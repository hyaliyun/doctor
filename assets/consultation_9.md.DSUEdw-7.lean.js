DESIGN Cross-sectional comparison of national surveys. PARTICIPANTS Participants in: 2016 American Community Survey, the 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the 2016 National Health Interview Survey, the 1999-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health. METHODS We estimated VI and blindness prevalence rates and confidence intervals for each survey measure and age-group using the Clopper-Pearson method. We then estimated weighted self-reported VI and blindness prevalence rates across survey measures by age-group using inverse variance weighting, fitted trend lines to age-group estimates, and used the trend-line equations to estimate the number of U.S. persons with VI and blindness in 2016. We compared these self-report estimates to those generated from NHANES physical evaluations of presenting VI and blindness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The variability of prevalence estimates of VI and blindness RESULTS: Survey response estimates of blindness varied between 0.1% and 5.6% for age-groups <65 years and between 0.6% to 16.6% for ages >=65. Estimates of VI varied between 1.6% and 24.8% for age-groups <65 years and between 2.2% and 26.6% for age-groups >=65. For summarized survey results and NHANES physical evaluation, prevalence rates for VI increased significantly with age-group. Blindness prevalence increased significantly with age-group for summarized survey responses but not for NHANES physical examination. Based on extrapolations of NHANES physical examination data to all ages, we estimated that in 2016, 23.4 million persons in the U.S. (7.2%) had VI or blindness, an evaluated visual acuity of 20/40 or worse in the better-seeing eye before correction; based on weighted self-reported surveys, we estimated 24.8 million persons (7.7%) had presenting VI or blindness. CONCLUSIONS Prevalence rates of VI and blindness obtained from national survey measures varied widely across surveys and age-groups. Additional research is needed to validate the ability of survey self-report measures of VI and blindness to replicate results obtained through clinical exam by an eye health professional.","output":"VARIABILITY OF VISION HEALTH RESPONSES ACROSS MULTIPLE NATIONAL SURVEY IN THE UNITED STATES."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Strengths use is an essential personal resource to consider when designing higher-educational programs and interventions. Strengths use is associated with positive outcomes for both the student (e.g., study engagement) and the university (e.g., academic throughput/performance). The Strengths Use Scale (SUS) has become a popular psychometric instrument to measure strengths use in educational settings, yet its use has been subjected to limited psychometric scrutiny outside of the U.S. Further, its longitudinal stability has not yet been established. Given the wide use of this instrument, the goals of this study were to investigate (a) longitudinal factorial validity and the internal consistency of the scale, (b) its equivalence over time, and (c) criterion validity through its relationship with study engagement over time. Data were gathered at two-time points, 3 months apart, from a sample of students in the Netherlands (n = 360). Longitudinal confirmatory factor analyses showed support for a two-factor model for overall strengths use, comprised of Affinity for Strengths and Strengths Use Behaviors. The SUS demonstrated high levels of internal consistency at both the lower- and upper bound limits at both time points. Further, strict longitudinal measurement invariance was established, which confirmed the instrument's temporal stability. Finally, criterion validity was established through relating strengths use to study engagement at different time stamps. These findings support the use of the SUS in practice to measure strengths use and to track the effectiveness of strengths use interventions within the higher education sector.","output":"The Strengths Use Scale: Psychometric Properties, Longitudinal Invariance and Criterion Validity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Physical distancing measures (e.g., keeping a distance of two metres from others, avoiding crowded areas, and reducing the number of close physical contacts) continue to be among the most important preventative measures used to reduce the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19). Therefore, it is important to understand barriers and facilitators of physical distancing to help inform future public health campaigns. Methods: The current study aimed to qualitatively explore barriers and facilitators of physical distancing in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic using a qualitative interpretative design. Semi-structured one-to-one phone interviews were conducted with 25 participants aged 18+ years and living in the Republic of Ireland between September and October 2020. A purposive sampling strategy was used to maximise diversity in terms of age, gender, and socioeconomic status. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Analysis resulted in the development of six main themes related to barriers and facilitators of physical distancing: (1) Maintaining and negotiating close relationships; (2) Public environments support or discourage physical distancing; (3) Habituation to threat; (4) Taking risks to maintain well-being; (5) Personal responsibility to control the \\"controllables\\"; and (6) Confusion and uncertainty around government guidelines. Conclusions: Our study found that physical distancing measures are judged to be more or less difficult based on a number of internal and external psychosocial factors, including maintaining and negotiating close relationships, habituation to threat, risk compensation, structure of public environments, personal responsibility, and confusion or uncertainty around government guidelines. Given the diversity in our sample, it is clear that the identified barriers and facilitators vary depending on context and life stage.

This study aimed to characterize social inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in S?o Paulo, the most populous city in Brazil and Latin America. METHODS: We conducted a population-based study, including COVID-19 deaths among S?o Paulo residents from March to September 2020. Age-standardized mortality rates and unadjusted rate ratios (RRs) [with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs)] were estimated by race, sex, age group, district of residence, household crowding, educational attainment, income level and percentage of households in subnormal areas in each district. Time trends in mortality were assessed using the Joinpoint model. RESULTS: Males presented an 84% increase in COVID-19 mortality compared with females (RR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.79-1.90). Higher mortality rates were observed for Blacks (RR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.67-1.88) and mixed (RR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.37-1.47) compared with Whites, whereas lower mortality was noted for Asians (RR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.58-0.68). A positive gradient was found for all socio-economic indicators, i.e. increases in disparities denoted by less education, more household crowding, lower income and a higher concentration of subnormal areas were associated with higher mortality rates. A decrease in mortality over time was observed in all racial groups, but it started earlier among Whites and Asians. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal striking social inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in S?o Paulo, exposing structural inequities in Brazilian society that were not addressed by the governmental response to COVID-19.

Our data based on the use of G2-test in in vitro irradiated blood lymphocytes in late G2-period of cell cycle indicated an increased carcinogenic risk in professionals with high IRS. We suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic could make significant adjustments in the formation of IRS in professionals who have survived the disease and continue to work with ionizing radiation (IR). Increased systemic inflammatory activity, which persists for a long time in COVID-19 patients, in combination with low-dose range irradiation (professionals who continue to work with IR) and with local irradiation in the high-dose range (radiation therapy for cancer patients) may affect IRS. Repeated determination of IRS in professionals who have had COVID-19 infection, using chromosomal G2-radiation sensitivity assay will answer the question: can SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus affect the IRS? The proposed hypothesis of the radiosensitivity evolution needs further experimental validation using a set of radiobiological indices to clarify the mechanism of IRS formation following COVID-19 infection.

Higher-than-usual seasonal declines in mean daily NO2 were observed for the pre-lockdown to lockdown periods in 2020. For PM2.5, Montreal was the only city with a higher-than-usual seasonal decline, whereas for O3 all four cities remained within the previous decadal range. In order to isolate the impact of lockdown-related emission changes from other factors such as seasonal changes in meteorology and emissions and meteorological variability, two emission scenarios were performed with the GEM-MACH air quality model. The first was a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario with baseline emissions and the second was a more realistic simulation with estimated COVID-19 lockdown emissions. NO2 surface concentrations for the COVID-19 emission scenario decreased by 31 to 34% on average relative to the BAU scenario in the four metropolitan areas. Lower decreases ranging from 6 to 17% were predicted for PM2.5. O3 surface concentrations, on the other hand, showed increases up to a maximum of 21% close to city centers versus slight decreases over the suburbs, but Ox (odd oxygen), like NO2 and PM2.5, decreased as expected over these cities.

We aimed to evaluate the presence of post-COVID-19 syndrome and its predictors in kidney transplant recipients (KTR) 6 months after the disease. Materials and Methods: A total of 67 KTR (38 m) with a mean age of 53.6  14 years, 7.3  6.4 years post-transplant were included in the cohort longitudinal study. Thirty-nine (58.2%) of them were hospitalized, but not one required invasive ventilation therapy. They were interviewed 6 months after being infected, with a series of standardized questionnaires: a self-reported symptoms questionnaire, the modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, and EQ-VAS scale. Results: Post-COVID-19 syndrome was diagnosed in 70.1% of KTR and 26.9% of them reported at least three persistent symptoms. The most common symptoms were fatigue (43.3%), hair loss (31.3%), memory impairment (11.9%), muscle aches, and headaches (11.9%). Dyspnea with an mMRC scale grade of at least 1 was reported by 34.3% patients vs. 14.9% before infection; 47.8% stated that they still feel worse than before the disease. Mean EQ-VAS scores were 64.83 vs. 73.34 before infection. The persistent symptoms are more frequent in older patients and those with greater comorbidity.

Patients had an acute ischemic stroke within 48 hours and a previous modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 to 3. We collected demographic data, vascular risk factors, prior mRS score, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, rate of reperfusion therapies, logistics, and metrics. Primary end point was functional outcome at 3 months. Favourable outcome was defined depending on the previous mRS score. Secondary outcome was mortality at 3 months. We performed mRS shift and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: We evaluated 701 patients (mean age 72.313.3 years, 60.5% men) and 91 (13%) had COVID-19 infection. Median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was higher in patients with COVID-19 compared with patients without COVID-19 (8 [3C18] versus 6 [2C14], P=0.049).

METHODS: A non-probability online survey was conducted (24th September?17th October 2020) with 5,114 UK adults, quota sampled to match the population for age, gender, ethnicity, income, and region. The Oxford COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy scale assessed intent to take an approved vaccine. Structural equation modelling estimated explanatory factor relationships. RESULTS: 71.7% (n=3,667) were willing to be vaccinated, 16.6% (n=849) were very unsure, and 11.7% (n=598) were strongly hesitant. An excellent model fit (RMSEA=0.05/CFI=0.97/TLI=0.97), explaining 86% of variance in hesitancy, was provided by beliefs about the collective importance, efficacy, side-effects, and speed of development of a COVID-19 vaccine. A second model, with reasonable fit (RMSEA=0.03/CFI=0.93/TLI=0.92), explaining 32% of variance, highlighted two higher-order explanatory factors: excessive mistrust (r=0.51), including conspiracy beliefs, negative views of doctors, and need for chaos, and positive healthcare experiences (r=?0.48), including supportive doctor interactions and good NHS care. Hesitancy was associated with younger age, female gender, lower income, and ethnicity, but socio-demographic information explained little variance (9.8%). Hesitancy was associated with lower adherence to social distancing guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is relatively evenly spread across the population. Willingness to take a vaccine is closely bound to recognition of the collective importance. Vaccine public information that highlights prosocial benefits may be especially effective.

The study findings presented that self-efficacy mediated the relationship between dimensions of psychological well-being (environmental mastery, autonomy, self-acceptance, positive relations with others, personal growth, and purpose in life) and resilience among Iranian students of UPM. Furthermore, self-efficacy was not observed to mediate the influence of optimism on resilience among Iranian students of UPM. The studys findings help to understand the interrelationship between self-efficacy, various dimensions of psychological well-being, and resilience. Consequently, counselors, psychologists, and instructors can develop and plan valuable strategies to enhance students psychological factors.","output":"Mediating Role of Self-Efficacy in the Relationship Between Optimism, Psychological Well-Being, and Resilience Among Iranian Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"GmcA is a FAD-containing enzyme belonging to the GMC (glucose-methanol-choline oxidase) family of oxidoreductases. A mutation in the Rhizobium leguminosarum gmcA gene was generated by homologous recombination. The mutation in gmcA did not affect the growth of R. leguminosarum, but it displayed decreased antioxidative capacity at H(2)O(2) conditions higher than 5 mM. The gmcA mutant strain displayed no difference of glutathione reductase activity, but significantly lower level of the glutathione peroxidase activity than the wild type. Although the gmcA mutant was able to induce the formation of nodules, the symbiotic ability was severely impaired, which led to an abnormal nodulation phenotype coupled to a 30% reduction in the nitrogen fixation capacity. The observation on ultrastructure of 4-week pea nodules showed that the mutant bacteroids tended to start senescence earlier and accumulate poly--hydroxybutyrate (PHB) granules. In addition, the gmcA mutant was severely impaired in rhizosphere colonization. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that the gmcA gene expression was significantly up-regulated in all the detected stages of nodule development, and statistically significant decreases in the expression of the redoxin genes katG, katE, and ohrB were found in gmcA mutant bacteroids. LC-MS/MS analysis quantitative proteomics techniques were employed to compare differential gmcA mutant root bacteroids in response to the wild type infection. Sixty differentially expressed proteins were identified including 33 up-regulated and 27 down-regulated proteins. By sorting the identified proteins according to metabolic function, 15 proteins were transporter protein, 12 proteins were related to stress response and virulence, and 9 proteins were related to transcription factor activity.

This is particularly evident when demand surges, as with recent lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent demand for home delivery services. Given the importance of this critical component, this study recommends horizontal collaboration as a possible solution for retailers seeking to improve the quality of their services. Design/methodology/approach: This study investigates whether horizontal collaboration should be considered as an option for faster and greener distribution of groceries ordered online. Using the United Kingdom and Greek grocery markets that differ in terms of online grocery penetration, distribution network structure and delivery times, the study discusses how the effectiveness of pooling resources can create positive spillover effects for consumers, businesses and society. Findings: Despite their differences, both markets indicate the need for horizontal collaboration in the highly topical issue of last mile delivery. Originality/value: Taking a theoretical and practical view in cases of disruption and constant pressure in last mile distribution, horizontal collaboration supports retailers to coordinate routes, increase fleet and vehicle utilisation, reduce traffic and carbon emissions while improving customer satisfaction. ? 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Horizontal collaboration in the last mile distribution: gauging managerial response to disruption and abnormal demand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background : Serosurveillance can be used to investigate the extent and distribution of immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within a population.

Methods : A longitudinal study of healthcare workers (HCWs) in Dili, Timor-Leste was conducted during vaccine roll-out (ChAdOx1) and a concurrent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Results : Three-hundred-and-twenty-four HCWs were included at baseline (April-May 2021). Thirty-two (9.9%) were anti-Nucleocapsid protein IgG (anti-N), indicating significant subclinical infection among HCWs early in the local outbreak. One-hundred-and-fifty-seven (48.5%) participants were followed-up (July-September 2021), by which time there had been high uptake of vaccination (91.7%) and 86.0% were anti-S seropositive. Acquisition of anti-N antibodies was observed in partially vaccinated HCWs (30/76, 39.5%), indicating some post-dose 1 infections. Discussion : Serosurveillance of HCWs may provide early-warning of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and should be considered in non-endemic settings, particularly where there is limited availability/uptake of testing for acute infection. Characterisation of humoral immune responses may be used to assess vaccine impact as well as coverage.

Lack of region-specific data on pediatric injuries is among the major challenges limiting the ability of health systems to implement interventions to prevent injuries and improve outcomes. We aim to characterize the burden of pediatric health injuries, initial healthcare interventions and outcomes seen in thirteen diverse healthcare facilities in Tanzania. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of children aged up to 18 years presenting to emergency units (EUs) of thirteen multi-level health facilities in Tanzania from 1(st) October 2019 to 30(th) September 2020. We describe injury patterns, mechanisms and early interventions performed at the emergency units of these health facilities. RESULTS: Among 18,553 trauma patients seen in all thirteen-health facilities, 4368 (23.5%) were children, of whom 2894 (66.7%) were male. The overall median age was 8 years (Interquartile range 4C12 years). Fall 1592 (36.5%) and road traffic crash (RTC) 840 (19.2%) were the top mechanisms of injury. Most patients 3748 (85.8%) arrived at EU directly from the injury site, using motorized (two or three) wheeled vehicles 2401 (55%). At EU, 651 (14.9%) were triaged as an emergency category. Multiple superficial injuries (14.4%), fracture of forearm (11.7%) and open wounds (11.1%) were the top EU diagnoses, while 223 (5.2%) had intracranial injuries. Children aged 0C4 years had the highest proportion (16.3%) of burn injuries. Being referred and being triaged as an emergency category were associated with high likelihood of serious injuries with adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 4.18 (95%CI 3.07C5.68) and 2.11 (95%CI 1.75C2.56), respectively. 1095 (25.1%) of patients were admitted to inpatient care, 14 (0.3%) taken to operation theatre, and 25 (0.6%) died in the EU. CONCLUSIONS: In these multilevel health facilities in Tanzania, pediatric injuries accounted for nearly one-quarter of all injuries. Over half of injuries occurred at home. Fall from height was the leading mechanism of injury, followed by RTC. Most patients sustained fractures of extremities. Future studies of pediatric injuries should focus on evaluating various preventive strategies that can be instituted at home to reduce the incidence and associated impact of such injuries.

Once such people are given due consideration, then several important points emerge, which have so far gone unnoticed or under-emphasized in the debate. This article focuses on two of those points: (a) Some vulnerable people who are currently being ignored in the debate may not desire to use gene editing, even if it is safe, effective and affordable, and they will have compelling reasons for making this decision; and (b) even if such people do decide to use the technology, the gene editing enterprise itself is unlikely to do much good for them (and may even be harmful to them), as it alarmingly misses the point regarding the underlying contributing causes of the most pressing problems that those people are facing. Therefore, the promise of the gene editing enterprise is a hollow one for some groups of vulnerable people.

I argue that virtual specialist-patient interaction challenges clinical reasoning and clinical judgement (clinical reasoning combined with statistical reasoning). However, clinical reasoning can improve by recognising the abductive, deductive, and inductive methods that the clinician employs. Abductive reasoning leading to an inference to the best explanation or invention of an explanatory hypothesis is the default response to unfamiliar or confusing situations. Deductive reasoning supports a previously established goal, but deductive accuracy requires sound premises leading to a valid conclusion. Inductive reasoning uses efficient data sorting, data interpretation, and plan creation without a previously established goal, and allows assessing inferential accuracy over time. In all cases, communication remains the backbone of the clinical encounter. Virtual care for CCD challenges clinical judgement by reducing available information, so even experienced specialists who use induction might default to deduction or abduction. The visit might shorten, decreasing narrative competence and in-turn management quality. Clinical judgement in virtual encounters can be enhanced by allowing sufficient time, employing allied health staff, using an advance script, avoiding dogmatic commitment to either virtual or in-person encounters, special training in virtual care, and conscious awareness of abductive, deductive, and inductive reasoning processes. Clinical judgement in virtual encounters especially calls for Gestalt cognition to assess a situational pattern irreducible to its parts and independent of its particulars, so that efficient data interpretation and self-reflection are enabled. Gestalt cognition integrates abduction, deduction, and induction, appropriately divides the time and effort spent on each, and can compensate for reduced available information. Evaluating one's clinical judgement for those components especially vulnerable to compromise can help optimize the delivery of virtual care for patients with CCD.","output":"Enhancing clinical judgement in virtual care for complex chronic disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 has spread rapidly around the globe. With eventually substantial global underestimation of infection, by the end of March 2022, more than 470 million cases were confirmed, counting more than 6.1 million deaths worldwide. COVID-19 symptoms range from mild (or no) symptoms to severe illness, with disease severity and death occurring according to a hierarchy of risks, with age and pre-existing health conditions enhancing risks of disease severity. In order to understand the dynamics of disease severity during the initial phase of the pandemic, we propose a modeling framework stratifying the studied population into two groups, older and younger, assuming different risks for severe disease manifestation. The deterministic and the stochastic models are parametrized using epidemiologicaldata for the Basque Country population referring to confirmed cases, hospitalizations and deaths, from February to the end of March 2020. Using similar parameter values, both models were able to describe well the existing data. A detailed sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the key parameters influencing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in the population. We observed that the population younger than 60 years old of age would contribute more to the overall force of infection than the older population, as opposed to the already existing age-structured models, opening new ways to understand the effect of population age on disease severity during the COVID-19 pandemic. With mild/asymptomatic cases significantly influencing the disease spreading and control, our findings support the vaccination strategy prioritising the most vulnerable individuals to reduce hospitalization and deaths, as well as the non-pharmaceutical intervention measures to reduce disease transmission.","output":"Modeling the initial phase of COVID-19 epidemic: The role of age and disease severity in the Basque Country, Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Targeting the asymptomatic liver stage of Plasmodium infection through chemoprevention could become a key intervention to reduce malaria-associated incidence and mortality.

Given the extensive interaction between the two populations, vaccination in one population may indirectly benefit the other via reduced transmission. Due to the mobility and extensive contacts, Palestinians employed in Israel could be a prime target for vaccination. METHODS: To evaluate the epidemiological and the economic benefits conferred by vaccinating Palestinians employed in Israel, we developed a model of influenza transmission within and between Israel and the West Bank. We parameterized the contact patterns underlying transmission by conducting a survey among Palestinians employed in Israel, and integrating survey results with traffic patterns and socio-demographic data. RESULTS: Vaccinating 50% of Palestinian workers is predicted to reduce the annual influenza burden by 28,745 cases (95% CI: 15,031-50,717) and 37.7 deaths (95% CI: 199C655) for the Israeli population, and by 32,9900 cases (95% CI: 14,379-51,531) and 20.2 deaths (CI 95%: 98C315) for the Palestinian population.

Some viruses use specific packaging signals, which are conserved sequence/structure motifs present only in the full-length genome. Recent work has shown that viral proteins important for packaging can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), where one or two viral nucleic acid binding proteins condense with the genome. The compositional simplicity of viral components lends itself well to theoretical modeling compared to more complex cellular organelles. Viral LLPS can be limited to one or two viral proteins and a single genome that is enriched in LLPS-promoting features. In our previous study, we observed that LLPS-promoting sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are located at the 5 and 3 ends of the genome, whereas the middle of the genome is predicted to consist mostly of solubilizing elements. Is this arrangement sufficient to drive single genome packaging, genome compaction, and genome cyclization? We addressed these questions using a coarse-grained polymer model, LASSI, to study the LLPS of nucleocapsid protein with RNA sequences that either promote LLPS or solubilization. With respect to genome compaction and cyclization, we find the most optimal arrangement restricts LLPS-promoting elements to the 5 and 3 ends of the genome, consistent with the native spatial patterning. Single genome packaging is possible for diverse arrangements of LLPS-promoting sequences in the genome, but only in limited conditions at the edge of the phase boundary. These results suggest that many and variably positioned LLPS promoting signals can support packaging in the absence of a singular packaging signal which argues against necessity of such a feature. We hypothesize that this model should be generalizable to multiple viruses as well as cellular organelles like paraspeckles, which enrich specific, long RNA sequences in a defined order.","output":"Role of spatial patterning of N-protein interactions in SARS-CoV-2 genome packaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 causing acute respiratory disease COVID-19 is considered a worldwide emergency. Since recently it has been found that SARS-coronavirus are dependent on the host transcriptional factors (TF) to express the viral genes, efforts are required to understand the molecular interplay between virus and host response. By bioinformatic analysis, we investigated human TF that can bind the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and can be involved in viral transcription. In particular, we analyzed the key role of the TF involved in interferon response. We found that several TF could be induced by the interferon antiviral response, specifically some induced by IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) and by un-phosphorylated ISGF3, that were found to promote the transcription of several viral open reading frame. Moreover, we found 22 TF binding sites that are present only in the sequence of virus infecting humans and not in Bat coronavirus RaTG13. The 22 TF are involved in the IFN, the retinoic acid signaling and the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, thus facilitating its own replication cycle. This mechanism, by competition, may steal the human TF involved in these processes, explaining SARS-CoV-2 disruption of the IFN-I signalling in host cells and the mechanism of the SARS retinoic acid depletion syndrome leading to the cytokine storm. We identified also three TF binding sites present exclusively in the Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 P.1 variant that may explain the higher severity of the respiratory syndrome in this virus variant. These data shed light on SARS-CoV2 dependence from the host transcription machinery associated to interferon response and strengthen our knowledge about the transcription and replicative activity of the virus and could pave the way for new targets drug design and therapeutic approaches.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may exploit human transcription factors involved in retinoic acid and interferon-mediated response: a hypothesis supported by an in-silico analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social scientists working on race and ethnicity are facing up to the challenge of how the Covid-19 pandemic is impacting on their research agendas In this introduction, we discuss the emerging evidence about the impact of Covid-19 in terms of race and ethnicity, on migrants and refugees, and on research agendas By focusing on the discussion that has developed about these issues during 2020 we aim to provide some of the broader background to the specific concerns to be found in the rest of this themed issue We move on from this overview of key developments to a discussion of the key themes that are explored by the fourteen papers that follow","output":"Race and ethnicity in pandemic times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The cases of Rifampicin-Resistant Tuberculosis (RR-TB) in our country have increased every year and RR-TB deaths are thought to be caused by prolongation of the QTc interval due to side effects of anti-tuberculosis drugs.

Addition of salubrinal C an inhibitor of eIF2 dephosphorylation C decreased expression of a surface marker associated with capacity for self renewal, increased senescence and induced clonogenic cell death, suggesting that excessive phosphorylation of eIF2 is detrimental to the cells' survival. Treating cells with salubrinal enhanced radiation-induced increase in eIF2 phosphorylation and clonogenic death and showed that irradiated cells are more sensitive to increased eIF2 phosphorylation than non-irradiated ones. Similar to salubrinal - the phosphomimetic eIF2 variant - S51D - increased sensitivity to radiation, and both abrogated radiation-induced increase in breast cancer type 1 susceptibility gene, thus implicating enhanced phosphorylation of eIF2 in modulation of DNA repair. Indeed, salubrinal inhibited non-homologous end joining as well as homologous recombination repair of double strand breaks that were induced by I-SceI in green fluorescent protein reporter plasmids. In addition to its effect on radiation, salubrinal enhanced eIF2 phosphorylation and clonogenic death in response to the histone deacetylase inhibitor C vorinostat. Finally, the catalytic competitive inhibitor of mTOR - Ku-0063794 - increased phosphorylation of eIF2 demonstrating further the involvement of mTOR activity in modulating eIF2 phosphorylation. These experiments suggest that excessive phosphorylation of eIF2 decreases survival of cancer cells; making eIF2 a worthy target for drug development, with the potential to enhance the cytotoxic effects of established anti-neoplastic therapies and circumvent resistance to rapalogues and possibly to other drugs that inhibit upstream components of the mTOR pathway.","output":"Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2 - a Downstream Effector of Mammalian Target of Rapamycin - Modulates DNA Repair and Cancer Response to Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we provide an account of how we ported a text and data mining course online in summer 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and how we improved it in a second pilot run.

Reports in the past year have suggested a multisystem pathophysiology characterized by hyperinflammation, gastrointestinal distress, and cardiovascular complications. Clinical laboratory investigations, including routine blood testing for inflammatory (e.g., C-reactive protein, ferritin) and cardiac (e.g., troponin, brain natriuretic peptides) markers have provided insight into potential drivers of disease pathogenesis, highlighting the role of the laboratory in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with similar conditions (e.g., Kawasaki disease, macrophage activating syndrome). CONTENT: While few studies have applied high-dimensional immune profiling to further characterize underlying MIS-C pathophysiology, much remains unknown regarding predisposing risk factors, etiology, and long-term impact of disease onset. The extent of autoimmune involvement is also unclear. In the current review, we summarize and critically evaluate available literature on potential pathogenic mechanisms underlying MIS-C onset and discuss the current and anticipated value of various laboratory testing paradigms in MIS-C diagnosis and monitoring. SUMMARY: From initial reports, it is clear that MIS-C has unique inflammatory signatures involving both adaptive and innate systems. Certain cytokines, inflammatory markers, and cardiac markers assist in the differentiation of MIS-C from other hyperinflammatory conditions. However, there are still major gaps in our understanding of MIS-C pathogenesis, including T cell, B cell, and innate response.

METHODS: Stents coated with different drug-eluting components were prepared by the mixed electrospinning method, with poly-L-lactide-caprolactone (PLCL) as the drug-loaded nanofiber membrane and GEM and/or CIS as the antitumor agents. Four different DESs were manufactured with four drug-loading ratios (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%), including bare-loaded (PLCL-0), single-drug-loaded (PLCL-GEM and PLCL-CIS), and dual-drug-loaded (PLCL-GC) stents. The drug release property, antitumor activity, and biocompatibility were evaluated in vitro and in vivo to confirm the feasibility and efficacy of this novel DES for ECC. RESULTS: The in vitro drug release study showed the stable, continuous release of both GEM and CIS, which was sustained for over 30 d without an obvious initial burst, and a higher drug-loaded content induced a lower release rate. The drug-loading ratio of 10% was used for further experiments due to its ideal inhibitory efficiency and relatively low toxicity. All drug-loaded nanofilms effectively inhibited the growth of EGI-1 cells in vitro and the tumor xenografts of nude mice in vivo; in addition, the dual-loaded nanofilm (PLCL-GC) had a significantly better effect than the single-drug-loaded nanofilms (P < 0.05). No significant differences in the serological analysis (P > 0.05) or histopathological changes were observed between the single-loaded and drug-loaded nanofilms after stent placement in the normal porcine biliary tract. CONCLUSION: This novel PLCL-GEM and CIS-eluting stent maintains continuous, stable drug release locally and inhibits tumor growth effectively in vitro and in vivo. It can also be used safely in normal porcine bile ducts. We anticipate that it might be considered an alternative strategy for the palliative therapy of ECC patients.","output":"Feasibility and efficacy evaluation of metallic biliary stents eluting gemcitabine and cisplatin for extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern. A small proportion of patients infected with COVID-19 go on to develop pneumonia. We speculated that COVID-19 may be likely to result in psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression. In this study, we conducted an investigation of anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Sixty-five COVID-19 patients were randomly enrolled into this study. Anxiety and depression among participants were measured through the completion of anonymous Chinese-language Zung self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale questionnaires. Data were analyzed using independent samples t-tests, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and &#967;2 tests. RESULTS: The questionnaire results showed that 26.15% and 41.54% of participants suffered from anxiety and depression, respectively, although there was no significantly statistical difference between the proportions of COVID-19 patients with anxiety and depression. Statistically significant differences in employment status, partial pressure of oxygen, and corticosteroid application existed between moderate- and severe COVID-19 patients (P<0.05). In particular, the partial pressure of oxygen was significantly lower in severe COVID-19 patients than in their moderate counter parts (71.3123.54 vs. 101.0634.43, U=156, P=0.006). Total lymphocytes was lower in severe group than in moderate group [1.6590.643 vs. 0.745 (0.645, 0.928), U=109, P=0.000]. Also, a higher proportion of female than male patients had anxiety (&#967;2=5.388, P=0.02). COVID-19 patients who received antiviral medications also displayed a higher rate of anxiety (&#967;2=4.481, P=0.034). Total lymphocytes between the non-anxiety and anxiety had statistical difference (U=321, P=0.019). Meanwhile, total lymphocytes between the non-depression and depression also had statistical difference (U=389.5, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with COVID-19, females and those treated with antiviral medications were more likely to experience anxiety.

Although it predates the COVID-19 outbreak, the pandemic has played a significant role in the increased rate of burnout, and even suicide, among emergency physicians. CASE REPORTS This paper includes several clinical vignettes to highlight incidents that may occur in the emergency department (ED) when physicians experience violations of their moral codes, leading to distress and moral injury. These scenarios explore the conflicts posed between competing bioethical principles such as beneficence, nonmaleficence, end-of-life decision-making, medical futility, respect for self-determination (autonomy), resource scarcity and triage, duty to care, and physician impairment. DISCUSSION There are significant similarities between moral injury and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with some authors describing moral injury as a subset of PTSD. We explore these commonalities to provide coping mechanisms and mitigation strategies for those suffering from moral injury. CONCLUSION Physicians experiencing moral injury may benefit from the many available evidence-based treatments for PTSD to identify and manage moral injury and to support patient care and personal well-being.","output":"Addressing Moral Injury in Emergency Medicine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the changes in prevalence and associated factors of tobacco smoking among Bangladeshi adults over time. DESIGN: Nationally representative cross-sectional surveys. SETTING: Two most recent Global Adults Tobacco Survey (GATS) data from Bangladesh, carried out in 2009 and 2017. PARTICIPANTS: Adult population aged 15 and above (n=9629 in 2009; n=12 783 in 2017). OUTCOME MEASURES: Current use of tobacco smoke, including cigarettes, bidi, hukkah, cigars or pipes, which was dichotomised (yes/no). METHODS: We analysed data from two recent rounds of GATS (2009 and 2017). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of tobacco smoking among Bangladeshi adults was noted (23.00%, 95% CI 22.98 to 23.00 in 2009; 16.44%, 95% CI 16.43 to 16.45 in 2017).

However, being offered free tobacco sample products (AOR=0.66, CI 0.57 to 0.77 for 2009; AOR=0.87, CI 0.76 to 0.99 for 2017) and having primary, secondary or higher education (all AORs <1 and p<0.05) as well as being a student (AOR=0.16, CI 0.09 to 0.29 for 2009; AOR=0.32, CI 0.19 to 0.53) were associated with lower odds of tobacco smoking in both surveys. CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of tobacco smoking has declined over the period, it is still high among those who were relatively older, men, less educated and exposed to a movie/drama where tobacco smoking is promoted. Therefore, appropriate interventions are required to stop tobacco smoking among the Bangladeshi population.","output":"Was there any change in tobacco smoking among adults in Bangladesh during 2009C2017?

Assuming increases to screening capacity are unrealistic, we propose two recovery strategies: one extends the screening interval by 6 months for all and the other extends the interval by 36/60 months, but only for women who have already missed being screened. METHODS: Using routine statistics from England we estimate the number of women affected by delays to screening. We used published research to estimate the proportion of screening age women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and progression rates to cancer. Under two recovery scenarios, we estimate the impact of COVID-19 on cervical cancer over one screening cycle (3 years at ages 25C49 and 5 years at ages 50C64 years). The duration of disruption in both scenarios is 6 months. In the first scenario, 10.7 million women have their screening interval extended by 6 months. In the second, 1.5 million women (those due to be screened during the disruption) miss one screening cycle, but most women have no delay. RESULTS: Both scenarios result in similar numbers of excess cervical cancers: 630 vs. 632 (both 4.3 per 100,000 women in the population). However, the scenario in which some women miss one screening cycle creates inequalitiesthey would have much higher rates of excess cancer: 41.5 per 100,000 delayed for screened women compared to those with a 6-month delay (5.9 per 100,000). CONCLUSION: To ensure equity for those affected by COVID-19 related screening delays additional screening capacity will need to be paired with prioritising the screening of overdue women.","output":"Recovery strategies following COVID-19 disruption to cervical cancer screening and their impact on excess diagnoses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans, can cause severe life-threatening respiratory pathologies. To better understand SARS-CoV-2 evolution, genome-wide analyses have been made, including the general characterization of its codons usage profile. Here we present a bioinformatic analysis of the evo-lution of SARS-CoV-2 codon usage over time using complete genomes collected since December 2019. Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 codon usage pattern is antagonistic to, and it is getting farther away from that of the human host. Further, a selection of deoptimized codons over time, which was accompanied by a decrease in both the codon adaptation index and the effective number of codons, was observed. All together, these findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could be evolving, at least from the perspective of the synonymous codon usage, to become less pathogenic.

Methods: By random cluster sampling survey method, according to the needs and medication adherence score, the electronic \\"questionnaire star\\" was designed to conduct a survey among children (0 to 14 years old) who diagnosed with asthma and joined the CCAAP on the basis of bronchial asthma medication adherence scale. Finally, the results of electronic questionnaire survey were analyzed. Results: A total of 423 questionnaires were sent out, 422 of which were valid, with an effective response rate of 99.7%. The results of questionnaire survey showed that 296 cases were male, accounting for 70.1%, and 126 cases were female, accounting for 29.9%, with an average age of (5.42.6) years old. The average age of males and females was (5.32.6) and (5.42.6) years old, respectively. There were more children aged &#8805;5 years than children who were younger than 5 years. Additionally, 13.95% of the parents thought that the pandemic had more than moderate impact on children with asthma, and 76.12% of the children were in the green zone and had no asthma attack. The proportion of green zone inhaled drugs (79.8%) was higher than yellow zone and red zone (49.8%). After using the CCAAP platform, the dissatisfaction rate was only 1.42%. Moreover, 71.87% of the children's medical expenses decreased, and the proportion of frequent use and intermittent use of antibiotics reduced, however, the proportion of occasional use and never use of antibiotics increased significantly (all P<0.05). The average score of drug compliance was 4.56, and the more frequently the platform was used, the higher the score of medication compliance was (P<0.05). Conclusions: After using CCAAP management with the aid of internet technology, children with asthma who had been isolated at home for a long time were less affected by COVID-19, with high medication compliance, generally lower medical expenses, significantly reduced use of antibiotics, and high satisfaction.

METHODS A total of 45 patients with thoracic esophageal cancer who underwent reconstruction with cervical esophagogastric anastomosis by iTST using a linear stapler after MIE between January 2016 and January 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. We modified and improved upon the TST by adding a 1- to 2-cm vertical incision on the anterior wall of the remnant esophageal stump to enlarge the anastomotic lumen and thereby reduce the risk of anastomotic stenosis. The short-term patient outcomes were determined to assess the safety and feasibility of our procedures. RESULTS The median operating time was 686 (range, 319-1110) minutes, and the median blood loss was 170 (range, 5-1180) ml. There were no cases of anastomotic stenosis in this study, although 2 patients (4.4%) developed minor anastomotic leakage. A case (2.2%) of tracheal fistula due to the apex of the triangular anastomosis was resolved simply by delaying the patient's oral intake. The mean length of the hospitalization was 21 days. CONCLUSIONS The iTST provides a larger lumen unlimited by the size of the esophagus in cervical esophagogastric anastomosis. This technique is feasible, and sufficient short-term results have been achieved.

RECENT FINDINGS Retinal outpatient visits, new patient visits, intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor injections and in-office multimodal retinal imaging has seen a significant decline in utilization in the early phase of the pandemic. Intravitreal injections were performed at a comparatively higher rate than office visits. Utilization appeared to steadily increase in April 2020. Telemedicine visits, enabled by new national legislation for all areas of medicine, have been adopted to a modest degree by the retina community.

Objective(s) Develop an evidence-informed communication tool to support patients, family, and cancer and palliative care clinicians navigating cancer care during a pandemic. Method(s) Interviews with 71 participants (48 patients, 4 caregivers, 19 clinicians) between August 2020 and July 2021 at four U.S. academic cancer centers. Four focus groups with five professionals representing oncology and palliative care advisory organizations. A 3-hour virtual Stakeholder Summit with 25 attendees representing patients and family, cancer and palliative care clinicians, researchers, and advocacy organizations. Results The initial tool had five domains based on focus group and interview data, reduced to three domains during iterative discussion at the stakeholder summit: COVID-19-related changes and concerns, coping with cancer during the pandemic, and telehealth preferences. Conversations about COVID-19 between patients, caregivers, and clinicians can be emotionally stressful or even taboo in some locales. Stakeholders advised building a tool to facilitate deeper discussions about COVID-19 while allowing patients to opt out and, if preferred, defer pandemic decision making to clinicians. Stakeholders noted that the tool should list only content and preferences that can actually be accommodated by cancer clinicians. Telehealth has different limitations and benefits, which created different preferences for clinicians, patients, and caregivers. Stakeholders agreed that a domain that captured patients preferences for its use should be kept. Conclusion(s) A stakeholder-developed and evidence-informed communication tool that outlines pandemic-related changes and existing options for care may help patients and caregivers be more knowledgeable and active in decision making related to their care during the pandemic.

Mental health conditions are deteriorating, financial crises are increasing in prevalence, and the need to stay at home has resulted in the increased prevalence of domestic violence. In Bangladesh, where domestic violence is already prevalent, the lockdown period and stay-at-home orders could result in more opportunities and increased scope for perpetrators of domestic violence. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence and pattern of domestic violence during the initial COVID-19 lockdown period in Bangladesh and the perceptions of domestic violence survivors with regard to mental health care. METHODS: We conducted this cross-sectional web-based study among the Bangladeshi population and used a semistructured self-reported questionnaire to understand the patterns of domestic violence and perceptions on mental health care from August to September 2020. The questionnaire was disseminated on different organizational websites and social media pages (ie, those of organizations that provide mental health and domestic violence services). Data were analyzed by using IBM SPSS (version 22.0; IBM Corporation). RESULTS: We found that 36.8% (50/136) of respondents had faced domestic violence at some point in their lives; psychological abuse was the most common type of violence. However, the prevalence of the economical abuse domestic violence type increased after the COVID-19 lockdown was enforced. Although 96.3% (102/136) of the participants believed that domestic violence survivors need mental health support, only 25% (34/136) of the respondents had an idea about the mental health services that are available for domestic violence survivors in Bangladesh and how and where they could avail mental health services. CONCLUSIONS: Domestic violence is one of the most well-known stressors that have direct impacts on physical and mental health. However, the burden of domestic violence is often underreported, and its impact on mental health is neglected in Bangladesh. The burden of this problem has increased during the COVID-19 crisis, and the cry for mental health support is obvious in the country. However, it is necessary to provide information about available support services; telepsychiatry can be good option for providing immediate mental health support in a convenient and cost-effective manner.","output":"Domestic Violence and Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The appearance of multidrug resistant bacteria and growing antibiotic resistance is leading to a continuous need for discovering new drugs and alternative treatments against infections.

EOs have a complex mode of action due to their multiple composition. Respiratory tract diseases (RTDs) associated with bacterial infection and inflammation affect a large number of people from every age group worldwide.

In addition to these pathways, transactivation of non-receptor tyrosine kinase (Src), PDGF receptors (PDGFRs), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt has been implicated in the expression of inflammatory genes. Here, we further investigated whether these different mechanisms participating in IL-1beta-induced ICAM-1 expression in A549 cells. We initially observed that IL-1beta-induced ICAM-1 promoter activity was attenuated by the inhibitors of Src (PP1), PDGFR (AG1296), PI3-K (LY294002 and wortmannin), and Akt (SH-5), revealed by reporter gene assay, Western blotting, and RT-PCR analyses. The involvement of Src and PI3-K/Akt in IL-1beta-induced ICAM-1 expression was significantly attenuated by transfection of A549 cells with dominant negative plasmids of Src, p85 and Akt, respectively. Src, PDGFR, and PI3K/Akt mediated the effects of IL-1beta because pretreatment with PP1, AG1296, and wortmannin also abrogated IL-1beta-stimulated Src, PDGFR, and Akt phosphorylation, respectively. Moreover, pretreatment with p300 inhibitor (curcumin) also blocked ICAM-1 expression. We further confirmed that p300 was associated with ICAM-1 promoter which was dynamically linked to histone H4 acetylation stimulated by IL-1beta, determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Association of p300 and histone-H4 to ICAM-1 promoter was inhibited by LY294002. Up-regulation of ICAM-1 enhanced the adhesion of neutrophils onto A549 cell monolayer exposed to IL-1beta, which was inhibited by PP1, AG1296, LY294002, wortmannin, and helenalin. These results suggested that Akt phosphorylation mediated through transactivation of Src/PDGFR promotes the transcriptional p300 activity and eventually leads to ICAM-1 expression induced by IL-1beta.","output":"Transactivation of Src, PDGF receptor, and Akt is involved in IL-1beta-induced ICAM-1 expression in A549 cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic has caused havoc worldwide, and different comorbidities have been seen to exacerbate the condition. Obesity is one of the leading comorbidities, which is associated with many other diseases. In this paper, we present a systematic review and meta-analysis estimating the effects of overweight and obesity on COVID-19 disease severity. Methodology: Two electronic databases (Medline and Cochrane library) and one grey literature database (Grey Literature Report) were searched using the following keywords: overweight, obesity, body mass index, respiratory disease, coronavirus, COVID-19. The risks of bias of the selected studies were assessed by using the Navigation Guide method for human data. Both random and fixed effect meta-analysis were determined using Review Manager (RevMan) software version 5.4. Results: After initial screening, 12 studies (7 cohort studies, four case-control studies, and one cross-sectional study) were fulfilled the eligibility criteria, comprising a total of 405359 patients and included in the systematic review. The pooled risk of disease severity was 1.31 times higher based on both fixed and random effect model among those overweight patients, I2 0% and 2.09 and 2.41 times higher based on fixed and random effect respectively among obese patients, I2 42% compared to healthy individuals.

At the same time, if a friend helps the OSA patients to call the doctor, the friend can also report the patient's condition in time. This system uses the popular IoT framework. At the bottom is the data acquisition layer, which uses wearable sensors to collect vital signs from patients, with a focus on ECG and SpO2 signals. The middle layer is the network layer that transmits the collected physiological signals to the Beidou indicator using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol. The top layer is the application layer, and the application layer uses the mature rescue interactive platform of Beidou. The Beidou system was developed by China itself, the main coverage of the satellite is in Asia, and is equipped with a high-density ground-based augmentation system. Therefore, the Beidou model improves the positioning accuracy and is equipped with a special communication satellite, which increases the short message interaction function. Therefore, patients can report disease progression in time while waiting for a rescue. After our simulation test, the effectiveness of the OSA patient rescue monitoring system based on the Beidou system and the positioning accuracy of OSA patients have been greatly improved. Especially when OSA patients work outdoors, the cell phone base station signal coverage is relatively weak. The satellite signal is well-covered, plus the SMS function of the Beidou indicator. Therefore, the system can be used to provide timely patient progress and provide data support for the medical rescue team to provide a more accurate rescue plan.

In our effort, a new class of isoquinolin-1(2H)-ones derivatives containing an aminosulfonyl moiety were designed and explored as potential inhibitors of PDE4. Accordingly, for the first time a CuCl2-catalyzed inexpensive, faster and ligand/additive free approach has been developed for the synthesis of these predesigned isoquinolin-1(2H)-one derivatives via the coupling-cyclization strategy. Thus, the CuCl2-catalyzed reaction of 2-iodobenzamides with appropriate terminal alkynes proceeded with high chemo and regioselectivity affording the desired compounds in 77-84% yield within 1-1.5 h. The methodology also afforded simpler isoquinolin-1(2H)-ones devoid of aminosulfonyl moiety showing a broader generality and scope of this approach. Several of the synthesized compounds especially 3c, 3k and 3s showed impressive inhibition (83-90%) of PDE4B when tested at 10 M in vitro whereas compounds devoid of aminosulfonyl moiety was found to be less active. In spite of high inhibition showed at 10 M these compounds did not show proper concertation dependent inhibition below 1 M that was reflected in their IC50 values e.g. 2.43  0.32, 3.26  0.24 and 3.63  0.80 M for 3k, 3o and 3s respectively.

Among these molecules, selected benzophenone-derived alkyl disaccharides cause the mucoid bacteria to swarm on hydrated soft agar gel and revert the mucoid to non-mucoid phenotype. The sessile (biofilm) and motile (swarming) phenotypes are controlled by opposing signaling pathways with high and low intracellular levels of bis-(3',5')-cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (cdG), respectively. As our molecules control multiple of these phenotypes, we hypothesized and explored a protein receptor, pilin of the pili appendages, that are consistent with controlling these bioactivities and signaling pathways. To test this binding hypothesis, we developed a bacterial motility enabled binding assay that utilizes the interfacial properties of hydrated gels and bacterial motility to conduct label-free ligand-receptor binding studies. The structure activity correlation and the receptor identification reveal a plausible mechanism for reverting mucoid to nonmucoid phenotypes by binding pili appendages with ligands capable of sequestering and neutralizing reactive oxygen species.","output":"Exploration of Ligand-Receptor Binding and Mechanisms for Alginate Reduction and Phenotype Reversion by Mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social and mass media platforms (SMM) are essential tools for keeping people informed about health-promoting practices.

Established on the community of inquiry (COI) model, this study aims to determine the factors that underpin students satisfaction with their e-learning experience through the mediated mechanism of students online learning readiness. Surveying 178 special needs students from various Indonesian universities revealed that teaching presence, cognitive and social presence, and content quality, directly and indirectly, influence e-learning satisfaction. This extended and more comprehensive model would help educators better understand e-learnings use as an effective pedagogical platform, especially in the context of special needs students. Key policy implications and directions for future research are suggested.","output":"The Satisfaction of the Special Need Students with E-Learning Experience During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case of Educational Institutions in Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The training medical students receive means they can be used as auxiliary healthcare staff during pandemics and disasters. During COVID-10, many medical students volunteered in healthcare settings in clinical and non-clinical capacities. While there has been research into students perceptions of the pandemic and their role within the NHS, the perceptions of healthcare staff perceive this student response has not been explored. METHODS: COVIDAssist is a survey based cross sectional observational study of medical student volunteering during COVID-19. The study consists of a cross sectional survey of doctors & nurses who worked alongside medical students in the NHS during the pandemic. We will use qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze responses. RESULTS: The primary objective of the study is to assess how effective student response was in reducing the burden on healthcare teams during the pandemic. Secondary objectives are: to identify the broad specialty (e.g. medicine, surgery, primary care) and healthcare roles medical students were most beneficial) ; the GMC outcome-based skills students exhibited; the training provided to students before volunteering and what additional training could have been provided to students. CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this study will help inform current and future guidance on effective student deployment during pandemics and disasters.

Electroacupuncture (EA) therapy is a type of traditional Chinese medicine physiotherapy that can alleviate the inflammatory response. However, the potential mechanism of EA in the treatment of ARDS is not yet clear. Ferroptosis is a new type of programmed cell death characterized by intracellular iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation. Recently, emerging evidence has shown that ferroptosis is closely related to the occurrence and development of ARDS caused by various pathological factors. Here, we further investigated whether EA-mediated inhibition of ferroptosis in lung tissue could attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS and explored its underlying mechanisms. In this study, mice were administered LPS intraperitoneally to establish a model of LPS-induced ARDS. We found that EA stimulation could not only reduce the exudation of inflammatory cells and proteins in the alveolar lumen but also significantly alleviate the pathological changes of lung tissue, inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines and improve the survival rate of mice. Concurrently, we also found that ferroptosis events occurred in the lung tissue of LPS-induced ARDS mice, manifested by elevated iron levels, ROS production and lipid peroxidation. Intriguingly, our results showed that EA stimulation at the Zusanli (ST36) acupoint activated 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (7nAchR) in lung tissue mainly through the sciatic nerve and cervical vagus nerve, thus exerting anti-ferroptosis and pulmonary protective effects. Additionally, these effects were eliminated by methyllycaconitine (MLA), a selective antagonist of 7nAchR. In vitro experiments, activation of 7nAchR protected alveolar epithelial cells from LPS-induced ferroptosis. Furthermore, our experiments showed that the pulmonary protective effects of EA stimulation were effectively reversed by erastin, a ferroptosis activator. Collectively, we demonstrated that EA stimulation could alleviate LPS-induced ARDS by activating 7nAchR to inhibit LPS-induced ferroptosis in alveolar epithelial cells. Targeting and regulating ferroptosis in alveolar epithelial cells may be a potential intervention approach for the treatment of LPS-induced ALI/ARDS in the future.","output":"Electroacupuncture Alleviates LPS-Induced ARDS Through 7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor-Mediated Inhibition of Ferroptosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has resulted in unprecedented social distancing policies being enforced worldwide.

Alternative drug therapy is one of the important ways to overcome TKI resistance. Hinokiflavone (HF) is a C-O-C type biflavonoid with low toxicity and antitumor activity. This study investigated the antitumor effect and possible mechanisms of HF in CML cells. METHODS: Cell viability was measured by CCK-8 assay. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were analyzed by flow cytometry. Western blotting was used to assess protein expression levels. RESULTS: Our results showed that HF significantly inhibited the viability of K562 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner and induced G(2)/M phase arrest by up-regulating p21 and down-regulating Cdc2 protein. Furthermore, HF induced caspase-dependent apoptosis by activating JNK/p38 MAPK signaling pathway and inhibiting NF-B activity. In addition, HF induced autophagy by increasing LC3-II expression and p62 degradation. Pretreatment with CQ, a late autophagy inhibitor, significantly increased the levels of LC3-II and p62 proteins and promoted cell survival. CONCLUSION: HF shows a good anti-leukemia effect and is expected to become a potential therapeutic drug for CML.

Many CYP seen in ED or primary care are triaged through NHS 111, which is a free telephone service, wherein all calls are initially triaged by a call-handler. Where appropriate, calls are passed on to the Clinical Assessment Services (CAS) for a call-back from a clinician. During the Covid-19 pandemic, NHS 111 experienced an increase in volume of calls offered. Objectives To support NHS 111 providers in responding to paediatric calls during the Covid-19 pandemic, and to assess the feasibility of including paediatric expertise within NHS 111 CAS and its impact on service delivery. Methods In May 2020, 70 paediatric clinicians, identified via the RCPCH (or locally), were on-boarded and trained to work remotely within the CAS of six NHS 111 providers in England. Across all six NHS 111 provider sites, the volunteers worked alongside existing CAS clinicians, providing call-backs to carers of paediatric cases under 16 years old, irrespective of the presenting complaint. Data were gathered from existing NHS 111 provider systems to include immediate outcomes (dispositions) and patient/carer feedback. Contributing paediatric clinicians and NHS 111 staff were surveyed by questionnaire and/or phone call. Results 2535 paediatric cases were taken by paediatric clinicians and 137,008 paediatric cases by non-paediatric clinicians working in the six NHS 111 providers from 25th May to 4th December 2020. Disposition rates varied between the calls taken by paediatric vs non-paediatric clinicians (table 1). ? ?All categories significant at p<0.01 e.g. self-care versus primary care referrals 2 (df =1, N = 78938) = 37.95, p<0.01 Survey data from 62/70 volunteers indicated that they enjoyed working for NHS 111. NHS 111 staff surveyed (n=14) and interviewed (n=5) reported that paediatricians contributed to improving the service delivery to young patients. Feedback from carers whose calls had been taken by paediatric clinicians at one NHS 111 provider (n=60) showed higher satisfaction rates when compared with national averages for all calls (including adults and children) (92% vs 67%), with more reporting that their problem was resolved (92% vs 26%). Conclusions The data showed that enhanced paediatric support within NHS 111 CAS is likely to reduce the large volume of children advised to attend ED or primary care, while improving the families' experience. Further work will explore the longer term outcomes within the NHS, and more detailed carer feedback. In future, more integrated models of care for CYP needing urgent and emergency care services may be achieved by this means, and better access to alternative healthcare support through hospital or community-based services, such as rapid access clinics.","output":"Impact of paediatrician involvement in nhs 111 clinical assessment services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To date (17 November 2021), there has been more than 254 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, and more than 5 million death globally (World Health Organization. https://covid19.who.int/). The virus causing COVID-19 is called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by the binding of its spike protein to the cellular surface protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The predicted 29 amino acid residues of ACE2 that interact with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) vary between human ACE2 and mouse or rat ACE2. Therefore, wildtype mice and rats show lower SARS-CoV-2 infection rate and mild symptoms compared to what is seen in humans. Small animal models that recapitulate human COVID-19 disease are urgently needed for better understanding the transmission and therapeutic measurement. Currently, scientists use either mouse-adapted SAS-CoV-2 (SAS-CoV-2 MA) models or random transgenic mouse models that artificially express human ACE2 under the control of cytokeratin 18 promoter or a constitutive promoter. SAS-CoV-2 MA may not completely reflect all aspects of the original human-tropic SAS-CoV-2 and the current transgenic human ACE2 mouse models typically have high mortality rate caused by neuroinvasion and encephalitis due to very high human ACE2 expression. To overcome these limitations, we have developed humanized ACE2 mouse and rat models using CRISPR-Cas9. Specifically, we inserted a ~3kb human ACE2 cDNA cassette into the mouse and rat Ace2 gene loci to ensure that human ACE2 expression is under the control of rodent Ace2 promoter and regulatory elements, while simultaneously disabling the rodent Ace2 gene. To accomplish this, CRISPR gRNAs targeting close to the translation initiation site of Ace2 were screened in cultured mouse and rat cells. Then CRISPR/Cas9 complex and donor DNA were subsequently microinjected into one-cell stage embryos which were subsequently implanted into pseudo pregnant females. Resulting pups were screened for correct knockin by junction PCR and insert PCR, and the PCR products were Sanger sequenced. Targeted Locus Amplification (TLA) further confirmed the integration sites and transgene sequence. RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis data showed that, in our models, human ACE2 is expressed in tissues expressing endogenous Ace2 (such as lung, kidney, and GI tract), while rodent endogenous Ace2 is absent from these tissues. Further breeding data indicated that both hemizygous and homozygous humanized ACE2 animals appear to be normal and fertile. Most importantly, animals displayed symptoms after infection with SARS-CoV-2. In summary, these data suggest that our humanized ACE2 models can be valuable for COVID-19 research.","output":"Development of humanized ACE2 mouse and rat models for COVID-19 research."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The clinical syndrome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic leading to significant morbidity and mortality.

It is often not clear if the acute myocardial dysfunction is caused by myocarditis or secondary to generalized inflammatory state of cytokine release or microvascular thrombotic angiopathy. Ischemia may also need to be ruled out. Regardless, myocardial dysfunction in these patients is associated with poor overall prognosis. Laboratory testing, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and even endomyocardial biopsy may be needed for timely diagnosis.

Two novel vaccine platforms, based on mRNA technology, were developed in 2020 by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Therapeutics (comirnaty? and spikevax?, respectively), and were the first ones presenting efficacies higher than 90%. Both consisted of N1-methyl-pseudouridine-modified mRNA encoding the SARS-COVID-19 Spike protein and were delivered with a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation. Because the delivery problem of ribonucleic acids had been known for decades, the success of LNPs was quickly hailed by many as the unsung hero of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.

Observational studies, however, are subject to biases that could erroneously suggest an impact on transmission, even when there is no true effect. Cluster randomized trials permit valid hypothesis tests of the effect of interventions on community transmission. While such trials could be completed in a relatively short period of time, they might require large sample sizes to achieve adequate power. However, the sample sizes required for such tests in outbreak settings are largely undeveloped, leaving unanswered the question of whether these designs are practical. We develop approximate sample size formulae and simulation\\\\based sample size methods for cluster randomized trials in infectious disease outbreaks. We highlight key relationships between characteristics of transmission and the enrolled communities and the required sample sizes, describe settings where trials powered to detect a meaningful true effect size may be feasible, and provide recommendations for investigators in planning such trials.

Despite numerous hurdles and inadequacies identified with the initial devices, current product offering and the need for remote patient care has driven advancements and adoption of the newer generation of devices. This study aims to evaluate the current use of augmented reality devices and the current hurdles to implementation by surveying authors who have recently published on this topic. Design A 22-question survey was shared with authors of 27 recent publications relating to usage of augmented reality in medicine between the years of 2019 and 2020. Results Eighty-two percent of participants were located in North America while the rest were located in Europe. Interestingly, over 65% of respondents were over the age of 40. Almost half of respondents (45%) used the technology for image review while almost a third (27%) used it for capturing and sharing video. Most concerns to implementation were related to privacy (38%) or reimbursement (33%). Conclusion Despite the hurdles reported by respondents, the advancements in AR/VR have come a long way since their introduction and have great potential for continued usage in medicine. Despite this, however, it is important to recognize that cost, security, and battery life continue to serve as hurdles preventing the widespread adoption of this technology to mass markets.","output":"Updates to the Current Landscape of Augmented Reality in Medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) develop acute exacerbations (AE), with varying natural history. The exacerbation is triggered by infection, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The study on infectious aetiology of AECOPD is largely restricted to only viral or only bacterial aetiology. There are no studies from India that have investigated multiple viral, bacterial, and fungal associations from the same group of patients. This prospective study was conducted over 2 years to estimate the incidence and profile of viral infections in AECOPD patients, their coinfection with other bacterial and fungal agents, and association of the type and pattern of infective agent with the clinical severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-four AECOPD cases were included in the study. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was performed from nasopharyngeal swab using Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 21 Plus Kit. ZiehlCNeelsen (ZN) stain, Modified ZN, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) mount were performed for Mycobacteria, Nocardia, and fungal elements. Bacterial cultures and fungal cultures were done as per the standard techniques. Serum samples were tested for Mycoplasma and Chlamydia pneumoniae immunoglobulin M enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The number of AECOPD events involving only viral infection, only bacterial infection, bacterialCviral coinfection, and no infection were 43 (58.1%), 32 (43.2%), 20 (27%), and 19 (25.7%), respectively. Influenza A virus was the most common virus (22/43, 51%) identified. In 26 patients, monoviral infections were found, and in 17 patients, polyviral infections were identified, the most common pattern being influenza A and B virus, followed by human rhinovirus and human parainfluenza. The most common bacteria isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9/32,28%) followed by Acinetobacter baumanii and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7/32, 21%). Among the viralCbacterial coinfection, human coronavirus NL63 infection was always associated with a bacterial infection. CONCLUSION: This information on the various viral and bacterial etiologies of respiratory infections in AECOPD in this part of India will improve the understanding of the management of AECOPD using a timely institution of antivirals and reduce the overuse of antibiotics and the implementation of routine influenza vaccination.","output":"Study of respiratory viruses and their coinfection with bacterial and fungal pathogens in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE In addition to being a medical phenomenon, pandemics affect the individual and society on several levels and lead to disruptions. In the pandemic process, different groups in the population, including pregnant women as a defenseless group, are subjected to psychological threat. The present study aimed to determine the levels of anxiety and depression and related factors in pregnant women during the the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. METHODS The present cross-sectional study was conducted with 269 pregnant women through face-to-face interviews held in Istanbul, Turkey. Regarding the data collection tools, the Cronbach  reliability coefficient was of 0.90 for the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and of 0.85 for the Beck Depression Inventory. RESULTS Among the participating pregnant women, 30.5% had mild, 17.5% had moderate, and 5.9% had severe anxiety symptoms, whereas 35.3% had mild, 16.7% had moderate, and 2.2% had severe depression symptoms. We found that those who were concerned about their health had 5.36 times (p = 0.04) more risk of developing anxiety, and 4.82 times (p = 0.01) more risk of developing depression than those who were not concerned. Those who had a history of psychiatric disease had 3.92 times (p = 0.02) more risk of developing anxiety than those without it. CONCLUSION We determined that about half of the pregnant women included in the study had some degree of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. The risk factors for anxiety and depression among the pregnant women were determined as smoking, concerns about health and getting infected with the coronavirus, history of psychiatric disease, and undergoing regular antenatal care.","output":"Levels and Predictors of Anxiety and Depression in Turkish Pregnant Woman During the Covid-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thus far, associations between the presence of systemic rheumatic disease and an increased risk of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) acquisition or a worse prognosis from COVID-19 have not been conclusive. It is not known for certain if there is an association between any pharmacological agent used for rheumatologic treatment, including biological and non-biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and an increased risk of COVID-19 acquisition or adverse outcomes from COVID-19, although these agents have been associated with an overall higher risk of infections. The pharmacological management of patients with a rheumatic disease without COVID-19 should currently follow usual treatment approaches. Individualized approaches to adjusting DMARD regimens in patients with documented COVID-19 seems prudent, with specific attention paid to the severity of the infection. Patients receiving antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine) may continue treatment with these agents. Treatment with sulfasalazine, methotrexate, leflunomide, immunosuppressants and biological agents other than interluekin-6 receptor inhibitors and JAK inhibitors should be stopped or withheld.

Performing arts and music studies have also experienced considerable changes, with university closures and a fluctuating return to normal and more limited operations. Prior studies detail the impact of the pandemic on college students, but we do not yet know what specific consequences it has for music students. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on music students health, practicing behavior, and everyday life. METHODS: In July 2020, we conducted an online survey of 80 students enrolled in performance and music education programs at a German music university and compared these data with data from a survey of 75 students at the same music university carried out in summer 2019. RESULTS: The survey revealed that the coronavirus pandemic led to a decrease in practicing hours and an increase of stressful thoughts and feelings. Students were mostly satisfied with Corona-measures taken by the university. Of analyzed determinants, only general fear of health problems was identified as a significant predictor of mental health status. Mental health status did not significantly differ between students surveyed in 2019 and 2020. CONCLUSION: Knowledge about the specific challenges the pandemic poses for music students can help conservatories to better respond to the needs of their students.

The time form leaving the hospital to re-infection and the time form the first nucleic acid negative test results to being re-infected were recorded. The clinical characteristics of the two groups were compared when they were admitted to the hospital. Logistic regression analysis was carried out on disease indicators with statistical differences between the two groups. RESULTS Compared with non-re-infected patients, there were statistical differences in age, contact history, fatigue, chills, nasal congestion and runny nose, lung CT observations, clinical classification and lymphocyte count of re-infected patients (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that nasal congestion and a runny nose, a lymphocyte count less than 0.93109 cells/L, and age 65 years were the risk factors of being re-infected. The ROC curve showed that the cut-off value of lymphocyte count was 0.847109 cells/L, and the AUC of predicted re-infection was 0.867.

We present findings of data analysis conducted for assessing the safety and clinical outcomes of remdesivir treatment for COVID-19 in India. METHODS: This retrospective analysis used data from an active surveillance programme database of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who were receiving remdesivir. RESULTS: Of the 2329 patients included, 67.40% were men. Diabetes (29.69%) and hypertension (20.33%) were the most common comorbidities. At remdesivir initiation, 2272 (97.55%) patients were receiving oxygen therapy. Remdesivir was administered for 5 days in 65.38% of patients. Antibiotics (64.90%) and steroids (47.90%) were the most common concomitant medications. Remdesivir was overall well tolerated, and total 119 adverse events were reported; most common were nausea and vomiting in 45.40% and increased liver enzymes in 14.28% patients. 84% of patients were cured/improved, 6.77% died and 9.16% showed no improvement in their clinical status at data collection. Subgroup analyses showed that the mortality rate was significantly lower in patients < 60 years old than in those > 60 years old. Amongst patients on oxygen therapy, the cure/improvement rate was significantly higher in those receiving standard low-flow oxygen than in those receiving mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, or high-flow oxygen. Factors that were associated with higher mortality were age > 60 years, cardiac disease, diabetes high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Our analysis showed that remdesivir is well tolerated and has an acceptable safety profile.

The role and utility of these novel formulations in clinical practice are outlined, as well as the risks and benefits associated with formulations that are currently available or under development. EXPERT OPINION Numerous concerns with the integration of these formulations into clinical practice remain, as no product is intended or capable of addressing all types of misuse or abuse. As a result, these formulations should not necessarily be considered preferred agents once available in clinical practice. Moreover, before initiating therapy with abuse-deterrent and tamper-resistant formulations, proper patient assessment to identify risk factors for misuse and abuse should be implemented and optimized. With screening and monitoring in place, it would then be sensible to consider these formulations in patients who appear to be at high risk of misuse, abuse and/or diversion.","output":"Abuse-deterrent and tamper-resistant opioids: how valuable are novel formulations in thwarting non-medical use?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review gives an overview of the development of machine learning in geoscience.

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a new classification algorithm for biomarker discovery in children at risk of SBI. Methods: We used data from five previously published, prospective observational biomarker discovery studies, which included patients aged 0C <16 years: the Alder Hey emergency department (n = 1,120), Alder Hey pediatric intensive care unit (n = 355), Erasmus emergency department (n = 1,993), Maasstad emergency department (n = 714) and St. Mary's hospital (n = 200) cohorts. Biomarkers including procalcitonin (PCT) (4 cohorts), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin-2 (NGAL) (3 cohorts) and resistin (2 cohorts) were compared for their ability to classify patients according to current standards (dichotomous classification of SBI vs. non-SBI), vs. a proposed PERFORM classification algorithm that assign patients to one of eleven categories. These categories were based on clinical phenotype, test outcomes and C-reactive protein level and accounted for the uncertainty of final diagnosis in many febrile children. The success of the biomarkers was measured by the Area under the receiver operating Curves (AUCs) when they were used individually or in combination. Results: Using the new PERFORM classification system, patients with clinically confident bacterial diagnosis (definite bacterial category) had significantly higher levels of PCT, NGAL and resistin compared with those with a clinically confident viral diagnosis (definite viral category). Patients with diagnostic uncertainty had biomarker concentrations that varied across the spectrum. AUCs were higher for classification of definite bacterial vs. definite viral following the PERFORM algorithm than using the SBI vs. non-SBI classification; summary AUC for PCT was 0.77 (95% CI 0.72C0.82) vs. 0.70 (95% CI 0.65C0.75); for NGAL this was 0.80 (95% CI 0.69C0.91) vs. 0.70 (95% CI 0.58C0.81); for resistin this was 0.68 (95% CI 0.61C0.75) vs. 0.64 (0.58C0.69) The three biomarkers combined had summary AUC of 0.83 (0.77C0.89) for definite bacterial vs. definite viral infections and 0.71 (0.67C0.74) for SBI vs. non-SBI.

Considering that pediatric population comprises a significant portion on the population in developing countries, and their risk of infection and spreading the disease has been underestimated, it is crucial to investigate parental willingness to administer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to their children between 5 and 11 years old. This study investigates the prevalence and determinants of parental willingness towards vaccinating their children (5C12 years old) against COVID-19 in a developing country setting, Jordan. METHODS: A cross-sectional study, conducted between October and November 2021, utilized online Google Forms to collect data on parents background characteristics, willingness to vaccinate their children, SARS-CoV-2, infection and vaccine, risk perception, and factors affecting decision to vaccinate. RESULTS: A total of 564 parents completed the questionnaire; 82.8% were mothers, 85.3% were 30 years of age or older, and 75.9% had bachelors degrees or higher. Only 25.4% of parents reported willingness to vaccinate their 5C12 years old children against SARS-CoV-2. Lower parental age, higher income, and having health insurance coverage increased parental willingness. Among participants vaccinated against COVID-19, only 29.0% were willing to vaccinate their children. Healthcare providers trust and vaccine recommendations by pediatricians increased parental willingness. COVID-19 risk perception seems to have negative effects on parental willingness. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of parents in Jordan indicated hesitancy towards administering COVID-19 vaccine for their children. Concerns about vaccine safety and trust in the healthcare system appear to be the most important predictors of parents hesitancy.

Our objective was to record short-term adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine in patients with cancer, to compare the magnitude and duration of these reactions with those of patients without cancer, and to determine whether adverse reactions are related to active cancer therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective, single-institution observational study was performed at an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. All study participants received 2 doses of the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine separated by approximately 3 weeks. A report of adverse reactions to dose 1 of the vaccine was completed upon return to the clinic for dose 2.

The aim of this study is to show, by means of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), the presence of an increased estimated systolic pressure in the pulmonary artery (esPAP) and altered right ventricular global longitudinal strain (RV-GLS) in patients without history of PH. Methods: In a group of 91 patients, aged under 55 years, hospitalized for a moderate Covid-19 infection, a thorough cardiologic and TTE examination were performed two months after discharge. Their initial thorax computer-tomography (TCT) images and laboratory data were accessed from the electronic data base of the hospital. Results: We observed an increased prevalence of PH (7.69%) and RVD (10.28%), significantly correlated with the initial levels of the TCT score and inflammatory factors (p ? 0.001), but borderline changes were observed in more patients. Multivariate regression analysis showed that these factors and RV-GLS explain 89.5% of elevated esPAP. Conclusions: In COVID-19 infection, PH and RVD are common complications, being encountered after the recovery even in moderate cases.

The literature suggests a learning curve of 50-100 cases for attaining proficiency and reducing the complication rates for laparoscopic bariatric surgery. The aims of this paper were to review the literature of initial cases by bariatric surgeons worldwide and to report the experience of initial 50 cases of LSG by a novice bariatric team in a single center. The objective was to evaluate the outcomes for laparoscopic bariatric surgery in the first 50 patients by a novice team of bariatric surgeons in an already established bariatric surgery program with short-term follow-up. METHODS All surgeries were done by a new bariatric team who underwent laparoscopic fellowship training under a bariatric team with an experience of over 600 bariatric procedures. Fifty consecutive patients from March 2010 to January 2012 were offered LSG and followed up for a minimum of 6 months. Weight loss and comorbidity resolution were tabulated and assessed. RESULTS Mean preoperative and postoperative BMIs were 46.6 and 35.7 kg/m2, respectively. There were no life threatening postoperative complications or mortality. The median percent excess weight loss was 50.3% at the end of 6 months. Comorbidity resolution values were 96% for obstructive sleep apnea, 89% for diabetes mellitus, and 87% for joint pains, among the most common comorbidities. CONCLUSION LSG is effective in achieving weight loss and in improving comorbidities with minimal complications even at the hands of novice bariatric surgeons with good laparoscopic skills and adequate bariatric training.","output":"Initial experience with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy by a novice bariatric team in an established bariatric center--a review of literature and initial results."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Excessive monocyte activation with the development of excessive or uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines often results in host tissue injury and even death in patients with pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus. However, the changes of cytokine profiles of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, as well as the underlying mechanisms that are involved, remain unknown. Using a cytokine array containing 174 inflammation-related cytokines, we found significantly altered cytokine profiles in severe COVID-19 patients compared with those in mild patients or healthy controls, and identified leptin, CXCL-10, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-&#945; as the top differentially expressed cytokines. Notably, leptin showed high consistency with CXCL-10 and TNF-&#945; in predicting disease severity, and correlated with body mass index, decreased lymphocyte counts, and disease progression. Further analysis demonstrated that monocytes in severe patients with higher leptin levels were inclined toward M1 polarization. Mechanistic studies revealed that leptin synergistically up-regulated expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and surface markers with IL-6 in monocytes through STAT3 and NF-&#954;B signaling pathways. Collectively, our results suggest that overweight COVID-19 patients were prone to have higher leptin levels, which further activated monocytes, resulting in amplified or dysregulated immune responses. Taken together, our findings argue that leptin correlates severity of COVID-19 and may indicate a possible mechanism by which overweight patients have a greater tendency to develop severe conditions.","output":"Leptin correlates with monocytes activation and severe condition in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: due to the fact that lung disease due to SARS COV 2 infection is of recent appearance and the lack of knowledge about its natural history, it is not clear the moment of adequate follow-up by diagnostic images, this being suggested after 3 months of the onset of the symptoms according to the evolution of the patient. We present the variation of image findings of a patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. DESCRIPTION:we present the case of a 56-year-old male patient who required initial hospitalization of 14 days because of symptoms secondary to multilobar severe pneumonia due to SARS-COV-2 infection with initial tomographic findings of classic pattern given by ground glass opacities of subpleural distribution predominantly in the lower lobes. The patient was discharged with low flow oxygen supplementation and attended the pulmonology consultation a month later reporting improvement in dyspnea with medical research council score grade 1 and complete withdrawal of oxygen support. A control chest computed tomography was taken 6 weeks since initial evaluation reporting subpleural bullae of recent appearance in the upper and lower right lobe with diameters of up to 80 mm. It was also described a small residual laminar pneumothorax adjacent to the lingula with pleural effusion with apparent septae. Given these findings, an intervention by thoracic surgery was requested who decided to schedule a surgical procedure and performed a new control image corresponding to 8 weeks from the initial one with findings of complete and spontaneous resolution of the pneumothorax as well as the pleural effusion although persistence of the bullas. It was decided there was not required further interventions and patient was discharged from follow-up.DISCUSSION: SARS-CoV2 infection manifests itself in different patterns of lung damage and can have long term pulmonary sequelae that are only identified with judicious and strict follow-up during the first months after infection. Nevertheless, the British Thoracic Society (BTS) has recommended the first image follow-up to be preformed after 3 months of the initial symptoms because of the high incidence of image alterations in that period of time and lesser probability of occult malignancy. This case described a rare presentation of lung damage with equally spontaneous resolution of the complications confirming the timeframe proposed by the BTS.","output":"Imagenological Evolution of Pulmonary Secuelae after SARS CoV2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus emergency led to a particularly serious situation, increasing the precarious conditions in which the external company found itself The responses of the penitentiary world have produced heterogeneous consequences, in some cases resulting in violent acts, in others based on internal mediation strategies that allowed collaboration between prisoners and staff The implementation of new measures such as calls on a daily basis and video calls, certainly contributed to alleviating internal tensions and marked an innovative turning point for the national penitentiary system The main problem, however, remains as always the overcrowding: in Italy but also in Europe has understandably increased the management problems of the pandemic ?

The aim of this review is to suggest the future challenges midwives are going to face in the upcoming decade of this Century. COVID-19 and other infections will reasonably impact healthcare workers all over the world. Midwives are frontline healthcare professionals who are constantly at risk of contagion as their job implies close contact with women, physical support and hand touch. Also, menstruation waste plays a large role in the pollution of waters, severely impacting hygiene in the developing countries and fueling climate change. Appropriate disposal of used menstrual material is still insufficient in many countries of the world especially because of lack of sanitary education on girls. As educators, midwives will be more involved into preventing inappropriate disposal of menstrual hygiene devices by educating girls around the world about the green alternatives to the commercial ones. Despite the evidences about the fertility decrement that occurs with aging, women keep postponing reproduction and increasing their chance being childless or suffering complications related to the advanced maternal age. Teen pregnancies are as well an important issue for midwives who will be called to face more age-related issues and use a tailored case to case approach, enhancing their family planning skills. Another crucial role of midwifery regards the information about the risk of drinking alcohol during gestation. Alcohol assumption during pregnancy is responsible for serious damage to the fetus causing a wide range of pathological conditions related to Fetal Alcoholic Spectrum Disorder, leading cause of mental retardation in children of western countries. On the whole, midwives have demonstrated their willingness to expand their practice through continuing professional development, and through specialist and advanced roles especially in preventive and educational positions.","output":"Challenges for Midwives' Healthcare Practice in the Next Decade: COVID-19 - Global Climate Changes - Aging and Pregnancy - Gestational Alcohol Abuse."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical and molecular characterization by Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) is reported in 35 COVID-19 patients attending the University Hospital in Siena, Italy, from April 7 to May 7, 2020.

Eleven studies met eligibility for inclusion: two studies evaluated personal sound amplification products, and nine studies assessed remote microphone systems (frequency modulation, Bluetooth, wireless). The evidence in this review suggests that alternative listening devices improve behavioural measures of speech intelligibility relative to unaided and/or aided conditions. Evidence for whether alternative listening devices improve self-reported outcomes is inconsistent. The evidence was judged to be of poor to good quality and subject to bias due to limitations in study design.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multidisciplinary, geographically representative group of individuals with expertise spanning transfusion medicine, infectious diseases and hematology was tasked with the development of a guidance document for CCP, drawing on expert opinion, survey of group members and review of available evidence. Three subgroups (i.e. donor, product and patient) were established based on self\\\\identified expertise and interest. Here, the donor and product\\\\related challenges are summarized and contrasted between HICs and LMICs with a view to guide related practices. RESULTS: The challenges to advance CCP therapy are different between HICs and LMICs. Early challenges in HICs related to recruitment and qualification of sufficient donors to meet the growing demand. Antibody testing also posed a specific obstacle given lack of standardization, variable performance of the assays in use and uncertain interpretation of results. In LMICs, an extant transfusion deficit, suboptimal models of donor recruitment (e.g. reliance on replacement and paid donors), limited laboratory capacity for pre\\\\donation qualification and operational considerations could impede wide adoption. CONCLUSION: There has been wide scale adoption of CCP in many HICs, which could increase if clinical trials show efficacy of use.

In Brazil, the first case was reported on February 26. As the number of cases grows in the country, there is a concern that the health system may become overwhelmed, resulting in shortages of hospital beds, intensive care unit beds, and mechanical ventilators. The timing of shortage is likely to vary geographically depending on the observed onset and pace of transmission observed, on the availability of resources, and on the actions implemented. Here we consider the daily number of cases reported in municipalities in Brazil to simulate twelve alternative scenarios of the likely timing of shortage, based on parameters consistently reported for China and Italy, on rates of hospital occupancy for other health conditions observed in Brazil in 2019, and on assumptions of allocation of patients in public and private facilities. Results show that hospital services could start to experience shortages of hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators in early April, the most critical situation observed for ICU beds. Increasing the allocation of beds for COVID-19 (in lieu of other conditions) or temporarily placing all resources under the administration of the state delays the anticipated start of shortages by a week. This suggests that solutions adopted by the Brazilian government must aim at expanding the available capacity (e.g., makeshift hospitals), and not simply prioritizing the allocation of available resources to COVID-19.","output":"Demand for hospitalization services for COVID-19 patients in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among the various types of cancer, lung cancer is the second most-diagnosed cancer worldwide. The kinesin spindle protein, Eg5, is a vital protein behind bipolar mitotic spindle establishment and maintenance during mitosis. Eg5 has been reported to contribute to cancer cell migration and angiogenesis impairment and has no role in resting, non-dividing cells. Thus, it could be considered as a vital target against several cancers, such as renal cancer, lung cancer, urothelial carcinoma, prostate cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, etc. In recent years, fungal secondary metabolites from the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) have been identified as an important lead source in the drug development pipeline. Therefore, the present study aims to identify potential mycotic secondary metabolites against the Eg5 protein by applying integrated machine learning, chemoinformatics based in silico-screening methods and molecular dynamic simulation targeting lung cancer. Initially, a library of 1830 mycotic secondary metabolites was screened by a predictive machine-learning model developed based on the random forest algorithm with high sensitivity (1) and an ROC area of 0.99. Further, 319 out of 1830 compounds screened with active potential by the model were evaluated for their drug-likeness properties by applying four filters simultaneously, viz., Lipinskis rule, CMC-50 like rule, Veber rule, and Ghose filter. A total of 13 compounds passed from all the above filters were considered for molecular docking, functional group analysis, and cell line cytotoxicity prediction. Finally, four hit mycotic secondary metabolites found in fungi from the IHR were screened viz., (?)-Cochlactone-A, Phelligridin C, Sterenin E, and Cyathusal A. All compounds have efficient binding potential with Eg5, containing functional groups like aromatic rings, rings, carboxylic acid esters, and carbonyl and with cell line cytotoxicity against lung cancer cell lines, namely, MCF-7, NCI-H226, NCI-H522, A549, and NCI H187. Further, the molecular dynamics simulation study confirms the docked complex rigidity and stability by exploring root mean square deviations, root mean square fluctuations, and radius of gyration analysis from 100 ns simulation trajectories.

METHODS: Surgeons from multiple specialties attended one of six faculty development workshops where IOT trigger videos were shown and discussed during break-out sessions. Participants completed questionnaires to (1) evaluate videos via survey and feedback, and (2) identify adoptable and discardable IOT techniques. Teaching techniques were collated to identify planned IOT changes and survey data and feedback were analyzed.

General vaccine hesitancy (including not having had a flu shot in the last two years), distrust of vaccine safety, and vaccine novelty are among the most important deterrents to vaccination. Further, our results suggest that inconsistent risk messages from public health experts and elected officials reduce vaccine uptake. We use our survey results in an epidemiological model to explore conditions under which a vaccine could achieve herd immunity. We find that in a middle-of-the-road scenario with central estimates of model parameters, a vaccine will benefit public health by saving many lives but nevertheless may fail to achieve herd immunity.","output":"Hesitancy Towards a COVID-19 Vaccine and Prospects for Herd Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to analyze spatiotemporal changes of CT manifestations in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this retrospective review, 110 patients with confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR form February 16, 2020, to March 28, 2020 were included. A total of 449 CT scans were reviewed. We analyze the type and distribution of lung abnormalities, and CT general assessment and lesion area statistics were performed. Patients were divided into mild, moderate, and severe disease based on Chinese guidelines: mild (patients with minimal symptoms, CT scans showed no pneumonia or a small area of pneumonia infection), moderate (different extent of clinical manifestations and CT scans showed multiple pneumonia infections in both lungs), severe disease (respiratory distress, CT scans lesion area exceeds 50%, and the lesion contains consolidation). The proportion of patients with mild, moderate and severe diseases was counted. RESULTS The CT score and the area involved reached a peak (median 10) on illness days 7-12, and then, continued to be at a high level. The main abnormal pattern after symptoms appeared GGO (36/94 [36%] to 40/65 [62%] in different periods). The proportion of mixed reached its peak on illness days 13-18 (36/93 [39%]). Pure GGO was the most common subtype of GGO (24 of 60 CT scans [40%] to 23 of 33 CT scans [70%]) after symptoms onset. The ratio of GGO with irregular lines and interfaces peaked on illness days 7-12 (6/34 [18%]). The lesions are mainly distributed on both sides and under the pleura. 76/84 (90%) of discharged patients had residual lesions on the final CT scans. 4 confirmed patients' CT scans did not show lesions (on illness days 1-24 days). There were 47 mild cases (42.7%), 46 moderate cases (41.8%), and 7 severe cases (6.3%). CONCLUSIONS The degree of lung abnormality on the CT of the patients reached the peak on the 7th to 12th days of the disease. CT performance changes with time have a certain regularity, which may indicate the progress and recovery of the disease. 90% of patients still observed residual lung abnormalities in CT images at the time of discharge. There were 4 confirmed cases where the CT images did not show the lesion; hence, CT cannot be used as a basis for judging COVID-19 as a single tool.","output":"Spatiotemporal changes of CT manifestations in 110 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The study evaluated the effects of the COVID-19 emergency lockdown on the psychological outcome in caregivers (children or spouses) of patients with dementia and the loss of the welfare services in these patients.

We hypothesize that visitor response may exhibit a threshold effect where ambient smoke reduces visitation after a critical level, but not before. We develop a series of breakpoint models to test this hypothesis. Overall, these models show little to no effect of ambient smoke on visitation to the 32 parks tested, even when allowing for critical thresholds at the extreme upper ranges of the smoke data. This suggests that wildfire smoke does not significantly alter behavior of park attendance.

METHODS: Two nursing homes were hospital-dependent, had connections with infection prevention and control departments, and had permanent physicians. Third nursing home had no direct connection with general hospital, no infection control practitioner, and no permanent physician. The main outcome was death. RESULTS: During first 3 months of the outbreak, 224/375 (59.7%) residents were classified COVID-19 cases and 57/375 (15.2%) died. Hospital dependent nursing homes had lower COVID-19 case fatality rates in comparison to non-hospital dependent nursing home (15 [6.6%] vs 38 [25.8%], OR 0.20 [0.11-0.38], p = 0.001).

Yet, the impact of individual microorganisms on pulmonary functions remains uncertain in children with CF. METHODS As part of the 'Mucoviscidosis, respiratory VIruses, intracellular Bacteria and fastidious organisms'' project, children with CF were longitudinally followed in a Swiss multicentric study. Respiratory samples included mainly throat swabs and sputa samples for bacterial culture and 16S rRNA metagenomics and nasopharyngeal swabs for respiratory virus detection by molecular assays. Percentage of predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1%) and Lung Clearance Index (LCI) were recorded. RESULTS Sixty-one children, of whom 20 (32.8%) presented with at least one pulmonary exacerbation, were included. Almost half of the 363 nasopharyngeal swabs tested by RT-PCR were positive for a respiratory virus, mainly rhinovirus (26.5%). From linear mixed-effects regression models, P. aeruginosa (-11.35, 95%CI [-17.90; -4.80], p = 0.001) was significantly associated with a decreased FEV1%, whereas rhinovirus was associated with a significantly higher FEV1% (+4.24 95%CI [1.67; 6.81], p = 0.001). Compared to conventional culture, 16S rRNA metagenomics showed a sensitivity and specificity of 80.0% and 85.4%, respectively for detection of typical CF pathogens. However, metagenomics detected a bacteria almost twice more often than culture.

With the COVID-19 pandemic, planting activities by farmers in Nigeria have been negatively impacted in the 2019/20 planting season. Hunger may therefore be looming in the coming periods because food production output will be lowered. Understanding volatility in the prices of food therefore becomes very important if any meaningful solutions are to be proffered. In this study, we sought to measure volatility in prices of important staple foods using the GARCH approach and then investigate the factors that drive them over the period 1970-2019. Our result revealed persistent volatility in food prices over the period under review. It was revealed that insurgency, political stability in neighbouring countries, trade liberalization, GDP per capita, inflation rate, government effectiveness, crop production, crude oil price and exchange rate were prominent drivers of volatility in food commodity prices. The study therefore recommends the pursuance of a peaceful nation that is capable of supporting sustainable and increased agricultural production. We as well recommend mechanisms that better regulates inter-border food trading activities whereas strategies of price stabilization policies and government interventions in the pre-liberalization era should be re-visited.

Liver metastasis is promoted, in part, by changes to the liver environment, resulting in the formation of a metastatic niche that supports circulating tumor cells. Understanding how the liver niche support breast cancer cells may lead to development of treatments for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Here, we report that the developmentally regulated process of weaning-induced liver involution increases liver metastasis in cancer cells with otherwise low metastatic potential. Increased metastasis associates with unique immunological properties in the involuting liver, including reduced ability to activate T cells required for tumor cell clearance. These data establish physiologic liver involution as a model to understand the liver metastatic niche and suggest future research into whether the immune milieu identified in the involuting liver could be targeted to treat metastases more generally. ABSTRACT: In rodents, we identified a physiologic process within the normal liver that creates a pre-metastatic niche. This physiology is weaning-induced liver involution, characterized by hepatocyte cell death, immune influx, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Here, using weaning-induced liver involution as a model of a physiologically regulated pro-metastatic niche, we investigate how liver involution supports breast cancer metastasis. Liver metastases were induced in BALB/c immune competent hosts by portal vein injection of D2OR (low metastatic) or D2A1 (high metastatic) mouse mammary tumor cells. Tumor incidence and multiplicity increased in involution hosts with no evidence of a proliferation advantage. D2OR tumor cell extravasation, seeding, and early survival were not enhanced in the involuting group compared to the nulliparous group. Rather, the involution metastatic advantage was observed at 14 days post tumor cell injection. This metastatic advantage associated with induction of immune tolerance in the involution host liver, reproductive state dependent intra-tumoral immune composition, and CD8-dependent suppression of metastases in nulliparous hosts. Our findings suggest that the normal postpartum liver is in an immune suppressed state, which can provide a pro-metastatic advantage to circulating breast cancer cells. Potential relevance to women is suggested as a postpartum diagnosis of breast cancer is an independent predictor of liver metastasis.","output":"Immune Milieu Established by Postpartum Liver Involution Promotes Breast Cancer Liver Metastasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This case describes an unusual cutaneous presentation.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The growth of recombinant L. plantarum was not affected by TsPPase/pSIP409-pgsA plasmid, and the recombinant plasmid was inherited stably in bacteria. Western blot and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) indicated that the rTsPPase was expressed on the surface of recombinant L. plantarum. Oral vaccination with rTsPPase induced higher levels of specific serum IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and mucosal secretory IgA (sIgA) in BALB/c mice. ELISA analysis revealed that the levels of IFN- and IL-4 released from spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyers patches were evidently increased at 2C4 weeks following vaccination, compared to MRS (De Man, Rogosa, Sharpe) medium control group (P < 0.05). Immunization of mice with rTsPPase exhibited a 67.18, 54.78 and 51.91% reduction of intestinal infective larvae, adult worms and muscle larvae at 24 hours post infection (hpi), 6 days post infection (dpi) and 35 dpi, respectively (P < 0.05), and the larval molting and development was significantly inhibited by 45.45% at 24 hpi, compared to the MRS group.

The additives were given twice daily with the meal from day 2 to day 14 post\\\\natum. The presence of infectious agents was proved in fecal samples of all calves. Intestinal infections with rotavirus (30.8% of the calves) predominated compared to those with coronavirus (7.1%), E. coli F5 (1.5%) and cryptosporidia (24.2%). In contrast to earlier studies, the manifestation of diarrhoea did not differ significantly between the five groups. Only the growth rate of the calves between day 2 and day 14 of life as a measure of their welfare showed treatmentFspecific differences. The control group (I) showed the lowest body weight gain of about 5.8 kg (SD 5.0), whereas in the treated groups it averaged 6.3 kg (SD 4.1, p = 0,60; group II), 6.8 kg (SD 4.3, p = 0.36; group III), 6.9 kg (SD 4.7, p = 0.61; group IV) and 7.7 kg (SD 4.9, p = 0.08; group V).

In this review, we examine current recommendations for CP and highlight differences in CP use between endemic and non-endemic MDROs. RECENT FINDINGS: The discontinuation of CP had no effect on the incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. The evidence regarding CP for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae is inconclusive, highlighting the need for more research to determine best infection control strategies. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae maintains a sporadic pattern in the USA, supporting current recommendations to use CP for colonized and infected patients. MDR Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB) is extremely virulent and responsible for outbreaks in healthcare settings, emphasizing the need for CP use with MDR-AB infected patients. Candida auris (C. auris) is often misdiagnosed; it is resistant to UV light and quaternary ammonium low-level disinfection. Because little is known about the transmission of C. auris, significant caution and CP use are necessitated. There is little research on vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) control strategies due to its rarity; thus, CP is strongly recommended. SUMMARY: Contact precautions are frequently part of a bundled infection control approach that involves meticulous hand hygiene, patient decolonization, chlorhexidine gluconate bathing, and reducing the use of invasive devices. Healthcare facilities should continue to utilize CP for non-endemic MDROs and the presence of endemic MDROs; however, CP may not add benefit to the current infection prevention bundle approach.","output":"Barrier Precautions in the Era of Multidrug Pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to COVID-19 hygiene and physical distancing restrictions, our service rapidly shifted to delivering Circle of Security-Parenting?

While being important tools in the diagnostic virology today, these techniques are time-consuming and require specific tools such as cultivation media, cell or tissue cultures, antibodies, purified antigens. In the past decade the number of new molecular-based methods grew rapidly and gained more popularity in diagnostic labs. The core of these techniques constitutes of techniques based on nucleic acid detection by specific amplification, hybridization, and/or sequencing (reviewed in ref. [1]). The most nucleic acid-based diagnostic methods are simple, speed, sensitive and specific and thus meet the gold four-S-standard for their application in any diagnostic laboratories. The methods are simple and speed because only a specific primer pair and a PCR machine are needed in a lab setting and identification of a viral pathogen takes within few hours. They are sensitive and specific and require only a small amount of patients materials to detect a specific nucleotide sequence region. In general, these techniques can be used to detect almost all types of viral pathogens and even to identify multiple viral pathogens or their variants at the same time.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of Monascus pigment derivatives, which were derived from a microbial secondary metabolite synthesized from polyketides by Monascus spp., as HCV antiviral agents. METHODS: We performed an in vitro RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) assay to screen for HCV RdRp inhibitors. The anti-HCV activity of RdRp inhibitors in HCV-replicating cells was evaluated by quantification of the RNA viral genome. Molecular docking analysis was performed to predict the binding sites of the selected RdRp inhibitors. RESULTS: We have identified a Monascus pigment and its derivatives as inhibitors of the HCV NS5B RdRp. A group of Monascus orange pigment (MOP) amino acid derivatives, in which the reactive oxygen moiety was changed to amino acids, significantly inhibited HCV replication. Further, combination of the MOP derivatives (Phe, Val or Leu conjugates) with interferon (IFN)- inhibited HCV replication more than IFN- treatment alone. Lastly, molecular docking studies indicate the inhibitors may bind to a thumb subdomain allosteric site of NS5B. The antiviral activity of the MOP derivatives was related to a modulation of the mevalonate pathway, since the mevalonate-induced increase in HCV replication was suppressed by the MOP compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify amino acid derivatives of MOP as potential anti-HCV agents and suggest that their combination with IFN- might offer an alternative strategy for the control of HCV replication.","output":"Inhibition of hepatitis C virus replication by Monascus pigment derivatives that interfere with viral RNA polymerase activity and the mevalonate biosynthesis pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Port-of-Spain, March 18, 2020: As part of the national drive to safeguard the health of the Trinidad and Tobago population in the face of the global COVID-19 outbreak, the Ministry of Health continues to provide up-to-date information on the country&#039;s status in this regard","output":"Trinidad and Tobago COVID 19 (Novel Coronavirus) Update #33"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent months SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly throughout the world.

These structures reveal that most Omicron mutations are located on the surface of the spike protein, which confer stronger ACE2 binding by nearly 10 folds but become inactive epitopes resistant to many therapeutic antibodies. Importantly, both RBD and the closed conformation of the Omicron spike trimer are thermodynamically unstable, with the melting temperature of the Omicron RBD decreased by as much as 7{degrees}C, making the spiker trimer prone to random open conformations. An unusual RBD-RBD interaction in the ACE2-spike complex unique to Omicron is observed to support the open conformation and ACE2 binding, serving the basis for the higher infectivity of Omicron. A broad-spectrum therapeutic antibody JMB2002, which has completed Phase 1 clinical trial, is found to interact with the same two RBDs to inhibit ACE2 binding, in a mode that is distinguished from all previous antibodies, thus providing the structural basis for the potent inhibition of Omicron by this antibody.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of Zilucoplan in improving oxygenation and short- and long-term outcome of COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a phase 2 academic, prospective, 2:1 randomized, open-label, multi-center interventional study. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients (18y old) will be recruited at specialized COVID-19 units and ICUs at 9 Belgian hospitals. The main eligibility criteria are as follows: 1) Inclusion criteria: a. Recent (6 days and 16 days) SARS-CoV-2 infection. b. Chest CT scan showing bilateral infiltrates within the last 2 days prior to randomisation. c. Acute hypoxia (defined as PaO(2)/FiO(2) below 350 mmHg or SpO2 below 93% on minimal 2 L/min supplemental oxygen). d. Signs of cytokine release syndrome characterized by either high serum ferritin, or high D-dimers, or high LDH or deep lymphopenia or a combination of those. 2) Exclusion criteria: e. Mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours prior to randomisation. f. Active bacterial or fungal infection. g. History of meningococcal disease (due to the known high predisposition to invasive, often recurrent meningococcal infections of individuals deficient in components of the alternative and terminal complement pathways). INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients in the experimental arm will receive daily 32,4 mg Zilucoplan subcutaneously and a daily IV infusion of 2g of the antibiotic ceftriaxone for 14 days (or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first) in addition to standard of care. These patients will receive additional prophylactic antibiotics until 14 days after the last Zilucoplan dose: hospitalized patients will receive a daily IV infusion of 2g of ceftriaxone, discharged patients will switch to daily 500 mg of oral ciprofloxacin. The control group will receive standard of care and a daily IV infusion of 2g of ceftriaxone for 1 week (or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first), to control for the effects of antibiotics on the clinical course of COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint is the improvement of oxygenation as measured by mean and/or median change from pre-treatment (day 1) to post-treatment (day 6 and 15 or at discharge, whichever comes first) in PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, P(A-a)O(2) gradient and a/A PO(2) ratio. (PAO(2)= Partial alveolar pressure of oxygen, PaO(2)=partial arterial pressure of oxygen, FiO(2)=Fraction of inspired oxygen). RANDOMISATION: Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (Zilucoplan: control). Randomization will be done using an Interactive Web Response System (REDCap). BLINDING (MASKING): In this open-label trial neither participants, caregivers, nor those assessing the outcomes will be blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total of 81 patients will be enrolled: 54 patients will be randomized to the experimental arm and 27 patients to the control arm.

We included clinical trials and observational studies on singleton gestating women evaluating antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or other treatments, compared between each other or to control (placebo or no treatment), and considering the pregnancy outcome FGR (primary outcome of the NetMA). Secondary efficacy outcomes included preterm birth, placental abruption, and fetal or neonatal death. Safety outcomes included bleeding and thrombocytopenia. Network meta-analyses using a frequentist framework were conducted to derive odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Out of 18780 citations, we included 30 studies on 4326 patients. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), alone or associated with low-dose aspirin (LDA), appeared more efficacious than control in preventing FGR [OR 2.00 (1.27 - 3.16) and 2.67 (1.21 - 5.89) for control vs LMWH and LDA+LMWH, respectively]. No difference between active treatments emerged in terms of FGR prevention, but estimates for treatments other than LMWH+/- LDA were imprecise. Only the confidence in the evidence regarding LMWH vs control was judged as moderate, according to the CINeMA framework. No treatment was associated with an increased risk of bleeding, although estimates were precise enough only for LMWH.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted during October 2020, during the lockdown period imposed by the government for the COVID-19 pandemic. All participants above 18 years of age were allowed to participate in this study. A total of 787 Lebanese adults out of 920 (85.54%) completed an online survey including Arabic versions of the ORTO-R measure of orthorexia, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, the Difficulty in Emotion Regulation Scale, and the Eating Attitudes Test. RESULTS: After making sure that all norms are verified, hierarchical linear regressions were conducted to evaluate the association between disordered eating attitudes (EAT scores) and ON (model 1), and after controlling for difficulties in emotion regulation (DERS score) (model 2). Model 1 accounted for 15.1% of the variance of ON (adj. R(2) = 0.151, F(1, 786) = 140.06, p < 0.001) and showed that higher levels of disordered eating (higher EAT scores) ( = 0.15) were significantly associated with more ON tendencies and behaviors.

Molecular docking studies of the selected peptides revealed one potential peptide KFVPKQPNMIL that demonstrated strong affinity toward significant amino acid residues responsible for the host cell entry (RBD) and multiplication (3CL(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2. The peptide was also assessed for its ability to interact with the critical residues of S1 RBD and 3CL(pro) of other -coronaviruses.

Survival curve analysis showed that patients with low exosomal AHCY expression had significantly longer survival than patients with high exosomal AHCY expression (P = 0.0038). The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve showed that the area under the curve (AUC) value for the mortality prediction ability of serum exosomal AHCY in HBV-LC patients was 0.921, which was higher than the values for the MELD score (AUC 0.815) and Child-Pugh classification (AUC 0.832), with a sensitivity and specificity of 93.41 and 76.00%, respectively. Conclusions: The serum exosomal AHCY level is a novel potential prognostic biomarker in HBV-LC patients, which may be great significance for the prognosis of HBV-LC patients.","output":"Prognostic Value of Serum Exosomal AHCY Expression in Hepatitis B-Induced Liver Cirrhosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Crises lay bare the social fault lines of society. In the United States, race, gender, age, and education have affected vulnerability to COVID-19 infection. Yet, consequences likely extend far beyond morbidity and mortality. Temporarily closing the economy sent shock waves through communities, raising the possibility that social inequities, preexisting and current, have weakened economic resiliency and reinforced disadvantage, especially among groups most devastated by the Great Recession. We address pandemic precarity, or risk for material and financial insecurity, in Indiana, where manufacturing loss is high, metro areas ranked among the hardest hit by the Great Recession nationally, and health indicators stand in the bottom quintile. Using longitudinal data (n = 994) from the Person to Person Health Interview Study, fielded in 2019-2020 and again during Indiana's initial stay-at-home order, we provide a representative, probability-based assessment of adverse economic outcomes of the pandemic. Survey-weighted multivariate regressions, controlling for preexisting inequality, find Black adults over 3 times as likely as Whites to report food insecurity, being laid off, or being unemployed. Residents without a college degree are twice as likely to report food insecurity (compared to some college), while those not completing high school (compared to bachelor's degree) are 4 times as likely to do so. Younger adults and women were also more likely to report economic hardships. Together, the results support contentions of a Matthew Effect, where pandemic precarity disproportionately affects historically disadvantaged groups, widening inequality. Strategically deployed relief efforts and longer-term policy reforms are needed to challenge the perennial and unequal impact of disasters.","output":"Pandemic precarity: COVID-19 is exposing and exacerbating inequalities in the American heartland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 prediction models based on clinical characteristics, routine biochemistry and imaging, have been developed, but little is known on proteomic markers reflecting the molecular pathophysiology of disease progression. Methods: he multicentre (six European study sites) Prospective Validation of a Proteomic Urine Test for Early and Accurate Prognosis of Critical Course Complications in Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection Study (Crit-COV-U) is recruiting consecutive patients (&#8805; 18 years) with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. A urinary proteomic biomarker (COV50) developed by capillary-electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) technology, comprising 50 sequenced peptides and identifying the parental proteins, was evaluated in 228 patients (derivation cohort) with replication in 99 patients (validation cohort). Death and progression along the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Progression Scale were assessed up to 21 days after the initial PCR test. Statistical methods included logistic regression, receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis and comparison of the area under the curve (AUC). Findings: in the derivation cohort, 23 patients died, and 48 developed worse WHO scores. The odds ratios (OR) for death per 1 standard deviation (SD) increment in COV50 were 352 (95% CI, 202-613, p <00001) unadjusted and 273 (125-595, p = 0012) adjusted for sex, age, baseline WHO score, body mass index (BMI) and comorbidities. For WHO scale progression, the corresponding OR were 263 (180-385, p<00001) and 338 (185-617, p<00001), respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) for COV50 as a continuously distributed variable was 080 (072-088) for mortality and 074 (066-081) for worsening WHO score. The optimised COV50 thresholds for mortality and worsening WHO score were 047 and 004 with sensitivity/specificity of 870 (746%) and 771 (639%), respectively. On top of covariates, COV50 improved the AUC, albeit borderline for death, from 078 to 082 (p = 011) and 084 (p = 0052) for mortality and from 068 to 078 (p = 00097) and 075 (p = 0021) for worsening WHO score. The validation cohort findings were confirmatory. Interpretation: this first CRIT-COV-U report proves the concept that urinary proteomic profiling generates biomarkers indicating adverse COVID-19 outcomes, even at an early disease stage, including WHO stages 1-3.

Here, we evaluated the in vitro activities of artesunate (AS) and two ozonides (OZ418 and OZ277) against human &#945;-coronavirus NL63 and ?-coronaviruses OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 in several cell lines. OZ418 had the best selectivity index (SI) in NL63-infected Vero cells and MK2 cells. The overall SI of the tested compounds was cell-type dependent. In OC43-infected human foreskin fibroblasts, AS had the best cell-associated SI, &#8805;17 M, while the SI of OZ418 and OZ277 was &#8805;12 M and &#8805;7 M, respectively. AS did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in either Vero or Calu-3 cells. A comparison of OZ418 and OZ277 activity in SARS-CoV2-infected Calu-3 cells revealed similar EC50 (5.3 M and 11.6 M, respectively), higher than the EC50 of remdesivir (1.0  0.1 M), but the SI of OZ418 was higher than OZ277. A third ozonide, OZ439, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 efficiently in Vero cells, but compared to OZ418 in Calu-3 cells, it showed higher toxicity. Improved inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 was observed when OZ418 was used together with remdesivir. Although the EC50 of ozonides might be clinically achieved in plasma after intravenous administration, sustained virus suppression in tissues will require further considerations, including drug combination.

In addition, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic were also taken into consideration. Methodology: The construction sector in Turkey was analyzed within the framework of the theoretical infrastructure of organizational ecology, i.e. a theoretical perspective that has not received enough attention, except in North America, as an organizational community, while joint-stock, limited, and cooperative companies were also analyzed as organizational populations. Focusing on the period between January 2017 and December 2020, a number of foundings and disbandings of joint-stock, limited and cooperative companies operating in the construction sector, the house price index and house sales statistics, which are thought to affect these rates, were used as data. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic period between March 2020 and December 2020 was included in the analysis as a dummy variable. The ARDL bounds test was used for data analysis. Results: The findings indicate differentiated effects of the house price index, house sales statistics, and the COVID-19 period on both the organizational community of the construction sector and the aforementioned populations.

Online decision support systems (DSS) and self-triage applications have been used in several settings to supplement health authority recommendations to prevent and manage COVID-19. A digital Italian health tech startup, Paginemediche, developed a noncommercial, online DSS with a chat user interface to assist individuals in Italy manage their potential exposure to COVID-19 and interpret their symptoms since early in the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the trend in online DSS sessions with that of COVID-19 cases reported by the national health surveillance system in Italy, from February 2020 to March 2021. METHODS: We compared the number of sessions by users with a COVID-19Cpositive contact and users with COVID-19Ccompatible symptoms with the number of cases reported by the national surveillance system. To calculate the distance between the time series, we used the dynamic time warping algorithm. We applied Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) encoding to the time series in 1-week periods. We calculated the Hamming distance between the SAX strings. We shifted time series of online DSS sessions 1 week ahead. We measured the improvement in Hamming distance to verify the hypothesis that online DSS sessions anticipate the trends in cases reported to the official surveillance system. RESULTS: We analyzed 75,557 sessions in the online DSS; 65,207 were sessions by symptomatic users, while 19,062 were by contacts of individuals with COVID-19. The highest number of online DSS sessions was recorded early in the pandemic. Second and third peaks were observed in October 2020 and March 2021, respectively, preceding the surge in notified COVID-19 cases by approximately 1 week. The distance between sessions by users with COVID-19 contacts and reported cases calculated by dynamic time warping was 61.23; the distance between sessions by symptomatic users was 93.72. The time series of users with a COVID-19 contact was more consistent with the trend in confirmed cases. With the 1-week shift, the Hamming distance between the time series of sessions by users with a COVID-19 contact and reported cases improved from 0.49 to 0.46. We repeated the analysis, restricting the time window to between July 2020 and December 2020. The corresponding Hamming distance was 0.16 before and improved to 0.08 after the time shift. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal trends in the number of online COVID-19 DSS sessions may precede the trend in reported COVID-19 cases through traditional surveillance. The trends in sessions by users with a contact with COVID-19 may better predict reported cases of COVID-19 than sessions by symptomatic users. Data from online DSS may represent a useful supplement to traditional surveillance and support the identification of early warning signals in the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Digital Surveillance Through an Online Decision Support Tool for COVID-19 Over One Year of the Pandemic in Italy: Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To better understand the factors that influence the humoral immune response to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). METHODS: Patients and controls from a large COVID-19 study, with (1) no previous history of COVID-19, (2) negative baseline anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test and (3) SARS-CoV-2 vaccination at least 10 days before serum collection were measured for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Demographic, disease-specific and vaccination-specific data were recorded. RESULTS: Vaccination responses from 84 patients with IMID and 182 controls were analysed. While all controls developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, five patients with IMID failed to develop a response (p=0.003). Moreover, 99.5% of controls but only 90.5% of patients with IMID developed neutralising antibody activity (p=0.0008). Overall responses were delayed and reduced in patients (mean (SD): 6.47 (3.14)) compared with controls (9.36 (1.85); p<0.001). Estimated marginal means (95% CI) adjusted for age, sex and time from first vaccination to sampling were 8.48 (8.12C8.85) for controls and 6.90 (6.45C7.35) for IMIDs.

In this short report we first estimate the underreporting factor for infections from publicly available data released by the Indian Council of Medical Research on reported number of cases and national seroprevalence surveys. We then use a compartmental epidemiologic model to estimate the undetected number of infections and deaths, yielding estimates of the corresponding underreporting factors. We compare the serosurvey based ad hoc estimate of the infection fatality rate (IFR) with the model-based estimate. Since the first and second waves in India are intrinsically different in nature, we carry out this exercise in two periods: the first wave (April 1, 2020CJanuary 31, 2021) and part of the second wave (February 1, 2021CMay 15, 2021). The latest national seroprevalence estimate is from January 2021, and thus only relevant to our wave 1 calculations. RESULTS: Both wave 1 and wave 2 estimates qualitatively show that there is a large degree of covert infections in India, with model-based estimated underreporting factor for infections as 11.11 (95% credible interval (CrI) 10.71C11.47) and for deaths as 3.56 (95% CrI 3.48C3.64) for wave 1. For wave 2, underreporting factor for infections escalate to 26.77 (95% CrI 24.26C28.81) and to 5.77 (95% CrI 5.34C6.15) for deaths. If we rely on only reported deaths, the IFR estimate is 0.13% for wave 1 and 0.03% for part of wave 2. Taking underreporting of deaths into account, the IFR estimate is 0.46% for wave 1 and 0.18% for wave 2 (till May 15). Combining waves 1 and 2, as of May 15, while India reported a total of nearly 25 million cases and 270 thousand deaths, the estimated number of infections and deaths stand at 491 million (36% of the population) and 1.21 million respectively, yielding an estimated (combined) infection fatality rate of 0.25%. There is considerable variation in these estimates across Indian states. Up to date seroprevalence studies and mortality data are needed to validate these model-based estimates.

Although it is already commercialized in capsules, no previous studies report its solid-state structure; thus, information about the correlation with its physicochemical properties is lacking. In parallel, recent studies have led to the improvement of drug administration, including encapsulation in polymeric nanoparticles (NPs). Here, we present CIPs crystal structure determined by PXRD data. We also propose an encapsulation method for CIP in micelles produced from Pluronic P123/F127 and PEO-b-PCL, aiming to improve its solubility, hydrophilicity, and delivery. We determined the NPs physicochemical properties by DLS, SLS, ELS, SAXS and the loaded drug amount by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Micelles showed sizes around 10C20 nm for Pluronic and 35C45 nm for the PEO-b-PCL NPs with slightly negative surface charge and successful CIP loading, especially for the latter; a substantial reduction in -potential may be evidenced. For Pluronic nanoparticles, we scanned different conditions for the CIP loading, and its encapsulation efficiency was reduced while the drug content increased in the nanoprecipitation protocol. We also performed in vitro release experiments; results demonstrate that probe release is driven by Fickian diffusion for the Pluronic NPs and a zero-order model for PEO-b-PCL NPs.","output":"Ciprofibrate-Loaded Nanoparticles Prepared by Nanoprecipitation: Synthesis, Characterization, and Drug Release"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hesitancy towards the COVID-19 vaccine remains high among the US population. Now that the vaccine is available to priority populations, it is critical to convince those that are hesitant to take the vaccine.

Some channels of information are more commonly found to spread misinformation. Given the expansive information environment, we sought to characterize the use of different media channels for COVID-19 vaccine information and determine the relationship between information channel and vaccine acceptance. We used quota sampling of vaccine priority groups [N = 2,650] between December 13 and 23, 2020 and conducted bivariate chi-squared tests and multivariable multinomial logistic regression analyses to determine the relative impact of channels of information on vaccine acceptance. We found traditional channels of information, especially National TV, National newspapers, and local newspapers increased the likelihood of vaccine acceptance. Individuals who received information from traditional media compared to social media or both traditional and social media were most likely to accept the vaccine.

The analysis estimates the marginal impact of each type and level of policy as implemented in concert with other policies. The purpose is to provide policymakers and the general public with an estimate of the relative effectiveness of various COVID-control strategies. We find that a set of widely implemented core policies reduces the spread of virus but not by enough to contain the pandemic except in a few highly compliant jurisdictions. The core policies include the cancellation of public events, restriction of gatherings to fewer than 100 people, recommendation to stay at home, recommended restrictions on internal movement, implementation of a partial international travel ban, and coordination of information campaigns. For the median jurisdiction, these policies reduce growth rate in new infections from an estimated 270% per week to approximately 49% per week, but this impact is insufficient to prevent eventual transmission throughout the population because containment occurs only when a jurisdiction reduces growth in COVID infection to below zero. Most jurisdictions must also implement additional policies, each of which has the potential to reduce weekly COVID growth rate by 10 percentage points or more. The slate of these additional high-impact policies includes targeted or full workplace closings for all but essential workers, stay-at-home requirements, and targeted school closures.","output":"Which COVID policies are most effective?

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for its elimination in target 5.2. To monitor governments' progress towards SDG target 5.2, this study aimed to provide global, regional, and country baseline estimates of physical or sexual, or both, violence against women by male intimate partners. METHODS: This study developed global, regional, and country estimates, based on data from the WHO Global Database on Prevalence of Violence Against Women. These data were identified through a systematic literature review searching MEDLINE, Global Health, Embase, Social Policy, and Web of Science, and comprehensive searches of national statistics and other websites. A country consultation process identified additional studies. Included studies were conducted between 2000 and 2018, representative at the national or sub-national level, included women aged 15 years or older, and used act-based measures of physical or sexual, or both, intimate partner violence. Non-population-based data, including administrative data, studies not generalisable to the whole population, studies with outcomes that only provided the combined prevalence of physical or sexual, or both, intimate partner violence with other forms of violence, and studies with insufficient data to allow extrapolation or imputation were excluded. We developed a Bayesian multilevel model to jointly estimate lifetime and past year intimate partner violence by age, year, and country. This framework adjusted for heterogeneous age groups and differences in outcome definition, and weighted surveys depending on whether they were nationally or sub-nationally representative. This study is registered with PROSPERO (number CRD42017054100). FINDINGS: The database comprises 366 eligible studies, capturing the responses of 2 million women. Data were obtained from 161 countries and areas, covering 90% of the global population of women and girls (15 years or older). Globally, 27% (uncertainty interval [UI] 23C31%) of ever-partnered women aged 15C49 years are estimated to have experienced physical or sexual, or both, intimate partner violence in their lifetime, with 13% (10C16%) experiencing it in the past year before they were surveyed. This violence starts early, affecting adolescent girls and young women, with 24% (UI 21C28%) of women aged 15C19 years and 26% (23C30%) of women aged 19C24 years having already experienced this violence at least once since the age of 15 years. Regional variations exist, with low-income countries reporting higher lifetime and, even more pronouncedly, higher past year prevalence compared with high-income countries. INTERPRETATION: These findings show that intimate partner violence against women was already highly prevalent across the globe before the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments are not on track to meet the SDG targets on the elimination of violence against women and girls, despite robust evidence that intimate partner violence can be prevented. There is an urgent need to invest in effective multisectoral interventions, strengthen the public health response to intimate partner violence, and ensure it is addressed in post-COVID-19 reconstruction efforts.

On D7, 9 contact pigs (principal virus group (PG)), were selected, moved to a separate room and commingled with one sentinel pig (S1). This process was repeated weekly with S2, S3 and S4. The PG was PEDV-positive by PCR from D3-11, with some pigs intermittently positive to D42. Pigs S1 and S2 were PEDV-positive within 24 hours of commingling. Antibodies were detected in all PG by D21 and by 7 days post-contact in S1 and S2. Pigs S3 and S4 were PCR and antibody negative following commingling. To evaluate protective immunity, 5 na?ve pigs (N) and the PG were challenged (N/C, PG/C) with homologous virus on D49. All N/C pigs were PEDV PCR-positive by D52 with detection out to D62 in 3/5 N/C pigs. All PG/C pigs were PEDV PCR-negative post-challenge. By D63, all N/C seroconverted. Although PEDV RNA was demonstrated in pigs after primary infection until D42, infectious PEDV capable of horizontal transmission to na?ve pigs was only shed 14C16 days after infection to age-matched pigs.

The narrowing of cranial vessels may be asymptomatic or produce neurological symptoms. Very often nonspecific signs of ischemia occur, such as headache, vertigo, or dizziness. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the effect of carotid and vertebral arteries stenosis on the function of the equilibrium organ on the basis of electronystagmography and posturography. MATERIAL: The study was conducted in 63 patients, presenting with carotid and vertebral arteries stenosis. The control group consisted of 32 healthy persons. METHODS: All patients were subjected to precise audiological and otoneurological diagnostic examinations. Prior to being qualified for the study, patients were subjected to the assessment of arteries by means of Doppler ultrasonography. The vestibular organ was assessed by means of physical examination as well as by electronystagmography and posturography testing. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed statistically significant reduction in the results of the equilibrium organ assessments in patients with carotid and vertebral arteries sclerosis as compared to the control group.

The spin Zeeman effect on the d electrons of the V ions dissociates the dimers in the insulating phase, resulting in the delocalisation of electrons. Because the Mott-Hubbard gap essentially does not depend on the spin degree of freedom, the structural instability is likely to be the more essential driving force behind the MI transition.","output":"Magnetic-field-induced insulator-metal transition in W-doped VO2 at 500 T"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Community water fluoridation (CWF) is the most effective and equitable approach to preventing dental caries (tooth decay).

DESIGN: Time series study of high income countries. SETTING: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, England and Wales, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Scotland, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United States. PARTICIPANTS: Mortality data from the Short-term Mortality Fluctuations data series of the Human Mortality Database for 2016-20, harmonised and disaggregated by age and sex. INTERVENTIONS: Covid-19 pandemic and associated policy measures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weekly excess deaths (observed deaths versus expected deaths predicted by model) in 2020, by sex and age (0-14, 15-64, 65-74, 75-84, and 85 years), estimated using an over-dispersed Poisson regression model that accounts for temporal trends and seasonal variability in mortality. RESULTS: An estimated 979 000 (95% confidence interval 954 000 to 1 001 000) excess deaths occurred in 2020 in the 29 high income countries analysed. All countries had excess deaths in 2020, except New Zealand, Norway, and Denmark. The five countries with the highest absolute number of excess deaths were the US (458 000, 454 000 to 461 000), Italy (89 100, 87 500 to 90 700), England and Wales (85 400, 83 900 to 86 800), Spain (84 100, 82 800 to 85 300), and Poland (60 100, 58 800 to 61 300). New Zealand had lower overall mortality than expected (?2500, ?2900 to ?2100). In many countries, the estimated number of excess deaths substantially exceeded the number of reported deaths from covid-19. The highest excess death rates (per 100 000) in men were in Lithuania (285, 259 to 311), Poland (191, 184 to 197), Spain (179, 174 to 184), Hungary (174, 161 to 188), and Italy (168, 163 to 173); the highest rates in women were in Lithuania (210, 185 to 234), Spain (180, 175 to 185), Hungary (169, 156 to 182), Slovenia (158, 132 to 184), and Belgium (151, 141 to 162). Little evidence was found of subsequent compensatory reductions following excess mortality. CONCLUSION: Approximately one million excess deaths occurred in 2020 in these 29 high income countries. Age standardised excess death rates were higher in men than women in almost all countries. Excess deaths substantially exceeded reported deaths from covid-19 in many countries, indicating that determining the full impact of the pandemic on mortality requires assessment of excess deaths. Many countries had lower deaths than expected in children <15 years.

This phenomenon is now termed as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). Pathophysiology of VITT is similar to that of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and associated with platelet-activating antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4). Therefore, current guidelines suggest non-heparin anticoagulants to treat VITT patients. In this study, we investigated the interactions of heparin, danaparoid, fondaparinux and argatroban with VITT-Ab/PF4 complexes using ex vivo model for thrombus formation as well as in vitro assays to analyze antibody binding and platelet activation. We found that IgGs from VITT patients induce increased adherent platelets/thrombus formation in comparison to IgGs from healthy controls. In this ex vivo flow-based model, the procoagulant activity of VITT IgGs was effectively inhibited with danaparoid, argatroban but also by heparin. Interestingly, heparin and danaparoid not only inhibited IgG binding to PF4 but were also able to effectively dissociate the preformed PF4/IgG complexes. Fondaparinux reduced the in vitro generation of procoagulant platelets and thrombus formation, however it did not affect platelet aggregation. In contrast, argatroban showed no effect on procoagulant platelets and aggregation, but significantly inhibited VITT-mediated thrombus formation. Taken together, our data indicate that negatively charged anticoagulants can disrupt VITT-Ab/PF4 interactions, which might serve as an approach to reduce antibody-mediated complications in VITT. Our results should be confirmed, however, in a clinical setting before a recommendation regarding the selection of anticoagulants in VITT patients could be made.","output":"The interaction between anti-PF4 antibodies and anticoagulants in vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this retrospective observational case series, we aimed to evaluate the use of real-time trans-thoracic echocardiography in accurate positioning of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cannulas.

Markers of inflammation such as cytokines, and amyloidogenic aggregates, so-called nanoplaques, are both promising biomarker candidates for AD. We have previously shown that there is a relationship between the levels of nanoplaques and cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid, but it is unknown whether this association extends to serum. OBJECTIVE: Investigate in a naturalistic memory clinic cohort whether the associations between nanoplaques and cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid extends to serum. METHODS: We collected serum from 49 patients assessed for cognitive complaints at the Oslo University Hospital Memory Clinic (15 with clinical AD). We assessed the levels of serum nanoplaques with the novel Thioflavin-T fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (ThT-FCS) assay. Serum levels of nine cytokines (eotaxin-1, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], interleukin [IL]-6, IL-7, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), gamma induced protein 10 (IP-10), macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP]-1, and MIP-1) were quantified with a multiplex assay and read on a Luminex IS 200 instrument. RESULTS: Serum nanoplaques were not increased in clinical AD patients compared to non-AD memory clinic patients and nanoplaques were not associated with any cytokines. The cytokines IL-8 and G-CSF were increased in patients with clinical AD compared to non-AD patients. CONCLUSION: In this small pilot study, serum nanoplaques were not associated with serum cytokines.

A scoping review of ML prediction models in paediatric CRDs was undertaken using the PRISMA extension scoping review guidelines. From 1209 results, 25 articles published between 2013 and 2021 were evaluated for features of a good clinical prediction model using the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) guidelines. Most of the studies were in asthma (80%), with few in cystic fibrosis (12%), bronchiolitis (4%) and childhood wheeze (4%). There were inconsistencies in model reporting and studies were limited by a lack of validation, and absence of equations or code for replication. Clinician involvement during ML model development is essential and diversity, equity and inclusion should be assessed at each step of the ML pipeline to ensure algorithms do not promote or amplify health disparities among marginalised groups. As ML prediction studies become more frequent, it is important that models are rigorously developed using published guidelines and take account of regulatory frameworks which depend on model complexity, patient safety, accountability and liability.","output":"Implementation of prognostic machine learning algorithms in paediatric chronic respiratory conditions: a scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study of recurrent epidemic outbreaks has been attracting great attention for decades, but its underlying mechanism is still under debate. Based on a large number of real data from different cities, we find that besides the seasonal periodic outbreaks of influenza, there are also non-periodic outbreaks, i.e. non-seasonal or non-annual behaviors. To understand how the non-periodicity shows up, we present a network model of SIRS epidemic with both time-dependent infection rate and a small possibility of persistent epidemic seeds, representing the influences from the larger annual variation of environment and the infection generated spontaneously in nature, respectively. Our numerical simulations reveal that the model can reproduce the non-periodic outbreaks of recurrent epidemics with the main features of real influenza data. Further, we find that the recurrent outbreaks of epidemic depend not only on the infection rate but also on the density of susceptible agents, indicating that they are both the necessary conditions for the recurrent epidemic patterns with non-periodicity. A theoretical analysis based on Markov dynamics is presented to explain the numerical results.

All included studies were analysed and the information extracted included author, title of study, year of publication, type of study, journal of publication, and main findings regarding post PP implantation fungal infections. RESULTS Nine relevant studies were included in this review, comprising retrospective single-centre studies and retrospective multicentre studies ranging from 2017 to 2020. Fungal infections were found responsible for 11.1% of all PP infections, with a greater risk in patients with diabetes, obesity, and from warmer climates. Current American Urological Association (AUA) and European Association of Urology (EAU) prophylaxis guidelines do not incorporate the use of antifungals. Trials of antifungal prophylaxis regimes combined with antibiotic prophylaxis have demonstrated a reduction in PP fungal infections.

Although outreach is a required part of any trauma system, very little is published on the resources required for a successful program. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive roadmap of the required components to achieve a successful trauma outreach program. METHODS This project describes the development and implementation of an educational outreach program from January 2016 to December 2020 that has grown from 27 facilities within one western state to 49 facilities across 14 different states. Program components measured include the number and attendance of trauma courses offered, including the Trauma Nursing Core Course (TNCC), Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), Rural Trauma Team Development Course (RTTDC), the number of trauma meetings and webinars provided, total trauma center designation and reviews, total states reached, and total trauma center collaborations. RESULTS From 2016 to 2020, the program more than doubled the number of TNCC and ATLS courses, maintained the number of RTTDC offered, and observed attendance rate increases of 33% and 11% for TNCC and ATLS courses, respectively. Outreach leadership attended 44 trauma meetings and educational webinars using virtual platform technology, nearly doubling the trauma center outreach with expansion across 14 states resulting in important changes in practice. CONCLUSION With administrative support, effective leadership, and technology, outreach programs can serve as important resources for statewide trauma systems.","output":"An Educational Outreach Program: A Trauma System's 5-Year Experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The rapid development of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) into a pandemic required people to quickly acquire, evaluate, and apply novel complex health-related information about the virus and transmission risks. This study examined the possible interplay between neurocognition and health literacy in the early uptake and use of COVID-19 public health information. Method: Data were collected between April 23 and May 21, 2020, a period during which 42 out of 50 states were under a stay-at-home order. Participants were 217 healthy adults who completed a telephone-based battery that included standard tests of neurocognition, health literacy, verbal IQ, personality, and anxiety. Participants also completed measures of COVID-19 information-seeking skills, knowledge, prevention intentions, and prevention behaviors. Results: A series of hierarchical multiple regressions with data-driven covariates showed that neurocognition (viz, episodic verbal memory and executive functions) was independently related to COVID-19 knowledge (e.g., symptoms, risks) at a medium effect size, but not to information-seeking skills, prevention intentions, or prevention behaviors. Health literacy was independently related to all measured aspects of COVID-19 health information and did not interact with neurocognition in any COVID-19 health domain. Conclusions: Individual differences in neurocognition and health literacy played independent and meaningful roles in the initial acquisition of knowledge related to COVID-19, which is a novel human health condition. Future studies might examine whether neurocognitive supports (e.g., spaced retrieval practice, elaboration) can improve COVID-19-related knowledge and health behaviors in vulnerable populations.","output":"How Did Individual Differences in Neurocognition and Health Literacy Influence the Initial Uptake and Use of Health-related Information about COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: The main purpose of this study is to investigate on the experience of nurses working in the Covid-19 area focusing on their roles perception. In particular, we explored the nurses perception of job satisfaction in relation to the images sent back by public opinion through the mass media and social communication channels. During the first wave of Covid-19 nurses have acquired media visibility, but their feeling is represented more by the discomfort of finding themselves suddenly glorified in the face of a lack of professional, social, and economic recognition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Mix-Method methodology and convenience sampling was adopted, on the population of professionals and students in post-graduate specializations, belonging to the Department of Medicine and Surgery of the University of Parma, and by nurses from the ASST-Bergamo Est, Lombardia Italy, who worked in the Covid emergency during the first WAVE: of the pandemic, from February 2020 to May 2020. In the quantitative phase Stamms Professional Quality of Life Scale - ProQOL was administered to 89 respondents through a Google Form, In the qualitative phase, 3 Focus Groups were conducted on a total of 17 students. RESULTS: At the ProQOL questionnaire, a moderate score was found in the Compassion Satisfaction scale (CF = 38.28) and in the Secondary Traumatic Stress subscale (STS-24.33), while low values emerged in the Burnout subscale (BO = 16.02). Five specific topics emerged from the focus groups: Professional collaboration, Job satisfaction, Nurses personal skills, Failure to protect the public image and the nursing profession.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Beijing, China, in January 2011. A survey was conducted in which information was collected using a standardized questionnaire. A comprehensive evaluation index system of health literacy related to influenza was built to evaluate the level of health literacy regarding influenza prevention and control among residents in Beijing. RESULTS: Thirteen thousand and fifty-three valid questionnaires were received. The average score for the sum of knowledge, behavior, and skill was 14.12  3.22, and the mean scores for knowledge, behavior, and skill were 4.65  1.20, 7.25  1.94, and 2.21  1.31, respectively. The qualified proportions of these three sections were 23.7%, 11.9%, and 43.4%, respectively, and the total proportion with a qualified level was 6.7%. There were significant differences in health literacy level related to influenza among the different gender, age, educational level, occupational status, and location groups (p < 0.05). There was a significant association between knowledge and behavior (r = 0.084, p < 0.001), and knowledge and skill (r = 0.102, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The health literacy level remains low among the general population in Beijing and the extent of relativities in knowledge, behavior, and skill about influenza was found to be weak. Therefore, improvements are needed in terms of certain aspects, particularly for the elderly and the population of rural districts.

The aim of our study is to analyse the impact on emergency medicine attendance after the national lockdown, as well as the clinical presentation and the management of patients with suspected COVID-19 in the Paediatric Emergency Department. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study included children and adolescents under the age of 18, attended in our Paediatric Emergency Department during the period March 14 to April 17, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1,666 patients were attended during the study period, 65.4% less than in the same period of 2019. Just over half (51.2%) were males, and mean age was 5.4 years. In triage, 39.9% were high priority levels, 6.5% more than 2019. Most frequent reasons for consultation at the Paediatric Emergency Department were fever (26.5%), respiratory symptoms (16.1%), and trauma (15.2%). A total of 218 patients (13%) received a diagnosis of possible COVID-19, with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in 18.4%, and 23.8% (52/218) were hospitalised. At discharge, 44% (96/218) were diagnosed with lower, and 33.9% (74/218) with upper respiratory infection.

This study aimed to evaluate the association between smoking and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: A matched case-control study was conducted using a large nationwide database. The case group included patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the control group was randomly sampled from the general Korean population in the National Health Insurance Service database by matching sex, age, and region of residence. Conditional logistic regression models were used to investigate whether the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 was affected by smoking status. RESULTS: A total of 4,167 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 20,937 matched controls were enrolled. The proportion of ex-smokers and current smokers was 26.6% of the total participants. In multivariate analysis, smoking was not associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratio [OR] = 0.56, confidence interval [CI] = 0.50-0.62). When ex-smokers and current smokers were analysed separately, similar results were obtained (current smoker OR = 0.33, CI = 0.28-0.38; ex-smoker OR = 0.81, CI = 0.72-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that smoking may not be associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Smoking tends to lower the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, these findings should be interpreted with caution.

In addition to the overarching narratives, the article also investigates more specifically the most commonly used metaphors prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of the article is to ascertain which lessons we can learn in terms of successes and failures of narrative foresight in action', so as to be able to utilise this knowledge for future global problems. Finally, the article argues that many current metaphors and narratives are linked to 'futures fallacies' - detrimental thinking patterns about the future.

This research understands respondents perspectives on factors contributing to the lower vaccination uptake in Gujarat, India. Forty-four semi-structured interviews were conducted through convenience sampling representing different demographic backgrounds. Factors influencing vaccine adoption included religious leadership, political leadership and the government, and fear of side effects, especially among children and those with co-morbidities, resulting primarily from fake news and misinformation circulated through social media. Compared with nine countries from across the world, the study found similarities to vaccine hesitancy from misinformation and the fear of side effects among children. In contrast, the role of government and the influence of religious and political leaders was considered positive. The study recommends strategies to overcome peoples apprehensions about the adoption of vaccination. These include offering incentives, providing positive peer-to-peer communication, recruiting influencers such as religious and community leaders and early adopters such as the elderly population to endorse vaccination, targeting youth through social media, and reaching rural sections by involving NGOs and social service groups.","output":"Understanding Factors to COVID-19 Vaccine Adoption in Gujarat, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) took the world by surprise.

The purpose was to gain perceptions into best strategies for online instruction for those content areas that promoted course objective competency with an emphasis on learner engagement. Fifty\\\\four DPT students were surveyed following the completion of an 8\\\\week summer semester Foundational Sciences course at the University of the Incarnate Word, School of Physical Therapy, DPT program. The 7\\\\question anonymous survey addressed content delivered both synchronously (live) and asynchronously (prerecorded or self\\\\regulated) with regard to time, synchronous class size and format (large group vs. breakout room), use of asynchronous voiceovers and video tutorials, and rating of specific activities promoting engagement. Open feedback questions addressed virtual course elements that students identified as most and least supportive of content mastery. Fifty responses were collected (93% response rate). Findings from the survey indicated a preference for synchronous sessions of 1.5 hr (94%) in length with the combination of both large and small group (breakout room) sessions (90%). Sixty percent of respondents preferred having a mix of synchronous classes with the entire cohort of 54 learners and smaller synchronous sessions with half the cohort. While 50% indicated a preference for more asynchronous PowerPoint voiceovers, 46% indicated that they preferred not having asynchronous voiceovers that aligned with every synchronous class. Activities promoting engagement received mixed ratings overall using a 5\\\\point Likert scale ranging from poor to excellent. Activities that received majority satisfactory ratings included Poll Everywhere (44%), Zoom annotation tool (40%), Zoom breakout room activities (44%) and StudyMate flashcards (56%).

When governments around the world imposed lockdown measures to curb the spread of COVID\\\\19, advocates in the domestic and family violence (DFV) sector recognised that these measures were likely to result in increases in violence against women, particularly intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV can take many forms, including physical, emotional, psychological, financial, coercive controlling behaviours, surveillance and isolation tactics. Lockdown conditions provide fertile ground for the exercise of coercive control by encouraging people to stay at home, limiting social interactions to household members, reducing mobility and enabling perpetrators to closely monitor their partner's movements. However, media reports and awareness of IPV are generally dominated by a focus on physical violence and lethality, which are easily defined and measured. By contrast, coercive control as a concept is difficult to operationalise, measure and action in law, policy and frontline interventions.

Sera from hospitalized COVID-19 patients suffering or not suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were comparatively analyzed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and pseudotype-based neutralization assays to quantify their neutralizing capacity. The two neutralization assays showed comparable data. In case of the non-ARDS sera, there was a distinct correlation between the data from the neutralization assays on the one hand, and enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA), as well as biophysical analyses, on the other hand. As such, surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based assays for quantification of binding antibodies or analysis of the stability of the antigenCantibody interaction and inhibition of syncytium formation, determined by cell fusion assays, were performed. In the case of ARDS sera, which are characterized by a significantly higher fraction of RBD-binding IgA antibodies, there is a clear correlation between the neutralization assays and the ELISA data. In contrast to this, a less clear correlation between the biophysical analyses on the one hand and ELISAs and neutralization assays on the other hand was observed, which might be explained by the heterogeneity of the antibodies. To conclude, for less complex immune seraas in cases of non-ARDS seracombinations of titer quantification by ELISA with inhibition of syncytium formation, SPR-based analysis of antibody binding, determination of the stability of the antigenCantibody complex, and competition of the RBD-ACE2 binding represent alternatives to the classic PRNT for analysis of the neutralizing potential of SARS-CoV-2-specific sera, without the requirement for a BSL3 facility.","output":"Comparative Investigation of Methods for Analysis of SARS-CoV-2-Spike-Specific Antisera"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic tested many fundamental connections between science and society.

Since then, at least 33 other countries have been affected and there is a possibility of a global outbreak. A tremendous amount of effort has been made to understand its transmission dynamics; however, the temporal and spatial transmission heterogeneity and changing epidemiology have been mostly ignored. The epidemic mechanism of COVID-19 remains largely unclear. Methods: Epidemiological data on COVID-19 in China and daily population movement data from Wuhan to other cities were obtained and analyzed. To describe the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 at different spatio-temporal scales, we used a three-stage continuous-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) meta-population model based on the characteristics and transmission dynamics of each stage: 1) local epidemic from December 1, 2019 to January 9, 2020; 2) long-distance spread due to the Spring Festival travel rush from January 10 to 22, 2020; and 3) intra-provincial transmission from January 23, 2020 when travel restrictions were imposed. Together with the basic reproduction number (R_0) for mathematical modelling, we also considered the variation in infectivity and introduced the controlled reproduction number (R_c) by assuming that exposed individuals to be infectious; we then simulated the future spread of COVID across Wuhan and all the provinces in mainland China. In addition, we built a novel source tracing algorithm to infer the initial exposed number of individuals in Wuhan on January 10, 2020, to estimate the number of infections early during this epidemic. Findings: The spatial patterns of disease spread were heterogeneous. The estimated controlled reproduction number (R_c) in the neighboring provinces of Hubei province were relatively large, and the nationwide reproduction number (except for Hubei) ranged from 0.98 to 2.74 with an average of 1.79 (95% CI 1.77-1.80). Infectivity was significantly greater for exposed than infectious individuals, and exposed individuals were predicted to have become the major source of infection after January 23. For the epidemic process, most provinces reached their epidemic peak before February 10, 2020. It is expected that the maximum number of infections will be approached by the end of March. The final infectious size is estimated to be about 58,000 for Wuhan, 20,800 for the rest of Hubei province, and 17,000 for the other provinces in mainland China. Moreover, the estimated number of the exposed individuals is much greater than the officially reported number of infectious individuals in Wuhan on January 10, 2020. Interpretation: The transmission dynamics of COVID-19 have been changing over time and were heterogeneous across regions. There was a substantial underestimation of the number of exposed individuals in Wuhan early in the epidemic, and the Spring Festival travel rush played an important role in enhancing and accelerating the spread of COVID-19. However, China's unprecedented large-scale travel restrictions quickly reduced R_c. The next challenge for the control of COVID-19 will be the second great population movement brought by removing these travel restrictions.","output":"Changing transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in China: a nationwide population-based piecewise mathematical modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To measure the migration of oral Ring-Adair-Elwyn (RAE) preformed tracheal tubes during neck extension compared with the neutral neck position, and to assess the correlation between changes in the thyromental distance (TMD) during changes in neck position and tracheal tube migration.

OBJECTIVE To identify patients with muscle symptoms confirmed by statin rechallenge and compare lipid-lowering efficacy for 2 nonstatin therapies, ezetimibe and evolocumab. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Two-stage randomized clinical trial including 511 adult patients with uncontrolled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and history of intolerance to 2 or more statins enrolled in 2013 and 2014 globally. Phase A used a 24-week crossover procedure with atorvastatin or placebo to identify patients having symptoms only with atorvastatin but not placebo. In phase B, after a 2-week washout, patients were randomized to ezetimibe or evolocumab for 24 weeks. INTERVENTIONS Phase A: atorvastatin (20 mg) vs placebo. Phase B: randomization 2:1 to subcutaneous evolocumab (420 mg monthly) or oral ezetimibe (10 mg daily). MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES Coprimary end points were the mean percent change in LDL-C level from baseline to the mean of weeks 22 and 24 levels and from baseline to week 24 levels. RESULTS Of the 491 patients who entered phase A (mean age, 60.7 [SD, 10.2] years; 246 women [50.1%]; 170 with coronary heart disease [34.6%]; entry mean LDL-C level, 212.3 [SD, 67.9] mg/dL), muscle symptoms occurred in 209 of 491 (42.6%) while taking atorvastatin but not while taking placebo.

For the mean of weeks 22 and 24, LDL-C level with ezetimibe was 183.0 mg/dL; mean percent LDL-C change, -16.7% (95% CI, -20.5% to -12.9%), absolute change, -31.0 mg/dL and with evolocumab was 103.6 mg/dL; mean percent change, -54.5% (95% CI, -57.2% to -51.8%); absolute change, -106.8 mg/dL (P < .001). LDL-C level at week 24 with ezetimibe was 181.5 mg/dL; mean percent change, -16.7% (95% CI, -20.8% to -12.5%); absolute change, -31.2 mg/dL and with evolocumab was 104.1 mg/dL; mean percent change, -52.8% (95% CI, -55.8% to -49.8%); absolute change, -102.9 mg/dL (P < .001). For the mean of weeks 22 and 24, between-group difference in LDL-C was -37.8%; absolute difference, -75.8 mg/dL. For week 24, between-group difference in LDL-C was -36.1%; absolute difference, -71.7 mg/dL. Muscle symptoms were reported in 28.8% of ezetimibe-treated patients and 20.7% of evolocumab-treated patients (log-rank P = .17). Active study drug was stopped for muscle symptoms in 5 of 73 ezetimibe-treated patients (6.8%) and 1 of 145 evolocumab-treated patients (0.7%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with statin intolerance related to muscle-related adverse effects, the use of evolocumab compared with ezetimibe resulted in a significantly greater reduction in LDL-C levels after 24 weeks.

Elucidating underlying disease pathogenesis requires a mechanistic molecular understanding of AEC differentiation. Previous studies have focused on changes of individual transcription factors, and to date no study has comprehensively characterized the dynamic, global epigenomic alterations that facilitate this critical differentiation process in humans. RESULTS: We comprehensively profiled the epigenomic states of human AECs during type 2 to type 1-like cell differentiation, including the methylome and chromatin functional domains, and integrated this with transcriptome-wide RNA expression data. Enhancer regions were drastically altered during AEC differentiation. Transcription factor binding analysis within enhancer regions revealed diverse interactive networks with enrichment for many transcription factors, including NKX2C1 and FOXA family members, as well as transcription factors with less well characterized roles in AEC differentiation, such as members of the MEF2, TEAD, and AP1 families. Additionally, associations among transcription factors changed during differentiation, implicating a complex network of heterotrimeric complex switching in driving differentiation. Integration of AEC enhancer states with the catalog of enhancer elements in the Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium and Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) revealed that AECs have similar epigenomic structures to other profiled epithelial cell types, including human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs), with NKX2C1 serving as a distinguishing feature of distal lung differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancer regions are hotspots of epigenomic alteration that regulate AEC differentiation. Furthermore, the differentiation process is regulated by dynamic networks of transcription factors acting in concert, rather than individually. These findings provide a roadmap for understanding the relationship between disruption of the epigenetic state during AEC differentiation and development of lung diseases that may be therapeutically amenable.

RECENT FINDINGS Human metapneumovirus has now been detected worldwide, causing severe respiratory tract illnesses primarily in very young, elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Animal models and reverse genetic techniques were designed for human metapneumovirus, and the first vaccine candidates have been developed. Considerable genetic and antigenic diversity was observed for human metapneumovirus, but the implication of this diversity for vaccine development and virus epidemiology requires further study. Two previously unrecognized human coronaviruses were discovered in 2004 in The Netherlands and Hong Kong. Their clinical impact and epidemiology are largely unknown and warrant further investigation. Several influenza A virus subtypes were transmitted from birds to humans, and these viruses continue to constitute a pandemic threat. The clinical symptoms associated with these zoonotic transmissions range from mild respiratory illnesses and conjunctivitis to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, sometimes resulting in death. More basic research into virus ecology and evolution and development of effective vaccines and antiviral strategies are required to limit the impact of influenza A virus zoonoses and the threat of an influenza pandemic.

Moreover, existing data are often restricted on reporting levels of single kinins, thus neglecting the distinct effects of active kinins on bradykinin (BK) receptors considering diverse metabolic pathways. A well-characterized and comprehensively evaluated healthy cohort is imperative for a better understanding of the biological variability of kinin profiles to enable reliable differentiation concerning disease-specific kinin profiles. METHODS: To study biological levels and variability of kinin profiles comprehensively, 28 healthy adult volunteers were enrolled. Nasal lavage fluid and plasma were sampled in customized protease inhibitor prespiked tubes using standardized protocols, proven to limit inter-day and interindividual variability significantly. Nine kinins were quantitatively assessed using validated LCCMS/MS platforms: kallidin (KD), Hyp(4)-KD, KD(1-9), BK, Hyp(3)-BK, BK(1-8), BK(1-7), BK(1-5), and BK(2-9). Kinin concentrations in nasal epithelial lining fluid were estimated by correlation using urea. RESULTS: Circulating plasma kinin levels were confirmed in the very low picomolar range with levels below 4.2 pM for BK and even lower levels for the other kinins. Endogenous kinin levels in nasal epithelial lining fluids were substantially higher, including median levels of 80.0 pM for KD and 139.1 pM for BK. Hydroxylated BK levels were higher than mean BK concentrations (Hyp(3)-BK/BK = 1.6), but hydroxylated KD levels were substantially lower than KD (Hyp(4)-KD/KD = 0.37). No gender-specific differences on endogenous kinin levels were found. CONCLUSIONS: This well-characterized healthy cohort enables investigation of the potential of kinins as biomarkers and would provide a valid control group to study alterations of kinin profiles in diseases, such as angioedema, sepsis, stroke, Alzheimers disease, and COVID-19.","output":"Mass spectrometric study of variation in kinin peptide profiles in nasal fluids and plasma of adult healthy individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role as antigen-presenting cells in the antiviral immune response. Here we show that Hantaan virus (HTNV), which belongs to the Bunyaviridae family (genus Hantavirus) and causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, productively infects human DCs in vitro. In the course of HTNV infection, DCs did not show any cytopathic effect and viral replication did not induce cell lysis or apoptosis. Furthermore, HTNV did not affect apoptosis-inducing signals that are important for the homeostatic control of mature DCs. In contrast to immunosuppressive viruses, e.g., human cytomegalovirus, HTNV activated immature DCs, resulting in upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC), costimulatory, and adhesion molecules. Intriguingly, strong upregulation of MHC class I molecules and an increased intercellular cell adhesion molecule type 1 expression was also detected on HTNV-infected endothelial cells. In addition, antigen uptake by HTNV-infected DCs was reduced, another characteristic feature of DC maturation. Consistent with these findings, we observed that HTNV-infected DCs stimulated T cells as efficiently as did mature DCs.

To do this, the authors developed a research model from the switch ing costs (defined as the time and effort students have been put to change from one learning platform to another) and quality-related perspectives. In addition, gender differences are examined and identified by testing the proposed research model on male and female students, respectively. Background The recent worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 has changed many aspects of people's lives, including higher education. To better protect students and faculty, many universities have moved most of their classes online. Such a sudden change could make significant impacts on student learning. Thus, this study aims to empirically examine factors that can influence student learning in remote classes during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to investigate potential gender differences in such a context. Methodology The survey method is used in this study. The survey invitation was sent to students in multiple classes that had switched from in-person learning to remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was distributed in the online format. In total, 428 students completed the survey, with 202 being males and 226 being females. Contribution This study contributes to the current literature on student learning during emergency situations such as COVID-19 by developing a research model to systematically investigate potential factors that could influence their perceptions of academic performance and learning enjoyment. A second contribution is the integration of theoretical perspectives of switching costs and three types of quality-related constructs in the proposed research model. In addition, the authors also investigate gender differences based on the proposed research model, and some interesting differences have been found and reported in this study. Findings Data analysis indicates that perceived value has a significant impact on perceived academic performance for female but not male students. In addition, male students find information quality to be a significant factor in perceived academic performance, but not perceived learning enjoyment;on the contrary, their female counterparts find it to be significant in influencing perceived learning enjoyment, but not perceived academic performance. Also, female students perceive system quality to be influential on their learning enjoyment and support service quality to be influential on their academic performance, but no such significant perceptions are found among male students. Recommendations for Practitioners The results of this study could help bring some insights to educators on teaching remote classes during the COVID-19 pandemic (or potentially in other similar emergency situations). For example, when moving classes to the remote platform because of an emergency situation, in order to make sure a smooth transition and achieve a higher rate of student learning success, educators, as well as the institution, need to focus on reducing the costs and, in the meanwhile, increasing the benefits associated with such a change from the students' perspective. In addition, educators may need to keep in mind the gender differences identified in this study, which may help them better understand the learning needs of different gender groups. Recommendation for Researchers Researchers could validate and apply the proposed research model on students from different types of institutions (such as public universities vs. private universities) and students at different levels (such as undergraduate vs. graduate students). It could also be valuable to apply and extend the current model on students from other nations who have different cultural backgrounds. Impact on Society Understanding influential factors on student learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as gender differences in this context, could help educators better adjust their teaching of remote classes in such an emergency situation, thus meeting the learning needs of students in both gender groups. Future Research Future research could further validate the research model proposed in this study by applying it to students in other institutions and other nations. Also, in addition to perceived academic performance and learning enjoyment, future research may expand the current model or create new models on other student learning-related dependent variables.","output":"Examining Gender Differences in Student Learning during the Covid-19 Pandemic: a Model from the Switching Costs and Quality- Related Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The reference standard for the molecular diagnostic testing for COVID-19 is the use of nasopharyngeal or combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs.

We examined the mechanism of apoptosis induction by CIV. High CIV doses (CIV(XS); 400 g/ml), UV-irradiated virus (CIV(UV); 10 g/ml) and CVPE (CIV protein extract; 10 g/ml) induced apoptosis in 60% of treated Choristoneura fumiferana (IPRI-CF-124T) cells. Normal doses of infectious CIV (10 g/ml) induced apoptosis in only 10% of C. fumiferana (CF) cells. Apoptosis was inhibited by Z-IETD-FMK, an apical caspase inhibitor, indicating that CIV-induced apoptosis requires caspase activity. The putative caspase in CF cells was designated Cf-caspase-i. CIV(UV) or CVPE enhanced Cf-caspase-i activity by 80% at 24 h relative to mock-treated cells. Since the MAP kinase pathway induces or inhibits apoptosis depending on the context, we used JNK inhibitor SP600125 and demonstrated drastic suppression of CVPE-induced apoptosis. Thus, the JNK signaling pathway is significant for apoptosis in this system. Virus interaction with the cell surface was not sufficient for apoptosis since CIV(UV) particles bound to polysterene beads failed to induce apoptosis. Endocytosis inhibitors (bafilomycin or ammonium chloride) negated apoptosis induction by CIV(UV), CIV(XS) or CVPE indicating that entry through this mode is required. Given the weak apoptotic response to infectious CIV, we postulated that viral gene expression inhibited apoptosis. CIV infection of cells pretreated with cycloheximide induced apoptosis in 69% of the cells compared to 10% in normal infections. Furthermore, blocking viral DNA replication with aphidicolin or phosphonoacetic acid suppressed apoptosis and Cf-caspase-i activity, indicating that early viral expression is necessary for inhibition of apoptosis, and de novo synthesis of viral proteins is not required for induction. We show for the first time that, in a member of the family Iridoviridae, apoptosis: (i) requires entry and endocytosis of virions or virion proteins, (ii) is inhibited under conditions permitting early viral expression, and (iii) requires the JNK signaling pathway. This is the first report of JNK signal requirement during apoptosis induction by an insect virus.","output":"Modulation of iridovirus-induced apoptosis by endocytosis, early expression, JNK, and apical caspase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection is associated, alongside with lung infection and respiratory disease, to cardiovascular dysfunction that occurs at any stage of the disease. This includes ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, and cardiomyopathies. The common pathophysiological link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the cardiovascular events is represented by coagulation abnormalities and disruption of factors released by endothelial cells, which contribute in maintaining the blood vessels into an anti-thrombotic state. Thus, early alteration of the functionality of endothelial cells, which may be found soon after SARS-CoV-2 infection, seems to represent the major target of a SARS CoV-2 disease state and accounts for the systemic vascular dysfunction that leads to a detrimental effect in terms of hospitalization and death accompanying the disease. In particular, the molecular interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the ACE2 receptor located in the endothelial cell surface, either at the pulmonary and systemic level, leads to early impairment of endothelial function, which, in turn, is followed by vascular inflammation and thrombosis of peripheral blood vessels. This highlights systemic hypoxia and further aggravates the vicious circle that compromises the development of the disease, leading to irreversible tissue damage and death of people with SARS CoV-2 infection. The review aims to assess some recent advances to define the crucial role of endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of vascular complications accompanying SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, the molecular mechanisms associated with the interaction of SARS CoV-2 with the ACE2 receptor located on the endothelial cells are highlighted to support its role in compromising endothelial cell functionality. Finally, the consequences of endothelial dysfunction in enhancing pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection are assessed in order to identify early therapeutic interventions able to reduce the impact of the disease in high-risk patients.","output":"The Contribution of Endothelial Dysfunction in Systemic Injury Subsequent to SARS-Cov-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study was conducted on medicinal plants used for the treatment of human and livestock ailments in Basona Werana District, North Shewa Zone, Amhara Region.

Therefore, understanding the precise molecular mechanisms that underpin plant fertility under environmental constraints is critical to safeguard future food production3. Here, we identified two Argonaute-like proteins whose activities are required to sustain male fertility in maize plants under high temperatures. We found that MALE-ASSOCIATED ARGONAUTE 1 and 2 (MAGO1 and MAGO2) associate with temperature-induced phased secondary small RNAs in pre-meiotic anthers and are essential to control the activity of retrotransposons in male meiocyte initials. Biochemical and structural analyses revealed how MAGO2 activity and its interaction with retrotransposon RNA targets are modulated through the dynamic phosphorylation of a set of highly conserved surface-located serine residues.

P. falciparum is the most lethal of the five strains of malaria, and is a major case of morbidity and mortality in endemic regions. Recent advancements in malaria diagnostic tools and prevention strategies have improved conjugation antimalarial therapies using fumigation and long-lasting insecticidal sprays, thus lowering malarial infections. Declines in the total number of infected individuals have been correlated with antimalarial drugs. Despite this, malaria remains a major health threat, affecting more than 30 million men, women, and children around the globe, and 20 percent of all children around the globe have malaria parasites in their blood. To overcome this life-threatening condition, novel therapeutic strategies, including immunization, are urgently needed to tackle this infection around the world. In line with this, the development of the RTS, S vaccine was a significant step forward in the fight against malaria. RTS, S is a vaccine for P. falciparum in which R specifies central repeat units, T the T-cell epitopes, and S indicates surface antigen. The RTS, S/AS01 malarial vaccine was synthesized and screened in several clinical trials between 2009 and 2014, involving thousands of young children in seven African countries, showing that children who received the vaccine did not suffer from severe malaria. Mosquirix? was approved by the World Health Organization in 2021, indicating it to be safe and advocating its integration into routine immunization programs and existing malaria control measures. This paper examines the various stages of the vaccines development, including the evaluation of its immunogenicity and efficacy on the basis of a total of 2.3 million administered doses through a routine immunization program. The protection and effectiveness provided by the vaccine are strong, and evidence shows that it can be effectively delivered through the routine child immunization platform.

The manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia in transplant patients are not well understood and may have more severe symptoms, longer duration, and a worse prognosis than in immunocompetent populations. AIMS: This study proposed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients. PATIENTS/METHODS: Clinical records, laboratory results, radiological characteristics, and clinical outcome of 24 kidney transplant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated from March 20, 2020, to May 20, 2020. RESULTS: The most common symptom was shortness of breath (70.8%), followed by fever (62.5%) and cough (45.8%). Five patients had leukopenia, and only one patient had leukocytosis, while 75% of the patients had a white blood cell (WBC) count in the normal range, and 79% of recipients developed lymphopenia. All of the patients had an elevated concentration of C-reactive protein and an increase in blood urea levels. Chest CT images of 23 patients (95.8%) showed typical findings of patchy ground-glass shadows in the lungs. Of the 24 patients, 12 were admitted to ICU (invasive care unit), and ten of 24 patients (41.6%) died, and 14 patients were discharged after complete recovery. CONCLUSION: It seems that COVID-19 is more severe in transplant patients and has poorer outcomes. Multiple underlying diseases, low O2 saturation, and multilobar view in chest CT scan may be of prognostic value.

This can be achieved by introducing reduced graphene oxide into the polymer matrix. In this study, printable composite filaments were prepared and characterized in terms of morphology and thermal and mechanical properties. Among the obtained HIPS/rGO composites, the filament containing 0.5 wt% of reduced graphene oxide had the best mechanical properties. Its tensile strength increased from 19.84 to 22.45 MPa, for pure HIPS and HIPS-0.5, respectively. Furthermore, when using the HIPS-0.5 filament in the printing process, no clogging of the nozzle was observed, which may indicate good dispersion of the rGO in the polymer matrix.","output":"High-Impact Polystyrene Reinforced with Reduced Graphene Oxide as a Filament for Fused Filament Fabrication 3D Printing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of Covid-19 in the global sphere has been profound The world is battling questions around public health, economy, politics and society As such, violent ideologies such as terrorism and extremism, have called for expansion In 2020, terrorist activities have suffered a slowdown globally leading to a flattened curve Despite that, the United Nations have warned that the pandemic poses a significant threat to the safety, health, and wellbeing of societies and communities around the world Several reports have warned about violent groups viewing the pandemic as an opportunity for expansion It is in this context that the paper will look at the social and economic fallout of the pandemic and its effects on terrorism, the current trends concerning extremist and terrorist activities and how the extremist or the terrorist groups have been exploiting the pandemic and its consequent government responses","output":"COVID-19 and its Impact on Terrorism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physical activity (PA) is essential for physical, mental, and emotional health;however, few adults engage in enough PA. Group exercise environments such as CrossFit can promote sustained exercise habits through social influence, support, and norms. This cross-sectional study aims to provide evidence for PA social influence at CrossFit. CrossFit members (n = 62) reported PA, workout logging frequency, and members at their gym they: (1) work out with and (2) go to with personal matters. Separate linear network autocorrelation models (LNAMs) determined if individuals reported similar PA scores as those of their social ties at CrossFit that they work out with and/or those they go to for personal matters. Participants reported a mean of 2740.55 MET minutes/week (SD = 1847.08), working out with a mean of 9.89 members (SD = 6.26), and speaking to a mean of 2.66 members about personal matters (SD = 3.68). A persons PA was significantly associated with that of their ties they go to with personal matters (PEp = 0.08, SEp = 0.02), but was not associated with the PA of their ties they work out with (PEw = 0.02, SEw = 0.01).

Obesity has been associated with increased severity and mortality of COVID-19. However, the molecular mechanisms by which obesity exacerbates COVID-19 pathologies are not well-defined. The levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) are elevated in obese subjects. This study was therefore designed to examine how excess levels of different FFAs may affect the progression of COVID-19. Biological molecules associated with palmitic acid (PA) and COVID-19 were retrieved from QIAGEN Knowledge Base, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tools were used to analyze these datasets and explore the potential pathways affected by different FFAs. Our study found that one of the top 10 canonical pathways affected by PA was the coronavirus pathogenesis pathway, mediated by key inflammatory mediators, including PTGS2; cytokines, including IL1 and IL6; chemokines, including CCL2 and CCL5; transcription factors, including NFB; translation regulators, including EEF1A1; and apoptotic mediators, including BAX. In contrast, n-3 fatty acids may attenuate PAs activation of the coronavirus pathogenesis pathway by inhibiting the activity of such mediators as IL1, CCL2, PTGS2, and BAX.

Vitamin D is a key modulator of the immune system. We hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency (VDD) could increase the risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. Methods: patients with confirmed COVID-19 seen at the emergency department of our hospital with recent measurements of 25(OH)D were recruited. We explored the association of vitamin D deficiency (VDD), defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 20 ng/mL, with a composite of adverse clinical outcomes. Results: we included 80 patients, of which 31 (39 %) presented the endpoint. VDD tended to predict an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 after adjusting for age, gender, obesity, cardiac disease, and kidney disease [OR 3.2 (95 % CI: 0.9-11.4), p = 0.07]. Age had a negative interaction with the effect of VDD on the composite outcome (p = 0.03), indicating that the effect was more noticeable at younger ages. Furthermore, male gender was associated with VDD and with severe COVID-19 at younger ages. Conclusions: in this retrospective study, vitamin D deficiency showed a signal of association with severe COVID-19 infection. A significant interaction with age was noted, suggesting VDD may have a greater impact in younger patients.

Methods: Using a representative statewide sample of adults in Massachusetts, diaper need was assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic among respondents with at least one child 0C4 years of age in diapers (n=353). Bivariate tests examined associations between diaper need and individual and household factors. Multivariable regression was used to examine associations between diaper need and demographic factors, job loss, and mental health during the pandemic. Results: More than one in three respondents reported diaper need (36.0%). Demographic factors associated with diaper need were age <25 years, Latino ethnicity, having less than a high school degree, unemployment before the pandemic, household income <$50,000, household food insecurity, or having a household member with a chronic disease. Diaper need was higher among respondents who utilized a nutrition assistance program or a food pantry during the pandemic.

METHODS: We studied 2275 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients from Colombia with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and analyzed the associations between RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value with gender, age, comorbidities, symptomatology, and disease severity. RESULTS: 15.4 % of the samples (n = 428) reported at least one comorbidity. There were 2011 symptomatic cases (72.4 %), being the most common reported symptom cough (57.2 %, n = 1586). Respiratory distress was present in 21.4 % of patients (n = 595), and 435 patients (15.6 %) required hospital admission. We observed that patients with no prior medical history harbored higher RNA copies than patients with comorbidities (p = 0.02). No significant differences in RNA copies were observed between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (p = 0.82). Strong correlations were detected between Ct values and the presence of odynophagia (p = 0.03), diarrhea (p = 0.04), and headache (p = 0.0008). An inverse association was found between RNA copy number and markers of disease severity, namely, respiratory distress (P < 0.0001) and hospitalization requirement (P < 0.0001).

Dissatisfaction with high and long-term trade deficit stimulated the US to accept tariff restrictions in trade with China, which was called the trade war. The purpose of this paper is twofold: to identify the possible consequences of trade war for existing production linkages within the GVCs; to characterise the counter measures carried out both by Chinese companies and Chinese government. In this paper we consider only trade war direct effects on China. We highlight a set of implications of the trade war on China in terms of company performance. These effects include trade diversion (a short-term effect), switching suppliers (a medium-term effect), and production shift (a long-term effect). The combination of effects has led to a high probability of transformation along the GVCs. Chinese government responds in order to restore broken ties in the chain. One of the most important ways is to focus on the domestic market and move from an export-oriented economy to a consumer-oriented economy with technological and scientific leadership.

Pathogens could affect the transcription of host genes, especially the ones related to the immune system, by inducing epigenetic modifications. Many proteins of M. tuberculosis were found to affect the hosts epigenome. Nine proteins were exploited in this study to predict epitopes to develop an mRNA vaccine against tuberculosis. Many immunoinformatics tools were employed to construct this vaccine to elicit cellular and humoral immunity. We performed molecular docking between selected epitopes and their corresponding MHC alleles. Thirty epitopes, an adjuvant TLR4 agonist RpfE, constructs for subcellular trafficking, secretion booster, and specific linkers were combined to develop the vaccine. This proposed construct was tested to cover 99.38% of the population. Moreover, it was tested to be effective and safe. An in silico immune simulation of the vaccine was also performed to validate our hypothesis. It also underwent codon optimization to ensure mRNAs efficient translation once it reaches the cytosol of a human host. Furthermore, secondary and tertiary structures of the vaccine peptide were predicted and docked against TLR-4 and TLR-3.Molecular dynamics simulation was performed to validate the stability of the binding complex.

HE functions similarly to hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase of the influenza A and B viruses (IAV/IBV). It has a monobasic site, which is cleaved by some host enzyme(s). The cleavage is essential to activating the virus, but the enzyme(s) in the respiratory tract has not been identified. This study investigated whether the host serine proteases, transmembrane protease serine S1, members 2 (TMPRSS2), and human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), which reportedly cleave HA of IAV/IBV, are involved in HE cleavage. We established TMPRSS2- and HAT-expressing MDCK (MDCK-TMPRSS2, MDCK-HAT) cells. ICV showed multicycle replication with HE cleavage without trypsin in MDCK-TMPRSS2 cells as well as IAV did. The HE cleavage and multicycle replication did not appear in MDCK-HAT cells infected with ICV without trypsin, while HA cleavage and multi-step growth of IAV appeared in the cells. Amino acid sequences of the HE cleavage site in 352 ICV strains were completely preserved. Camostat and nafamostat suppressed the growth of ICV and IAV in human nasal surface epithelial (HNE) cells. Therefore, this study revealed that, at least, TMPRSS2 is involved in HE cleavage and suggested that nafamostat could be a candidate for therapeutic drugs of ICV infection. Importance Influenza C virus (ICV) is a pathogen that causes acute respiratory illness, mostly in children, but there are no anti-ICV drugs. ICV has only one kind of spike protein, the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein on the virion surface, that possesses receptor binding, receptor destroying, and membrane fusion activities. The HE cleavage is essential for the virus to be activated, but the enzyme(s) in the respiratory tract has not been identified. This study revealed that transmembrane protease serine S1, members 2 (TMPRSS2), and not human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), is involved in HE cleavage. This is a novel study on the host enzymes involved in HE cleavage, and the result suggests that the host enzymes, such as TMPRSS2, may be a target for therapeutic drugs of the ICV infection.","output":"TMPRSS2 activates hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein of influenza C virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ongoing training in the area of basic life support aims to encourage and sustain the willingness to act in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest situations among first aiders.

The survey conducted among MRU Public Security Academy students was dedicated to disclosing the perceptions of individuals first entering the labour market about (in)equality in labour relations and experiences in the course of professional practice. To attain these objectives, certain goals were set: analysis of multiple layers of the concept of equality, legal regulation of the principle of gender equality and its inclusion in labour relations and statutory service. Furthermore, the present paper considered various trends and patterns in the implementation of the gender equality principle in labour relations, based on the analysis of the data of the Office of the Equal Opportunities Ombudsperson. Empirical research was carried out to assess the experience of students who had their professional practice in police headquarters in terms of gender inequality. Based on the performed survey that involved the students of MRU Public Security Academy, it should be concluded that the majority of students did not understand the different behaviours that could violate an individual's rights in terms of the equality of men and women. When responding to certain questions, the majority of respondents indicated that gender inequality in Lithuania existed only to the extent it occurred naturally;however, when responding to other questions, the majority stated that there were numerous situations during their practice when they experienced discrimination (i.e. preferential treatment of one of the genders, abuse due to gender etc.).

Nucleic acid testing of respiratory tract specimens for SARS-CoV-2 is the current gold standard for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the diagnostic accuracy of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid may be lower than optimal. The detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies should be used as a serological non-invasive tool for the diagnosis and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection. AIM: To investigate the diagnostic value of SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG and nucleic acid detection in COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 652 suspected COVID-19 patients, and 206 non-COVID-19 patients in Wuhan Integrated TCM and Western Medicine Hospital. Data on SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests and serum antibody tests were collected to investigate the diagnostic value of nucleic acid RT-PCR test kits and immunoglobulin (Ig)M/IgG antibody test kits. The &#967;2 test was used to compare differences between categorical variables. A 95% confidence interval (CI) was provided by the Wilson score method. All analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States). RESULTS: Of the 652 suspected COVID-19 patients, 237 (36.3%) had positive nucleic acid tests, 311 (47.7%) were positive for IgM, and 592 (90.8%) were positive for IgG. There was a significant difference in the positive detection rate between the IgM and IgG test groups (P < 0.001). Using the RT-PCR results as a reference, the specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of IgM/IgG combined tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection were 98.5%, 95.8%, and 97.1%, respectively. Of the 415 suspected COVID-19 patients with negative nucleic acid test results, 366 had positive IgM/IgG tests with a positive detection rate of 88.2%. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that serological IgM/IgG antibody combined test had high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and can be used in combination with RT-PCR for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Clinical application of combined detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and nucleic acid"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many of the policies that were put into place during the Covid-19 pandemic had a common goal: to flatten the curve of the number of infected people so that its peak remains under a critical threshold.

In this situation, ultraviolet (UVC) disinfection technologies seem to be promising because biocontaminated air and surfaces are the major media for disease transmission. However, UVC is strongly absorbed by human cells and protein components; therefore, there are concerns about damaging plasma components and causing dermatitis and skin cancer. To avoid these concerns, in this study, we demonstrate that the efficient inactivation of bacteria is achieved by visible pulsed light irradiation. The principle of inactivation is based on transient photothermal heating. First, we provide experimental confirmation that extremely high temperatures above 1000 K can be achieved by pulsed laser irradiation. Evidence of this high temperature is directly confirmed by melting gold nanoparticles (GNPs). Inorganic GNPs are used because of their well-established thermophysical properties. Second, we show inactivation behaviour by pulsed laser irradiation. This inactivation behaviour cannot be explained by a simple optical absorption effect. We experimentally and theoretically clarify this inactivation mechanism based on both optical absorption and scattering effects. We find that scattering and absorption play an important role in inactivation because the input irradiation is inherently scattered by the bacteria; therefore, the dose that bacteria feel is reduced. This scattering effect can be clearly shown by a technique that combines stained Escherichia coli and site selective irradiation obtained by a wavelength tunable pulsed laser. By measuring Live/Dead fluorescence microscopy images, we show that the inactivation attained by the transient photothermal heating is possible to instantaneously and selectively kill microorganisms such as Escherichia coli bacteria. Thus, this method is promising for the site selective inactivation of various pathogenic viruses and bacteria in a safe and simple manner.","output":"Mechanism of transient photothermal inactivation of bacteria using a wavelength-tunable nanosecond pulsed laser"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the beginning of 2020, to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to the campus, the Ministry of Education of China launched a policy Suspension of classes without suspending schooling for the spring semester of 2020.

The World Health Organization has reported overzealous usage of broad-spectrum antibiotics during this current pandemic raising concerns of increasing antimicrobial resistance? Therefore, the knowledge of coinfection and the common pathogens during these challenging times is essential for antibiotic stewardship practices. RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of reported superimposed bacterial and viral coinfections in COVID-19 patients is around 0.04 to 17%. However, more than 70% of patients have received broad-spectrum antibiotics. The presence of a simultaneous coinfection can be suspected in patients with neutrophilic lymphocytosis and elevated procalcitonin in the setting of COVID-19. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panels, with its short turnaround time, aid in the definitive diagnosis of possible coinfection. Acinetobacter baumanii, Mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza virus, Aspergillus, Candida, etc., are commonly implicated pathogens.

Cardiovascular disease leads the ranking in deaths in adults in Argentina with 280 deaths per day, and in recent decades we have reduced its mortality by 20-30% through various evidence-based interventions. Herein we conducted predictive analyses to understand what could be the consequences of a worse implementation of those interventions. We estimate that less control of cardiovascular risk factors from April to October 2020 could cause up to 10 500 new preventable cases of cardiovascular disease. In terms of myocardial infarction, a drop from 40% to 60% of the reperfusion treatment could increase mortality by 3% to 5%. A marginal 10% to 15% increase in relative risk of cardiovascular death would be equivalent to an excess of 6000 to 9000 preventable deaths. In conclusion, given the high prevalence and fatality of cardiovascular disease, even a small negative impact on the efficacy of its care will translate into large numbers of people affected in Argentina.

Unlike hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) which has been associated with hepatitis B virus infection or cirrhosis, the etiology of hepatoblastoma remains vague. Genetic syndromes, including familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), and trisomy 18 syndrome, have been associated with hepatoblastoma. BWS is an overgrowth syndrome which exhibits an alteration of genomic imprinting on chromosome 11p15.5. N(6)-Methyladenosine (M(6)A) is an RNA modification with rampant involvement in the metabolism of cells and malignant diseases. It has been observed to impact the development of various cancers via its governance of gene expression. Here, we explore the role of m(6)A and its genetic associates in promoting HB, and the impact this may have on our future management of the disease. ABSTRACT: Hepatoblastoma (HB) is a rare primary malignancy of the developing fetal liver. Its course is profoundly influenced by genetics, in the context of sporadic mutation or genetic syndromes. Conventionally, subtypes of HB are histologically determined based on the tissue type that is recapitulated by the tumor and the direction of its differentiation. This classification is being reevaluated based on advances on molecular pathology. The therapeutic approach comprises surgical intervention, chemotherapy (in a neoadjuvant or post-operative capacity), and in some cases, liver transplantation. Although diagnostic modalities and treatment options are evolving, some patients experience complications, including relapse, metastatic spread, and suboptimal response to chemotherapy. As yet, there is no consistent framework with which such outcomes can be predicted. N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is an RNA modification with rampant involvement in the normal processing of cell metabolism and neoplasia. It has been observed to impact the development of a variety of cancers via its governance of gene expression. M(6)A-associated genes appear prominently in HB. Literature data seem to underscore the role of m(6)A in promotion and clinical course of HB. Illuminating the pathogenetic mechanisms that drive HB are promising additions to the understanding of the clinically aggressive tumor behavior, given its potential to predict disease course and response to therapy. Implicated genes may also act as targets to facilitate the evolving personalized cancer therapy. Here, we explore the role of m(6)A and its genetic associates in the promotion of HB, and the impact this may have on the management of this neoplastic disease.","output":"The Role of N(6)-Methyladenosine in the Promotion of Hepatoblastoma: A Critical Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To assess the association between vitamin D deficiency and increased morbidity/mortality with COVID-19 respiratory dysfunction. DESIGN: Scoping review. DATA SOURCES: Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 24 of April 2020) and PubMed (2020 to 17 of September 2020). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: A search using the search terms: [(cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol or vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 or vitamin D or 25OHD) and (SARS-CoV-2 or coronavirus or COVID or betacoronavirus or MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV or respiratory infection or acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS)]m.p. was conducted on the 24/04/2020 (Search A) and 17/09/2020 (Search B). RESULTS: 91 studies were identified as being concerned with Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI)/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and vitamin D, and 25 publications specifically explored the role of vitamin D deficiency in the development and progression of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 related ARDS. Search A identified three main themes of indirect evidence supporting such an association. Consistent epidemiological evidence exists linking low vitamin D levels to increased risk and severity of respiratory tract infections. We also report on plausible biological processes supporting such an association; and present weaker evidence supporting the benefit of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the risk and severity of ARIs. Uncertainty remains about what constitutes an appropriate dosing regimen in relation to reducing risk/severity of ARI/ARDS. More recent evidence (Search B) provided new insights into some direct links between vitamin D and COVID-19; with a number of cohort and ecological studies supporting an association with PCR-positivity for SARS-CoV-2 and vitamin D deficiency. The exact efficacy of the vitamin D supplementation for prevention of, or as an adjunct treatment for COVID-19 remains to be determined; but a number of randomized control trials (RCTs) currently underway are actively investigating these potential benefits. CONCLUSION: Our rapid review of literature supports the need for observational studies with COVID-19 infected populations to measure and assess vitamin D levels in relation to risk/severity and outcomes; alongside RCTs designed to evaluate the efficacy of supplementation both in preventive and therapeutic contexts. The overlap in the vitamin D associated biological pathways with the dysregulation reported to drive COVID-19 outcomes warrants further investigation.","output":"Association Between Vitamin D and Novel SARS-CoV-2 Respiratory Dysfunction C A Scoping Review of Current Evidence and Its Implication for COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) is a major contributor to seasonal outbreaks of acute respiratory illness (ARI) The origins of locally circulating HCoV-OC43 strains and characteristics of their genetic diversity are unknown for most settings despite significance to effective HCoV control strategies Between December 2015 and June 2016, we undertook ARI surveillance in coastal Kenya in nine outpatients and one inpatient health facility (HF) Ninety-two patient samples tested HCoV-OC43 positive and forty (43 5%) were successfully sequenced in spike (S) gene region (2,864 long, 70%) Phylogenetic analysis confirmed co-circulation of two distinct HCoV-OC43 clades that closely clustered with genotype G (n = 34, 85%) and genotype H (n = 6, 15%) reference strains Local viruses within the same clade displayed low genetic diversity yielding identical sequences in multiple HF Furthermore, the newly sequenced Kenyan viruses showed close phylogenetic relationship to other contemporaneous sampled strains (2015-16) including those originating from distant places (e g USA and China) Using a genetic similarity threshold of 99 1 per cent at nucleotide level, the HCoV-OC43 strains sampled globally between 1967 and 2019 fell into nine sequence clusters Notably, some of these clusters appeared to have become extinct, or occurred only sporadically in a few geographical areas while others persisted globally for multiple years In conclusion, we found that HCoV-OC43 strains spread rapidly both locally and across the globe with limited genetic evolution in the spike gene Full-genome sequences that are spatio-temporally representative are required to advance understanding of the transmission pathways of this important human respiratory pathogen","output":"Transmission and evolutionary dynamics of human coronavirus OC43 strains in coastal Kenya investigated by partial spike sequence analysis, 2015-16"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: To overcome travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, consumer-based technology was rapidly deployed to the smartphones of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) participating in a 12-month exercise trial.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of AKI in a cohort of patients with COVID-19 admitted to medicine and intensive care unit (ICU) wards, its association with in-hospital mortality, and disease severity. Our aim was to stratify these outcomes by out-of-hospital AKI and in-hospital AKI. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study from a registry of patients with COVID-19. SETTING: Three community and 3 academic hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 815 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between March 4, 2020, and April 23, 2021. MEASUREMENTS: Stage of AKI, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: We classified AKI by comparing highest to lowest recorded serum creatinine in hospital and staged AKI based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) system. We calculated the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio for the stage of AKI and the outcomes of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of the 815 patients registered, 439 (53.9%) developed AKI, 253 (57.6%) presented with AKI, and 186 (42.4%) developed AKI in-hospital. The odds of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death increased as the AKI stage worsened. Stage 3 AKI that occurred during hospitalization increased the odds of death (odds ratio [OR] = 7.87 [4.35, 14.23]). Stage 3 AKI that occurred prior to hospitalization carried an increased odds of death (OR = 5.28 [2.60, 10.73]). LIMITATIONS: Observational study with small sample size limits precision of estimates. Lack of nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 and hospitalized patients without COVID-19 as controls limits causal inferences. CONCLUSIONS: Acute kidney injury, whether it occurs prior to or after hospitalization, is associated with a high risk of poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19.

The disease is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The pathogen of COVID-19 is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It infects the cells binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) which is expressed by cells throughout the airways as targets for cellular entry. Although the majority of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience symptoms of mild upper respiratory tract infection, in some people infections of the peripheral airways result in severe, potentially fatal pneumonia. However, the induction of COVID-19 pneumonia requires that SARS-CoV-2 reaches the peripheral airways. While huge efforts have been made to understand the spread of the disease as well as the pathogenesis following cellular entry, much less attention is paid how SARS-CoV-2 from the environment reach the receptors of the target cells. The aim of the present study is to characterize the deposition distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the airways upon exposure to cough-generated aerosol. For this purpose, the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model has been applied. Aerosol size distribution and breathing parameters were taken from the literature supposing normal breathing through the nose. We found that the probability of direct infection of the peripheral airways due to inhalation of aerosol generated by a bystander cough is very low. As the number of pathogens deposited in the extrathoracic airways is ~10 times higher than in the peripheral airways, we concluded that in most cases COVID-19 pneumonia must be preceded by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways. Our results suggest that without the enhancement of viral load in the upper airways, COVID-19 would be much less dangerous. The period between the onset of initial symptoms and the potential clinical deterioration could provide an opportunity for prevention of pneumonia by blocking or significantly reducing the transport of viruses towards the peripheral airways. Coughing into a tissue or cloth even at home in order to absorb the emitted aerosol is highly recommended to avoid the continuous re-inhalation of own cough.","output":"Deposition distribution of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in the human airways upon exposure to cough-generated aerosol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: In patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia, chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is advised when risk factors for severe disease (i.e., age > 65 years and/or comorbidities) are present, and can influence management strategy. The objective was to assess whether HRCT is associated to short-time development of severe disease in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Seventy-seven consecutive patients (mean age, 64  15 years) with mild COVID-19 pneumonia (no or mild respiratory failure) that underwent HRCT were retrospectively identified. Fifty-two on 77 patients had reported risk factors for severe disease. A chest-imaging devoted radiologist recorded, on a per-examination basis, the following HRCT features: ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, organizing pneumonia (OP) pattern, mosaic attenuation, and nodules. The extent of each feature (total feature score, TFS) was semi-quantitatively assessed. Total lung involvement (TLI) was defined as the sum of all TFSs. The study outcome was defined as the occurrence of severe disease (moderate-to-severe respiratory failure) within 15 days from HRCT. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess if age, comorbidities, and HRCT features were associated to severe disease. RESULTS: On univariable analysis, severe disease was significantly associated with age > 59 years (29/47 patients, 61.7%) (p = 0.013), and not significantly associated with having comorbidities (22/44 patients, 50.0%).

Subsequently, the authors used ordered logistic regressions analyses to understand if and to what extent AI-enabled hospitality service interactions are evaluated by service customers.FindingsThe presence of mechanical AI-related text (text related to service robots) in ORs influences positively electronic word-of-mouth (e-WOM) valence. Hotel guests writing ORs explicitly mentioning their interactions with the service robots are more prone to associate high online ratings to their ORs.

These conventional treatment methods have several drawbacks in terms of energy, cost, and emission. But the actual problem for the treatment providers is the huge and non-uniform flow of the BMWs during the pandemic. The existing treatment methods are lacking flexibility for the non-uniform flow. The Government of India has provisionally approved some new techniques like plasma pyrolysis, sharp/needle blaster, and PIWS-3000 technologies on a trial basis.

Therefore, there is an absolute requirement to micromanage the BMWs based on certain parameters for the possible COVID-19 like pandemic in the future. Segregation is a major step of the BMW management. Its guideline may be shuffled as segregation at the entry points followed by collection instead of the existing system of the collection followed by segregation. Other steps like transportation, location of treatment facilities, upgradation of the existing treatment facilities, and new technologies can solve the challenges up to a certain extent.

It has been suggested that the countrys precarious health system and poverty rates prior to the pandemic may justify higher mortality figures in Peru than in other Latin American countries, despite prompt action for its containment and compliance with the protective measures. Psychological distress had a greater incidence in women, young people, people without a partner, and people without university studies. The most significant conditioning variables were self-perceived health status, headache or muscle pain over the past 14 days, level of studies, and age. The extensive use of preventive measures against COVID-19 is in line with the strict legislative measures taken, and this is, in turn, in line with other countries when looking at the lower effect on mental health, but contrary when focusing on the high lethality identified. The need to include the economy or availability and quality of healthcare in future studies arises, as well as the suitability to analyze the cause for differences between countries.","output":"Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health in Peru: Psychological Distress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Electronic ticketing (E-ticketing) is the process of digital ticket delivery, and it can be combined with different technologies to produce a wide variety of benefits in the construction transportation industry. Many transportation departments and agencies are not willing to adopt this technology due to some limitations imposed by technology or organization policies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to perform analysis of E-Ticketing adoption and its changes during the Covid-19 pandemic, evaluate the benefits and limitations of the technology, and determine the technology integration with other available automation platforms in construction industry. The outcome of study will help in validating that the primary uses of E-ticketing are not safety and documentation;it is also a tool for rendering automated inspections and reducing the cost and increasing the overall quality of transportation construction projects during and after the pandemic. This study incorporated an extensive literature review on policies, memos, guidelines, news articles, and research publications pertaining to the limitations, benefits, and key technologies that can be integrated into E-ticketing platforms. A qualitative analysis of recent technological trends indicated that intelligent compaction, drone surveying, infrared sensors, advanced imaging, and thermal profilers can be integrated into an E-ticketing platform to extract better results that are paramount to a project's success. Four findings from this study will assist project stakeholders in developing guidelines and policies, reducing costs, and increasing the overall safety of the project. The main contribution of the paper is a framework for the platform that combines E-ticketing and other emerging technologies to facilitate efficient automated inspections, billing, and telematics in the construction transportation industry.","output":"E-Ticketing Technology in Construction Projects: Adoption, Benefits, and Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To examine the psychological distress and the associated predictor factors of the 2019 corona-virus disease (COVID-19) on survivors in the early convalescence in Shenzhen. METHOD: A survey questionnaire consisting of post-traumatic stress disorder self-rating scale (PTSD-SS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) was presented to COVID-19 survivors still in quarantine. Scores of each scale and subscale were dependent variables in the Mann-Whitney test and stepwise regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 126 subjects were included in the study, the mean scores of PTSD-SS, SDS, and SAS were 45.5  18.9, 47.3  13.1, and 43.2  10.2, respectively, meanwhile, 9 (31.0%), 28 (22.2%), and 48 (38.1%) of the survivors met the cut-score for clinical significant symptoms of stress response, anxiety, and depression, respectively. Infected family members, and postinfection physical discomforts were significantly associated with scores on all three scales. Social support, retirement, and being female had significant associations with the PTSD-SS score. The survivors aged 60 or above experienced less severe stress response symptoms, fewer emotional symptoms of depression, and fewer anxiety symptoms than younger survivors. CONCLUSION: The occurrence rate of psychological distress among the COVID-19 survivors in early convalescence was high, highlighting the need for all COVID-19 survivors to be screened for psychological distress regularly for timely intervention. The predictors indicated by the current study may help to identify those at high-risk. Besides, the results indicated the older survivors suffered less emotional reactivity and fewer stress response symptoms from infectious diseases than the younger ones.","output":"Psychological Distress and Its Correlates Among COVID-19 Survivors During Early Convalescence Across Age Groups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article describes 5 cases of bartonellosis with fever and atypical clinical presentations in kidney transplant recipients: thrombotic microangiopathies, recurrent hemophagocytosis, and immune reconstitution syndrome after treatment.

Methods: All patients who underwent telemedicine visits at one urban academic medical center between March 2020 and June 2020 were included. All departments were included including surgical and nonsurgical. Demographic data, primary language, and visit type were collected. Primary zip code was used as surrogate for socioeconomic status through use of the zip code median household income. The demographics of the New York metropolitan area were obtained through the U.S. Census Bureau and used as a control cohort. Results: A total of 362,413 telemedicine visits met inclusion criteria with the majority of visits performed in April and May; 127,851 (35.3%) and 110,166 (30.4%), respectively. The highest performing department was Internal Medicine, which performed 72,796 visits or 20% of the total cohort. In our cohort of telemedicine patients, 59.6% identified as White, 11.4% as Black, and 5.7% as Asian. This is less diverse than the overall population of the metropolitan area, which is 17.5% Black and 11.5% Asian. There was also a large gender gap in the utilization of telemedicine services in general, where women (60.2%) were more likely than men (39.8%) to utilize the virtual visits. In addition, although over a third of patients in the Metropolitan area have median household incomes of <50,000, this population only represented 13.6% of our total cohort. Conclusions: This study highlights both the capability of telemedicine to provide care at a large urban academic medical center during a pandemic in addition to identifying potential gaps in care with telemedicine. The disparities highlighted in our cohort stress the importance of outreach to non-White older patients of lower socioeconomic status.","output":"Telemedicine Utilization at an Academic Medical Center During COVID-19 Pandemic: Are Some Patients Being Left Behind?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Young children's use of digital devices is increasing as we progress through the 21st century and handheld and mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, have become increasingly available. While older children using tablets to read has been more broadly investigated, less is known about the impacts of digital reading on children at the stage of literacy acquisition. An analytical review was conducted on the effects of interactive e-book interventions for young children's literacy development when compared to (a) listening to print books, (b) regular school programs, and (c) reading non-enhanced and non-interactive e-books. A significant additional beneficial effect of e-book interventions was found for phonological awareness and vocabulary learning based on data from 1138 children in 14 randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies. When e-books are properly selected and used, children develop literacy skills equally well and sometimes better than with print books. Additionally, e-book interventions outperformed the regular school program in the development of literacy skills. Similarly, enhanced e-book conditions revealed benefits over the non-enhanced e-book interventions in literacy skill acquisition.

The development of automated methods for quantifying COVID-19 abnormalities in these CT images is invaluable to clinicians. The hallmark of COVID-19 in chest CT images is the presence of ground-glass opacities in the lung region, which are tedious to segment manually. We propose anamorphic depth embedding-based lightweight CNN, called Anam-Net, to segment anomalies in COVID-19 chest CT images.

However, effective influenza forecasting still remains a challenge despite increasing research interest. It is even more challenging amidst the COVID pandemic, when the influenza-like illness (ILI) counts are affected by various factors such as symptomatic similarities with COVID-19 and shift in healthcare seeking patterns of the general population. Under the current pandemic, historical influenza models carry valuable expertise about the disease dynamics but face difficulties adapting. Therefore, we propose CALI-Net, a neural transfer learning architecture which allows us to 'steer' a historical disease forecasting model to new scenarios where flu and COVID co-exist. Our framework enables this adaptation by automatically learning when it should emphasize learning from COVID-related signals and when it should learn from the historical model. Thus, we exploit representations learned from historical ILI data as well as the limited COVID-related signals. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is successful in adapting a historical forecasting model to the current pandemic. In addition, we show that success in our primary goal, adaptation, does not sacrifice overall performance as compared with state-of-the-art influenza forecasting approaches.","output":"Steering a Historical Disease Forecasting Model Under a Pandemic: Case of Flu and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced the hardest-hit populations, like Italians, to radically change their daily habits, starting with social distancing, strict preventive measures, and self-isolation.

This study aims to investigate the temporal trend in (1) avoidance and protective behaviors, (2) fear, (3) socio-economic impact, and (4) anxiety levels during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a high level of anxiety may have a detrimental impact during an infectious disease outbreak, factors associated with anxiety were also explored. The survey was carried out for 10 weeks and the responses were divided into three periods of around 3 weeks: 25 January-21 February, 22 February-17 March and 18 March-3 April (the period the Malaysian Government issued Movement Control Order). Findings revealed that most of the pyschobehavioural variables showed small increases during first (25 January-21 February) and second (22 February-17 March) periods, and high psychobehavioral responses were reported during the third period. A total of 72.1% (95%CI = 69.2-75.0) reported moderate to severe anxiety as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Factor influencing moderate to severe anxiety is a high perception of severity (OR = 2.09; 95%CI = 1.48-2.94), high perceived susceptibility (OR = 1.71; 95%CI = 1.17-2.50), high impact score (OR = 1.63; 95%CI = 1.17-2.26) and high fear score (OR = 1.47; 95%CI = 1.01-2.14).

Only the son had heart failure, with reduced ejection fraction and atrial fibrillation. This report aims to show that age and baseline comorbidities are not always predictors of severe COVID-19 disease. CASE REPORTS: Case 1: The son, a 29-year-old man, presented with dyspnea and palpitation. His nasopharyngeal swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). He required high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy and had new-onset atrial fibrillation and reduced ejection fraction. Case 2: The father, a 54-year-old man, presented with dyspnea. Nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. He required regular nasal cannula oxygen therapy. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm. Echocardiogram showed normal ejection fraction. Case 3: The grandfather, an 84-year-old man with a history of atrial flutter, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension, presented with dyspnea and fever. Nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. He required regular nasal cannula oxygen therapy. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm. Echocardiogram showed normal ejection fraction.

This study examined these experiences and associations with healthcare satisfaction, use and breast feeding. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: 3 public hospitals, 2 private hospitals, and 1 health centre/dispensary in Nairobi and Kiambu counties in Kenya. PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected from women who delivered in health facilities between September 2019 and January 2020. The sample included 1014 women surveyed at baseline and at least one follow-up at 2C4 or 10 weeks post partum. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Outcomes related to satisfaction with care and care utilisation; (2) continuation of post-discharge newborn care practices such as breast feeding. RESULTS: 17.6% of women reported newborn separation at the facility, of whom 71.9% were separated over 10 min. 44.9% felt separation was unnecessary and 8.4% reported not knowing the reason for separation. 59.9% reported consent was not obtained for procedures on their newborn. Women separated from their newborn (>10 min) were 44% less likely to be exclusively breast feeding at 2C4 weeks (adjusted OR (aOR)=0.56, 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.76). Obtaining consent for newborn procedures corresponded with 2.7 times greater likelihood of satisfaction with care (aOR=2.71, 95% CI: 1.67 to 4.41), 27% greater likelihood of postpartum visit attendance for self or newborn (aOR=1.27, 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.55), and 33% greater likelihood of exclusive breast feeding at 10 weeks (aOR=1.33, 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.62).

METHODS A prospective randomised single-centre study was carried out of 29 female patients, who underwent robot-assisted or laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy for external or internal rectal prolapse with symptoms of obstructive defecation and/or faecal incontinence. Anatomical changes were measured by Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) and magnetic resonance defecography. Functional changes were evaluated using symptom questionnaires before and 3 months after surgery. RESULTS After rectopexy, changes in POP-Q measurements were statistically significant for points Ap, Bp, C, D and Ba. The descent of the anorectum and cervix/vaginal cuff during straining were significantly reduced with regard to the reference line (mean, -10.4  14.9 mm, p = 0.001) and (-13.3  18.1 mm, p < 0.001) respectively. Pelvic organ mobility (POM) was reduced statistically significantly for the posterior (mean, -16.6  20.8 mm, p < 0.001) and apical compartments (mean, -13.1  14.8, p < 0.001). The PFDI-20, PFIQ-7 and PISQ-12 questionnaires showed statistically significant improvement of symptoms and sexual function. No significant differences were observed between the robot-assisted and laparoscopic techniques in terms of anatomical or functional parameters.

To this end we constructed an online questionnaire to investigate the levels of stress, well-being, and work-life balance in relationship with living and working conditions. Moreover, the questionnaire was designed to obtain information about the perceived occurrence, increase or decrease of misconduct in research (e.g., research misconduct by colleagues) and professional relationships (e.g., misbehaviors between colleagues, from students and toward students). The questionnaire was administered online by contacting faculty at three universities in Tuscany, Italy, asking them to relate their experience during the first lockdown (MarchCMay 2020). Faculty members were invited to complete the questionnaire by their institutional e-mail account. The final sample consisted of 581 respondents. The results showed that inadequacies of the equipment, and particularly poor internet connection, were significantly correlated with main issues reported, such as relationships with students and research activities. Female teachers primarily suffered from stressful conditions, lacked well-being, and experienced work-life imbalance. Stress levels were related to perceptions of the frequency of misconduct and of an increase in their frequency during the period of home quarantine. Female professors, when compared to their male counterparts, perceived misconduct from students as increased and more frequent in the period of quarantine. Results point to a gender issue that is likely to arise from conditions of domestic activities imbalance and that increases stress and misconduct perception.

In-hospital costs were calculated using detailed expenditure reports provided by the hospital accounts department. Total costs including those arising from surgical procedures, consumables, personnel and accommodation were analysed for 24 consecutive patients undergoing aquablation and compared with 24 patients undergoing TURP during the same period. Mean total costs and mean costs for individual expense items were compared between treatment groups with t-tests. RESULTS: Mean total costs per patient ( standard deviation) were higher for aquablation at EUR 10,994  2478 than for TURP at EUR 7445  2354. The mean difference of EUR 3549 was statistically significant (p <0.001). Although the mean procedural costs were significantly higher for aquablation (mean difference EUR 3032; p <0.001), costs apart from the procedure were also lower for TURP, but the mean difference of EUR 1627 was not significant (p <0.327). Medical supplies were mainly responsible (mean difference EUR 2057; p <0.001) for the difference in procedural costs.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- is a common cytokine found in disease microenvironment. The aim of this study was to determine whether TNF- can regulate the expression of AQP4 in astrocytes. Primary astrocyte cultures were treated with different concentrations of TNF- and the cell viability was assessed through cell counting kit-8 assay and AQP4 expression was detected by qPCR, western blots, and immunofluorescence assays. The activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) pathway was detected by western blot. Further, dual-luciferase reporting system and chromatin immunoprecipitation were used to detect the transcriptional regulation of AQP4 by p65. These experiments demonstrated that treatment with TNF- can lead to astrocyte edema and an increase in AQP4 expression. Following TNF- treatment, the expression levels of P-IKK/?-IB and P-p65 increased significantly over time. The results of the dual-luciferase reporter system and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that p65 protein and AQP4 promoter had a robust binding effect after TNF- treatment, and the NF-B pathway inhibitor, BAY 11-7082 could inhibit these effects of TNF-. The expression level of AQP4 was significantly decreased upon p65 interference, while the astrocyte viability was significantly increased compared to that in the TNF- only group. In conclusion, TNF- activated NF-B pathway, which promoted the binding of p65 to the AQP4 gene promoter region, and enhanced AQP4 expression, ultimately reducing astrocyte viability and causing cell edema.","output":"TNF- induces AQP4 overexpression in astrocytes through the NF-B pathway causing cellular edema and apoptosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article uses data from the 2020 TIAA Institute-GFLEC Personal Finance (P-Fin) Index to show that many American families were financially fragile well before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the U S economy Financial fragility is particularly severe among specific demographic groups, such as African-Americans and those with low income The article also shows that financial fragility is strongly linked to financial literacy and that many Americans are ill-equipped to deal with the financial decisions needed to navigate through a financial crisis Suggestions are provided to deal with personal finance decisions in times of emergency","output":"Building up financial literacy and financial resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Chronic renal failure is a chronic medical condition characterized by a progressive and irreversible loss of kidney function.

The present study was carried out to investigate the individual factors (biomarkers and psychological dimensions) of end-stage renal disease patients dealing with dialysis, analyzing their predictor values for developing negative disease adaptations by an allostatic paradigm. Methods: We conducted an observational study on 35 patients affected by end-stage renal disease; biological and psychological markers have been detected. We conducted descriptive statistical analyses (t-tests) and performed a hierarchical regression analysis to investigate the relationship between pathological medical conditions and psychological dimensions. Results: The findings showed a positive correlation between creatinine levels and psychological distress as well as stress index. No significant effect of time of dialysis, time from diagnosis, age and personality traits was found. Conclusion: Our findings showed that personality traits did not represent a protective factor by moderating positive emotional adaptations; conversely, creatinine levels appeared predictive for negative emotional adaptations. High levels of creatinine were found to be positively associated with high stress levels as well psychological distress.

In addition, many patients with COVID-19 infection have suffered liver damage which might contribute to a worse prognosis. We conducted a clinical epidemiological analysis to investigate the association of overweight/obesity and abnormal liver function (ALF) with hospitalized duration in patients infected with COVID-19. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with diagnosed COVID-19 (22 women & 36 men; average age: 49.2  13.1 yr) were included, and their clinical data were collected at The Second Affiliated and Yuying Childrens Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang. Overweight/obesity was determined as body mass index (BMI) 24 kg/m(2), ALF was determined as alanine aminotransferase >40 U/L, and prolonged hospitalization was lasting more than the median value of the hospitalized days (19 days) in this population. RESULTS: The proportions of prolonged hospitalization were elevated in patients with overweight/obesity and ALF compared with those without overweight/obesity (62.1% versus 26.1%, P = 0.010) and those without ALF (70.6% versus 41.5%, P = 0.043). KaplanCMeier analysis showed that the hospitalized duration was increased from the patients with neither overweight/obesity nor ALF to those with either overweight/obesity or ALF, and to those with both of overweight/obesity and ALF (mean with 95% confidence interval: 16.4 [14.5C18.3] versus 25.3 [21.6C29.1] versus 28.3 [24.6C32.0], P for trend = 0.001).

The COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) is a WHO-led initiative to promote vaccine access equity to LMICs and is providing many of the doses available in these settings. However, initial doses are limited and countries, such as Madagascar, need to develop prioritization schemes to maximize the benefits of vaccination with very limited supplies. There is some consensus that dose deployment should initially target health care workers, and those who are more vulnerable including older individuals. However, questions of geographic deployment remain, in particular associated with limits around vaccine access and delivery capacity in underserved communities, for example in rural areas that may also include substantial proportions of the population. MethodsTo address these questions, we developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and simulated various vaccination allocation strategies for Madagascar. Simulated strategies were based on a number of possible geographical prioritization schemes, testing sensitivity to initial susceptibility in the population, and evaluating the potential of tests for previous infection. ResultsUsing cumulative deaths due to COVID-19 as the main outcome of interest, our results indicate that distributing the number of vaccine doses according to the number of elderly living in the region or according to the population size results in a greater reduction of mortality compared to distributing doses based on the reported number of cases and deaths. The benefits of vaccination strategies are diminished if the burden (and thus accumulated immunity) has been greatest in the most populous regions, but the overall strategy ranking remains comparable. If rapid tests for prior immunity may be swiftly and effectively delivered, there is potential for considerable gain in mortality averted, but considering delivery limitations modulates this.

RESULTS: A total of 35,691 v-safe participants 16 to 54 years of age identified as pregnant. Injection-site pain was reported more frequently among pregnant persons than among nonpregnant women, whereas headache, myalgia, chills, and fever were reported less frequently. Among 3958 participants enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry, 827 had a completed pregnancy, of which 115 (13.9%) resulted in a pregnancy loss and 712 (86.1%) resulted in a live birth (mostly among participants with vaccination in the third trimester).

METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, the Cochrane Library for eligible studies from inception to March 16, 2020, without language restrictions. We included studies that examined the diagnostic accuracy of cuff leak test if post-extubation airway obstruction after extubation or reintubation was explicitly reported as the reference standard. Two authors in duplicate and independently assessed the risk of bias using the Quality Assessment for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. We pooled sensitivities and specificities using generalized linear mixed model approach to bivariate random-effects meta-analysis. Our primary outcomes were post-extubation airway obstruction and reintubation. RESULTS: We included 28 studies involving 4493 extubations. Three studies were at low risk for all QUADAS-2 risk of bias domains. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of cuff leak test for post-extubation airway obstruction were 0.62 (95% CI 0.49C0.73; I(2) = 81.6%) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.82C0.90; I(2) = 97.8%), respectively.

This study aimed at assess the status of occupational stress in the three occupational groups of nurses, physicians and hospital cleaning crew facing COVID-19 patients in hospitals of Kerman province in Iran. METHODOLOGY: : This cross-sectional descriptive analytical study was performed on 290 medical staffs including nurses, physicians and cleaning crew facing COVID-19 patients working in different hospitals in Iran in 2020. Demographic information form and occupational Stress Questionnaire (HSE tool indicator) were used to collect data. The health and safety executive (HSE) questionnaire has 35 questions and 7 areas, which was developed in the 1990s by the UK Health and Safety Institute to measure occupational stress. RESULTS: The mean score of total dimensions among HCWs was 2.93. Communications, Manager support, Changes and Demand factors with scores of 2.76, 2.77, 2.83 and 2.87 had the greatest impact on participants' stress levels, respectively. Also, Colleague support factor with a score of 3.38 had the least effect on stress levels. Also, according to the results, 87% of nurses, 79% of cleaning crew and 67% of physicians had a partial to high levels of stress that, on average, 77.5% of the HCWs participating in this study had at least a small amount of stress. CONCLUSIONS: The mean stress score among the participants of the present study was between high stress level and moderate stress level. Factors such as communications, manager support, change and demand had the greatest impact on employee stress levels. Therefore, by improving the communication between people working in hospitals, increasing managers' support for staff, and reducing workplace demands such as reducing workload and improving workplace environment, the stress level of staff in hospitals during the outbreak of COVID-19 can be reduced.","output":"Occupational Stress Assessment of Health Care workers (HCWs) Facing COVID\\\\19 Patients in Kerman Province Hospitals in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The field of pathology is currently undergoing a significant transformation from traditional glass slides to a digital format dependent on whole slide imaging. Transitioning from glass to digital has opened the field to development and application of image analysis technology, commonly deep learning methods (artificial intelligence [AI]) to assist pathologists with tissue examination. Nephropathology is poised to leverage this technology to improve precision, accuracy, and efficiency in clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS Through a multidisciplinary approach, nephropathologists, and computer scientists have made significant recent advances in developing AI technology to identify histological structures within whole slide images (segmentation), quantification of histologic structures, prediction of clinical outcomes, and classifying disease. Virtual staining of tissue and automation of electron microscopy imaging are emerging applications with particular significance for nephropathology.

The 2009 Hajj took place during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. This study investigates factors associated with compliance with recommended influenza A (H1N1)-related health practices and behaviors among American pilgrims to the 2009 Hajj: receiving seasonal influenza vaccinations, receiving influenza A (H1N1) vaccinations, and behaviors intended to mitigate respiratory illness. METHODS American residents from Minnesota and Michigan completed anonymous surveys prior to and following travel to the 2009 Hajj. Surveys assessed demographics; knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) related to influenza A (H1N1); seasonal and H1N1 vaccinations; health-seeking behaviors; sources of health information; and protective behaviors during the Hajj. RESULTS Pre- and post-travel surveys were completed by 186 participants. Receiving seasonal influenza vaccination was reported by 138 (63%) respondents, and 80 (36%) reported receiving an influenza A (H1N1) vaccine. One hundred forty-four (79%) respondents reported engaging in protective behaviors during the Hajj to prevent illness. In multivariable models, greater perceived severity of influenza A (H1N1) before traveling was associated with: seasonal influenza vaccination (OR=1.74, 95% CI=1.14-2.62, p=.01), influenza A (H1N1) vaccination (OR=2.02, 95% CI=1.35-3.02, p=.001), and engaging in protective behaviors during the Hajj (OR=1.62, 95% CI=1.00-2.63, p=.003). CONCLUSIONS This study found that accurate knowledge of influenza A (H1N1) symptoms, transmission, and prevention was associated with greater perceived severity of influenza A (H1N1); and perceived influenza A (H1N1) severity was associated with engaging in recommended protective health practices.

This can lead to side differences (inter-limb asymmetry) in upper quarter mobility/stability between the throwing and non-throwing arm, which could even increase with advancing age (i.e., playing experience). However, side differences in upper quarter mobility/stability is associated with an increased musculoskeletal injury risk. Therefore, we assessed side differences in upper quarter mobility/stability in young handball players at different ages using a cross-sectional study design. METHODS: Upper Quarter Y Balance test performance of the throwing and non-throwing arm was assessed in 190 sub-elite young female and male handball players (13-18 years). Per arm, relative maximal reach distances (% arm length) for all three directions (i.e., medial, inferolateral, superolateral) and the composite score (CS) were calculated and used for an age  side analysis of variance. Additionally, partial eta-squared (?p2) was calculated as an effect size measure. RESULTS: Irrespective of measure, statistically significant main effects of age (except for the composite score) and side but no statistically significant age  side interaction effects were detected. Further, limb asymmetry in the inferolateral reach direction was above the injury-related cut-off value (i.e.,  7.75% arm length) in 13- and 14-year-olds but not in the older players. CONCLUSION: The detection of limb asymmetry above the proposed injury-related cut-off value in younger players (13- and 14-year-olds) but not in older players (15- to 18-year-olds) may be indicative for an increased injury risk for the younger age group.

The study hypothesis was that this exceptional situation temporarily altered childhood trauma epidemiology. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective study was performed during the 8 weeks of lockdown. Pediatric traumatology emergency activity was compared to that during the same period in the previous 3 years. RESULTS: During lockdown, emergency consultations decreased by 50%. The number of patients operated on was 86% of that in the previous 3 years. Patients operated on during lockdown had a mean age of 7.6 years (median, 7.5 years) compared to 9.3 years (9.4 years). The rate of domestic accidents (59% versus 23%) and trampoline accidents (16% versus 5%) increased, while those of sport and locomotion-related accidents decreased. Wounds were more frequent, at 35% of procedures, versus 13% previously. The rate of surgery for upper-limb fracture deceased, while that of lower-limb fracture was unchanged. Distal forearm fracture was less frequent, as was distal tibial fracture. DISCUSSION: The present study found a 50% decrease in pediatric traumatology emergency activity during lockdown, without decrease in surgery.

This 3-year follow-up study assesses late adverse effects, evaluates rehabilitative long-term effects and identifies patients who benefit the most. DESIGN: RePCa was a randomized clinical trial with multidisciplinary rehabilitation (n = 79) or usual care (n = 82). The intervention during the first 6 months consisted of consultations by nurses and physiotherapists focusing on psychosocial support and physical activity, respectively. Here we report the 3-year follow-up. Data consisted of disease-specific quality of life (EPIC-26), general quality of life (SF-12) and pelvic floor strength measured by electromyography. RESULTS: One hundred forty-three patients (92%) responded. The primary outcome urinary irritative sum-score was no longer significantly different between groups. In patients with moderate-severe urinary problems at baseline, we observed a significant long-term effect on the urinary irritative sum-score in favour of the intervention (+ 13.4 points P = .014). More patients had moderate-severe bowel problems in the control group (n = 10; 14%) compared to the intervention group (n = 2; 3%) (P = .016). Pelvic floor strength deteriorated significantly in both groups. CONCLUSION: The short-term rehabilitation was beneficial but of limited benefit in the long term for all patients. A significant and clinically relevant effect was found in irradiated prostate cancer patients with moderate-severe urinary problems at baseline. In both groups, pelvic floor strength was weakened during follow-up. IMPACT FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Prior research showed patients benefit from early rehabilitation. Identification of patients with moderate-severe urinary problems followed by a focused rehabilitation during the first 6 months after radiotherapy results in long-term improvement. Radiated patients have to be aware of their pelvic floor strength. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Patients can be informed that they benefit from early rehabilitation, and they cannot expect larger changes in adverse effects within the first years, but they have to be aware of their pelvic floor strength.

There is a strong pathophysiological rationale suggesting that hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT), a low-risk and non-invasive treatment, may be beneficial for COVID-19 patients. This systematic review aimed to explore the potential effectiveness and safety of HBOT for treating patients with COVID-19. METHODS Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched from December 2019 to February 2021, without language restrictions. The grey literature was searched via an internet search engine and targeted website and database searches. Reference lists of included studies were searched. Independent reviewers assessed studies for eligibility and extracted data, with disagreements resolved by consensus or a third reviewer. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Data were summarised descriptively. RESULTS Six publications (one cohort study, five case reports/series) met the inclusion criteria with a total of 37 hypoxaemic COVID-19 patients treated with HBOT. Of these 37 patients, the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation and in-hospital survival were assessed for 26 patients across three studies. Of these 26 patients, intubation and mechanical ventilation were not required for 24, and 23 patients survived. No serious adverse events of HBOT in COVID-19 patients were reported. No randomised trials have been published. CONCLUSIONS Limited and weak evidence from non-randomised studies including one propensity-matched cohort study suggests HBOT is safe and may be a promising intervention to optimise treatment and outcomes in hypoxaemic COVID-19 patients.

According to transferring the huge volume of produced sensitive health data of patients who do not want their private medical information to be revealed, dealing with security issues of IoT data as a major concern and a challenging problem has remained yet. Encountering this challenge, in this paper, a remote health monitoring model that applies a lightweight block encryption method for provisioning security for health and medical data in cloud-based IoT environment is presented. In this model, the patients' health statuses are determined via predicting critical situations through data mining methods for analyzing their biological data sensed by smart medical IoT devices in which a lightweight secure block encryption technique is used to ensure the patients' sensitive data become protected. Lightweight block encryption methods have a crucial effective influence on this sort of systems due to the restricted resources in IoT platforms.

However, antigen-specific T cell responses are emerging as a crucial mechanism for both clearance of the virus and as the most likely route to long-lasting immune memory that would protect against re-infection. Therefore, T cell responses are also of considerable interest in vaccine development. Furthermore, persistent alterations in T cell subset composition and function post-infection have important implications for patients long-term immune function. In this review, we examine T cell phenotypes, including those of innate T cells, in both peripheral blood and lungs, and consider how key markers of activation and exhaustion correlate with, and may be able to predict, disease severity. We focus on SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells to elucidate markers which may indicate formation of antigen-specific T cell memory. We also examine peripheral T cell phenotypes in recovery and the likelihood of long-lasting immune disruption. Finally, we discuss T cell phenotypes in the lung as important drivers of both virus clearance and tissue damage. As our knowledge of the adaptive immune response to COVID-19 rapidly evolves, it has become clear that whilst some areas of the T cell response have been investigated in some detail, others, such as the T cell response in children remain largely unexplored.

Their substrate proteins participate in a wide range of cellular processes, including transcription, survival, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Dysregulated calpain activity has been implicated in tumorigenesis, suggesting that calpains may be promising therapeutic targets. AREAS COVERED This review covers clinical and basic research studies implicating calpain-1 and calpain-2 expression and activity in tumorigenesis and metastasis. We highlight isoform specific functions and provide an overview of substrates and cancer-related signalling pathways affected by calpain-mediated proteolytic cleavage. We also discuss efforts to develop clinically relevant calpain specific inhibitors and spotlight the challenges facing inhibitor development. EXPERT OPINION Rationale for targeting calpain-1 and calpain-2 in cancer is supported by pre-clinical and clinical studies demonstrating that calpain inhibition has the potential to attenuate carcinogenesis and block metastasis of aggressive tumors. The wide range of substrates and cleavage products, paired with inconsistencies in model systems, underscores the need for more complete understanding of physiological substrates and how calpain cleavage alters their function in cellular processes. The development of isoform specific calpain inhibitors remains an important goal with therapeutic potential in cancer and other diseases.","output":"Calpain as a therapeutic target in cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Polypharmacy is an important challenge in clinical practice. We aimed at determining the effect of polypharmacy on functional outcome and treatment effect of alteplase in acute ischemic stroke. METHODS Post-hoc analysis of the randomized, placebo-controlled WAKE-UP trial of MRI-guided intravenous alteplase in unknown onset stroke. Polypharmacy was defined as intake of 5 medications at baseline. Comorbidities were assessed by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). The primary efficacy variable was favorable outcome defined by a score of 0-1 on the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days. We used logistic regression analysis to test for an association of polypharmacy with functional outcome, and for interaction of polypharmacy and the effect of thrombolysis. RESULTS Polypharmacy was present in 133/503 (26%) patients. Patients with polypharmacy were older (mean age 70 vs 64 years; P<0.0001) and had a higher score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at baseline (median 7 vs 5; P=0.0007). A comorbidity load defined by a CCI score 2 was more frequent in patients with polypharmacy (48% vs 8%; P<0.001). Polypharmacy was associated with lower odds of favorable outcome (adjusted odds ratio 0.50, 95% CI, 0.30-0.85; P=0.0099), while the CCI score was not. Treatment with alteplase was associated with higher odds of favorable outcome in both groups, with no heterogeneity of treatment effect (test for interaction of treatment and polypharmacy, P=0.29). CONCLUSION In stroke patients, polypharmacy is associated with worse functional outcome after intravenous thrombolysis independent of comorbidities. However, polypharmacy does not interact with the beneficial effect of alteplase.","output":"Polypharmacy, functional outcome, and treatment effect of intravenous alteplase for acute ischemic stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"School principals were required to engage in crisis leadership throughout New Zealands first seven-week COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020 Eighteen school principals from a range of secondary schools were interviewed about their experiences The challenges they faced included preparing students and teachers for online teaching and learning for an unknown length of time, supporting student and staff wellbeing, and communicating clearly and compassionately to all stakeholder groups Their opportunities related to strengthening digital teaching and learning, distributing leadership and resetting direction This study identifies a number of implications for future crisis leadership practice including: preparing, attending to wellbeing, communicating effectively, leading collaboratively and taking opportunities","output":"Leading through COVID-19: New Zealand secondary principals describe their reality: EMAL"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 36-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to our hospital with acute onset of left-sided chest pain.

Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane CENTRAL to identify the Randomized Controlled Trails published on Coronavirus Disease-19 between 1st Dec 2019 to 31st Aug 2021. Research articles met with study criteria were included in the study. Assessment of quality of randomized controlled trials was done using modified Jadad scale. Results: 21,259 records of randomized controlled trials were identified through database searching, out of which 90 randomized controlled trials were included in the study and, 34 (37.8%) were of high-quality, 46 (51.1%) were of moderate quality, and 10 (11.1 %) were of low-quality studies. There were 40 (44.4%), 38 (42.2%), and 12 (13.3%) randomized controlled trials published in the early, middle, and late terms with Jadad score 5.12, 5.34, and 5.68 respectively (P=0.52).

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Although COVID-19 infection is usually associated with mild disease, it can lead to severe respiratory complications. Little is known about the perioperative outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We examined patients who underwent urgent and emergent surgery at 2 hospitals in New York City from March 17 to April 15, 2020. Elective surgical procedures were cancelled throughout and routine, laboratory based COVID-19 screening was instituted on April 1. Mortality, complications, and admission to the intensive care unit were compared between patients with COVID-19 detected perioperatively and controls. RESULTS: Among 468 subjects, 36 (7.7%) had confirmed COVID-19. Among those with COVID-19, 55.6% were detected preoperatively and 44.4% postoperatively. Before the routine preoperative COVID-19 laboratory screening, 7.7% of cases were diagnosed preoperatively compared to 65.2% after institution of screening (P = 0.0008). The perioperative mortality rate was 16.7% in those with COVID-19 compared to 1.4% in COVID-19 negative subjects [aRR = 9.29; 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.68-15.21]. Serious complications were identified in 58.3% of COVID-19 subjects versus 6.0% of controls (aRR = 7.02; 95%CI, 4.96-9.92). Cardiac arrest, sepsis/shock, respiratory failure, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute kidney injury were more common in those with COVID-19. The intensive care unit admission rate was 36.1% in those with COVID-19 compared to 16.4% of controls (aRR = 1.34; 95%CI, 0.86-2.09).

In this State of the Art Review, we highlight notable examples including the use of next-generation sequencing in cancer pharmacogenomics, in the diagnosis of rare disorders, and in the tracking of infectious disease outbreaks. We also discuss progress in dissecting the molecular basis of common diseases, the role of the host microbiome, the identification of drug response biomarkers, and the repurposing of drugs. The significant challenges of implementing genomic medicine are examined, along with the innovative solutions being sought. These challenges include the difficulty in establishing clinical validity and utility of tests, how to increase awareness and promote their uptake by clinicians, a changing regulatory and coverage landscape, the need for education, and addressing the ethical aspects of genomics for patients and society. Finally, we consider the future of genomics in medicine and offer a glimpse of the forces shaping genomic medicine, such as fundamental shifts in how we define disease, how medicine is delivered to patients, and how consumers are managing their own health and affecting change.","output":"Genomic medicine: a decade of successes, challenges, and opportunities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world currently faces a pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2.

However, there is no clear evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 infection might be different across SES in Portugal. This work identifies the COVID-19 worst-affected municipalities at four different time points in Portugal measured by prevalence of cases, and seeks to determine if these worst-affected areas are associated with SES. METHODS: The worst-affected areas were defined using the spatial scan statistic for the cumulative number of cases per municipality. The likelihood of being in a worst-affected area was then modelled using logistic regressions, as a function of area-based SES and health services supply. The analyses were repeated at four different time points of the COVID-19 pandemic: 1st of April, 1st of May, 1st of June, and 1st of July, corresponding to two moments before and during the confinement period and two moments thereafter. RESULTS: Twenty municipalities were identified as worst-affected areas in all four time points, most in the coastal area in the Northern part of the country. The areas of lower unemployment were less likely to be a worst-affected area on the 1st of April [AOR = 0.36 (0.14; 0.91)], on the 1st of May [AOR = 0.03 (0.00; 0.41)], and on the 1st of July [AOR = 0.40 (0.16; 1.05)].

However, in many cases only incomplete datasets are available, particularly in health care applications, where each patient typically undergoes different clinical procedures or can drop out of a study. Since the data to train the neural networks need to be complete, most studies discard the incomplete datapoints, which reduces the size of the training data, or impute the missing features, which can lead to artefacts. Alas, both approaches are inadequate when a large portion of the data is missing. Here, we introduce GapNet, an alternative deep-learning training approach that can use highly incomplete datasets. First, the dataset is split into subsets of samples containing all values for a certain cluster of features. Then, these subsets are used to train individual neural networks. Finally, this ensemble of neural networks is combined into a single neural network whose training is fine-tuned using all complete datapoints. Using two highly incomplete real-world medical datasets, we show that GapNet improves the identification of patients with underlying Alzheimer's disease pathology and of patients at risk of hospitalization due to Covid-19. By distilling the information available in incomplete datasets without having to reduce their size or to impute missing values, GapNet will permit to extract valuable information from a wide range of datasets, benefiting diverse fields from medicine to engineering.","output":"Neural Network Training with Highly Incomplete Datasets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The neologism 'post-truth' was declared to be 'the word of the year' in 2016 by the Oxford Dictionary.

We provide preliminary findings of the system, established in a tertiary care academic center for the administration of HCQ prophylaxis to healthcare workers (HCW) based on Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) advisory. METHODS: A dedicated clinical pharmacology and internal medicine team screened for contraindications, administered informed consent, maintained compliance and monitored for adverse events. RESULTS: Among the 194 HCWs screened for ruling out contraindications for prophylaxis, 9 were excluded and 185 were initiated on HCQ. A total of 55 adverse events were seen in 38 (20.5%) HCWs out of which 70.9%, 29.1% were mild and moderate & none were severe. Before the completion of therapy, a total of 23 participants discontinued. Change in QTc interval on day 2 was 5 (IQR: ?3.75, 11) ms and the end of week 1 was 15 ms (IQR: 2, 18). Out of the 5 HCW who turned positive for COVID-19, 2 were on HCQ.

The synthesis of GVL from renewable biomass and its derivatives has great application prospects but also presents challenges due to the multiple conversion steps involved. Here, a HfCl4-mediated acid-base bifunctional catalytic system was developed, which was demonstrated to be efficient for upgrading furfural (FF) to GVL in a single pot with unprecedented performance. The Lewis acidity of Hf4+ and moderate basicity of HfO(OH)2xH2O, and strong Br?nsted acidity of HCl in situ generated from HfCl4 hydrolysis were found to play a synergistic role in the cascade reaction processes, mainly contributing to the pronounced catalytic activity. The effects of the key reaction parameters, such as the catalyst dosage, reaction time, and temperature, on GVL production were optimized by response surface methodology. It is worth mentioning that the recovered catalyst after thermal treatment could be directly used for the hydrogen transfer processes, like FF-to-furfuryl alcohol conversion. This catalytic strategy opens a new avenue for the selective conversion of biomass feedstocks involving multiple steps and complex processes.","output":"One-step upgrading of bio-based furfural to ?3-valerolactone via HfCl4-mediated bifunctional catalysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gastrointestinal symptoms, especially diarrhea, are common with novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors are heavily expressed in enterocytes and serve as entry receptors for SARS-CoV-2. ACE-2 receptors may also be responsible for pancreatic injury in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Diarrhea associated with SARS-CoV-2 is usually believed to be due to viral invasion of enterocytes. However, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency resulting from SARS-CoV-2 is another plausible mechanism leading to diarrhea in such patients. We present a case series of three SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with predominant respiratory symptoms at presentation who developed diarrhea, and further fecal analysis revealed exocrine pancreatic insufficiency as the underlying mechanism.

The dominant idea that \\"we are in this together\\" needs to be critically unpacked to understand the differential impact of the same pandemic on people with varied vulnerabilities. The concept of \\"intersectional vulnerability\\" has been key to understanding the unequal distribution of the pandemic risk. Using a gendered intersectional lens, this paper aims to understand the lived experiences of migrant women workers during the pandemic and their narratives of gendered inequality. Through a narrative study in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), India, from May to October 2020, this study brings out stories of precarity faced by five migrant women while battling the social, psychological, and economic effects of the pandemic. Loss of livelihood, home, savings, and prospects of a better future shape the narratives of these women. The pandemic exacerbated the already precarious positions of these women by creating a situation where-(a) patriarchal structures were further reinforced, and (b) losing gender solidarity and companionship through lockdown and social distancing.","output":"Where is my home?: Gendered precarity and the experience of COVID-19 among women migrant workers from Delhi and National Capital Region, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increased vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to reduce the incidence of anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers.

In parallel, the country has been experiencing a remarkable nutrition transition that has contributed to the burden of malnutrition and non-communicable diseases, all imposing serious repercussions on people's livelihoods, food security, and health. Such circumstances have prodded public demand for guidance on affordable, healthy, and sustainable dietary choices to alleviate the burden to this emerging unfortunate situation. Objective: The purpose of this study is to provide evidence-based sustainable and healthy dietary recommendations which balance the tradeoffs among the health, environmental footprint and cost dimensions of sustainability, while closely resembling the usual food consumption pattern. Methodology: Data from the latest available national food consumption survey was used as the usual food consumption pattern of Lebanese adults. Optimized dietary patterns were calculated using the optimization model Optimeal which produced patterns most similar to the usual diet and simultaneously satisfying the three main sets of constraints: health, environmental footprints, and cost. The identified healthy and sustainable dietary options were vetted by multiple key stakeholders from the government, academia, international, and national non-governmental organizations. Results: Compared to the usual intake, the optimized diet included higher intakes of whole grain bread, dark green vegetables, dairy products, and legumes, and lower intakes of refined bread, meat, poultry, added sugars, saturated fat, as compared to usual national mean consumption. The optimized dietary model resulted in a decrease in the associated environmental footprints: water use (?6%); and GHG (?22%) with no change in energy use. The cost of the optimized diet was not different from that of the usual intake. Conclusion: An evidence-based sustainable and healthy diet was developed for Lebanon providing the population and policy makers with some answers to a complex situation. Findings highlight the need for the development of sustainable food based dietary guidelines for Lebanon to promote diets that are healthy, sustainable, culturally acceptable, and affordable and that can alleviate food insecurity among the general population.","output":"Promoting Sustainable and Healthy Diets to Mitigate Food Insecurity Amidst Economic and Health Crises in Lebanon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Physician burnout and wellbeing are an ongoing concern. Limited research has reported on the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on burnout among U.S. physicians. Methods: We surveyed U.S. frontline physicians at two time points (wave one in May-June 2020 and wave two in Dec 2020-Jan 2021) using a validated burnout measure. The survey was emailed to a national stratified random sample of family physicians, internists, hospitalists, intensivists, emergency medicine physicians, and infectious disease physicians. Burnout was assessed with the Professional Fulfillment Index Burnout Composite scale (PFI-BC). Quantile regression was used to estimate the change in median PFI-BC scales, adjusting for physician, geographic, and pandemic covariates. Results: : Overall, 38.1% of 286 respondents reported PFI-BC scores consistent with burnout in wave one, and 33.1% of 262 respondents in wave two. Burnout declined or was unchanged among all specialties surveyed apart from hospitalists. 34.2% of primary care physicians reported burnout in wave one and 29.7% in wave two. Burnout declined among critical care (53.5% to 43.1%) and emergency physicians (50.6% to 44.5%);but hospitalist burnout rates increased (27% to 44.2%). Conclusions: : Rates of physician burnout during the first year of the pandemic appear to be comparable to pre-pandemic rates. We found no evidence of increasing burnout over a six month period, apart from hospitalist respondents.

While COVID-19 poses higher health risks for older adults, it is unknown whether older adults are also facing higher financial risks as a result of COVID-19 scams. Here, we examined age differences in vulnerability to COVID-19 scams and individual difference measures (such as impulsivity, ad skepticism, and past experiences with fraud) that might help explain them. A lifespan sample (M = 48.03, SD = 18.56) of sixty-eight younger (18C40 years, M = 25.67, SD = 5.93), 79 middle-aged (41C64 years, M = 49.86, SD = 7.20), and 63 older adults (65C84 years, M = 69.87, SD = 4.50) recruited through Prolific completed questions and questionnaires online. In a within-subjects design, each participant responded to five COVID-19 solicitations, psychological measures, and demographic questions. Age group comparisons revealed that older adults were marginally less likely to perceive COVID-19 solicitations as genuine than middle-aged adults were. In addition, older adults perceived significantly fewer benefits than both younger and middle-aged adults did and perceived marginally higher risks than younger adults did. Hence, older adults did not exhibit greater vulnerability to COVID-19 scams. Regardless of age, intentions to respond to COVID-19 solicitations were positively predicted by higher levels of educational attainment, being married, past fraud victimization, and higher levels of positive urgency. As expected, stronger genuineness and benefit perceptions positively predicted action intentions, whereas stronger risk perceptions negatively predicted action intentions As such, COVID-19 scam susceptibility appears to be the result of a impulse control issue that is not easily inhibited, not even by past experiences of scam victimization.","output":"Susceptibility to COVID-19 Scams: The Roles of Age, Individual Difference Measures, and Scam-Related Perceptions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study was designed and implemented as a rapid survey of the psychosocial impacts of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), known as COVID-19 in residents across the United Kingdom.

However, many data sets that could inform science and policy during an emerging event do not exist or are only released months or years later. Here, we synthesize multiple data sources from across the seafood supply chain, including unconventional real-time data sets, to show the relative initial responses and indicators of recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic. We synthesized news articles from January to September 2020 that reported effects of COVID-19 on the US seafood sector, including processor closures, shortened fishing seasons and loss of revenue. Concerning production and distribution, we assessed past and present landings and trade data and found substantial declines in fresh seafood catches (-40%), imports (-37%) and exports (-43%) relative to the previous year, while frozen seafood products were generally less affected. Google search trends and seafood market foot traffic data suggest consumer demand for seafood from restaurants dropped by upwards of 70% during lockdowns, with recovery varying by state. However, these declines were partially offset by an increase (270%) in delivery and takeout service searches. Our synthesis of open-access data sets and media reports shows widespread, but heterogeneous, ramifications of COVID-19 across the seafood sector, implying that policymakers should focus support on states and sub-sectors most affected by the pandemic: fishery-dependent communities, processors, and fisheries and aquaculture that focus on fresh products.","output":"Early effects of COVID-19 on US fisheries and seafood consumption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of telehealth in the management of patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The COVID-19 outbreak during the study period provided an opportunity to evaluate any pandemic influence on how telehealth was perceived by patients and physicians. METHODS: We included patients with AIH who were followed in the Harran University hospital, Turkey. Patients were managed by either remote telehealth or standard care. RESULTS: A total of 46 (telehealth, n=19 and standard care, n= 27) patients (40 female) with a median age of 32 (range 17-74) years at diagnosis were included in the study. Until the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the rates of biochemical remission and relapse after remission were similar in the telehealth and standard care groups (89.5% vs. 89.1% and 15.8% vs. 25.9%, p=ns, for both). The telehealth group maintained remission significantly better than the standard care group (100% vs. 77.3%, p=0.035) during the COVID-19 period. All relapses were due to non-adherence to therapy. Psychiatric problems, pregnancy-related issues and drug side-effects could all be managed remotely by telehealth. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we show for the first time that telehealth is a feasible alternative for managing AIH, both under normal circumstances and during the COVID-19 pandemic. EXPERT OPINION: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) requires long-life lifelong immunosuppression and follow-up for most patients. The use of telehealth may be an alternative way to evaluate these patients remotely. We show for the first time that telehealth is effective and useful in the management of AIH in regular time as well during COVID-19.

Some vertebrates, such as newts and zebrafish, regenerate the heart throughout their lives. To understand how regenerative abilities differ among animal species, comparative research has been conducted in animals like mouse, zebrafish, and newt. For those purposes, cryo-injury is suitable as an experimental model for the pathological condition of human myocardial infarction. In fact, cryo-injury procedures are common in mouse and zebrafish. RESULTS: In the present study, we induced cryo-damage on the ventricle in Iberian ribbed newts using a liquid nitrogen-chilled probe. We observed that the injured area recovered within 8 weeks, with remodeling of scar tissue and proliferation of cardiomyocytes. We investigated the subsequent recovery of cryo-injured and amputated tissues by comparative analysis of the gene expression profiles following these two procedures. CONCLUSION: Notably, we established a cryo-injury procedure for the newt and confirmed that regeneration of the cryo-damaged myocardial tissue is achieved by changes in gene expression that are milder than those observed in the amputation model. Our results suggest that the cryo-injury method is suitable for comparing the process of cardiac regeneration in the newt with that in other animal models. This article is protected by copyright.

As a result, the investigation of hub genes for the discovery of potential therapeutic targets and candidate biomarkers is warranted. In this study, we used the ComBat method to merge three gene expression datasets of AD from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). During combined analysis, we identified 850 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the temporal cortex of AD and cognitively normal (CN) samples. We performed weighted gene coexpression network analysis to build gene coexpression networks incorporating these DEGs to identify key modules and hub genes. We found one module most strongly correlated with AD onset as the key module and 19 hub genes in the key module that were down-regulated in AD brains. According to Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses, DEGs were mostly enriched in synapse function, and genes in the key module were mostly related to learning and memory. We selected five little-studied genes, AP3B2, GABRD, GPR158, KIAA0513, and MAL2, to validate their expression in AD mouse model by performing quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We found that all of them were down-regulated in cortices of 8-month 5xFAD mice compared to those of wild-type mice. We then further investigated their correlations with -secretase activity and A42 levels in AD samples of different Braak stages. We found that all five hub genes had significant negative associations with -secretase activity and that AP3B2 and KIAA0513 had significant negative associations with A42 levels. We tested the differential expressions of the five hub genes in two AD GEO datasets from the blood and found that KIAA0513 was significantly up-regulated in patients with both mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD and was able to differentiate MCI and AD from CN in the two datasets. In conclusion, these five novel vulnerable genes were involved in AD progression, and KIAA0513 was a promising candidate biomarker for early diagnosis of AD.","output":"Identification of KIAA0513 and Other Hub Genes Associated With Alzheimer Disease Using Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To evaluate technology use, eHealth literacy and feature preferences for a smartphone application with patient portal among women with pelvic floor disorders (PFD).

Statistics are descriptive. Results: 41 (75.9%) were aged 30-69, and 52 (96.3%) had a high school diploma or higher. 51 (94.4%) owned a smartphone deviceand 42 (77.8%) ever used a smartphone application. Mean eHEALS score was 28.1 +/- 6.2. Most reported knowing how/where to find useful health information online. Only 29 (53.7%) were comfortable assessing quality of online resources, and 18 (33.3%) felt confident using online information to make health decisions. 45 (83.3%) felt that a smartphone application could positively impact satisfaction, communication and coordination of PFD care. Most valued application features included PFD information resources (94.4%), decision aids (92.6%), and communication with healthcare team (90.7%). Conclusions: Many women with PFD would value a smartphone application to support shared decision-making. Users should be involved in the feature selection process.

Failed turnover of protein aggregates (both AD/PD related aggregates and the ASC speck) by protein degradation pathways, prionoid propagation of inflammation by the ASC speck, cross-seeding of protein aggregation by the ASC speck, and pro-aggregatory cleavage of proteins by caspase-1 are some of the mechanisms that exacerbate disease progression. We also review studies that provide this causal framework and highlight how the ASC speck serves as a platform for the propagation and spreading of inflammation and protein aggregation that drives AD and PD.","output":"Crosstalk Between the NLRP3 Inflammasome/ASC Speck and Amyloid Protein Aggregates Drives Disease Progression in Alzheimers and Parkinsons Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the pandemic, the US has seen increases in substance use and the number of deaths by overdose.

Pseudotyped viruses that mimic SARS-CoV-2 have been widely used for in vitro evaluation because they are available in BSL-2 containment laboratories; however, in vivo application is inadequate. Therefore, animal models that can be instigated with animal BSL-2 will increase opportunities for in vivo evaluations. Methods Hamsters (6-to 10-week-old males) were intratracheally inoculated with luciferase-expressing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus. The lungs were harvested 24 h after inoculation, and luminescence was measured using an in vivo imaging system. Results Lung luminescence after inoculation with the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus increased in a dose-dependent manner. VSV-G (envelope [G]) pseudotyped virus also induced luminescence; however, a 100-fold concentration was required to reach a level similar to that of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus. Conclusions The SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus is applicable to SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections in a hamster model. Because of the single-round infectious virus, the model can be used to study the steps from viral binding to entry, which will be useful for future research regarding SARS-CoV-2 entry without using live SARS-CoV-2 or transgenic animals.","output":"A novel hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection using a pseudotyped virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is a high-risk viral agent involved in the recent pandemic stated worldwide by the World Health Organization The infection is correlated to a severe systemic and respiratory disease in many cases, which is clinically treated with a multi-drug pharmacological approach The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate through a literature overview the effect of adjuvant therapies and supplements for the SARS-CoV-2 infection The research has analyzed the advantage of the EK1C4, by also assessing the studies on the resveratrol, vitamin D, and melatonin as adjuvant supplements for long hauler patients prognosis The evaluated substances reported important benefits for the improvement of the immune system and as a potential inhibitor molecules against SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the use of sartans as therapy The adjuvant supplements seem to create an advantage for the healing of the long hauler patients affected by chronic symptoms of constant chest and heart pain, intestinal disorders, headache, difficulty concentrating, memory loss, and tachycardia","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Disease Adjuvant Therapies and Supplements Breakthrough for the Infection Prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been documented that grit plays an indispensable role in the process of language learning and teaching.

Despite qualitative discussions of potential social-economic causes, it remains unclear how this pattern could be accounted for from a quantitative approach. Through the development of an urban epidemic hazard index (EpiRank), we came up with a mathematical explanation for this phenomenon. The index is constructed from epidemic simulations on a multi-layer transportation network model on top of local SEIR transmission dynamics, which characterizes intra- and inter-city compartment population flow with a detailed mathematical description. Essentially, we argue that these highlighted cities possess greater epidemic hazards due to the combined effect of large regional population and small inter-city transportation.

A questionnaire was given to all 47 teachers. One-on-one interview with great attention to the measures of reducing the transmission of Covid-19 was conducted to all senior five physics teachers. Research findings revealed that video-based multimedia is less used in teaching and learning physics. Teachers indicated that poor infrastructure, poor teachers' training aimed at effective integration of multimedia in education, pressure to prepare students for exams, and teachers' lack of time for preparation are major factors that impede the use of video-based multimedia in teaching and learning physics.

Due to the cessation of all non-emergent surgical cases in the USA and worldwide, the professional lives and practices of many physicians have been negatively affected. However, among different physicians and specifically plastic surgeons, cosmetic/aesthetic plastic surgeons have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as the majority of their cases are semi-elective and elective. The ability to perform semi-elective and elective cases is dependent on state and local authorities regulations, and it is currently uncertain when the ban, if ever, will be completely lifted. Financial constraints on patients and their future inability to pay for these procedures due to the COVID-19-related economic recession are things to consider. Overall, the goal of this unprecedented time for cosmetic/aesthetic plastic surgeons is for their medical practices to survive, to conserve cash flow although income is low to none, and to maintain their personal finances. In this paper, the authors review the financial impacts of the current COVID-19 pandemic on the practices of cosmetic plastic surgeons in the USA and worldwide, along with some potential approaches to maintain their practices and financial livelihoods.

The virus first emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and subsequently spreaded around the world. Genomic analyses revealed that this zoonotic virus may be evolved naturally but not a purposefully manipulated laboratory construct. However, currently available data are not sufficient to precisely conclude the origin of this fearsome virus. Comprehensive annotations of the whole-genomes revealed hundreds of nucleotides, and amino acids mutations, substitutions and/or deletions at different positions of the ever changing SARS-CoV-2 genome. The spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 possesses a functional polybasic (furin) cleavage site at the S1-S2 boundary through the insertion of 12 nucleotides. It leads to the predicted acquisition of 3-O-linked glycan around the cleavage site.

Use of real-time ultrasound guidance has been shown to improve the technical accuracy of percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy; however, it is unclear if there is an associated reduction in complications. Our objective was to determine whether the peri-procedural use of real-time ultrasound guidance is associated with a reduction in complications of percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy using a propensity score analysis. METHODS This study reviewed all percutaneous dilatational tracheostomies performed in an 8-year period in a neurocritical care unit. Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomies were typically performed by trainees under guidance of the attending intensivist. Bronchoscopic guidance was used for all procedures with addition of real-time ultrasound guidance at the discretion of the attending physician. Real-time ultrasound guidance was used to guide endotracheal tube withdrawal, guide tracheal puncture, identify guidewire entry level and confirm bilateral lung sliding. The primary outcome was a composite of previously defined complications including (among others) bleeding, infection, loss of airway, inability to complete procedure, need for revision, granuloma and early dislodgement. Propensity score analysis was used to ensure that the relationship of not using real-time ultrasound guidance with the probability of an adverse outcome was examined within groups of patients having similar covariate profiles. Covariates included were age, gender, body mass index, diagnosis, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, timing of tracheostomy, positive end-expiratory pressure and presence of risk factors including coagulopathy, cervical spine immobilization and prior tracheostomy. RESULTS A total of 200 patients underwent percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy during the specified period, and 107 received real-time ultrasound guidance. Risk factors for percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy were present in 63 (32%). There were nine complications in the group without real-time ultrasound guidance: bleeding (n = 4), need for revision related to inability to ventilate or dislodgement (n = 3) and symptomatic granuloma (n = 2). There was one complication in the real-time ultrasound guidance group (early dislodgement). The odds of having an adverse outcome for patients receiving real-time ultrasound guidance were significantly lower (odds ratio = 0.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.009 to 0.811; P = 0.032) than for those receiving a standard technique while holding the propensity score quartile fixed.

METHODS: Cardiac computed tomography (CT) integrated by electroanatomical mapping was used for substrate identification and merged with dedicated CT scans for treatment plan preparation. A single 25-Gy radioablation dose was delivered by a LINAC-based volumetric modulated arc therapy technique in a non-invasive matter. The primary safety endpoint was treatment-related adverse effects during acute and long-term follow-up (FU), obtained by regular in-hospital controls and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) remote monitoring. The primary efficacy endpoint was the reduction at 3 and 6 months of VT episodes and ICD shocks. RESULTS: Seven out of eight patients (men; age, 70  7 years; ejection fraction, 27  11%; 3 ischemic, 4 non-ischemic cardiomyopathies) underwent SBRT. At a median 8-month FU, no treatment-related serious adverse event occurred. Three patients died from non-SBRT-related causes. Four patients completed the 6-month FU: the number of VT decreased from 29  33 to 11  9 (p = .05) and 2  2 (p = .08), at 3 and 6 months, respectively; shocks decreased from 11 to 0 and 2, respectively. At 6 months, all patients. showed a significant reduction of VT episodes and no electrical storm recurrence, with the complete regression of iterative VTs in 2/2 patients.

Hyponatraemia in COVID-19 is common with a prevalence of 20C30% and is mostly due to SIAD or hypovolaemia. It mirrors disease severity and is an early predictor of mortality. Hypernatraemia may also develop in COVID-19 patients, with a prevalence of 3C5%, especially in ICU, and derives from different multifactorial reasons, for example, due to insensible water losses from pyrexia, increased respiration rate and use of diuretics. Hypernatraemic dehydration may contribute to the high risk of acute kidney injury in COVID-19. IV fluid replacement should be administered with caution in severe cases of COVID-19 because of the risk of pulmonary oedema.","output":"ENDOCRINOLOGY IN THE TIME OF COVID-19-2021 UPDATES: The management of diabetes insipidus and hyponatraemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To study the clinical profile, predictors of mortality, and outcomes of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. DESIGN A prospective observational study. SETTING PICU, Advanced Pediatric Centre, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India. PATIENTS All children (age > 1 mo to < 14 yr) admitted in PICU with a diagnosis of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (as per Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference definition) from August 1, 2015, to November 2016. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Out of 1,215 children admitted to PICU, 124 (11.4%) had pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. Fifty-six children (45.2%) died. Median age was 2.75 years (1.0-6.0 yr) and 66.9% were male. Most common primary etiologies were pneumonia, severe sepsis, and scrub typhus. Ninety-seven children (78.2%) were invasively ventilated. On multiple logistic regressions, Lung Injury Score (p = 0.004), pneumothorax (p = 0.012), acute kidney injury at enrollment (p = 0.033), FIO2-D1 (p = 0.018), and PaO2/FIO2 ratio-D7 (p = 0.020) were independent predictors of mortality. Positive fluid balance (a cut-off value > 102.5 mL/kg; p = 0.016) was associated with higher mortality at 48 hours. Noninvasive oxygenation variables like oxygenation saturation index and saturation-FIO2 ratio were comparable to previously used invasive variables (oxygenation index and PaO2/FIO2 ratio) in monitoring the course of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. CONCLUSIONS Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome contributes to a significant burden in the PICU of a developing country and is associated with significantly higher mortality. Infection remains the most common etiology. Higher severity of illness scores at admission, development of pneumothorax, and a positive fluid balance at 48 hours predicted poor outcome.","output":"Clinical Profile and Predictors of Outcome of Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in a PICU: A Prospective Observational Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of samples in biological experiments is continuously increasing, but complex protocols and human error in many cases lead to suboptimal data quality and hence difficulties in reproducing scientific findings. Laboratory automation can alleviate many of these problems by precisely reproducing machine-readable protocols. These instruments generally require high up-front investments, and due to the lack of open application programming interfaces (APIs), they are notoriously difficult for scientists to customize and control outside of the vendor-supplied software. Here, automated, high-throughput experiments are demonstrated for interdisciplinary research in life science that can be replicated on a modest budget, using open tools to ensure reproducibility by combining the tools OpenFlexure, Opentrons, ImJoy, and UC2. This automated sample preparation and imaging pipeline can easily be replicated and established in many laboratories as well as in educational contexts through easy-to-understand algorithms and easy-to-build microscopes. Additionally, the creation of feedback loops, with later pipetting or imaging steps depending on the analysis of previously acquired images, enables the realization of fully autonomous \\"smart\\" microscopy experiments.

We identify some discoveries that may have clinical implications. METHODS The model requires 60-day-gestation fetal lambs. In lambs, glomerulogenesis is complete by 90 days gestation. (Term is 145 days.) The ability to develop a reliable method of creating bladder outlet obstruction in females, ligating both the urethra and urachus was critical. The lambs are bred to an accuracy of 24 h. RESULTS Creating the model at 50-60 days gestation, produces different expressions of renal dysplasia in groups of lambs undergoing identical interventions at the same stage of gestation. Early complete urethral obstruction can produce the Potter phenotype. An appropriately timed vesico-amniotic shunt preserves renal development, producing a shrunken, non-compliant bladder. Shunting the normal fetal bladder at 80 days gestation produces a similar bladder. Provision of a low-pressure valve in the shunt preserves bladder development and compliance. Using a high-pressure shunt produces results similar to non-shunted lambs. DISCUSSION We developed a reliable animal model for obstructive uropathy.

METHODS Between January 2006 and April 2010, a total of 96 patients underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Of these, 74 (77.1%) underwent conventional transabdominal laparoscopic adrenalectomy (group 1) and 22 (32.9%) underwent SILA (group 2). Age, sex ratio, tumor size, operating time, blood loss, postoperative visual analog pain scale (VAS) scores, and duration of hospitalization were compared between the two groups. RESULTS The mean ages of the patients in groups 1 and 2 were 43.4  12.3 and 43.3  10 years, respectively (P = 0.7). The female:male ratios in groups 1 and 2 were 1.6:1 and 4.5:1, respectively (P < 0.0001). The mean tumor size was significantly larger in group 1 than in group 2 (4.7  1.5 vs. 3.34  1.06 cm, respectively; P = 0.093). No significant difference was found between group 1 and group 2 with respect to the mean operating time (68.4  20.8 vs. 63.9  16.9 min, respectively; P = 0.36) or the level of intraoperative blood loss (38  26.5 vs. 48.4  62.4 ml, respectively; P = 0.26). The postoperative VAS score was significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1 (2.05  0.57 and 3.28  0.63, respectively; P < 0.0001). The length of hospital stay was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (3.04  1.2 and 2.45  0.96 days, respectively; P = 0.04).

However, the implementation of health legal preparedness differs between low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) and developed countries. OBJECTIVE: This paper examines recent trends regarding public health legal preparedness for emergencies and discusses its role in the recent Ebola outbreak. DESIGN: A rigorous literature review was conducted using eight electronic databases as well as Google Scholar. The results encompassed peer-reviewed English articles, reports, theses, and position papers dating from 2011 to 2014. Earlier articles concerning regulatory actions were also examined. RESULTS: The importance of PHLP has grown during the past decade and focuses mainly on infectionCdisease scenarios. Amid LMICs, it mostly refers to application of international regulations, whereas in developed states, it focuses on independent legislation and creation of conditions optimal to promoting an effective emergency management. Among developed countries, the United States utilisation of health legal preparedness is the most advanced, including the creation of a model comprising four elements: law, competencies, information, and coordination. Only limited research has been conducted in this field to date. Nevertheless, in both developed and developing states, studies that focused on regulations and laws activated in health systems during emergencies, identified inconsistency and incoherence. The Ebola outbreak plaguing West Africa since 2014 has global implications, challenges and paralleling results, that were identified in this review. CONCLUSIONS: The review has shown the need to broaden international regulations, to deepen reciprocity between countries, and to consider LMICs health capacities, in order to strengthen the national health security.

For studies conducted across a country or territory, we used the seroprevalence estimate and the upper and lower CIs and compared them to the total number of reported infections to calculate the ratio of reported to expected infections. RESULTS: We identified 23 population-based seroprevalence studies conducted in Europe.

Whether rich or poor, all nations are struggling to cope with this new global health crisis. The speed of the threat's emergence and the quick response required from public health authorities and the public itself makes evident the need for a major reform in pandemic surveillance and notification systems. The development and implementation of a graded, individual-level pandemic notification system could be an effective tool to combat future threats of epidemics. This paper describes a prototype model of such a notification system and its potential advantages and challenges for implementation. Similar to other emergency alerts, this system would include a number of threat levels (level 1-5) with a higher level indicating increasing severity and intensity of safety measures (eg, level 1: general hygiene, level 2: enhanced hygiene, level 3: physical distancing, level 4: shelter in place, and level 5: lockdown). The notifications would be transmitted to cellular devices via text message (for lower threat levels) or push notification (for higher threat levels). The notification system would allow the public to be informed about the threat level in real time and act accordingly in an organized manner. New Zealand and the United Kingdom have recently launched similar alert systems designed to coordinate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic response more efficiently. Implementing such a system, however, faces multiple challenges. Extensive preparation and coordination among all levels of government and relevant sectors are required. Additionally, such systems may be effective primarily in countries where there exists at least moderate trust in government. Advance and ongoing public education about the nature of the system and its steps would be an essential part of the system, such that all members of the public understand the meaning of each step in advance, similar to what has been established in systems for other emergency responses. This educational component is of utmost importance to minimize adverse public reaction and unintended consequences. The use of mass media and local communities could be considered where mobile phone penetration is low. The implementation of such a notification system would be more challenging in developing countries for several reasons, including inadequate technology, limited use of data plans, high population density, poverty, mistrust in government, and tendency to ignore or failure to understand the warning messages. Despite the challenges, an individual-level pandemic notification system could provide added benefits by giving an additional route for notification that would be complementary to existing platforms.","output":"Considerations for an Individual-Level Population Notification System for Pandemic Response: A Review and Prototype"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neurologists have a particular interest in SARS-CoV-2 because the nervous system is a major participant in Covid-19, both in its acute phase and in its persistent post-Covid phase.

BACKGROUND: Nurses express several concerns during disease outbreaks, some of which are related to ethical dilemmas. EVALUATION: It is an integrative review in which four databases were searched. Critical appraisal tools and PRISMA guidelines were used. Content analysis was performed to analyse the obtained data. KEY ISSUES: A total of 14 studies were identified. The results are presented into four categories: concerns with beneficenceCnonmaleficence; awareness of need for autonomy; challenges to justice; and coping with ethical dilemmas. CONCLUSION: While caring for patients during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, nurses often put their own health and that of their families at risk. The ethical dilemmas faced by nurses are mainly caused by the lack of Protective Personal Equipment (PPE), shortages of medical supplies and personnel and the uncertainties that permeate an environment threatened by a new and highly contagious disease such as COVID\\\\19. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: This review provides information that can inspire nurse managers working during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic to support and empower nurses to act in accordance with ethical principles, which is important in order for nurses to protect themselves while providing efficient and effective care.","output":"Ethical dilemmas experienced by nurses while caring for patients during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic: An integrative review of qualitative studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Metallopeptidases of the M1 family are found in all phyla (except viruses) and are important in the cell cycle and normal growth and development. M1s often have spatiotemporal expression patterns which allow for strict regulation of activity. Mutations in the genes encoding M1s result in disease and are often lethal. This family of zinc metallopeptidases all share the catalytic region containing a signature amino acid exopeptidase (GXMXN) and a zinc binding (HEXXH[18X]E) motif. In addition, M1 aminopeptidases often also contain additional membrane association and/or protein interaction motifs. These protein interaction domains may function independently of M1 enzymatic activity and can contribute to multifunctionality of the proteins. SCOPE: A brief review of M1 metalloproteases in plants and animals and their roles in the cell cycle is presented. In animals, human puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA) acts during mitosis and perhaps meiosis, while the insect homologue puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PAM-1) is required for meiotic and mitotic exit; the remaining human M1 family members appear to play a direct or indirect role in mitosis/cell proliferation. In plants, meiotic prophase aminopeptidase 1 (MPA1) is essential for the first steps in meiosis, and aminopeptidase M1 (APM1) appears to be important in mitosis and cell division. CONCLUSIONS: M1 metalloprotease activity in the cell cycle is conserved across phyla. The activities of the multifunctional M1s, processing small peptides and peptide hormones and contributing to protein trafficking and signal transduction processes, either directly or indirectly impact on the cell cycle. Identification of peptide substrates and interacting protein partners is required to understand M1 function in fertility and normal growth and development in plants.","output":"The role of multifunctional M1 metallopeptidases in cell cycle progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is immune-driven pathologies that are observed in severe cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection. SARS-CoV emerged in 2002 to 2003 and led to a global outbreak of SARS. As with the outcome of human infection, intranasal infection of C57BL/6J mice with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV results in high-titer virus replication within the lung, induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and immune cell infiltration within the lung. Using this model, we investigated the role of the complement system during SARS-CoV infection. We observed activation of the complement cascade in the lung as early as day 1 following SARS-CoV infection. To test whether this activation contributed to protective or pathologic outcomes, we utilized mice deficient in C3 (C3(C/C)), the central component of the complement system. Relative to C57BL/6J control mice, SARS-CoV-infected C3(C/C) mice exhibited significantly less weight loss and less respiratory dysfunction despite equivalent viral loads in the lung. Significantly fewer neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes were present in the lungs of C3(C/C) mice than in C56BL/6J controls, and subsequent studies revealed reduced lung pathology and lower cytokine and chemokine levels in both the lungs and the sera of C3(C/C) mice than in controls. These studies identify the complement system as an important host mediator of SARS-CoV-induced disease and suggest that complement activation regulates a systemic proinflammatory response to SARS-CoV infection. Furthermore, these data suggest that SARS-CoV-mediated disease is largely immune driven and that inhibiting complement signaling after SARS-CoV infection might function as an effective immune therapeutic.","output":"Complement Activation Contributes to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the advancement of laparoscopic devices and surgical technology, the era of minimal invasive surgery has progressed to reduced-port surgery, and finally to single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS).

We aimed to investigate an association between viral LRTI at <5 years and the development of atopy at > 2 years. METHODS: We conducted a search at Embase, Pubmed, Web of Science, and Global Index Medicus. We collected data from the included articles. We estimated the odds ratio and the 95% confidence intervals with a random effect model. We determined factors associated with atopy development after childhood LRTI using univariate and multivariate meta-regression analyses. We recorded this systematic review at PROSPERO with the number CRD42018116955. RESULTS: We included 24 studies. There was no relationship between viral LRTI at <5 years and skin prick test-diagnosed-atopy (OR = 1.2, [95% CI = 0.7C2.0]), unknown diagnosed-atopy (OR = 0.7, [95% CI = 0.4C1.3]), atopic dermatitis (OR = 1.2, [95% CI = 0.9C1.6]), hyperreactivity to pollen (OR = 0.8, [95% CI = 0.3C2.7]), food (OR = 0.8, [95% CI = 0.3C2.5]), or house dust mite (OR = 1.1, [95% CI = 0.6C2.2]). Although not confirmed in all studies with a symmetric distribution of the 23 confounding factors investigated, the overall analyses showed that there was a relationship between childhood viral LRTI at < 5 years and serum test diagnosed-atopy (OR = 2.0, [95% CI = 1.0C4.1]), allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (OR = 1.7, [95% CI = 1.1C2.9]), hyperreactivity diagnosed by serum tests with food (OR = 5.3, [1.7C16.7]) or inhaled allergens (OR = 4.2, [95% CI = 2.1C8.5]), or furred animals (OR = 0.6, [95% CI = 0.5C0.9]). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that there is no association between viral LRTI at < 5 years and the majority of categories of atopy studied during this work. These results, however, are not confirmed for the remaining categories of atopy and more particularly those diagnosed by serum tests.

However, this has not been validated for agreement between dry matter content and observed fecal consistency. Therefore, a comparison of observed fecal consistency score to fecal percent dry matter and Cryptosporidium parvum oocyst shedding was performed to assess the accuracy of observational scoring as a measure of diarrhea and its association with number of oocysts shed. Fecal samples from 20 dairy calves experimentally infected with C. parvum oocysts were collected daily post-infection and scored on a scale from 1 to 4, with 1 being normal feces to 4 being severe diarrhea. An aliquot of each sample was analyzed for percent dry matter and Cryptosporidium oocyst counts by using immunofluorescent microscopy. Fecal consistency scores of 1, 2, 3, and 4 had median percent dry matter of 20.9, 16.3, 9.6, and 5.8, respectively. Using percent dry matter assessed by fecal consistency scoring were significantly different from each other (P < 0.001). A higher fecal consistency score also was associated with a greater number of Cryptosporidium oocysts shed (P < 0 .0001).

Methods Using publicly available data from the National Center for Health Statistics on deaths occurring in the US in 2020, we calculated per-capita COVID-19 mortality by industry and occupation. We additionally calculated per-capita COVID-19 mortality by essential industry---essential or not---by age group, sex, and race/ethnicity. Results Among non-military individuals and individuals with a known industry or occupation, there were 48,030 reported COVID-19 deaths, representing 25.1 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 working-age individuals after age standardization.

This drought has had major socio-economic effects particularly on the large impoverished rural population as well as on some urban areas where supplied water services have broken down in several cases. The region is influenced by both midlatitude and tropical systems leading to a complex regional meteorology that hitherto has not been much studied compared to other parts of South Africa. Here, the ongoing drought is examined in the context of long-term trends and the interannual rainfall variability of the region. Although the region has experienced drought in all seasons since 2015, focus here is placed on the spring (SeptemberCNovember) which shows the most consistent and robust signal. On average, this season contributes between about 25C35% of the annual rainfall total. Based on CHIRPS data, it is found that this season shows a significant decreasing trend in both rainfall totals as well as the number of rainfall days (but not heavy rainfall days) for spring over most of the province since 1981. On interannual time scales, the results indicate that dry (wet) springs over the Eastern Cape are associated with a cyclonic (anticyclonic) anomaly southeast of South Africa as part of a shift in the zonal wavenumber 3 pattern in the midlatitudes. Over the landmass, a stronger (weaker) Botswana High is also apparent with increased (decreased) subsidence over and near the Eastern Cape which is less (more) favourable for cloud band development and hence reduced (enhanced) rainfall during dry (wet) springs. Analysis of mid-century (2040C2060) CMIP5 rainfall projections suggests that there may be a flattening of the annual cycle over the Eastern Cape with the winter becoming wetter and the summer drier. For the spring season of interest here, the multi-model projections also indicate drying but less pronounced than that projected for the summer.","output":"Drought in the Eastern Cape region of South Africa and trends in rainfall characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Haze is a recurrent problem in Southeast Asia. Exposure to haze is linked to ophthalmic, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and mortality. In this study, we investigated the role of demographic factors, knowledge and perceived risk in influencing protective behaviours during the 2013 haze in Singapore. METHODS We evaluated 696 adults in a cross-sectional study. Participants were sampled via a 2-stage simple random sampling without replacement from a large residential district in Singapore in 2015. The questionnaire measured the participant's knowledge, perceived risk and behaviours during the Southeast Asian haze crisis in 2013. Reliability and validity of the questionnaire were assessed using comparative fit index (0.96) and root mean square error of approximation (0.05). We performed structural equation modelling to examine the relationship between the hypothesised factors and protective behaviours. RESULTS More than 95% of the individuals engaged in at least 1 form of protective behaviour. Knowledge was strongly associated with protective behaviours via direct effect (=0.45, 95% CI 0.19-0.69, P<0.001) and indirect effect through perceived risk (=0.18, 95% CI 0.07-0.31, P=0.002). Perceived risk was associated with protective behaviours (=0.28, 95% CI:0.11-0.44, P=0.002). A lower household income and ethnic minority were associated with protective behaviours. A lower education level and smokers were associated with lower knowledge of haze. A higher education and ethnic minority were associated with a lower perceived risk.

The LunG canceR pAtients coVid19 Disease (GRAVID) study aimed to describe clinical characteristics, outcomes, and predictors of poor outcome in patients with lung cancer and COVID-19. Methods: In this large nationwide study, we reviewed medical records of patients with lung cancer and confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis from 65 Spanish hospitals. Clinical features, treatments and disease outcomes were collected. The primary endpoint was to determine all-cause mortality;secondary endpoints were hospitalization and admission to intensive care units (ICU). Risk factors for poor prognosis were identified by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Results: Overall, 447 patients were included for analysis. Mean age was 67 1  9 8 years;332 (74 3%) were men, and 383 (85 7%) current/former smokers. NSCLC was the most frequent type of cancer (377, 84 5%), consisting mainly of adenocarcinoma (228, 51 0%), and stage III metastatic or unresectable disease (354, 79 2%). Two-hundred and sixty-six (59 5%) patients were receiving anticancer treatment, mostly first-line chemotherapy. In total, 350 (78 3%) patients were hospitalized for a mean of 13 4  11 4 days, nine (2 0%) patients were admitted to the ICU, and 146 (32 7%) died. Advanced disease and the use of corticosteroids to treat COVID-19 during hospitalization were predictors of mortality. Hospitalized, non-endof-life stage patients with lymphocytopenia and high LDH had an increased risk of death. Severity of COVID-19 correlated to higher mortality, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation rates. Conclusions: Due to their underlying comorbidities and immunocompromised status, patients with lung cancer and COVID-19 show high hospitalization and mortality rates. These outcomes, alongside the identification of prognostic factors, may inform physicians on the risks and benefits in this population, in order to provide individualized oncological care.","output":"COVID-19 disease in patients with LUNG cancer in Spain: GRAVID LunG canceR pAtients coVid19 Disease (GRAVID STUDY)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This paper uses a social media platform, Reddit, to identify real-time experiences of people who use drugs during the COVID-19 lock-down. METHODS: Reddit is a popular and growing social media platform, providing a large, publicly available dataset necessary for high performance of machine learning and topic modeling techniques. We used opioid-related subreddits, communities where Reddit users engage in conversations about drug use, to examine COVID-19-related content of posts and comments from March to May 2020. This paper investigates the latent topics of users posts/comments using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, an unsupervised machine learning approach that uncovers the thematic structure of a document collection. We also examine how topics changed over time. RESULTS: The final dataset consists of 525 posts and 9284 comments, for a total of 9809 posts/comments (3756 posts/comments in r/opiates, 1641 in r/OpiatesRecovery, 1203 in r/suboxone, and 3209 in r/Methadone) among 2342 unique individuals. There were 5256 posts/comments in March; 3185 in April; and 1368 in May (until May 22). Topics that appeared most frequently in COVID-19-related discussions included medication for opioid use disorder experiences and access issues (22.6%), recovery (24.2%), and drug withdrawal (20.2%). CONCLUSIONS: During the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, people who use drugs were impacted in several ways, including forced or intentional withdrawal, confusion between withdrawal and COVID-19 symptoms, take-home medication for opioid use disorder issues, and barriers to recovery.

Professional satisfaction and patient care improve in a pleasant learning environment; where postgraduate physicians are encouraged, suitably supervised, and fostered. A negative learning environment can be detrimental to trainees and teams morale and can jeopardize the multidisciplinary working relationship. Objectives The objective of this study was to measure the Educational Environment (EE) of Psychiatry postgraduate training in the Midwest of Ireland training Deanery; what aspects of training are working well and what areas are seen as not optimal. Methods This study took place between April and June 2021. A mixed methods approach was adopted, using the Postgraduate Hospital Educational Environment Measure (PHEEM) and semi-structured one-to-one interviews. Results Response rate was 88% (n=22). The total PHEEM score was 105.6423.52, indicating a postgraduate EE with more positive than negative aspects, but with room for improvement. There were no differences in overall PHEEM and subscale scores between trainees gender, training grades or years of working experience. Three themes were identified that contribute to trainees perception of EE: the commitment of the trainees supervisors to the role they play in trainees overall development, the clinical workload of the trainee, and the day-to-day working conditions of the trainee. Definite disparities between work placements were evident in the collected data across these three themes. Conclusions Although the training program had an overall positive EE, specific answers and interview themes indicated some areas of weakness that may contribute to trainee dissatisfaction and possible burnout. Planned interventions targeting these areas and tracking changes in EE and burnout rates over time may be useful measures going forward.

METHODS The aim of this study was to identify and explore the concerns of people with long-term respiratory conditions in the UK regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and how these concerns were affecting them. We conducted a thematic analysis of free text responses to the question 'What are your main concerns about getting coronavirus?', which was included in the British Lung Foundation/Asthma UK (BLF-AUK) partnership COVID-19 survey, conducted between the 1st and 8th of April. This was during the 3rd week of the UK's initial social distancing measures. RESULTS 7,039 responses were analysed, with respondents from a wide range of ages, gender, and all UK nations.

We identified several known and putative interactions potentially relevant to cellular signaling pathways and confirmed interactions between full-length Scribble and the target proteins -PIX, plakophilin-4, and guanylate cyclase soluble subunit -2 using colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The affinities of recombinant Scribble PDZ domains and the synthetic peptides representing the C termini of these proteins were in the 1- to 40-M range. Furthermore, we identified several well-established host-virus protein-protein interactions, and confirmed that PDZ domains of Scribble interact with the C terminus of Tax-1 of human T-cell leukemia virus with micromolar affinity. Previously unknown putative viral protein ligands for the PDZ domains of Scribble and Erbin were also identified. Thus, we demonstrate that our ProP-PD libraries are useful tools for probing PDZ domain interactions.

A key mechanism of human SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated by the combination of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2-derived spike glycoprotein. Despite the importance of these protein interactions, there is still insufficient detection methods to observe their activity at the cellular level. Herein, we developed a novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based hACE2 biosensor to monitor the interaction between hACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD. This biosensor facilitated the visualization of hACE2-RBD activity with high spatiotemporal resolutions at the single-cell level. Further studies revealed that the FRET-based hACE2 biosensors were sensitive to both exogenous and endogenous hACE2 expression, suggesting that they might be safely applied to the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection without direct virus use. Therefore, our novel biosensor could potentially help develop drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting hACE2-RBD interaction.","output":"Development of a SARS-CoV-2-derived receptor-binding domain-based ACE2 biosensor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought increased focus on hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), as doctors, the medical community, and policymakers around the world attempt to understand how the risks of HCQ weigh against unknown benefits. We aim to evaluate the effects of HCQ on cardiac conduction, thus contributing to the global understanding of implications of HCQ use. METHODS: We reviewed 717 cases of nonmalaria patients treated with HCQ (302) or without HCQ (415) in our hospital from 2008 to 2019, analyzed the cardiac conduction recorded by electrocardiogram (122 vs. 180) including heart rate (HR), PR, and corrected-QT (QTc) intervals, and explored the relationship of cardiac conduction with age, HCQ dosage, HCQ duration, sex, and primary diseases in HCQ users. RESULTS: The all-cause mortality is similar between HCQ and non-HCQ groups (4.0 vs. 4.3%, p = 0.85). Patients aged 45 years or older, not younger ones, have lower HR (80.1  1.7 vs. 85.7  1.8 bpm, p = 0.03) but longer PR (163  3.4 vs. 146.6  4.2 ms, p = 0.003) and QTc (417.8  3.8 vs. 407.7  2.7 ms, p = 0.03) in HCQ than those in non-HCQ. The age in the HCQ group is positively correlated with PR (R = 0.31, p < 0.01) and QTc (R = 0.34, p < 0.01) but not HR. HR, PR, and QTc are not related to HCQ dosage (0.1C0.6 g/day), HCQ duration (0.2C126 months), sex, primary diseases, and repeated exams. CONCLUSION: Age is the most important risk factor of HCQ on cardiac conduction in nonmalaria patients. Electrocardiogram monitoring is suggested in aged patients due to the effects of HCQ on HR, PR, and QTc.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine Inhibits Cardiac Conduction in Aged Patients with Nonmalaria Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SAR-CoV-2) is the strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the respiratory illness that resulted in COVID-19 pandemic in early December 2019. Due to lack of knowledge of the epidemiological cycle and absence of any type of vaccine or medications, the Government issued various non-pharmacological measures to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Several researchers applied the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) compartmental epidemiology process model to identifying the effect of different governments intervention methods enforced to mollify the spread of COVID-19 epidemic. In this paper, we aim to provide a modified SIRD model for COVID-19 spread prediction. We have analyzed the data of the Northern and Southern states of India from January 30, 2020, to October 24, 2020 using the proposed SIRD model and existing SIRD model. We have made the predictions with reasonable assumptions based on real data, considering that the precise course of an epidemic is highly dependent on how and when quarantine, isolation, and precautionary measures were imposed. The proposed method gives better approximation values of new cases, R0 (Reproductive Number), daily deaths, daily infectious, transmission rate, and recovered individuals.Through the analysis of the reported results, the proposed SIRD model can be an effective method for investigating the effect of government interventions on COVID-19 associated transmission and mortality rate at the time of epidemic.","output":"Modified SIRD Model for COVID-19 Spread Prediction for Northern and Southern States of India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we develop a framework to classify the Global supply chain risk management problems and present an approach for the solution of these problems. The risk management problems need to be handled at three levels strategic, operational and tactical. In addition, risk within the supply chain might manifest itself in the form of deviations, disruptions and disasters. To handle unforeseen events in the supply chain there are two obvious approaches: (1) to design chains with built in risk-tolerance and (2) to contain the damage once the undesirable event has occurred. Both of these approaches require a clear understanding of undesirable events that may take place in the supply chain and also the associated consequences and impacts from these events. We focus our efforts on mapping out the propagation of events in the supply chain due to supplier non-performance, and employ our insight to develop a mathematical programming based model for strategic level deviation and disruption management. The first model, a simple integer quadratic optimization model, adapted from the Markowitz model, determines optimal partner selection with the objective of minimizing both the operational cost and the variability of total operational cost. This model offers a possible approach to robust supply chain design.

The aim of this scoping review was to assess the extent, range and nature of published research related to formal systems for recognising and responding to clinical deterioration in emergency department (ED) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a scoping review according to PRISMA-ScR guidelines. MEDLINE complete, CINAHL and Embase were searched on 07 April 2021 from their dates of inception. Human studies evaluating formal systems for recognising and responding to clinical deterioration occurring after triage that were published in English were included. Formal systems for recognising and responding to clinical deterioration were defined as: i) predefined patient assessment criteria for clinical deterioration (single trigger or aggregate score), and, or ii) a predefined, expected response should a patient fulfil the criteria for clinical deterioration. Studies of short stay units and observation wards; deterioration during the triage process; system or score development or validation; and systems requiring pathology test results were excluded. The following characteristics of each study were extracted: author(s), year, design, country, aims, population, system tested, outcomes examined, and major findings. RESULTS: After removal of duplicates, there were 2696 publications. Of these 33 studies representing 109,066 patients were included: all were observational studies. Twenty-two aggregate scoring systems were evaluated in 29 studies and three single trigger systems were evaluated in four studies. There were three major findings: i) few studies reported the use of systems for recognising and responding to clinical deterioration to improve care of patients whilst in the ED; ii) the systems for recognising clinical deterioration in ED patients were highly variable and iii) few studies reported on the ED response to patients identified as deteriorating. CONCLUSION: There is a need to re-focus the research related to use of systems for recognition and response to deteriorating patients from predicting various post-ED events to their real-time use to improve patient safety during ED care.

Healthcare workers (HCW) play a key role in vaccine promotion and patient guidance, and it is likely that hesitancy among this population will have a major impact on the adoption of a successful immunization policy. To investigate HCW attitudes towards anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) vaccination, we developed an anonymous online cross-sectional survey. 1723 Italian HCW responded. Overall, 1155 (67%) intended to be vaccinated, while 443 (26%) were not sure and 125 (7%) declared refusal. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with hesitancy were using Facebook as the main information source and being a non-physician HCW, while predictors of acceptance included younger age, being in close contact with high-risk groups and having received flu vaccination during the 2019-2020 season. Reasons for hesitancy included lack of trust in vaccine safety (85%) and receiving little (78%) or conflicting (69%) information about vaccines. According to our results, adequate investment in vaccine education for healthcare personnel appears to be urgently needed, prioritizing non-physicians and information quality spread through social media. We hope that our data could help governments and policy-makers to target communication in the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination campaign.","output":"Attitudes towards Anti-SARS-CoV2 Vaccination among Healthcare Workers: Results from a National Survey in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Therapeutic vaccination against cancer is an important approach which, when combined with other therapies, can improve long-term control of cancer. In fact, the induction of adaptive immune responses against Tumor Associated Antigens (TAAs) as well as innate immunity are important factors for tumor stabilization/eradication. A variety of immunization technologies have been explored in last decades and are currently under active evaluation, such as cell-based, protein, peptide and heat-shock protein-based cancer vaccines. Genetic vaccines are emerging as promising methodologies to elicit immune responses against a wide variety of antigens, including TAAs. Amongst these, Adenovirus (Ad)-based vectors show excellent immunogenicity profile and have achieved immunological proof of concept in humans. In vivo electroporation of plasmid DNA (DNA-EP) is also a desirable vaccine technology for cancer vaccines, as it is repeatable several times, a parameter required for the long-term maintenance of anti-tumor immunity. Recent findings show that combinations of different modalities of immunization (heterologous prime/boost) are able to induce superior immune reactions as compared to single-modality vaccines. In this review, we will discuss the challenges and requirements of emerging cancer vaccines, particularly focusing on the genetic cancer vaccines currently under active development and the promise shown by Ad and DNA-EP heterologous prime-boost.","output":"Emerging Cancer Vaccines: The Promise of Genetic Vectors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to analyze the different clinical characteristics between children and their families infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Clinical data from nine children and their 14 families were collected, including general status, clinical, laboratory test, and imaging characteristics. All the children were detected positive result after their families onset. Three children had fever (22.2%) or cough (11.2%) symptoms and six (66.7%) children had no symptom. Among the 14 adult patients, the major symptoms included fever (57.1%), cough (35.7%), chest tightness/pain (21.4%), fatigue (21.4%) and sore throat (7.1%). Nearly 70% of the patients had normal (71.4%) or decreased (28.6%) white blood cell counts, and 50% (7/14) had lymphocytopenia. There were 10 adults (71.4%) showed abnormal imaging.

In this study, we report that the foamy virus (FV) envelope (Env) glycoprotein is palmitoylated. Specifically, we found that bovine foamy virus (BFV) Env (BEnv) is palmitoylated at amino acid positions C58 and C59 by BDHHC3 and BDHHC20 in a DHHC motif-dependent manner. In addition, mutations C58S and C58/59S significantly decrease cell surface expression of BEnv, subviral particle (SVP) egress, and its membrane fusion activity, thus ultimately inhibiting BFV replication. The C59S mutation exerts a minor effect in this regard. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the function of BEnv in the context of BFV replication is under the regulation of palmitoylation.","output":"Palmitoylation of the Bovine Foamy Virus Envelope Glycoprotein Is Required for Viral Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), automation and artificial intelligence (AI) have attracted renewed interest in multiple industrial fields. Global manufacturing bases were affected strongly by workforce shortages associated with the spread of COVID-19, and are working to increase productivity by embracing digital manufacturing technologies that take advantage of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT) that offer the promise of improved connectivity among supply chains. This trend can increase and smooth the flow of social capital, which is a potential resource in supply chains and can affect supply chain performance in healthcare industry. However, such an issue has not been properly recognized as the best practice in healthcare industry. Thus, this study investigates empirically the relationship between digitalization and supply chain performance in healthcare manufacturing companies based on previous research that proposed a role for social capital. We surveyed the staff of domestic small and medium-sized healthcare manufacturing companies in South Korea currently operating or planning to deploy digital manufacturing technologies. Online and email surveys were utilized to collect the data. Invalid responses were excluded and the remaining 130 responses were analyzed using a structural equation model in SPSS with the AMOS module. We found that digitalization has a positive effect on the formation of social capital, which in turn has a positive effect on supply chain performance. The direct effect of digitalization on supply chain performance is small, and relatively large portions are mediated and influenced by social capital. The establishment of strategic relationships in the healthcare manufacturing industry is significant, as supply chain networks and production processes can influence the intended use of factory output. Companies should, therefore, secure timely and accurate information to manage the flow of products and services. The formation of social capital in the supply chain can help visualize entire supply chains and has a positive effect on real-time information-sharing among key elements of those chains.","output":"Relationships among Healthcare Digitalization, Social Capital, and Supply Chain Performance in the Healthcare Manufacturing Industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conformational changes are an essential feature of most molecular processes in biology. Optical tweezers have emerged as a powerful tool for probing conformational dynamics at the single-molecule level because of their high resolution and sensitivity, opening new windows on phenomena ranging from folding and ligand binding to enzyme function, molecular machines, and protein aggregation. By measuring conformational changes induced in a molecule by forces applied by optical tweezers, new insight has been gained into the relationship between dynamics and function. We discuss recent advances from studies of how structure forms in proteins and RNA, including non-native structures, fluctuations in disordered proteins, and interactions with chaperones assisting native folding.

Such efforts are challenged by metabolite transport limitations, which arise when complex plant pathways distributed across organelles and tissues are reconstructed in unicellular hosts without concomitant transport machinery. We recently reported an engineered yeast platform for production of the tropane alkaloid (TA) drugs hyoscyamine and scopolamine, in which product accumulation is limited by vacuolar transport. Here, we demonstrate that alleviation of transport limitations at multiple steps in an engineered pathway enables increased production of TAs and screening of useful derivatives. We first show that supervised classifier models trained on a tissue-delineated transcriptome from the TA-producing plant Atropa belladonna can predict TA transporters with greater efficacy than conventional regression- and clustering-based approaches. We demonstrate that two of the identified transporters, AbPUP1 and AbLP1, increase TA production in engineered yeast by facilitating vacuolar export and cellular reuptake of littorine and hyoscyamine. We incorporate four different plant transporters, cofactor regeneration mechanisms, and optimized growth conditions into our yeast platform to achieve improvements in de novo hyoscyamine and scopolamine production of over 100-fold (480 g/L) and 7-fold (172 g/L). Finally, we leverage computational tools for biosynthetic pathway prediction to produce two different classes of TA derivatives, nortropane alkaloids and tropane N-oxides, from simple precursors. Our work highlights the importance of cellular transport optimization in recapitulating complex PNP biosyntheses in microbial hosts and illustrates the utility of computational methods for gene discovery and expansion of heterologous biosynthetic diversity.","output":"Engineering cellular metabolite transport for biosynthesis of computationally predicted tropane alkaloid derivatives in yeast"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel COVID-19 infection has spread all over the world and is still generating a lot of issues at different levels There is a lack of control in disease early diagnosis and rapid evolution, which impacts both the medical and the economic system Young gastroenterologists should adapt to overcome current difficulties and continue their life and general training This is a multi-center national study, which aims to assess the general perspective of young gastroenterologists (residents and young specialists) from six university centers in Romania regarding their current training and the psychological effect the pandemic has on their life and job An online survey with 58 items was distributed using Google Forms, and quality of life and anxiety were assessed The validated instruments 15D (for assessing the health-related quality of life) and endler multidimensional anxiety scales (EMAS-for assessing anxiety) were used All analyses were performed using SPSS 25 Of the 174 gastroenterologists approached, 96 (response rate of 55%) responded A majority of the respondents were residents in gastroenterology (64%), and 40 6% were male The pandemic influenced the number of examined patients as well as young gastroenterologists' endoscopy training Health-related quality of life was negatively associated with the level of anxiety generated by the cognitive component of anxiety as a state, the new and ambiguity of the state, and how threatened the respondent felt The level of anxiety was moderate (median = 51), and no difference was found between the physicians working in a designated hospital or not General caution should be considered for young gastroenterologists' training, and continuous observation should be done to ensure better mental health on the current evolution These findings would need to be verified in larger-sample studies and in different types of specialties","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Health-Related Quality of Life, Anxiety, and Training Among Young Gastroenterologists in Romania"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several studies indicate that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted within indoor spaces. Therefore, environmental characterization of SARS-CoV-2 viral load with respect to human activity, building parameters, and environmental mitigation strategies is critical to combat disease transmission. METHODS: We recruited 11 participants diagnosed with COVID-19 to individually occupy a controlled chamber and conduct specified physical activities under a range of environmental conditions; we collected human and environmental samples over a period of three days for each participant. RESULTS: Here we show that increased viral load, measured by lower RNA cycle threshold (C(T)) values, in nasal samples is associated with higher viral loads in environmental aerosols and on surfaces captured in both the near field (1.2 m) and far field (3.5 m). We also found that aerosol viral load in far field is correlated with the number of particles within the range of 1 m -2.5 m. Furthermore, we found that increased ventilation and filtration significantly reduced aerosol and surface viral loads, while higher relative humidity resulted in lower aerosol and higher surface viral load, consistent with an increased rate of particle deposition at higher relative humidity. Data from near field aerosol trials with high expiratory activities suggest that respiratory particles of smaller sizes (0.3 m -1 m) best characterize the variance of near field aerosol viral load. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that building operation practices such as ventilation, filtration, and humidification substantially reduce the environmental aerosol viral load, and therefore inhalation dose, and should be prioritized to improve building health and safety.","output":"Quantifying environmental mitigation of aerosol viral load in a controlled chamber with participants diagnosed with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The global pandemic of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has led to global shortages of ventilators and accessories. One solution to this problem is to split ventilators between multiple patients, which poses the difficulty of treating two patients with dissimilar ventilation needs. A proposed solution to this problem is the use of 3D-printed flow splitters and restrictors. There is little data available on the reliability of such devices and how the use of different 3D printing methods might affect their performance. METHODS: We performed flow resistance measurements on 30 different 3D-printed restrictor designs produced using a range of fused deposition modelling and stereolithography printers and materials, from consumer grade printers using polylactic acid filament to professional printers using surgical resin. We compared their performance to novel computational fluid dynamics models driven by empirical ventilator flow rate data. This indicates the ideal performance of a part that matches the computer model. RESULTS: The 3D-printed restrictors varied considerably between printers and materials to a sufficient degree that would make them unsafe for clinical use without individual testing. This occurs because the interior surface of the restrictor is rough and has a reduced nominal average diameter when compared to the computer model. However, we have also shown that with careful calibration it is possible to tune the end-inspiratory (tidal) volume by titrating the inspiratory time on the ventilator. CONCLUSIONS: Computer simulations of differential multi patient ventilation indicate that the use of 3D-printed flow splitters is viable. However, in situ testing indicates that using 3D printers to produce flow restricting orifices is not recommended, as the flow resistance can deviate significantly from expected values depending on the type of printer used.

The effects of SAH orders on the trauma population remain unknown. We hypothesized an increase in rates of penetrating trauma, gunshot wounds, suicide attempts, and domestic violence in the Southern California trauma population after the SAH order. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective analysis of all trauma patients presenting to 11 American College of Surgeons levels I and II trauma centers spanning seven counties in California was performed. Demographic data, injury characteristics, clinical data, and outcomes were collected. Patients were divided into three groups based on injury date: before SAH from January 1, 2020, to March 18, 2020 (PRE), after SAH from March 19, 2020, to June 30, 2020 (POST), and a historical control from March 19, 2019, to June 30, 2019 (CONTROL). POST was compared with both PRE and CONTROL in two separate analyses. RESULTS: Across all periods, 20,448 trauma patients were identified (CONTROL, 7,707; PRE, 6,022; POST, 6,719). POST had a significantly increased rate of penetrating trauma (13.0% vs. 10.3%, p < 0.001 and 13.0% vs. 9.9%, p < 0.001) and gunshot wounds (4.5% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.002 and 4.5% vs. 3.7%, p = 0.025) compared with PRE and CONTROL, respectively.

The tourism industry, in particular, has suffered greatly. For instance, widespread travel restrictions have directly led to unemployment among tourism practitioners, especially tour leaders engaged in leading overseas tour groups. In the current environment, tour companies are limited to training only, and as such have chosen to focus on strengthening three critical areas: the leadership, psychological, and professional skills of their tour operators. This study contributes to the tourism literature by examining the direct and indirect effects of accountability on ownership of organization behavior (OOB) and tour leader personality in the context of the tourism industry, in order to expand the sustainable development of the tourism industry. The definition of OOB is that the psychological influence of the tour leader will affect their behavior, and the psychological consequences of the tour leader will be affected by experience (such as seniority of the team leader or number of tour groups). A structured questionnaire was used to survey tour leaders who hold an international license in Taiwan. The direct mediating influences of competence and having a place (psychological antecedents) on their accountability was confirmed. OOB also partially mediated the direct positive effect of the practice mechanism on their accountability. Our results also confirmed that competence and having a place are important predictors of the practice mechanism, and are better predictors of accountability than OOB. These findings should enhance the organizational design and marketing options available to travel agency businesses, as well as offering guidance to managers attempting to shape and mold their organizational culture and the behaviors of tour leaders associated with the implementation of OOB, in order to improve accountability in the sustainable business model of tourism.","output":"The Mediating Effect of Ownership of Psychological Behavior and Tour Leader Experience on Accountability in Order to Explore the Sustainable Business Model of the Tourism Industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cardiac injury is frequently encountered in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is associated with increased risk of mortality.

The aim of this study was to analyze the strategies employed by the More Doctors Program (Programa Mais Mdicos) to provide primary care physicians in vulnerable and peri-urban parts of Greater Brasilia. METHODS: The study used a qualitative approach based on the precepts of social constructivism. Forty-nine semi-structured interviews were conducted: 24 with physicians employed as part of the More Doctors program, five with program medical supervisors, seven with secondary care physicians, twelve with primary care coordinators, and one federal administrator. The interviews occurred between March and September 2019. The transcripts of the interviews were submitted to thematic content analysis. RESULTS: The partnership between the Ministry of Health and local authorities was essential for the provision of doctors-especially foreign doctors, most from Cuba, to assist vulnerable population groups previously without access to the health system. There was a notable presence of doctors with experience working with socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, which was important for gaining a better understanding of the effects of the endemic urban violence in the region. The incentives and other institutional support, such as enhanced salaries, training, and housing, transportation, and food allowances, were factors that helped provide a satisfactory working environment. However, the poor state of the infrastructure at some of the primary care units and limitations of the health service as a whole were factors that hampered the provision of comprehensive care, constituting a cause of dissatisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: More Doctors introduced a range of novel strategies that helped ensure a supply of primary care doctors in vulnerable and peri-urban parts of Greater Brasilia. The inclusion of foreign doctors, most from Cuba, was crucial for the success of the health services provided for the local communities, who subsist in violent and socioeconomically deprived urban areas. However, it became clear that barriers from within the health service itself hampered the physicians' capacity to provide a satisfactory service. As such, what is needed for primary care to be effective is not just the recruitment, training, and deployment of doctors, but also investment in the organization of the whole health system.","output":"Challenges facing the More Doctors program (Programa Mais Mdicos) in vulnerable and peri-urban areas in Greater Brasilia, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Healthcare spending in the emergency department (ED) setting has received intense focus from policymakers in the United States (U.S.). Relatively few studies have systematically evaluated ED spending over time or disaggregated ED spending by policy-relevant groups, including health condition, age, sex, and payer to inform these discussions. This studys objective is to estimate ED spending trends in the U.S. from 2006 to 2016, by age, sex, payer, and across 154 health conditions and assess ED spending per visit over time. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This observational study utilized the National Emergency Department Sample, a nationally representative sample of hospital-based ED visits in the U.S. to measure healthcare spending for ED care. All spending estimates were adjusted for inflation and presented in 2016 U.S. Dollars. Overall ED spending was $79.2 billion (CI, $79.2 billion-$79.2 billion) in 2006 and grew to $136.6 billion (CI, $136.6 billion-$136.6 billion) in 2016, representing a population-adjusted annualized rate of change of 4.4% (CI, 4.4%-4.5%) as compared to total healthcare spending (1.4% [CI, 1.4%-1.4%]) during that same ten-year period. The percentage of U.S. health spending attributable to the ED has increased from 3.9% (CI, 3.9%-3.9%) in 2006 to 5.0% (CI, 5.0%-5.0%) in 2016. Nearly equal parts of ED spending in 2016 was paid by private payers (49.3% [CI, 49.3%-49.3%]) and public payers (46.9% [CI, 46.9%-46.9%]), with the remainder attributable to out-of-pocket spending (3.9% [CI, 3.9%-3.9%]). In terms of key groups, the majority of ED spending was allocated among females (versus males) and treat-and-release patients (versus those hospitalized); those between age 20C44 accounted for a plurality of ED spending. Road injuries, falls, and urinary diseases witnessed the highest levels of ED spending, accounting for 14.1% (CI, 13.1%-15.1%) of total ED spending in 2016. ED spending per visit also increased over time from $660.0 (CI, $655.1-$665.2) in 2006 to $943.2 (CI, $934.3-$951.6) in 2016, or at an annualized rate of 3.4% (CI, 3.3%-3.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Though ED spending accounts for a relatively small portion of total health system spending in the U.S., ED spending is sizable and growing. Understanding which diseases are driving this spending is helpful for informing value-based reforms that can impact overall health care costs.","output":"Healthcare spending in U.S. emergency departments by health condition, 2006C2016"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Palliative care provides \\"person- and family-centred care\\" for people with a life-limiting illness. The primary goal is to optimise comfort from physical, psychosocial, and spiritual stressors. COVID-19 has presented unique challenges to the social work role in an inpatient Palliative Care ward. The ward was considered \\"high risk\\", and therefore, special restrictions were introduced. For patients in the terminal phase, restrictions initially involved the next of kin nominating up to four family members who could only visit two at a time during a designated time period. Those not deemed in the terminal phase could not have visitors. These restrictions caused increased stressors for families already feeling emotional. A communication plan was developed in collaboration with the multidisciplinary team. This involved the patient's next of kin being allocated a worker who called them each morning to provide an update and record any of their queries and concerns. Other strategies involved gathering information about technology devices families and patients owned along with increasing technology resources on the ward. A social work perspective on person-in-environment has helped in understanding and navigating the micro and macro impact that COVID-19 is having in palliative care.

Although quantification of (18)F-DPA-714 binding can be achieved through kinetic modeling analysis with an arterial input function (AIF) measured with blood sampling procedures, the invasiveness of such procedures has been an obstacle for wide application. To address these challenges, we developed an image-derived input function (IDIF) that noninvasively estimates the arterial input function from the images acquired for (18)F-DPA-714 quantification. Methods: The method entails three fully automatic steps to extract the IDIF, including a segmentation of voxels with highest likelihood of being the arterial blood over the carotid artery, a model-based matrix factorization to extract the arterial blood signal, and a scaling optimization procedure to scale the extracted arterial blood signal into the activity concentration unit. Two cohorts of human subjects were used to evaluate the extracted IDIF. In the first cohort of five subjects, arterial blood sampling was performed, and the calculated IDIF was validated against the measured AIF through the comparison of distribution volumes from AIF (V(T,AIF)) and IDIF (V(T,IDIF)). In the second cohort, PET studies from twenty-eight healthy controls without arterial blood sampling were used to compare V(T,IDIF) with V(T,REF) measured using a reference region-based analysis to evaluate whether it can distinguish high-affinity (HAB) and mixed-affinity (MAB) binders. Results: In the arterial blood-sampling cohort, V(T) derived from IDIF was found to be an accurate surrogate of the V(T) from AIF. The bias of V(T, IDIF) was ?5.8  7.8% when compared to V(T,AIF), and the linear mixed effect model showed a high correlation between V(T,AIF) and V(T, IDIF) (p < 0.001). In the nonblood-sampling cohort, V(T, IDIF) showed a significance difference between the HAB and MAB healthy controls. V(T, IDIF) and standard uptake values (SUV) showed superior results in distinguishing HAB from MAB subjects than V(T,REF). Conclusions: A novel IDIF method for (18)F-DPA-714 PET quantification was developed and evaluated in this study.

These diseases are associated with plasma and/or tissue increases in cholesterol derivatives mainly formed by auto-oxidation: 7-ketocholesterol, also known as 7-oxo-cholesterol, and 7?-hydroxycholesterol. The formation of these oxysterols can be considered as a consequence of mitochondrial and peroxisomal dysfunction, leading to increased in oxidative stress, which is accentuated with age. 7-ketocholesterol and 7?-hydroxycholesterol cause a specific form of cytotoxic activity defined as oxiapoptophagy, including oxidative stress and induction of death by apoptosis associated with autophagic criteria. Oxiaptophagy is associated with organelle dysfunction and in particular with mitochondrial and peroxisomal alterations involved in the induction of cell death and in the rupture of redox balance. As the criteria characterizing 7-ketocholesterol- and 7?-hydroxycholesterol-induced cytotoxicity are often simultaneously observed in major age-related diseases (cardiovascular diseases, age-related macular degeneration, Alzheimer's disease) the involvement of these oxysterols in the pathophysiology of the latter seems increasingly likely. It is therefore important to better understand the signalling pathways associated with the toxicity of 7-ketocholesterol and 7?-hydroxycholesterol in order to identify pharmacological targets, nutrients and synthetic molecules attenuating or inhibiting the cytotoxic activities of these oxysterols. Numerous natural cytoprotective compounds have been identified: vitamins, fatty acids, polyphenols, terpenes, vegetal pigments, antioxidants, mixtures of compounds (oils, plant extracts) and bacterial enzymes. However, few synthetic molecules are able to prevent 7-ketocholesterol- and/or 7?-hydroxycholesterol-induced cytotoxicity: dimethyl fumarate, monomethyl fumarate, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG126, memantine, simvastatine, Trolox, dimethylsufoxide, mangafodipir and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) inhibitors.

In this study, we evaluated the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 variants in human ACE-2-expressing (K18-hACE2) mice. Eight-week-old K18-hACE2 mice were inoculated intranasally with a representative virus from the original B.1 lineage, or the emerging B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), B.1.617.2 (delta) or B.1.1.529 (omicron) lineages.

For Austrian cities, depending on location and topography, heavy rainfall events, storms and heat waves in particular could become increasingly relevant in the tourism context. For medium-sized and large cities, heat is the most frequently discussed topic in connection with possible adaptation potentials. The analysis of challenges shows a strong overlap of adaptation targets in city tourism with adaptation challenges for city planning including connection to the sub-urban surrounding areas to confront climate change impacts. Covid-19 pandemic, additionally, offered the opportunity to discuss a new re-start of the city-tourism against the experience during the shutdown period in spring 2020. The paper argues that we can learn from the current health crisis for coping with climate change related extreme events and to increase achievements in climate change mitigation. Firstly, the pandemic provides a strong ability to discuss the impact of city tourism due to short-term air travel and options to enhance more climate-friendly options on the other hand. Secondly, Covid-19 emphasized the need to reconsider the role of free spaces in metropolitan areas as well as their accessibility. Herewith synergies with climate change adaptation are likely when questioning the availability and accessibility of green and blue infrastructure as well as their capacities. Challenges including crowding and impacts by over tourism on public free spaces will require joint strategies involving all public and private institutions (including local communities and businesses) responsible for the maintenance of green and blue free spaces. Thirdly, the strong interactions between urban and suburban areas became evident once more, which will also be very relevant for city tourism in the future (e.g. in times of heat waves). Reflection on the transferability of coping with such crowding effects, related to the adaptive behaviour of residents and tourists in times of severe heat waves, might be relevant for both city tourism and summer tourism destinations near metropolitan areas. Finally, the Covid-19 crisis encourages discussions on over-tourism in metropolitan destinations in favour of a more balanced approach, in particular in inner city areas and around major sightseeing attractions.","output":"Reprint of: City tourism pre- and post-covid-19 pandemic C Messages to take home for climate change adaptation and mitigation?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"International Patient Summary (IPS) Standards represent a collaborative effort among Standards Development Organizations i e HL7, CEN, ISO, IHE to extract a snapshot of key information from Electronic Health Records including key conditions, allergies, medications, as well as immunization information This information is associated with provenance information regarding when and how this information was produced, and who attests to its validity Many mobile handset manufacturers support this functionality by default and empower citizens to receive safe care where and when needed Patient summaries are also one of the key functionalities supported by Connected Europe, eHealth Digital Services Infrastructure, operated by European Union member states and the most recent initiative regarding the European Electronic Health Record Exchange Format, which explicitly includes laboratory observations (test results) With COVID-19 the immunization section of the IPS standard comes to play a critical role, empowering individuals to access and manage data related to their immunity, such as the tests carried out and their outcome Additionally, consideration will be given to a key related question is how to standardize the representation of COVID19 tests and associated results Already, the standards organizations SNOMEDCT International, LOINC, and CDISC have released guidance related to terminology and nomenclature","output":"International Patient Summary Standards conveying immunization information"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19, healthcare workers are exposed to a higher risk of mental health problems, especially anxiety symptoms.

However, most of the previous findings mainly focused on its indirect effect in inhibiting the advanced glycation end products. Here, besides glycemic control, we also demonstrated a stimulatory role of liraglutide in promoting autophagy and relieving oxidative stress in Zucker diabetic fatty(ZDF) rats. The renoprotective effect of liraglutide has been demonstrated by significantly decreasing urinary albumin (P<0.01) and ameliorating renal pathological changes (P<0.001) in vivo. Besides that, proliferation of Hkc8 and HEK293 cells have been increased after treating with exendin-4, a GLP-1 receptor agonist. Moreover, the GLP-1 could positively improve the progression of autophagy in vivo and in vitro through regulating the autophagy-related protein LC3 and P62 via AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. Simultaneously, it could reverse Nrf2 translocation into the nuclei, then suppress oxidative stress. In terms of mechanism, the renoprotective effect of the GLP-1 would be exerted via the GLP1R-AMPK-mTOR-autophagy-ROS signaling axis.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using EHRs from nine geriatric clinics in Stockholm, Sweden, comprising 3,405 COVID-19 patients (mean age 81.9 years) between 1/3/2020 and 31/10/2021. Frailty was assessed using a 48-item eFI developed for Swedish geriatric patients, the CFS, and Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). Comorbidity was measured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). We analyzed in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission using logistic regression and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). 30-day and 6-month mortality were modelled by Cox regression, and the length of stay by linear regression. Results: Controlling for age and sex, a 10% increase in the eFI was associated with higher risks of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR]=2.84; 95% confidence interval=2.31-3.51), 30-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR]=2.30; 1.99-2.65), 6-month mortality (HR=2.33; 2.07-2.62), 30-day readmission (OR=1.34; 1.06-1.68), and longer length of stay ({beta}=2.28; 1.90-2.66).

The objective was to verify the factors associated with sarcopenia in institutionalized elderly. METHODS In total, 219 elderly individuals (60 years old) living in long-term institutions in Natal/RN were included in the study. After defining the elderly as sarcopenic or non-sarcopenic, anthropometric, biochemical, sociodemographic and health-related were analyzed. The Student t-test and Mann-Whitney test were used to analyze the quantitative, while the chi-square test was used for the qualitative variables. Finally, Poisson regression was used to provide prevalence ratios for those variables that presented differences in the bivariate analyses. RESULTS Physical capacity and anthropometry were associated with sarcopenia. For each 1 cm of knee height, the elderly presented 2.71% more chance of not having sarcopenia, and eutrophic or overweight individuals (according to BMI) presented 37.71 and 91.81% chances, respectively, of not presenting sarcopenia. Elderly individuals who ambulate have a 30.08% chance of not being considered sarcopenic. In addition, biochemical and anthropometric indicators demonstrated a relationship of sarcopenia with malnutrition.

Although widespread vaccination campaigns are underway, their efficacy is reduced owing to emerging variants of concern(1,2). Development of host-directed therapeutics and prophylactics could limit such resistance and offer urgently needed protection against variants of concern(3,4). Attractive pharmacological targets to impede viral entry include type-II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) such as TMPRSS2; these proteases cleave the viral spike protein to expose the fusion peptide for cell entry, and thus have an essential role in the virus lifecycle(5,6). Here we identify and characterize a small-molecule compound, N-0385, which exhibits low nanomolar potency and a selectivity index of higher than 10(6) in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells and in donor-derived colonoids(7). In Calu-3 cells it inhibits the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta). Notably, in the K18-human ACE2 transgenic mouse model of severe COVID-19, we found that N-0385 affords a high level of prophylactic and therapeutic benefit after multiple administrations or even after a single administration. Together, our findings show that TTSP-mediated proteolytic maturation of the spike protein is critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo, and suggest that N-0385 provides an effective early treatment option against COVID-19 and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.","output":"A?

First, bodies are used to legitimize the political order; second, they serve to determine political subjectivity; and third, body politics define politics.

In terms of anatomy, during the abdominal aorta's dissection, it is possible to identify the periaortic adipose tissue and the periaortic parietal peritoneum lying over it, sealing the retroperitoneal space. They seem to be fragile layers, with apparently no biomechanical role in the abdomen. However, it is well known that most cases of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms that reach the emergency department still alive present retroperitoneal bleeding contained by the above-mentioned two-layer combination, eventually allowing time for surgical treatment. In previous studies about aortic wall stress, tension, and abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture prediction, only information concerning the vessel wall itself is highlighted. Therefore, the present work aims to study the biomechanical and histological properties of the periaortic tissue, comparing them to the same variables measured in aortic wall samples described in the medical literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples of periaortic tissue were harvested from 27 individuals during necropsy. Smoking status and the presence of abdominal aortic aneurysm were observed. Biomechanical uniaxial destructive tests were performed up to samples rupture. Values of failure stress, tension, and strain were obtained. Samples were also harvested for histological analysis. RESULTS: Periaortic tissue presented less amount of collagen in smokers than in non-smokers (p = 0.017). The periaortic tissue seems to be more elastic than aortic walls described in the literature (strain: 0.75  0.37). Analyzing periaortic tissue failure stress (56.8  101.26 N/cm2) and tension (7.65  4.99 N/cm), it has at least 52% and 55%, respectively of the stress and tension described in the medical literature for abdominal aortic aneurysm walls. CONCLUSIONS: The periaortic tissue presents less collagen fibers in smokers than in non-smokers. The periaortic tissue seemed very delicate during an autopsy, but the study of its biomechanical properties showed that it presents more than half of the resistance of an abdominal aortic aneurysm wall. This information suggests this tissue might have a mechanical protective role against massive bleeding when it comes to an aortic rupture. Therefore this tissue's biomechanical information should be included in computational models on enlargement and rupture prediction of abdominal aortic aneurysms.","output":"Biomechanical properties of the periaortic abdominal tissue: it is not as fragile as it seems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has had a greater burden, as measured by rate of infection, in poorer communities within cities.

One explanation is that government suppression was less severe in poorer communities, either because the poor were more likely to be exempt or unable to comply. Another explanation is that effective suppression itself accelerated the epidemic in poor neighborhoods because households are more crowded and residents share toilet and water facilities.

Locations of the aneurysms were posterior communicating artery (n = 7), anterior communicating artery or A2 (n = 7), middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation (n = 3), basilar artery tip (n = 1) and anterior choroidal artery (n = 1). The initial clinical and angiographic outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS Coil embolization was successfully completed in all 19 aneurysms, resulting in complete occlusions (n = 18) or residual neck (n = 1). In one procedure, a thrombus formation was detected at the neck portion of the ruptured MCA bifurcation aneurysm near to the end of the procedure. It was completely resolved with an intra-arterial infusion of Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (Tirofiban, 1.0 mg) without any clinical sequela.

The percent of each retina expressing BDNF and TrkB was quantified for the total retinal thickness, and separately for the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) complex + retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). The expression of each protein was correlated with clinical outcomes obtained from the subject's ocular histories. RESULTS There was no significant difference in BDNF or TrkB expression when comparing glaucomatous and control retinas. Correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between BDNF expression and the use of prostaglandin analogs. TrkB expression was highly correlated with the last-measured intraocular pressure (IOP), the use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, the use of beta blockers, and the total number of drugs used for the treatment of glaucoma. CONCLUSION Topical drugs used to treat glaucoma were associated with an increase in retinal BDNF and TrkB expression in human retina, independent of IOP, which may represent molecular evidence of neuroprotective pathway activation.","output":"High Correlation between Glaucoma Treatment with Topical Prostaglandin Analogs and BDNF Immunoreactivity in Human Retina."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Technical difficulties in laparoscopic gastric bypass for severely obese patients have led to sleeve gastrectomy first and then laparoscopic gastric bypass as a second stage after significant weight loss.

One key determinant of this is the evolution of multifaceted resistance mechanisms within the tumour that may either pre-exist or develop during the course of therapy. This is particularly evident in pancreatic cancer, where limited responses to treatment underlie dismal survival rates, highlighting the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. Here, we discuss the major features of pancreatic tumours that contribute to therapy resistance, and how they may be alleviated through exploitation of the mounting and exciting promise of nanomedicines; a unique collection of nanoscale platforms with tunable and multifunctional capabilities that have already elicited a widespread impact on cancer management. ABSTRACT: The development of drug resistance remains one of the greatest clinical oncology challenges that can radically dampen the prospect of achieving complete and durable tumour control. Efforts to mitigate drug resistance are therefore of utmost importance, and nanotechnology is rapidly emerging for its potential to overcome such issues. Studies have showcased the ability of nanomedicines to bypass drug efflux pumps, counteract immune suppression, serve as radioenhancers, correct metabolic disturbances and elicit numerous other effects that collectively alleviate various mechanisms of tumour resistance. Much of this progress can be attributed to the remarkable benefits that nanoparticles offer as drug delivery vehicles, such as improvements in pharmacokinetics, protection against degradation and spatiotemporally controlled release kinetics. These attributes provide scope for precision targeting of drugs to tumours that can enhance sensitivity to treatment and have formed the basis for the successful clinical translation of multiple nanoformulations to date. In this review, we focus on the longstanding reputation of pancreatic cancer as one of the most difficult-to-treat malignancies where resistance plays a dominant role in therapy failure. We outline the mechanisms that contribute to the treatment-refractory nature of these tumours, and how they may be effectively addressed by harnessing the unique capabilities of nanomedicines. Moreover, we include a brief perspective on the likely future direction of nanotechnology in pancreatic cancer, discussing how efforts to develop multidrug formulations will guide the field further towards a therapeutic solution for these highly intractable tumours.","output":"Nanomedicine in Pancreatic Cancer: Current Status and Future Opportunities for Overcoming Therapy Resistance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article is the second part of a series that explores the historical process of the configuration of the internship in medical education and practice In a previous article, we studied the emergence of the internship in Napoleonic France and its latter configuration trough the North American Flexnerian reforms to medical education This second part deals with the process by which the internship was constituted in Colombia through five sections The first one analyses the French influence at the beginning of the 20th century;the second part, the change towards the North American flexnerian model, which was motivated by the arrival of multiple medical missions and their suggestions regarding medical education;the third part studies the process by which these models assembled in the country, their regulation and its crisis;the fourth discusses the actual proposals;and the epilogue talks about the future of the internship in the COVID-19 pandemics ? 2021, Universidad de Antioquia All rights reserved","output":"Notes for a future research on the history of the internship in medicine, in Colombia.

Yet the impact on mobility of different non-pharmaceutical countermeasures in the earlier stages of the pandemic is not well-understood. Design: Trends were evaluated using Citymappers mobility index covering 2 nd to 26 th March 2020, expressed as percentages of typical usage periods from 0% as the lowest and 100% as normal. China and India were not covered. Multivariate fixed effects models were used to estimate the association of policies restricting movement on mobility before and after their introduction. Policy restrictions were assessed using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index as well as measures coding the timing and degree of school and workplace closures, transport restrictions, and cancellation of mass gatherings. Setting: 41 cities worldwide Main outcome measures: Citymappers mobility index Results: : Mobility declined in all major cities throughout March. Larger declines were seen in European than Asian cities. The COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index was strongly associated with declines in mobility (r = -0.75, p<0.001). After adjusting for time-trends, we observed that implementing non-pharmaceutical countermeasures was associated with a decline of mobility of 10.0% for school closures (95% CI: 4.36% to 15.7%), 15.0% for workplace closures (95% CI: 10.2% to 19.8%), 7.09% for cancelling public events (95% CI: 1.98% to 12.2%), 18.0% for closing public transport (95% CI: 6.74% to 29.2%), 13.3% for restricting internal movements (95% CI: 8.85% to 17.8%) and 5.30% for international travel controls (95% CI: 1.69 to 8.90).

METHODS We conducted a retrospective observational study in a cohort of 326 women who underwent POP repair and had a standardized preoperative POP assessment using the Baden-Walker classification. The distribution of POP grade was described for each vaginal compartment. The association between the involvement of each specific compartment and predictors was evaluated with a logistic regression model. RESULTS The frequency of significant POP (grade  2) was 79% in the anterior compartment, 49% in the middle/apical compartment and 31% in the posterior compartment. Combined significant anterior and apical defects were present in 25% of women. Increasing age was a significant risk factor for apical defect (between 60 and 70 years OR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.6; > 70 years OR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.7-6.6). Previous hysterectomy (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.0-4.6) was a significant risk factor for posterior defect. CONCLUSIONS In a population undergoing POP surgery, anterior compartment involvement is the most common and serious defect and can often be associated with an apical defect, especially in older women. In case of previous hysterectomy, the posterior compartment may be weakened.

Functional testing of the variants IFIH1 alleles demonstrated that the resulting proteins are unable to induce IFN-, are intrinsically less stable than wild-type IFIH1, and lack ATPase activity. In vitro assays showed that IFIH1 effectively restricts replication of human respiratory syncytial virus and rhinoviruses.

The prevalence of obesity in the United States in 2017-2018 was 42.4%. Webb County, Texas with a 95.6% Hispanic population shows an obesity prevalence of 35.8% in 2014. It is unclear whether obesity increases the risks of complications and mortality in Hispanic population from COVID-19 disease. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 2020 and August 2020. 950 patients were tested and admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients were categorized into classes of body habitus by BMI: underweight (< 18.5), normal (18.5-24.9), overweight (25.0-29.9), obesity class 1 (30.0-34.9), obesity class 2 (35.0-39.9), and obesity class 3 ( >40.0). RESULTS: 950 Hispanic patients were included (Male-52.8%, Female- 47.2%) in the study. In total, 19.05% of our patients died during the hospitalization with an increased risk of mortality in patients having obesity class 2 (RR 4.14, 95% CI = 2.2C7.7 p=< 0.0001), and obesity class 3 (RR 6.0, 95% CI = 1.3C4.6 p=< 0.0001) compared with those with normal BMI. Mortality was higher in obese patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation at 93.75% compared to obese patients who were non-ventilated at 4.29%.

Avoidance behavior impacts daily function and is proposed to impair extinction learning. However, despite its prevalence, its objective assessment remains a challenge. To this end, we developed a fully automated experimental procedure using immersive virtual reality. The procedure contained a behavioral search, forced-choice, and an approach task with varying degrees of freedom and task relevance of the stimuli. In this study, we examined the sensitivity and feasibility of these tasks to assess avoidance behavior in patients with specific phobia. We adapted the tasks by replacing the originally conditioned stimuli with a spider and a neutral animal and investigated 31 female participants composed of 15 spider-phobic and 16 non-phobic participants. As the non-phobics were quite heterogeneous in terms of their Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ) scores, we subdivided them into six \\"fearfuls\\" that had elevated FSQ scores, and 10 \\"non-fearfuls\\" that had no fear of spiders. The phobics successfully managed to complete the procedure and showed consistent avoidance behavior across all behavioral tasks. Compared to the non-fearfuls, which did not show any avoidance behavior at all, the phobics looked at the spider much more often and clearly directed their body toward it in the search task. In the approach task, they hesitated most when they were close to the spider, and their difficulty to touch the spider was reflected in a strong increase in right hand acceleration changes. The fearfuls showed avoidance behavior depending on the tasks: strongest in the search task and weakest in the approach task. Additionally, we identified subjective valence ratings of the spider as the main influence on both objective avoidance behavior and subjective well-being after exposure, mediating the effect of the FSQ. In summary, the behavioral tasks are well suited to assess avoidance behavior in phobic participants and provide detailed insights into the process of avoidance.","output":"Facing Your Fear in Immersive Virtual Reality: Avoidance Behavior in Specific Phobia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accounting for SARS-CoV-2 adsorption on solids suspended in wastewater is a necessary step towards the reliable estimation of virus shedding rate in a sewerage system, based on measurements performed at a terminal collection station, i.e., at the entrance of a wastewater treatment plant.

RESULTS: The national level of infection with seasonal respiratory viruses, which generally does not necessitate quarantine or contact screening, was greatly reduced after Canada imposed physical distancing and other quarantine measures. The 2019C2020 influenza season ended earlier than it did in the previous year. The influenza virus was replaced by rhinovirus/enterovirus or parainfluenza virus in the previous year, with the overall test positivity remaining at approximately 35%. However, during the 2019C2020 post-influenza period, the overall test positivity of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 was still low (7.2%).

METHODS: Medline was searched for articles on massive transfusion, transfusion, trauma, surgery, coagulopathy and hemostatic defects. A group of experts reviewed the findings. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Coagulopathy will result from hemodilution, hypothermia, the use of fractionated blood products and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The clinical significance of the effects of hydroxyethyl starch solutions on hemostasis remains unclear. Maintaining a normal body temperature is a first-line, effective strategy to improve hemostasis during massive transfusion. Red cells play an important role in coagulation and hematocrits higher than 30% may be required to sustain hemostasis. In elective surgery patients, a decrease in fibrinogen concentration is observed initially while thrombocytopenia is a late occurrence. In trauma patients, tissue trauma, shock, tissue anoxia and hypothermia contribute to the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation and microvascular bleeding. The use of platelets and/or fresh frozen plasma should depend on clinical judgment as well as the results of coagulation testing and should be used mainly to treat a clinical coagulopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Coagulopathy associated with massive transfusion remains an important clinical problem. It is an intricate, multifactorial and multicellular event. Treatment strategies include the maintenance of adequate tissue perfusion, the correction of hypothermia and anemia, and the use of hemostatic blood products to correct microvascular bleeding.

Several drugs like Remdesivir, Azithromycin, Favirapir, Ritonavir, Darunavir, etc., are put under evaluation in more than 300 clinical trials to treat COVID-19. On the other hand, several vaccines like Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnsons Janssen, Sputnik V, Covishield, Covaxin, etc., also evolved from the research study. While few of them already gets approved, others show encouraging results and are still under assessment. In parallel, there are also significant developments in new drug development. But, since the approval of new molecules takes substantial time, drug repurposing studies have also gained considerable momentum. The primary agent of the disease progression of COVID-19 is SARS-CoV2/nCoV, which is believed to have 89% genetic resemblance with SARS-CoV, a coronavirus responsible for the massive outbreak in 2003. With this hypothesis, Human-SARS-CoV protein interactions are used to develop an in-silico Human-nCoV network by identifying potential COVID-19 human spreader proteins by applying the SIS model and fuzzy thresholding by a possible COVID-19 FDA drugs target-based validation. At first, the complete list of FDA drugs is identified for the level-1 and level-2 spreader proteins in this network, followed by applying a drug consensus scoring strategy. The same consensus strategy is involved in the second analysis but on a curated overlapping set of key genes/proteins identified from COVID-19 symptoms.

Since the very high number of disposable masks being used globally on a daily basis to face the Covid19 pandemic is posing new environmental risks, mainly connected to improper disposal, any possible improvements in the management of this waste stream is very important. In this work their potential use as sound porous absorber is discussed. Surgical face masks are mainly made of polypropylene fibers which show good acoustical properties. Their porous structure was studied through the measurement of some non-acoustic properties: bulk density, fiber diameter, porosity, flow resistivity and tortuosity. Moreover, the sound absorption performance of samples, made of scrapped face masks, with different thicknesses was evaluated using an impedance tube according to ISO 10534-2. The results obtained from the sound absorption spectra and two single indexes, Noise Reduction Coefficient and Sound Absorption Average showed a high sound absorption value over a frequency range of interest. Finally, the sound absorption spectra obtained for surgical face masks were compared with those obtained for fibrous materials currently used in building sector, suggesting that this fibrous waste could act as a possible substitute to traditional ones.","output":"The recycling of surgical face masks as sound porous absorbers: Preliminary evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infertility is defined as a couples inability to conceive after at least one year of regular unprotected intercourse. This condition has become a global health problem affecting approximately 187 million couples worldwide and about half of the cases are attributable to male factors. Oxidative stress is a common reason for several conditions associated with male infertility. High levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) impair sperm quality by decreasing motility and increasing the oxidation of DNA, of protein and of lipids. Multi-antioxidant supplementation is considered effective for male fertility parameters due to the synergistic effects of antioxidants. Most of them act by decreasing ROS concentration, thus improving sperm quality. In addition, other natural molecules, myo-inositol (MI) and d-chiroCinositol (DCI), ameliorate sperm quality. In sperm cells, MI is involved in many transduction mechanisms that regulate cytoplasmic calcium levels, capacitation and mitochondrial function. On the other hand, DCI is involved in the downregulation of steroidogenic enzyme aromatase, which produces testosterone.

It also causes significant economic burdens that are associated with health-care costs and loss of labor. Usually, the treatment of dengue infection is supportive therapy and not the specific treatment for it, while it is often clinically difficult to predict whether dengue-infected patients will progress to severe diseases or not. We here propose integrated management strategies for early dengue virus (DENV) infection based on our 5-year experience in early management of dengue infection, literature reviews, and research studies over the last 10 years. This proposal consists of 4 aspects: (1) rehydration with oral rehydration therapy, (2) reduction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF- and IL-6 with oral cytokine inhibitors i.e., pentoxifylline and doxycycline, (3) inhibition of DENV replication, viral load reduction, nonstructural protein 1 antigen (NS1Ag) clearance with doxycycline and ivermectin, (4) restoration of the immune function with vitamin D and zinc supplementation. The major benefit of these drugs and supplements is that they are already approved by regulatory bodies, affordable, and clinically safe. They result in better clinical and laboratory outcomes, including in a reduction in hospitalization and cost of treatment.

Here, we discuss how patient care was provided collaboratively by the local community teams integrated with remote specialist oncology services. A 77-year-old patient presented with symptoms of cauda equina secondary to a large metastatic sacral deposit. The deposit was biopsied, and histology revealed a diagnosis of differentiated follicular thyroid cancer that was treated with external beam radiotherapy and thyroidectomy, followed by radioiodine. However, the disease was found to be resistant to radioiodine therapy, and the patient subsequently developed back pain due to new bone metastases. After further palliative external beam radiotherapy, the patient was started on systemic treatment with lenvatinib. Treatment has continued for more than 2.5 years with a slow but steady improvement in symptoms and quality of life. Monitoring and assessment of lenvatinib therapy and management of associated toxicities was coordinated remotely from a specialist cancer center over 200 miles away, using the skills of the local medical and nursing teams.

Influenza surveillance is critical for providing information to national influenza programmes and for making vaccine composition predictions. Vaccination prevents viral infections, but rapid influenza evolution results in emerging mutants that differ antigenically from vaccine strains. Current influenza surveillance relies on Sanger sequencing of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene. Its classification according to World Health Organization (WHO) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) guidelines is based on combining certain genotypic amino acid mutations and phylogenetic analysis. Next-generation sequencing technologies enable a shift to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for influenza surveillance, but this requires laboratory workflow adaptations and advanced bioinformatics workflows. In this study, 253 influenza A(H3N2) positive clinical specimens from the 2016C2017 Belgian season underwent WGS using the Illumina MiSeq system. HA-based classification according to WHO/ECDC guidelines did not allow classification of all samples. A new approach, considering the whole genome, was investigated based on using powerful phylogenomic tools including beast and Nextstrain, which substantially improved phylogenetic classification. Moreover, Bayesian inference via beast facilitated reassortment detection by both manual inspection and computational methods, detecting intra-subtype reassortants at an estimated rate of 15 %. Real-time analysis (i.e. as an outbreak is ongoing) via Nextstrain allowed positioning of the Belgian isolates into the globally circulating context. Finally, integration of patient data with phylogenetic groups and reassortment status allowed detection of several associations that would have been missed when solely considering HA, such as hospitalized patients being more likely to be infected with A(H3N2) reassortants, and the possibility to link several phylogenetic groups to disease severity indicators could be relevant for epidemiological monitoring. Our study demonstrates that WGS offers multiple advantages for influenza monitoring in (inter)national influenza surveillance, and proposes an improved methodology. This allows leveraging all information contained in influenza genomes, and allows for more accurate genetic characterization and reassortment detection.","output":"Whole-genome-based phylogenomic analysis of the Belgian 2016C2017 influenza A(H3N2) outbreak season allows improved surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Control of molecular chirality is a fundamental challenge in organic synthesis. Whereas methods to construct carbon stereocentres enantioselectively are well established, routes to synthesize enriched heteroatomic stereocentres have garnered less attention1-5. Of those atoms commonly present in organic molecules, nitrogen is the most difficult to control stereochemically. Although a limited number of resolution processes have been demonstrated6-8, no general methodology exists to enantioselectively prepare a nitrogen stereocentre. Here we show that control of the chirality of ammonium cations is easily achieved through a supramolecular recognition process. By combining enantioselective ammonium recognition mediated by 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol scaffolds with conditions that allow the nitrogen stereocentre to racemize, chiral ammonium cations can be produced in excellent yields and selectivities. Mechanistic investigations demonstrate that, through a combination of solution and solid-phase recognition, a thermodynamically driven adductive crystallization process is responsible for the observed selectivity. Distinct from processes based on dynamic and kinetic resolution, which are under kinetic control, this allows for increased selectivity over time by a self-corrective process. The importance of nitrogen stereocentres can be revealed through a stereoselective supramolecular recognition, which is not possible with naturally occurring pseudoenantiomeric Cinchona alkaloids.

As known from previous studies, 25-OH in pure monolayers can be anchored to the water surface with a hydroxyl group at either C(3) or C(25). In this study, we investigated how the presence of additional strong interactions with sphingolipids modifies the surface arrangement of 25-OH. Results have shown that, in the 25-OH/GM1 system, there are no preferences regarding the orientation of the 25-OH molecule in surface complexes and two types of complexes are formed. On the other hand, SM enforces one specific orientation of 25-OH: being anchored with the C(3)-OH group to the water. The strength of interactions between the studied sphingolipids and 25-OH versus cholesterol is similar, which indicates that cholesterol may well be replaced by oxysterol in the lipid raft system. In this way, the composition of lipid rafts can be modified, changing their rheological properties and, as a consequence, influencing their proper functioning.","output":"How the replacement of cholesterol by 25-hydroxycholesterol affects the interactions with sphingolipids: The Langmuir Monolayer Study complemented with theoretical calculations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The integration of personal protective equipment (PPE) and procedures into breast imaging and intervention practices will mitigate the risk of transmission of COVID-19 during the pandemic.

Alectinib is a second-generation ALK inhibitors. Here we describe 2 clinical cases of patients with choroidal metastasis of ALK rearranged NSCLC who received Alectinib as first-line therapy achieving disease control and quality of life improvement. PATIENTS CONCERNS In case report 1, 62-year-old man presented with scintillated scotomas at the level of the right eye; in case report 2, 69-year-old man presented with respiratory distress, persistent cough resistant to medical therapy, pain, and blurred vision. DIAGNOSES In case report 1, fundus and ultrasonographic examination showed circumscribed choroid thickening with dome-like appearance compatible with repetitive lesion. Computed tomographic/y (CT) showed multiple bilateral pulmonary nodular formations and adenocarcinoma of the lung was diagnosed by a transbronchial biopsy.In case report 2, CT showed a primary lesion of 36  27 mm in the middle lobe with bilateral lung metastases and lymphadenopathies. Multiple hepatic metastases and minor suspicious bone repetitions. A liver biopsy made a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma compatible with pulmonary primitiveness. An ocular fluoroangiography evidenced a left choroidal metastasis. INTERVENTIONS Case report 1, 2, medical treatment with Alectinib 1200 mg/day was initiated. OUTCOMES In case report 1, a few days after beginning the treatment, both systemic symptoms like respiratory distress and low vision were palliated. Reassessment by CT confirmed treatment response. In case report 2, clinically, visus disorders had already improved 2 weeks after beginning treatment. CT showed pulmonary, nodal, and hepatic response.

The severity of the epidemic has largely been controlled in many countries, but continues to inflict severe public health and socioeconomic burden in some parts of Nigeria. One of the major reasons for Nigeria's failure in the fight against the epidemic is lack of effective health care system and awareness programs which play a vital role in the control of the blinding trachoma epidemic. This study proposed a mathematical model to study the transmission dynamics of blinding trachoma in Nigeria that consider both person to person and vector transmission dynamics. The analysis shows that the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when R(0)1. We fit the model with field data instances from Northern Nigeria and provide a detailed estimation of the model parameters. Our result shows that, the epidemic could increase if awareness programs are not properly implemented. We obtained some simulation results with the aid of mesh plots for the reproductive number R-0 as a function of two different biological parameters.

The composite primary endpoint combined tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation and death within 7 days of admission. Stabilized weights were computed for patients based on propensity score (DPP-4 inhibitors users vs. non-users) and were used in multivariable logistic regression models to estimate the average treatment effect in the treated as inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). RESULTS: Five hundred and ninety-six participants were under DPP-4 inhibitors before admission to hospital (24.3%). The primary outcome occurred at similar rates in users and non-users of DPP-4 inhibitors (27.7% vs. 28.6%; p = .68). In propensity analysis, the IPTW-adjusted models showed no significant association between the use of DPP-4 inhibitors and the primary outcome by Day 7 (OR [95% CI]: 0.95 [0.77-1.17]) or Day 28 (OR [95% CI]: 0.96 [0.78-1.17]).

Previous research has identified few studies examining the efficacy of educational interventions on parental concussion knowledge. The aim of this research was to actively work together with children who have experienced a concussion and their parents to develop, refine, and evaluate the usability of a web-based infographic for pediatric concussion. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to report on the usability of the infographic, parental knowledge, and self-confidence in pediatric concussion knowledge before and after exposure to the infographic. METHODS: A multiphase, multimethod research design using patient engagement techniques was used to develop a web-based infographic. For this phase of the research (usability, knowledge, and confidence evaluation), parents who could communicate in English were recruited via social media platforms and invited to complete web-based questionnaires. Electronic preintervention and postintervention questionnaires were administered to parents to assess changes to concussion knowledge and confidence after viewing the infographic. A usability questionnaire with 11 items was also completed. RESULTS: A web-based, infographic was developed. The infographic is intended for parents and children and incorporates information that parents and children identified as both wants and needs about concussion alongside the best available research evidence on pediatric concussion. A total of 31 surveys were completed by parents. The mean scores for each item on the usability surveys ranged from 8.03 (SD 1.70) to 9.26 (SD 1.09) on a 10-point Likert scale, indicating that the usability components of the infographic were largely positive. There was no statistically significant difference between preintervention and postintervention knowledge scores (Z=?0.593; P=.55; both preintervention and postintervention knowledge scores had a median of 9 out of 10).

However, the expression of ACE2 is extremely low in a variety of human tissues, especially in the airways. Thus, other coreceptors and/or cofactors on the surface of host cells may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we identified nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA (MYH9) as an important host factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection of human pulmonary cells by using APEX2 proximity-labeling techniques. Genetic ablation of MYH9 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in wild type (WT) A549 and Calu-3 cells, and overexpression of MYH9 enhanced the pseudovirus infection in WT A549 and H1299 cells. MYH9 was colocalized with the SARS-CoV-2 S and directly interacted with SARS-CoV-2 S through the S2 subunit and S1-NTD (N-terminal domain) by its C-terminal domain (designated as PRA). Further experiments suggested that endosomal or myosin inhibitors effectively block the viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 into PRA-A549 cells, while transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin B and L (CatB/L) inhibitors do not, indicating that MYH9 promotes SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis and bypasses TMPRSS2 and CatB/L pathway.

However, SCADA systems are continuously exposed to various heterogeneous cyberattacks, making the detection task using the conventional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) very challenging. Furthermore, conventional security solutions, such as firewalls, and antivirus software, are not appropriate for fully protecting SCADA systems because they have distinct specifications. Thus, accurately detecting cyber-attacks in critical SCADA systems is undoubtedly indispensable to enhance their resilience, ensure safe operations, and avoid costly maintenance. The overarching goal of this paper is to detect malicious intrusions that already detoured traditional IDS and firewalls. In this paper, a stacked deep learning method is introduced to identify malicious attacks targeting SCADA systems. Specifically, we investigate the feasibility of a deep learning approach for intrusion detection in SCADA systems. Real data sets from two laboratory-scale SCADA systems, a two-line three-bus power transmission system and a gas pipeline are used to evaluate the proposed methods performance. The results of this investigation show the satisfying detection performance of the proposed stacked deep learning approach. This study also showed that the proposed approach outperformed the standalone deep learning models and the state-of-the-art algorithms, including Nearest neighbor, Random forests, Naive Bayes, Adaboost, Support Vector Machine, and oneR. Besides detecting the malicious attacks, we also investigate the feature importance of the cyber-attacks detection process using the Random Forest procedure, which helps design more parsimonious models.","output":"A stacked deep learning approach to cyber-attacks detection in industrial systems: application to power system and gas pipeline systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites of the host cells.

METHOD: An online multicategorical questionnaire was distributed to collect demographic information combined with the following tools: Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), WHO-5 wellbeing score, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A snowball non-discriminate sampling procedure was conducted to collect data from people attending or working at higher institutions from March 1, 2020 to April 24, 2020. A total of 1723 completed responses (917 males, 37.4 13.4 years old and 806 females 32.2  11.5 years old) were collected. RESULTS: The female participants had significantly lower mental health scores than males (53.9% vs. 46.1%). The mental wellbeing scores were higher among participants with medium and high physical activity (PA) levels (p < 0.00). Additionally, the mental wellbeing scores were significantly improved by dietary quality and its sleeping score (p < 0.001). However, PA was by far the major determinant of the mental health scores.

In this paper were investigated the physiological traits of two populations of Dictyota dichotoma var. intricata, living at two different pH for several generations to assess the reasons of the algae reduced abundance at current (8.1) compared to low pH (6.7). Besides, through transplant experiments, the two populations were analysed for the stress response and reversibility of physiological performance at different pH. The long-term acclimation to high pCO2/low pH favours an ecotype characterised by low energetic costs, higher photochemical efficiency and more resistance to the oxidative stress, compared to individuals living at current pH. These traits promoted the growth and reproduction of the community living at pH 6.7, favouring a lower macroalgal diversity, but a higher ecological success under ocean acidification. The similar behaviour observed between Dictyota living at pH 6.7 and transplanted thalli from pH 6.7 to 8.1, suggested a high tolerance to pH changes in the short-term. On the contrary, adaptive responses may have favoured molecular adjustments on the long-term, as showed by the significant differences between the wild populations at pH 8.1 and 6.7. The overall data indicate that both plasticity and adaptive mechanisms may be the reasons for the success of the brown seaweeds under future high pCO2/low pH. The plasticity due to photochemistry adjustments is likely involved in the early response to environmental changes. Conversely, modifications in the photosynthetic biochemical machinery suggest that more complex adaptive mechanisms occurred in the current population of Dictyota living at pH 6.7. Further studies on population genetics will reveal if any differentiation is taking place at the population level or a local adaptation has already occurred in Dictyota and other brown algae under chronic low pH.","output":"Long-term response of Dictyota dichotoma var. intricata (C.

Despite their potential toxicity, these materials have even been used in face masks to prevent COVID-19 transmission. The increasingly widespread use of these materials requires the design and implementation of appropriate, versatile, and accurate toxicological screening methods to guarantee their safety. Murine models are adequate, though limited when exploring different doses and lengths of exposureas this increases the number of animals required, contrary to the Three Rs principle in animal experimentation. This article proposes an in vitro model using primary, non-transformed normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells as an alternative to the most widely used model to date, the human lung tumor cell line A549. The model has been tested with three graphene derivativesgraphene oxide (GO), few-layer graphene (FLG), and small FLG (sFLG). Results We observed a cytotoxic effect (necrosis and apoptosis) at early (6- and 24-hour) exposures, which intensified after seven days of contact between cells and the graphene-related materials (GRMs)with cell death reaching 90% after a 5 g/mL dose. A549 cells are more resistant to necrosis and apoptosis, yielding values less than half those of NHBE cells at low concentrations of GRMs (between 0.05 and 5 g/mL). Indeed, GRM-induced cell death in NHBE cells is comparable to that induced by toxic compounds such as diesel exhaust particles on the same cell line. Conclusions We propose NHBE as a suitable model to test GRM-induced toxicity, allowing refinement of the dose concentrations and exposure timings for better-designed in vivo mouse assays.","output":"Rapid and Efficient Testing of The Toxicity of Graphene-Related Materials in Primary Human Lung Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Elderly individuals are at high risk for severe COVID-19.

A patient's prognosis is determined using a SOFA or MSOFA score to measure likelihood of survival to discharge, as well as a consideration of relevant comorbidities and their effects on likelihood of survival up to one or five years. Although some guidelines use age as a tiebreaker when two patients' prognoses are identical, others refuse to consider age for fear of discriminating against the elderly. In this paper, I argue that age is directly relevant for maximizing health benefits, so current ethics guidelines are wrongly excluding or deemphasizing life-stage in their triage algorithms. Research on COVID-19 has shown that age is a risk factor in adverse outcomes, independent of comorbidities. And limiting a consideration of life-years to only one or five years past discharge does not maximize health benefits. Therefore, based on their own stated values, triage algorithms for coronavirus patients ought to include life-stage as a primary consideration, along with the SOFA score and comorbidities, rather than excluding it or using it merely as a tiebreaker. This is not discriminatory because patients ought to have equal opportunity to experience life-stages. The equitable enforcement of that right justifies unequal treatment based on age in cases when there is a scarcity of life-saving resources. A consideration of life-stage would thus allow healthcare workers to responsibly steward public resources in order to maximize lives and life-years saved.","output":"A consequentialist argument for considering age in triage decisions during the coronavirus pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study assessed psychosocial predictors of U.S. adults' willingness to get a future COVID-19 vaccine and whether these predictors differ under an emergency use authorization (EUA) release of the vaccine. METHODS: A survey of 788 U.S. adults was conducted to explore the relationships between demographics and psychosocial predictors of intent to get a future COVID-19 vaccine as well as willingness to get such a vaccine under EUA. RESULTS: Significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake intentions were education, having insurance, scoring high on subjective norms, a positive attitude toward the vaccine, as well as high perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, high perceived benefits of the vaccine, scoring low on barriers to the vaccine, and scoring high on self-efficacy. Predictors of willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine under EUA were age, race/ethnicity, positive subjective norms, high perceived behavioral control, positive attitudes toward the vaccine, as well as high perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, high perceived benefits of the vaccine, low barriers to the vaccine, and scoring high on self-efficacy for getting the vaccine. Concerns about rushed vaccine development appear to reduce vaccine uptake intent, as well as willingness to get the vaccine under EUA.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether residual blood samples can be used for SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence monitoring in pediatrics. METHODS In this repeated cross-sectional cohort study, anonymous residual blood samples from pediatric patients aged 0-17 years were collected in three time-periods (Oct.-Nov. 2020, April 2021, and June-July 2021) and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (anti-S) and nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibodies using commercial antibody assays. 28 reactive samples were used to compare antibody levels with a pseudotyped neutralization assay. The results were further compared to the official national COVID-19 surveillance data to calculate the number of unreported cases. RESULTS In total, n=2,626 individual blood samples were analyzed. In this unvaccinated pediatric cohort anti-S and anti-N antibody seroprevalence increased over the three time periods (anti-S: 1.38-9.16%, and 14.59%; anti-N: 1.26%, to 6.19%, and 8.56%). Compared to the national surveillance data this leads to a 3.93-5.66-fold increase in the number of unreported cases. However, a correlation between the cumulative incidence of the individual provinces and our assigned data was found (r=0.74, p=0.0151).

Research from high income countries has found many challenges associated with the meaningful implementation of CE in practice, but this has been underexplored in LIMCS and in South East Asia (SEA) in particular. Methods We completed a realist synthesis and systematic review of peer reviewed publications and grey literature to identify the context and actions which promote successful implementation of CE approaches in SEA. We used a theory-driven approach-realist synthesis-to analyse data and develop context-mechanism-outcome configurations that can be used to explain how civic engagement approaches operate in South East Asian contexts. We worked closely with patient and public representatives to guide the review from the outset. Results Fifty-seven published and unpublished articles were included, 24 were evaluations of CE, including two Randomized Controlled Trials. The majority of CE interventions featured uptake or adaptation of Western models of care. We identified important cultural differences in the enactment of civic engagement in SEA contexts and four mechanisms which, alongside their contextual barriers and facilitators, can be used to explain how civic engagement produces a range of outcomes for people experiencing mental health problems, their families and communities. Our review illustrates how CE interventions can be successfully implemented in SEA, however Western models should be adapted to fit with local cultures and values to promote successful implementation. Barriers to implementation included distrust of services/outside agencies, stigma, paternalistic cultures, limited resource and infrastructure. Conclusion Our findings provide guidance for the implementation of CE approaches within SEA contexts and identify areas for further research.

Patient characteristics, operator, number of passes, accuracy of placement, immediate and delayed periprocedural complications and radiation exposure were assessed. RESULTS Five patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and one patient with a large cerebellar infarct (average age 45.5 years (range 39-53), four women) underwent EVD placement within the angiography suite using iGuide. Four procedures were performed by a neuroradiologist and two by a neurosurgeon. All catheters were placed with a single pass and all terminated within the frontal horn of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle. No parenchymal or intraventricular hemorrhages were encountered after catheter placement. No patients experienced any immediate or delayed periprocedural complications. Radiation exposure related to the FD CTs required for placement was 593.7 mGy (range 539-673).

The content of the hernia was reduced into the abdomen, and the diaphragmatic defect was closed with a running laparoscopic suture using a self-fixating suture. Clips were placed at the edges of the suture to secure the pledged sutures to both the anterior and posterior fascia. Demographic data such as BMI and operative and postoperative data were collected. RESULTS: Retrospectively collected data for 9 patients were analyzed. There were 1 (11.1%) males and 8 (88.8%) females. The median BMI was 29.1452 kg/m2. The median operative time was 8025 minutes. There were no intraoperative complications or conversions to open surgery. Patients began a fluid diet on the first postoperative day and were discharged after a median hospital stay of 31.87 days. In a median follow-up of 36 months, we did not observe any recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: Transabdominal laparoscopic approach with primary closure of the diaphragmatic defect is a viable approach for the repair of Morgagni hernia. In our experience, the use of laparoscopic transabdominal suture fixed to the fascia allowed the closure of the defect laparoscopically with minimal tension on the repairs.","output":"Laparoscopic repair of giant Morgagni hernia by direct suturing with V-Loc"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates whether the real interest rate parity (RIRP) is valid during the three waves of globalizations that occurred in the last 150 years (1870C1914, 1944C1971, 1989 to the present). If any, these periods should favor RIRP, since globalization is a process where economies and financial markets become increasingly integrated into a global economic system. In contrast to the existing literature, we model the departures from RIRP as a long-term memory process and apply fractional integration methods on a sample of real interest rate differentials of seven developed countries: France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Japan, Spain, and the UK across the three globalization waves paired against the USA. We compute impulse response functions (IRF) to gain further insight into the memory characteristics of the RIRP differential processes and provide half-life estimates. We find that deviations from RIRP are mean reverting, providing robust evidence of real interest rate convergence during the three globalization waves. We shed further light on financial and commodity market integration during the three globalization waves by assessing the memory properties of uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) and relative purchasing power parity (PPP) differential processes. We find that deviations from relative PPP and UIP are not always mean-reverting processes. RIRP, relative PPP, and UIP hold simultaneously only in 7 out of 21 cases; RIRP and UIP hold in 11 out of 21 cases; RIRP hold without the support of relative PPP and UIP in 3 out of 21 cases. Thus, the evidence in favor of real interest rate convergence appears to be driven more by UIP than relative PPP.

Herein, we present a facile one-pot hydrothermal strategy for fabricating ZnO nanorod-decorated 3D graphene aerogels (ZnO/GAs). In this nanoarchitecture, GAs act as a new generation enhanced carrier, which can effectively improve the photoactivity of ZnO under visible light by enhancing the interfacial charge transfer. In addition, the as-prepared ZnO/GA nanocomposites exhibited two times higher photocurrent intensity than that of ZnO/graphene. Furthermore, we developed a novel self-powered PEC biosensor based on a ZnO/GAs sensitized structure with the amplification of enzymolysis products for the detection of parathion-methyl. Thiocholin, as a sacrificial electron donor, which is produced from the hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine catalyzed by acetylcholinesterase (AChE), can further significantly improve the photocurrent. Then, the inhibition of AChE activity by parathion-methyl prevented the production of thiocholine, resulting in an obvious decrease in photocurrents. Based on the above results, we fabricated an AChE-based self-powered PEC biosensor for the sensitive and selective determination of parathion-methyl with a linear range of 0.1 ng mL-1 to 0.1 g mL-1 and a detection limit of 0.03 ng mL-1 (S/N = 3). This PEC biosensing strategy not only gives insights into using GAs as a novel sensibilizer to improve the PEC nature of semiconductors but also provides a promising flexible platform for organophosphorus pesticide detection.","output":"A one-step hydrothermal route to fabricate a ZnO nanorod/3D graphene aerogel-sensitized structure with enhanced photoelectrochemistry performance and self-powered photoelectrochemical biosensing of parathion-methyl"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the public has often expressed great appreciation toward medical personnel who were often shown in the media expressing strong emotions about the situation. To examine whether the perception of people on a physician is in fact influenced by whether the physician treats patients with COVID-19 and the emotions they expressed in response to the situation, 454 participants were recruited in May 2020. Participants saw facial expressions of anger, sadness, happiness, and neutrality which supposedly were shown by physicians who were presented as working either in COVID-19 wards or in an internal medicine ward. Participants rated how competent, empathetic, caring, and likable each physician was, to what degree they would wish to be treated by each physician, and what salary each physician deserved. Physicians treating patients with COVID-19 were seen more positively and as deserving higher pay; they appeared more competent, caring, likable, and were more likely to be chosen as a caregiver compared to physicians not treating patients with COVID-19. The expressed emotions of physicians had a strong impact on how they were perceived, yet this effect was largely unrelated to whether they treated patients with COVID-19 or not such that happy physicians seemed more empathetic, caring, and likable than the physicians who showed negative emotions. Positive regard toward physicians treating patients with COVID-19 was associated with the fact that they were seen as saving lives and not due to the risk imposed by their work.","output":"Does It Pay to Treat Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019?

However, the exposure to SARS-CoV-2 of pets from households with no COVID-19 cases or stray animals remains less assessed. Using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT90), we investigated the infection and previous exposure of dogs and cats to SARS-CoV-2 during the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

MiRNAs can interact with other molecules such as viruses and act as a mediator for viral infection. In this study, we examined whether, and to what extent, the SARS-CoV-2 virus can serve as a sponge for human miRNAs. RESULTS: We identified multiple potential miRNA/target pairs that may be disrupted during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using miRNA expression profiles and RNA-seq from published studies, we further identified a highly confident list of 5 miRNA/target pairs that could be disrupted by the viruss miRNA sponge effect, namely hsa-miR-374a-5p/APOL6, hsa-let-7f-1-3p/EIF4A2, hsa-miR-374a-3p/PARP11, hsa-miR-548d-3p/PSMA2 and hsa-miR-23b-3p/ZNFX1 pairs. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing based data, we identified two important miRNAs, hsa-miR-302c-5p and hsa-miR-16-5p, to be potential virus targeting miRNAs across multiple cell types from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples. We further validated some of our findings using miRNA and gene enrichment analyses and the results confirmed with findings from previous studies that some of these identified miRNA/target pairs are involved in ACE2 receptor network, regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and in immune cell maturation and differentiation. CONCLUSION: Using publicly available databases and patient-related expression data, we found that acting as a miRNA sponge could be one explanation for SARS-CoV-2-mediated pathophysiological changes.

It has developed into a threatening international public health emergency. With the exception of China, the number of cases continues to increase worldwide. A number of studies about disease diagnosis and treatment have been carried out, and many clinically proven effective results have been achieved. Although information technology can improve the transferring of such knowledge to clinical practice rapidly, data interoperability is still a challenge due to the heterogeneous nature of hospital information systems. This issue becomes even more serious if the knowledge for diagnosis and treatment is updated rapidly as is the case for COVID-19. An open, semantic-sharing, and collaborative-information modeling framework is needed to rapidly develop a shared data model for exchanging data among systems. openEHR is such a framework and is supported by many open software packages that help to promote information sharing and interoperability. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a shared data model based on the openEHR modeling approach to improve the interoperability among systems for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: The latest Guideline of COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment in China was selected as the knowledge source for modeling. First, the guideline was analyzed and the data items used for diagnosis and treatment, and management were extracted. Second, the data items were classified and further organized into domain concepts with a mind map. Third, searching was executed in the international openEHR Clinical Knowledge Manager (CKM) to find the existing archetypes that could represent the concepts. New archetypes were developed for those concepts that could not be found. Fourth, these archetypes were further organized into a template using Ocean Template Editor. Fifth, a test case of data exchanging between the clinical data repository and clinical decision support system based on the template was conducted to verify the feasibility of the study. RESULTS: A total of 203 data items were extracted from the guideline in China, and 16 domain concepts (16 leaf nodes in the mind map) were organized. There were 22 archetypes used to develop the template for all data items extracted from the guideline. All of them could be found in the CKM and reused directly. The archetypes and templates were reviewed and finally released in a public project within the CKM. The test case showed that the template can facilitate the data exchange and meet the requirements of decision support. CONCLUSIONS: This study has developed the openEHR template for COVID-19 based on the latest guideline from China using openEHR modeling methodology.

The introduction of three-dimensional visualization, tremor elimination, a 4th arm, and 7-degree range of motion allowed a significant operator advantage over laparoscopy, especially for anastomotic suturing. After starting with pyeloplasty, the use of robotic technology with pediatric urology has expanded to include ureteral reimplantation and even more complex reconstructive procedures, such as enterocystoplasty, appendicovesicostomy, and bladder neck reconstruction. However, limitations of the Da Vinci Surgical Systems still exist despite its continued technological advances over multiple generations in the past 20 years.

Besides the classical full-length monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), so-called nanobodies (Nbs) have come into focus. A Nb is the smallest naturally-derived functional antibody fragment known and represents the variable domain (V(H)H, 15 kDa) of a camelid heavy-chain-only antibody (HCAb). Based on their nanoscale and their special structure, Nbs display striking advantages concerning their production, but also their characteristics as binders, such as high stability, diversity, improved tissue penetration and reaching of cavity-like epitopes.

Healthcare systems across the world encountered an unprecedented surge of COVID-19 patients resulting in more than half a million deaths globally. COVID-19 has affected multiple sub-specialties and procedure-related fields, including gastroenterology. Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy centers are specialized units where thousands of endoscopies are performed annually. A significant proportion of these procedures are affected due to the national and regional lockdowns across the globe. To adapt to this rapidly evolving situation, endoscopy centers have undergone significant changes and have taken unprecedented precautions to avoid the transmission of the virus. However, endoscopy centers are going through financial strain due to a reduction in the number of procedures from lockdowns and fear of virus transmission. Theoretically, endoscopies could add to the disease transmission as SARS-CoV-2 has shown to be present in the GI secretions. Multiple precautions such as mandatory use of face masks, safe distancing, use of barriers between the endoscopists and patients, negative pressure rooms, extended use of personal protective equipment, and volume reduction have been taken to decrease the risk of disease transmission by these centers.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS Qualitative study; semi-structured interviews with 32 doctors who had participated in the voluntary assisted dying system during its first year of operation (commenced 19 June 2019). Doctors were interviewed during April-July 2020. RESULTS Three major themes related to problems during the first year of operation of the Act were identified: the statutory prohibition of health professionals initiating discussions with their patients about voluntary assisted dying; the Department of Health and Human Services guidance requirement that all doctor-patient, doctor-pharmacist, and pharmacist-patient interactions be face-to-face; and aspects of implementation, including problems with the voluntary assisted dying online portal, obtaining documentary evidence to establish eligibility, and inadequate resourcing of the Statewide Pharmacy Service. CONCLUSIONS Doctors reported only limited concerns about the Victorian voluntary assisted dying legislation, but have had some problems with its operation, including implications for the accessibility of voluntary assisted dying to eligible patients. While legislative change may resolve some of these concerns, most can be ameliorated by improving the processes and systems.","output":"Participating doctors' perspectives on the regulation of voluntary assisted dying in Victoria: a qualitative study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The analogy of South Africa as an ailing organism afflicted by chronic socioeconomic inequality is apt as it captures the nations manifest endemic abrasions and frailties, especially as it relates to the lived experience of its most vulnerable citizens (the precariat). COVID-19 has accentuated the plight of the poor, yet political rhetoric professes that the pandemic does not discriminate. In this article I offer an analysis of the intricate relationship between politics, economics, and education in the South African context. I argue that these are indeed complexly connected social phenomena that have particular variant manifestations and implications for South African citizens. While I recognise that health is also implicated in this matrix, it is beyond the scope of this article to examine this crucial social provision in any detail. I contend that in attempting to understand how COVID-19 impacts South African society, it is important to firstly analyse the prevailing (pre-COVID) status quo, especially as it relates to socio-economic inequality, as the effects of the pandemic impact the lived experience of people on the indigent-affluent continuum in starkly distinct ways. The pandemic has brought into sharp purview the accentuated nature of human adversity in the South African context and the social justice peculiarities plaguing South African society. Methodologically, I attempt a Foucauldian analysis of the contemporary political-economy-education matrix to reveal how fundamental neoliberal tenets have fashioned South African society and its education system into a dualism in which poverty and affluence co-exist. I attempt to move beyond constructions of deprivation, strife and adversity to reflect on resistance and the resilience (technologies of the self) that human beings summon in the face of crisis. Secondly, I examine the impact of the pandemic at localised school level to reveal its material effects on poor schools. ?

METHODS: A cross-sectional design with online survey was used with a Self-efficacy scale, Self-confidence scale and Caring nurse-patient interaction scale: 23- item Version-Nurse (CNPI-23 N). RESULTS: A sample of 120 nurses participated in the current study. The results showed that the participants had a moderate level of self-efficacy, self-confidence and interaction (M = 28.84 (SD= 7.7), M =47.41 (SD= 9.0) and M= 93.59 (SD=16.3) respectively). Positive relationships were found between nurse' self-efficacy, self-confidence and nurse-patient interaction (r = 0.81, P < 0.0001 and 0.79, P 0.0001 respectively). Significant differences were found in self-efficacy according to years of experience, academic qualifications and position (F = 2.10, P = 0.003, F = 3.60, P = 0.002 and F = 2.60, P =0.007 respectively). Furthermore, the results indicated that there was a significant difference in self-confidence and nurse-patient interaction also.

The study objective was therefore to test these guidelines using 16 adult domestic cats (2 cohorts of 8) by observing behavioural changes associated with elimination throughout the litter transition. Cats were transitioned from a clay-based litter (CLAY) to a plant-based litter product (PLANT) over 6 days (period 1) via an incremental replacement of CLAY with PLANT. All cats then remained on PLANT for 8 days (period 2). This same transition process was executed for both cohorts, and litter box behaviours were observed via remote recording. Urination, defecation, cover, and dig behaviours were not different between periods 1 and 2 (p > 0.05). Sniffing frequency was greater in period 2 than period 1 (p < 0.05); however, during the litter transition (period 1), cats sniffed the litter boxes being transitioned from CLAY to PLANT more often and for longer than they did for the boxes consisting of only PLANT (p < 0.05).

Validated pregnancy outcome algorithms based on the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification/Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-CM/PCS) have not previously been published. METHODS: We developed algorithms to classify pregnancy outcomes and estimate GA using ICD-10-CM/PCS and service codes on claims in the 2016C2018 IBM(?) MarketScan(?) Explorys(?) Claims-EMR Data Set and compared the results with ob-gyn adjudication of electronic medical records (EMRs). Obstetric services were grouped into episodes using hierarchical and spacing requirements. GA was based on evidence with the highest clinical accuracy. Among pregnancies with obstetric EMRs, 100 full-term live births (FTBs), 100 preterm live births (PTBs), 100 spontaneous abortions (SAs), and 24 stillbirths were selected for review. Physicians adjudicated cases using Global Alignment of Immunization safety Assessment in pregnancy (GAIA) definitions applied to structured EMRs. RESULTS: The claims-based algorithms identified 34,204 pregnancies, of which 9.9% had obstetric EMRs. Of sampled pregnancies, 92 FTBs, 93 PTBs, 75 SAs, and 24 stillbirths were adjudicated. Among these pregnancies, the percent agreement was 97.8%, 62.4%, 100.0%, and 70.8% for FTBs, PTBs, SAs, and stillbirths, respectively. The percent agreement on GA within 7 and 28 days, respectively, was 85.9% and 100.0% for FTBs, 81.7% and 98.9% for PTBs, 61.3% and 94.7% for SAs, and 66.7% and 79.2% for stillbirths. CONCLUSIONS: The pregnancy outcome algorithms had high agreement with physician adjudication of EMRs and may inform post-market maternal safety surveillance.

The need for state entrepreneurship protectionism in order to rehabilitate the transport sector was proved. The conditions for including the sectors of the economy in the category of the most affected by thepandemic in the context of state protectionism were determined. Based on statistics and using the indicators of riskiness and priority of the economic sector, the sectors of the economy for allocation of financial investments were determined. The problem of determining the rate of financial capital investments was stated and solved. A comprehensive procedure for ensuring entrepreneurship protectionism in the context of financial investments for rehabilitation of the transport sector, taking into consideration the riskiness and priority of the economic sector, was proposed. Since the problem of state protectionism of entrepreneurship during the COVID-19 pandemic challenges is relevant for a number of countries, this procedure was tested on the example of the transport sector of the economy. According to the obtained results, the sectors of the economy that were recognized as the most affected by COVID-19 fall under state protectionism, and the problem of supporting the latter can only be solved through state intervention. The results of calculations show that the funds at the available amount of public finances S=1 allocated for support are distributed proportionally. The comprehensive approach made it possible to identify three sectors of the economy for financial investments, in this case, those that were most affected by COVID-19 receive the largest share of financial investments. From the practical point of view, this study is interesting for state administrations during the allocation of funds by the vector of support for the sectors of the economy that were most affected by pandemic challenges, and theoretically - to researchers dealing with financial support, protectionism, and state administration. ? 2021.

It affects the delivery of healthcare for not addressing the psychological components and may interfere with the patients attendance to necessary health care services. Therefore, a valid and reliable instrument to measure anticipated stigma related to chronic illness is vital to inform possible interventions. This study aimed to translate the Chronic Illness Anticipated Stigma Scale (CIASS) into the Amharic language and evaluate its psychometric properties in Ethiopia. METHODS: The CIASS was translated into Amharic language using standard procedures. The Amharic version was completed by 173 patients (response rate 96%) with chronic illness from three referral hospitals in the Amhara region. Internal consistency was examined through Cronbachs alpha. Construct validity was evaluated by confirmatory factor analysis and convergent validity by using a Pearson correlation of P-value less than or equal to 0.05. RESULTS: The internal consistency was estimated at Cronbach alpha of 0.92. By using a structural equation model, and modification indices a model fitness testing was run and shows a root mean squared error of approximation 0.049 (90% CI, 0.012C0.075). The structural validity results in 78.8% of confirmatory factor analysis showed from the extraction of the three-dimension (components). Validity tests for convergent by using Pearson correlation positively correlated with common mental distress and negatively correlated with quality of lifeCBREF, and the construct validity shows a good valid tool to CIASS. CONCLUSION: The Amharic language version of the chronic illness anticipated stigma scale shows a satisfactory level of reliability and validity on different psychometric measures of assessment. The tool may be useful for future researchers and patients with chronic illness in the Amharic-speaking population.

To explore whether the antecedents for neurodevelopmental disabilities might begin in utero, we analyzed whether fetal brain volume predicted subsequent neurodevelopmental outcome in children with CHD. Methods: Fetuses with isolated CHD and sociodemographically comparable healthy control fetuses underwent fetal brain MRI and 2-year neurodevelopmental evaluation with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III) and the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System (ABAS-3). Hierarchical regression evaluated potential predictors of Bayley-III and ABAS-3 outcomes in the CHD group, including fetal total brain volume adjusted for gestational age and sex, sociodemographic characteristics, birth parameters, and medical history. Results: The CHD group (n=52) had lower Bayley-III cognitive, language, and motor scores than the control group (n=26), but fetal brain volumes were similar. Within the CHD group, larger fetal total brain volume correlated with higher Bayley-III cognitive, language, and motor scores, and ABAS-3 adaptive functioning scores (r=0.32-0.47; all P<0.05), but not in the control group. Fetal brain volume predicted 10 21% of the variance in neurodevelopmental outcome measures in univariate analyses. Multivariable models that also included social class and postnatal factors explained 18-45% of the variance in outcome, depending on developmental domain. Moreover, in final multivariable models, fetal brain volume was the most consistent predictor of neurodevelopmental outcome across domains. Conclusions: Small fetal brain volume is a strong independent predictor of 2-year neurodevelopmental outcomes and may be an important imaging biomarker of future neurodevelopmental risk in CHD. Future studies are needed to support this hypothesis.

The present study aimed to provide current antimicrobial resistance and epidemiological profiles of S. pneumoniae infections in Taiwan. METHODS A total of 252 nonduplicate S. pneumoniae isolates were collected from patients admitted to 16 hospitals in Taiwan between January 2017 and December 2019, and were analyzed. The minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics was determined using the Vitek 2 automated system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Furthermore, epidemiological profiles of S. pneumoniae infections were analyzed. RESULTS Among the strains analyzed, 88% were recognized as invasive pneumococcal strains. According to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute criteria for non-meningitis, the prevalence of penicillin-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae demonstrated a declining trend from 43.6% in 2017 to 17.2% in 2019. However, the rate of penicillin-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae was 85.7% based on the criteria for meningitis. Furthermore, the prevalence of ceftriaxone-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae was 62.7% based on the criteria for meningitis. Isolates demonstrated higher susceptibility toward doripenem and ertapenem than toward meropenem and imipenem. An increased rate of non-susceptibility toward levofloxacin was observed in southern Taiwan (15.1%) and elderly patients (65 years; 11.4%). Most isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and linezolid. CONCLUSION Empirical treatment with ceftriaxone monotherapy for pneumococcal meningitis should be carefully monitored owing to its high non-susceptibility rate. The susceptibility rates of most isolates to penicillin (used for treating non-meningitis pneumococcal diseases), carbapenems (ertapenem and doripenem), respiratory quinolones (moxifloxacin and levofloxacin), vancomycin, and linezolid suggested the potential of these antibiotics in treating pneumococcal diseases in Taiwan.","output":"Nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in invasive isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae in Taiwan from 2017 to 2019."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a mathematical model for the transmission of COVID-19 by the Caputo fractional-order derivative.

The word \\"cadaver,\\" by definition, is a human body used by medical students and scientists to study anatomy. Our objective was to investigate whether students will use the word \\"donor\\" even when by definition, they mean \\"cadaver,\\" due to the culture of medical school and the desire to adhere to social norms. METHODS We used a validated survey instrument to compare the emotional experiences of students in a traditional dissection-based course in 2019, to those in a prosection-based course in 2020, necessitated by spatial distancing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic. Free-text responses were collected and organized into data sets, which were analyzed by evaluators blinded to the year of study. We used a grounded theory thematic analysis, beginning with a word frequency method to generate primary codes. Subsequent codes were generated by individual raters, then in group discussion, until reaching thematic saturation. RESULTS Among all data sets, and between years of study, Donor was a common primary code that was subsequently analyzed. This code was used in several connotations, or subcodes. Donor1 was used when referring to a previously living person. For example, \\"I appreciate that the donors gave their bodies to science to help us learn.\\" (Prosection group: 37%. Dissection group: 48%). Donor2 was used as a synonym for cadaver. For example, \\"spending time w/ donors was absolutely necessary in consolidating anatomy knowledge.\\" (Prosection group: 48%. Dissection group: 39%). \\"Cadaver\\" was not a high frequency word in any data set. DISCUSSION The high frequency of the subcode Donor2 illustrates that when students are describing a body in the lab from which they are dissecting/learning (by definition, a cadaver), they are replacing the term \\"cadaver\\" with donor, whether actively or subconsciously. This subcode is an example of how medical school culture and social norms can shape the way that students think and/or talk about the anatomy lab. The use of the word donor, which characteristically is defined as \\"a person who chooses to make a donation,\\" inherently reminds students that this body was a previously living person; when performing dissections, this reminder could prompt complex emotional responses that may require time and facilitation to process. While the primary function of using the word donor is to show respect, perhaps the secondary function is to enable students to compartmentalize conflicting thoughts and feelings about a single topic, which is a skill that will help them grow and develop as medical students.","output":"Medical School Culture Influences How Students Think About Gross Anatomy Lab."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) encompasses a variety of local invasion and nodal involvement and its management is still under debate. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have been shown to improve the survival in metastatic NSCLC, but are far from being accepted as an induction therapy. METHODS We retrospectively collected data of all patients who received induction ICI (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) and chemotherapy (carboplatin with paclitaxel) for stage IIIA-B NSCLC followed by surgery in our unit between January 2019 and March 2020. RESULTS Of the 12 patients (9 males, 3 females) 6 had a squamous cell carcinoma, 3 had adenocarcinoma, 1 had an undifferentiated adenocarcinoma and 1 had adeno-squamous carcinoma. Seven patients had stage IIIA disease and 5 had stage IIIB. After induction therapy, 6 patients had stable disease and 6 had a partial response. The median tumor reduction was 3.05 cm (range 2.30-8.70). All patients, but one due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak, had no delay in surgery. Two patients experienced myelosuppression after induction therapy, two had minor adverse effects. Three patients had postoperative complications not related to the induction therapy. All patients had a pathological response: 5 complete, 4 major and 3 partial. Eleven patients are alive (mean months of follow-up 18.174.97) and free of disease.

In this context, we designed a decentralized, patient-centered randomized clinical trial leveraging mobile technologies, rather than in-person site visits, to test the efficacy of 12 weeks of canagliflozin for the treatment of heart failure, regardless of ejection fraction or diabetes status, on the reduction of heart failure symptoms. METHODS: One thousand nine hundred patients will be enrolled with a medical record-confirmed diagnosis of heart failure, stratified by reduced (&#8804;40%) or preserved (>40%) ejection fraction and randomized 1:1 to 100 mg daily of canagliflozin or matching placebo. The primary outcome will be the 12-week change in the total symptom score of the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire.

Their schemas contain structural and behavioral entity descriptions. Databases must continuously be adapted to new requirements of a world in constant change while: (1) relational database management systems (RDBMS) do not allow inconsistencies in the schema; (2) stored procedure bodies are not meta-described in RDBMS such as PostgreSQL that consider their bodies as plain text. As a consequence, evaluating the impact of an evolution of the database schema is cumbersome, being essentially manual. We present a semi-automatic approach based on recommendations that can be compiled into a SQL patch fulfilling RDBMS constraints. To support recommendations, we designed a meta-model for relational databases easing computation of change impact. We performed an experiment to validate the approach by reproducing a real evolution on a database. The results of our experiment show that our approach can set the database in the same state as the one produced by the manual evolution in 75% less time.","output":"Recommendations for Evolving Relational Databases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Induction of immunological tolerance has been the holy grail of transplantation immunology for decades. The only successful approach to achieve it in patients has been a combined kidney and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an HLA-matched or -mismatched living donor. Here, we report the first three patients in Europe included in a clinical trial aiming at the induction of tolerance by mixed lymphohematopoietic chimerism after kidney transplantation. Two female and one male patient were transplanted with a kidney and peripherally mobilized hematopoietic stem cells from their HLA-identical sibling donor. The protocol followed previous studies at Stanford University: kidney transplantation was performed on day 0 including induction with anti-thymocyte globulin followed by conditioning with 10x 1.2 Gy total lymphoid irradiation and the transfusion of CD34+ cells together with a body weight-adjusted dose of donor T cells on day 11. Immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine A and steroids for 10 days, cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil for 1 month, and then cyclosporine A monotherapy with tapering over 9C20 months. The 3 patients have been off immunosuppression for 4 years, 19 months and 8 months, respectively. No rejection or graft-versus-host disease occurred. Hematological donor chimerism was stable in the first, but slowly declining in the other two patients. A molecular microscope analysis in patient 2 revealed the genetic profile of a normal kidney. No relevant infections were observed, and the quality of life in all three patients is excellent. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, all three patients were vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Comirnaty(?)), and they showed excellent humoral and in 2 out 3 patients also cellular SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. Thus, combined kidney and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a feasible and successful approach to induce specific immunological tolerance in the setting of HLA-matched sibling living kidney donation while maintaining immune responsiveness to an mRNA vaccine (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00365846).","output":"Successful Induction of Specific Immunological Tolerance by Combined Kidney and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in HLA-Identical Siblings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 outbreak had a huge worldwide impact, and several countermeasures to contain its spread have been adopted, such as the interruption of nonurgent outpatient clinics.

Twenty-five patients receiving BT therapy were surveyed using the structuralized questionnaire by Dressler and Adib Saberi, while the caregivers were assessed using the Caregiver Burden Scale. The lockdown delayed BT therapy by 9  2.8 months. Around 44% of the selected patients noticed increased muscle cramps, 24% increased muscle pain, and 32% both of them. Due to the lockdown, the patient's quality of life was reduced by 68.4  21.1%. After the lockdown, 100% of patients perceived BT therapy as more important than before. Around 76% of the patients perceived the lockdown as inadequate and felt that their rights were not respected. The overall score of the Caregiver Burden Scale, as regarded before the lockdown, was 29.12  11.63, while the overall score as regarded after the lockdown was 37.44  14.85. The overall score increased, from before the lockdown to after the lockdown, for 92% of caregivers.

However, the altitudinal distribution characteristics and possible sources of PHCZs in high mountain soils are still unknown. The present study was the first to analyze PHCZs in soil samples collected along the eastern slope of Mt. Qionglai (MQ), the east edge of the Tibetan Plateau. The concentration of PHCZs (based on dry weight) ranges from 14.4 to 107a?ng/g (median value of 40.9), which was at high end of the range reported in soils and sediments to date in the literature. The composition profiles of PHCZs in the soils of MQ were dominated by 3,6-dichlorocarbazole (36-CCZ), 3-chlorocarbazole (3-CCZ), and 2-bromocarbazole (2-BCZ). The mean TOC-normalized concentrations of PHCZs in soil samples from below-treeline (2092a?ng/g TOC) were higher than those from alpine meadow (1124a?ng/g TOC), probably due to the forest filter effect. The decreasing trend of the PHCZs TOC-normalized concentrations with altitude shows that accumulation of PHCZs from the alpine meadow samples was not affected by the mountain cold-trapping effect. Significantly positive correlations were observed between the concentrations of more than half of detected PHCZ congeners and TOC. In addition, PHCZs show the potential to represent a class of POPs with the frequent occurrence and wide distribution, as the abundance and environmental behavior of PHCZs are similar to some POPs in MQ.","output":"Occurrence and distribution of polyhalogenated carbazoles in eastern Tibetan Plateau soils along the slope of Mt.

Strategies toward Ending Preventable Maternal Mortality (EPMM) (2015) turned a broad lens on upstream systemic determinants of maternal health and survival highlighted in 11 Key Themes. A monitoring framework was developed to help countries track progress across these domains. This process yielded requests for additional indicators where stakeholders identified gaps for tracking EPMM Key Themes. In response, two technical consultations aimed at affirming the measurement gaps, specifying the constructs for measurement, and fully elaborating the metadata to allow them to be monitored. METHODS: Measures for development were prioritized based on multi-stakeholder dialogues in five countries, and data collected from government officials and UN partners in twenty countries on perceived need for proposed additional indicators. Sixty-one participants representing expertise in measure development and the topical areas covered took part across both consultations. Measures were developed through two simultaneous participatory online consultations stratified by focus area, comprising videos, discussion forums, polls, and live Zoom meetings. RESULTS: Eight candidate indicators relevant to priority recommendations in the EPMM Strategies are presented. Each includes a definition, numerator and denominator (if applicable), method of estimation, disaggregation factors, preferred data source(s), and expected periodicity. Four address gaps in measures of fundamental rights-related determinants of maternal health at national and subnational level, including womens reproductive autonomy; participative accountability for maternal health outcomes; and Respectful Maternity Care. Four strengthen the ability to count, track, and link births and maternal deaths and causes of death. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed indicators correspond to specific EPMM Key Themes, filling gaps identified by multiple stakeholders, and respond to calls for a broadened approach to measurement and for indicators that track the social and health-systems determinants of maternal health. They reflect inputs and aspirations of numerous stakeholders, gathered over time and across various platforms. The iterative, discursive exploration of the concepts for measurement and the need for metrics to track them responds to recent calls for measure development to be carried out in more inclusive ways, and to be primarily concept- and user-driven.","output":"The prioritization and development of key social and structural indicators to address gaps in a framework for monitoring the Strategies toward Ending Preventable Maternal Mortality (EPMM): Results of an iterative expert technical consultation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After accumulating data through a nationwide survey, we characterized the recent prevalences and geographic distributions of various genotypes of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) on layer farms in Japan.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between New York Citys 2014 paid sick leave mandate and health care utilization among Medicaid-enrolled adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used New York State Medicaid administrative data for adults 18 to 64 years old continuously enrolled in Medicaid from August 1, 2011, through July 31, 2017. A difference-in-differences approach with entropy balancing weights was used to compare New York City with the rest of New York State to assess the association of the paid sick leave mandate with health care utilization, and for those 40 to 64 years old, with preventive care utilization. The data analysis was performed from June through August 2020. EXPOSURES: Temporal and spatial variation in exposure to the mandate. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Annual health care utilization (emergency care, specialist visits, and primary care clinician visits) per Medicaid-enrolled adult. Secondary outcomes include categories of emergency utilization and utilization of 5 preventive services. RESULTS: Of 552 857 individuals (mean [SD] age, 43 [12] years; 351 130 [64%] women) who met inclusion criteria, 99 181 (18%) were White, 162 492 (29%) Black, and 138 061 (25%) Hispanic. Paid sick leave was significantly associated with a reduction in the probability of emergency care (?0.6 percentage points [pp]; 95% CI, ?0.7 to ?0.5 pp; P < .001), including a 0.3 pp reduction (95% CI, ?0.4 to ?0.2; P < .001) in care for conditions treatable in a primary care setting and an increase in annual outpatient visits (0.124 pp; 95% CI, 0.040 to 0.208 pp; P < .001).

We employed a Bayesian network (BN) analysis of HEV3 and HEV4 to detect epistatic connectivity among protein sites and its association with the host specificity in each genotype. The data imply coevolution among ~70% of polymorphic sites from all HEV proteins and association of numerous coevolving sites with adaptation to swine or humans.

Collecting such datasets is time-consuming and expensive. Until now, very few annotated COVID-19 imaging datasets are available. Although self-supervised learning enables us to bootstrap the training by exploiting unlabeled data, the generic self-supervised methods for natural images do not sufficiently incorporate the context. For medical images, a desirable method should be sensitive enough to detect deviation from normal-appearing tissue of each anatomical region; here, anatomy is the context. We introduce a novel approach with two levels of self-supervised representation learning objectives: one on the regional anatomical level and another on the patient-level. We use graph neural networks to incorporate the relationship between different anatomical regions. The structure of the graph is informed by anatomical correspondences between each patient and an anatomical atlas. In addition, the graph representation has the advantage of handling any arbitrarily sized image in full resolution. Experiments on large-scale Computer Tomography (CT) datasets of lung images show that our approach compares favorably to baseline methods that do not account for the context. We use the learnt embedding to quantify the clinical progression of COVID-19 and show that our method generalizes well to COVID-19 patients from different hospitals.

Since the infectious area is difficult to distinguish manually annotation, the segmentation results are time-consuming. To tackle these problems, we propose an efficient method based on a deep adversarial network to segment the infection regions automatically. Then, the predicted segment results can assist the diagnostic network in identifying the COVID-19 samples from the CT images. On the other hand, a radiologist-like segmentation network provides detailed information of the infectious regions by separating areas of ground-glass, consolidation, and pleural effusion, respectively. Our method can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability and provide lesion regions in CT images with limited training data.

Data were analyzed thematically utilizing Braun and Clarkes (2006) six-step thematic analysis process.

The individual factors thematic domain comprises intrapersonal influences, employment and educational attainment; while the social factors thematic domain includes interpersonal influences, social influences, and hope for the future. Youth living in low socio-economic status communities were thought to be at greater risk of alcohol misuse and subsequent risky behaviour, given the political and social history of marginalisation, systematic oppression, and social inequality. To address alcohol use and risky sexual behavior among youth, we recommend interventions with adolescents, parents or guardians, and the community. More specifically, interventions aimed at adolescents should focus on the transition to young adulthood. Interventions with parents should focus on their role in modelling and potentially regulating alcohol consumption. Finally, community interventions should centre on drinking behaviors, levels of drinking, what constitutes harmful drinking, and how to identify when treatment and recovery support is likely to be required.","output":"Youths Perceptions Of The Relation Between Alcohol Consumption And Risky Sexual Behaviour in the Western Cape, South Africa: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION An IPAA is the preferred operative approach for restoration of intestinal continuity in patients with ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis. As minimally invasive approaches have become more widely adopted, their use in IPAA has also become increasingly commonplace. Laparoscopy has the same limitations during the proctectomy portion as seen in operations for rectal cancer, including dissection in the mid-to-lower rectum attributed to angles created by bony confines of the deep pelvis and lack of visibility when constructing the anastomosis. Robotic surgery provides improved 3-dimensional and high-definition visualization of the pelvis and multiple degrees of freedom, which greatly enhance performance during the proctectomy and construction of the anastomosis. TECHNIQUE In the setting of a previous subtotal colectomy, the ileostomy site is taken down and stapled across. A 15-mm balloon trocar is placed in the site to achieve insufflation, and the robotic ports are placed horizontally just above the umbilicus. The lateral mesenteric attachments are mobilized laparoscopically, then the J-pouch is constructed through the ostomy site. The J-pouch is placed back into the abdomen with the anvil in place, and the proctectomy is performed after docking the robot. The rectum is stapled with the robotic stapler and exteriorized from the ileostomy site, and the anastomosis is constructed under direct robotic visualization. RESULTS In addition to the potential ergonomic advantages, the maneuverability and visualization in the pelvis during the proctectomy and construction of the anastomosis are reported by many surgeons to be improved as compared with laparoscopy, especially in male or obese patients.

BACKGROUND: Relief of bothersome migraine symptoms can influence satisfaction with treatment and therapeutic persistence. Understanding the impact of preventive treatment on a PI-MBS could improve clinical decision-making. METHODS: In PROMISE-2, patients with chronic migraine received eptinezumab 100, 300 mg, or placebo administered intravenously every 12 weeks for up to 2 doses (n = 1072). PI-MBS was an exploratory outcome requiring each patient to self-report their MBS in response to an open-ended question. At baseline and week 12, patients rated overall improvement in PI-MBS. The relationships among PI-MBS at week 12 and change in monthly migraine days (MMDs) from baseline to month 3 (weeks 9-12), Patient Global Impression of Change at week 12, and changes from baseline to week 12 in the 6-item Headache Impact Test total, EuroQol 5-dimensions 5-levels visual analog scale, and 36-item Short-Form Health Survey component scores were assessed. RESULTS: Treatment groups had similar baseline characteristics and reported a total of 23 unique PI-MBS, most commonly light sensitivity (200/1072, 18.7%), nausea/vomiting (162/1072, 15.1%), and pain with activity (147/1072, 13.7%). Improvements in PI-MBS at week 12 correlated with changes in MMDs ( = -0.49; p < 0.0001) and other patient-reported outcomes. Controlling for changes in MMDs, PI-MBS improvement predicted other patient-reported outcomes in expected directions. The magnitude of the standardized mean differences between placebo and active treatment for PI-MBS were 0.31 (p < 0.0001 vs. placebo) and 0.54 (p < 0.0001 vs. placebo) for eptinezumab 100 and 300 mg, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in PI-MBS at week 12 was associated with improvement in other patient-reported outcome measures, and PI-MBS may be an important patient-centered measure of treatment benefits in patients with chronic migraine.","output":"Evaluating the clinical utility of the patient-identified most bothersome symptom measure from PROMISE-2 for research in migraine prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a serious threat to global health.

In people, fecal S100/calgranulin concentrations are affected by age, obesity, diet and other lifestyle factors. Knowledge about the effects of such factors on fecal S100/calgranulin concentrations in dogs is currently scarce. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between several factors and fecal S100/calgranulin concentrations in a large cohort of healthy adult dogs. METHODS: Single\\\\spot fecal samples from 181 healthy pet dogs and data derived from a standard questionnaire served to evaluate the effect of age, sex, reproductive status, body weight and body condition, breed type and size, vaccination, endoparasite treatment, diet, environment and travel history on fecal S100/calgranulin concentrations and the fecal calgranulin ratio (fCalR). RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed a significant association of reproductive status (in female dogs) and breed size with fecal S100A12, fecal calprotectin and fCalR. Breed type was linked to fecal S100A12 concentrations and fCalR; recent vaccination (particularly with a vaccine against canine parvovirus) to fCalR. In multivariate models, breed size was linked to fecal S100A12 and calprotectin concentrations, and recent vaccination affected S100A12 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Breed size, recent vaccination and reproductive status in female dogs can affect fecal S100/calgranulin concentrations, and these biomarkers should be interpreted in light of those confounding factors. The utility of reference intervals for fecal canine S100/calgranulin concentrations might be improved through stratification by sex/reproductive status and breed size.

Considerable effort has been invested in convincing people to put on a mask, if not for their own sake than for those more vulnerable. Social and cognitive psychologists know that use and liking go both ways: people use what they like, and they like what they use. Here we asked whether positive attitudes towards facial masks were higher in those who had been wearing them longer. We asked participants in a diverse sample (N = 498 from five countries and more than 30 US states) to rate how attractive and emotionally arousing masks and other objects associated with COVID-19 were in comparison to neutral objects, as well as reporting on their mask-wearing habits. To confirm reliability of findings, the experiment was repeated in a subset of participants 8C10 weeks later. The findings show that regular use of protective masks was linked to their positive appraisal, with a higher frequency and a longer history of wearing a mask predicting increased mask attractiveness. These results extended to other COVID-related objects relative to controls. They also provide critical ecological validity for the idea that emotional appraisal of everyday objects is associated with our experience of using them. Practically, they imply that societal measures to encourage mask wearing may have contributed to positive emotional appraisals in those who put them on, whether due to personal choice or societal pressure.","output":"In the hands of the beholder: Wearing a COVID-19 mask is associated with its attractiveness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Femoral arterial cannulation to initiate veno-arterial ECMO may result in ipsilateral limb ischemia due to reduced distal blood flow below the insertion point of the cannula.

RESULTS: The study included 65 adult patients supported with femoral VA-ECMO for refractory cardiogenic shock. The studied patients had a mean age of 37.9  14.87 years, mostly males (70.8%), a mean BSA of 1.77  0.27 m(2), and a mean BMI of 26.1  6.7 kg/m(2). Twenty-one (32.3%) patients developed acute lower limb ischemia. The patients who developed acute limb ischemia had significantly frequent AKI (< 0.001) without significant use of haemodialysis (p = 0.07) and longer ICU stay (p = 0.028) compared to the patients without limb ischemia. The hospital mortality occurred in 29 (44.6%) patients without significant difference between the patients with and without acute limb ischemia. The occurrence of acute limb ischemia was significantly correlated with failed percutaneous cannulation (p = 0.039), while there was no significant statistical correlation between the cut-down technique and occurrence of limb ischemia (p = 0.053). The occurrence of femoral cannulation site bleeding was significantly correlated with failed percutaneous cannulation (p = 0.001) and cut-down technique (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Acute vascular complications are frequent after femoral VA-ECMO. Failed percutaneous femoral cannulation has been, in this study, identified as the most important risk factor for acute limb ischemia and cannulation site bleeding. A careful approach during femoral cannulation is recommended to prevent occurrence of acute limb ischemia and femoral cannulation site bleeding.","output":"Acute vascular complications of femoral veno-arterial ECMO: a single-centre retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dysregulation of kinase signaling is associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer, inflammation, and autoimmunity; consequently, the kinases involved have become major therapeutic targets. While kinase signaling pathways play crucial roles in multiple cellular processes, the precise manner in which their dysregulation contributes to disease is dependent on the context; for example, the cell/tissue type or subcellular localization of the kinase or substrate. Thus, context-selective targeting of dysregulated kinases may serve to increase the therapeutic specificity while reducing off-target adverse effects. Primary cilia are antenna-like structures that extend from the plasma membrane and function by detecting extracellular cues and transducing signals into the cell. Cilia formation and signaling are dynamically regulated through context-dependent mechanisms; as such, dysregulation of primary cilia contributes to disease in a variety of ways.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection caused more than half of the deaths due to cirrhosis in the region, followed by alcohol consumption (208%), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; 121%), and chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV; 157%). In 2015, HBV accounted for about half the cases of hepatocellular carcinoma in the region. Preventive strategies for viral hepatitis-related liver disease include increasing access to clean drinking water and sanitation. HBV vaccination programmes for neonates have been implemented by all countries, although birth-dose coverage is extremely suboptimal in some. Availability of screening tests for blood and tissue, donor recall policies, and harm reduction strategies are in their initial stages in most countries. Many governments have put HBV and HCV drugs on their essential medicines lists and the availability of generic versions of these drugs has reduced costs.

Among the many concerning processes being reinforced by the current crises is growth in demand for rental housing (e.g., as families face new prospects of foreclosure or unaffordability due to un- or under-employment brought on by the pandemic, many will likely transition to renting). While rising rentership is not a problem in and of itself, there is broad consensus that economic and social conditions for most renter households are worsening. Coupled with stagnant growth in living wage jobs and the long-term, uncertain nature of economic recovery from COVID-19, one consequence of these dynamics is that renters are paying more with less. A growing class of renters is facing a shrinking degree of housing security. Situated in a public health and economic crisis that is deepening and expanding existing racial, social, and economic inequities, there is an urgent need to advance housing security for vulnerable households, particularly renters for whom precarious, burdensome, and/or exploitative tenancy conditions contribute to further marginalization, further limiting their access to opportunity, security, and autonomy.

Some 650/663 (98%) women had a complete abortion, 5 (0.8%) an ongoing pregnancy and 4 (0.6%) an incomplete abortion. No one was treated inadvertently beyond 12 weeks' gestation, but one woman was never pregnant. One woman who had a pre-abortion ultrasound was later managed as a caesarean scar ectopic. There were two cases of haemorrhage and no severe infections. Some 123 (18.5%) women sought advice by telephone for a concern related to the abortion and 56 (8.4%) then attended a clinic for review. Most (628, 95%) women rated their care as very or somewhat acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: This model of telemedicine abortion without routine ultrasound is safe, and has high efficacy and high acceptability among women.","output":"Telemedicine medical abortion at home under 12 weeks' gestation: a prospective observational cohort study during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To describe endogenous endophthalmitis in the setting of Covid-19 pneumonia post recovery.

In addition to understanding the modes of transmission, the effectiveness of the mitigation methods also needs to be built into any effective model for making such predictions. We show that such complexities can be circumvented by appealing to scaling principles which lead to the emergence of universality in the transmission dynamics of the disease. The ensuing data collapse renders the transmission dynamics largely independent of geopolitical variations, the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, population demographics, etc. We propose a simple two-parameter model -- the Blue Sky model -- and show that one class of transmission dynamics can be explained by a solution that lives at the edge of a blue sky bifurcation. In addition, the data collapse leads to an enhanced degree of predictability in the disease spread for several geographical scales which can also be realized in a model-independent manner as we show using a deep neural network. The methodology adopted in this work can potentially be applied to the transmission of other infectious diseases and new universality classes may be found.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether ocular surface cells possess the key factors required for cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 entry/infection. METHODS: We analyzed human post-mortem eyes as well as surgical specimens for the expression of ACE2 (the receptor for SARS-CoV-2) and TMPRSS2, a cell surface-associated protease that facilitates viral entry following binding of the viral spike protein to ACE2. RESULTS: Across all eye specimens, immunohistochemical analysis revealed expression of ACE2 in the conjunctiva, limbus, and cornea, with especially prominent staining in the superficial conjunctival and corneal epithelial surface. Surgical conjunctival specimens also showed expression of ACE2 in the conjunctival epithelium, especially prominent in the superficial epithelium, as well as the substantia propria. All eye and conjunctival specimens also expressed TMPRSS2. Finally, Western blot analysis of protein lysates from human corneal epithelium obtained during refractive surgery confirmed expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results suggest that ocular surface cells including conjunctiva are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2, and could therefore serve as a portal of entry as well as a reservoir for person-to-person transmission of this virus.

We conducted Bayesian Poisson regression to determine the association of navigation performance with domain-specific cognitive functions. We determined associations of gait and accelerometric features with disorientation events in real-time data using Bayesian generalized mixed effect models. The accuracy of gait and accelerometric features to predict disorientation events was determined using cross-validated support vector machines (SVM) and Hidden Markov models (HMM). Results Bayesian analysis revealed strong evidence for the effect of gait and accelerometric features on disorientation. The evidence supported a relationship between executive functions but not visuospatial abilities and perspective taking with navigation performance. Despite these effects, the cross-validated percentage of correctly assigned instances of disorientation was only 72% in the SVM and 63% in the HMM analysis using gait and accelerometric features as predictors. Conclusion Disorientation is reflected in spatiotemporal gait features and the accelerometric signal as a potentially more easily accessible surrogate for gait features.

More parents with busy jobs choose m-health without time limitation. During the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, m-Health can assist with health promotion, directions for medication usage and disease diagnosis via online chat and video consultation without contacting others. To our knowledge, no studies have been performed to explore the role of m-health in parents' attitudes towards child health at home during COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to identify the associated factors of willingness to adopt m-Health among Chinese parents during the COVID-19 outbreak, and to explore the correlation between the frequency of adopting m-Health and parents' attitudes towards child health at home. METHODS: Chinese parents were asked to complete an online survey from 25th January to 15th February, 2020. The questionnaire comprised of two parts with a total of sixteen items, including parents' demographic variables and attitudes towards child health at home. By multivariate logistic regression we explored factors associated with parents' willingness to adopt m-Health during the COVID-19 outbreak. Pearson chi-square test was used to reveal the correlation between the frequency of adopting m-Health and parents' attitudes towards child health at home. RESULTS: A total of 254 parents enrolled, from which 202 out 254 (79.5%) were willing to adopt m-Health during the COVID-19 outbreak. Parents' age ((adjusted OR (AOR): 8.114(95% CI: 1.471 to 44.764)), parents' interest in the COVID-19 pandemic (AOR: 8.753(95% CI: 2.009 to 38.127); AOR: 22.194(95% CI: 5.509 to 89.411)), the source to recommend m-Health (AOR: 4.257(95% CI: 1.439 to 12.596)), presence of chronic disease in children (AOR: 20.844(95% CI: 4.600 to 94.443)), parents' duration of daily internet use (AOR: 6.487(95% CI: 1.870 to 22.495); AOR: 8.766(95% CI: 1.883 to 40.804)), and adoption of m-Health before the COVID-19 outbreak (AOR: 3.413(95% CI: 1.234 to 9.444)) were significantly correlated with parents' willingness to adopt m-Health during the COVID-19 outbreak. The frequency of m-health usage among parents was correlated with their behaviors in regards to hand-washing (2=18.967, P=.004), mask-wearing (2=45.364, P< .001), frequency of leaving the home (2=16.767, P=.01), room disinfection and ventilation (2=19.515, P=.003), temperature checking (2=17.47, P=.007), and mental health-care of children (2=63.810, P< .001) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The juxtamembrane domain (JMD) of S is an aromatic amino acid-rich region proximal to the transmembrane domain that is highly conserved in all coronaviruses. Alanine substitutions for one or two of the six aromatic residues in the JMD did not alter the surface expression of the SARS-CoV S proteins with a deletion of the C-terminal 19 amino acids (S Delta19) or reduce binding to soluble human ACE2 (hACE2). However, hACE2-dependent entry of trypsin-treated retrovirus pseudotyped viruses expressing JMD mutant S Delta19 proteins was greatly reduced. Single alanine substitutions for aromatic residues reduced entry to 10 to 60% of the wild-type level. The greatest reduction was caused by residues nearest the transmembrane domain. Four double alanine substitutions reduced entry to 5 to 10% of the wild-type level. Rapid hACE2-dependent S-mediated cell-cell fusion was reduced to 60 to 70% of the wild-type level for all single alanine substitutions and the Y1188A/Y1191A protein.

One is the major virion surface envelope protein (E), which is recognized by antibody, whereas the other is a secreted, heavily glycosylated non-structural protein (NS1). Inoculation with either protein can give rise to a protective immune response, as can the passive transfer of E and NS1 monospecific monoclonal antibodies. Experiments reported here demonstrate that the secreted form of NS1, whether from cells infected with tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) or from cells infected with a defective recombinant adenovirus containing the NS1 gene, occurs chiefly as a pentamer or hexamer and occasionally as a decamer or dodecamer. Intracellular forms of this protein however occur only as dimers. The higher M(r) forms secreted from the cell are exquisitely sensitive to detergent, suggesting they are held together by hydrophobic bonds. Both intracellular and extracellular forms of the dimer can be dissociated by heat, but at different temperatures. Unlike similar proteins from mosquito-borne viruses. NS1 from TBEV-infected cells cannot be dissociated at ambient temperatures by extremes of pH. Studies on the antigenic structure of this protein show it to have several highly conserved epitopes, confirming similar earlier conclusions from amino acid sequence analyses.","output":"The NS1 protein of tick-borne encephalitis virus forms multimeric species upon secretion from the host cell."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Laparoscopic subtotal cholecystectomy, a bailout surgery for cholecystitis, can result in postoperative bile leakage, so surgical ingenuity is required.

Percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage was performed to alleviate cholecystitis because the patient was taking antiplatelet medicine. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was then performed within 72 hours from the onset. The gallbladder was operatively found to be strongly fibrotic, so the procedure was switched to laparoscopic subtotal cystectomy, dissecting the gallbladder at the infundibulum-cystic duct level. The gallbladder stump was closed with barbed suture and omentopexy was added due to fragility. There was no significant postoperative bile leakage.

This phenomenon is common to all organisms and the real weight of the many factors involved in its shaping still remains to be fully determined. So far, relatively little attention has been put in the analysis of CUB in bivalve mollusks due to the limited genomic data available. Taking advantage of the massive sequence data generated from next generation sequencing projects, we explored codon preferences in 64 different species pertaining to the six major evolutionary lineages in Bivalvia. We detected remarkable differences across species, which are only partially dependent on phylogeny. While the intensity of CUB is mild in most organisms, a heterogeneous group of species (including Arcida and Mytilida, among the others) display higher bias and a strong preference for AT-ending codons. We show that the relative strength and direction of mutational bias, selection for translational efficiency and for translational accuracy contribute to the establishment of synonymous codon usage in bivalves. Although many aspects underlying bivalve CUB still remain obscure, we provide for the first time an overview of this phenomenon in this large, commercially and environmentally important, class of marine invertebrates.","output":"Analysis of synonymous codon usage patterns in sixty-four different bivalve species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the experiences of special care dentistry providers worldwide.

The relationships between these variables and the changes in clinical activity, the treated patients' COVID-19 status and the implementation of protective measures in the dental clinic were analyzed. A total of 436 (70.6% women) dentists from 59 countries responded to the survey. Clinical activity was reduced or stopped for 79.1% of respondents. The most common change was to limit treatment to urgent care only (53.7%). Treatment under general anesthesia or deep sedation was discontinued (51.0%) or reduced (35.8%) for the majority of respondents. Male dentists were more likely to maintain their clinical activity than female dentists (p < 0.001), and respondents from North America were more likely to do so than participants from other geographical regions (p < 0.001).

Methods: We conducted a retrospective audit of all stroke and TIA presentations in 2020 and compared these with data from 2019. We collected information about stroke subtype, severity, time from stroke/TIA onset to presentation and acute reperfusion therapies. Results: Between January-February and April-March 2020, there was a 15% drop in acute stroke presentations (128 vs. 109). In the same period \\"stroke mimic\\" presentations dropped by 22%. The proportion of patients attending the emergency department within 4.5hrs was only 36% compared with 48% over the similar period in 2019. Conclusions: Although the raw numbers of ischemic stroke presentations remained stable during NSW Covid lockdown, the proportion of patients presenting within time window for acute reperfusion therapies fell. The number of TIAs similarly fell suggesting COVID-19 discouraged patients from presenting to hospital which placed them at higher risk of disabling stroke.

The assessment of the variables that influence early childhood caries as well as its pathophysiology leads to improved control of this disease. Cystatin S, as one of the salivary proteins, has an essential role in pellicle formation, tooth re-mineralization, and protection. The present study aims to assess salivary cystatin S levels and demographic data in early childhood caries in comparison with caries-free ones using statistical analysis and machine learning methods. METHODS: A cross-sectional, caseCcontrol study was undertaken on 20 cases of early childhood caries and 20 caries-free children as a control. Unstimulated whole saliva samples were collected by suction. Cystatin S concentrations in samples were determined using human cystatin S ELISA kit. The checklist was collected from participants about demographic characteristics, oral health status, and dietary habits by interviewing parents. Regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were done to evaluate the potential role of cystatin S salivary level and demographic using statistical analysis and machine learning. RESULTS: The mean value of salivary cystatin S concentration in the early childhood caries group was 191.55  81.90 (ng/ml) and in the caries-free group was 370.06  128.87 (ng/ml). T-test analysis showed a statistically significant difference between early childhood caries and caries-free groups in salivary cystatin S levels (p = 0.032). Investigation of the area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy of the ROC curve revealed that the logistic regression model based on salivary cystatin S levels and birth weight had the most and acceptable potential for discriminating of early childhood caries from caries-free controls. Furthermore, using salivary cystatin S levels enhanced the capability of machine learning methods to differentiate early childhood caries from caries-free controls. CONCLUSION: Salivary cystatin S levels in caries-free children were higher than the children with early childhood caries. Results of the present study suggest that considering clinical examination, demographic and socioeconomic factors, along with the salivary cystatin S levels, could be usefull for early diagnosis ofearly childhood caries in high-risk children; furthermore, cystatin S is a protective factor against dental caries.

Long COVID can also manifest as prolonged fatigue, which may be linked to neuromuscular function impairment (NMFI). The current clinical assessment for NCVI monitors neurocardiovascular performance upon the application of orthostatic stressors such as an active (i.e. self-induced) stand or a passive (tilt table) standing test. Lower limb muscle contractions may be important in orthostatic recovery via the skeletal muscle pump. In this study, adults with long COVID were assessed with a protocol that, in addition to the standard NCVI tests, incorporated simultaneous lower limb muscle monitoring for NMFI assessment. To accomplish such an investigation, a wide range of continuous non-invasive biomedical technologies were employed, including digital artery photoplethysmography for the extraction of cardiovascular signals, near-infrared spectroscopy for the extraction of regional tissue oxygenation in brain and muscle, and electromyography for assessment of timed muscle contractions in the lower limbs. With the novel technique described and exemplified in this paper, we were able to integrate signals from all instruments used in the assessment in a precisely synchronized fashion. We demonstrate that it is possible to visualize the interactions between all different physiological signals during the combined NCVI/NMFI assessment. Multiple counts of evidence were collected, which can capture the dynamics between skeletal muscle contractions and neurocardiovascular responses. The proposed multimodal data visualization can offer an overview of the functioning of the muscle pump during both supine rest and orthostatic recovery and can conduct comparison studies with signals from multiple participants at any given time in the assessment. This could help researchers and clinicians generate and test hypotheses based on the multimodal inspection of raw data, in long COVID and other clinical cohorts.","output":"A novel methodology for the synchronous collection and multimodal visualisation of continuous neurocardiovascular and neuromuscular physiological data in adults with long COVID"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To estimate the frequency of perception of discrimination and its association with occupational stress, anxiety and fear of COVID-19 in Colombian general practitioners","output":"Perception of discrimination in a group of Colombian general practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic and its relation to labor and psychological factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recommendation provides information to employees of medical departments at any level and primarily primary care about the possible proarrhythmic and adverse effects of drugs used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients and the features of therapy for COVID-19 patients with heart rhythm and conduction disorders receiving permanent antiarrhythmic therapy","output":"[Recommendations for the management of COVID 19 patients regarding proarrhythmic effects of some current treatments, specifically if these patients suffer from arrhythmias, and for those receiving antiarrhythmic therapy.]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with severe COVID-19 have a hyperinflammatory immune response suggestive of macrophage activation.

Family physicians are gatekeepers to specialized care in Ontario, so it is essential to understand predictors relating to referrals to telepsychiatry to better plan services and increase telepsychiatry adoption. METHODS: This study used an annual retrospective cross-sectional study design to compare physicians who referred their patients to telepsychiatry each year from fiscal year (FY) 2008 to FY 2016. A 1-year (FY 2016) comparison of family physicians who referred to telepsychiatry (FPTs) compared to family physicians who did not refer to telepsychiatry (FPNTs) matched (1:2) by region was also conducted. Finally, we used statistical modeling to understand the predictors of referring to telepsychiatry among physicians. RESULTS: Between FY 2008 and FY 2016, the number of patients receiving telepsychiatry increased from 925 visits to 13,825 visits. Thirty-two percent of Ontario primary care physicians referred to telepsychiatry in 2016. Several characteristics were notably different between FPTs and FPNTs: FPTs were more likely to be from a residence with less than 10,000 people, to have more nurse practitioners in the practice, and to be from a family health team than FPNTs. Rostered patients of FPTs were more likely to reside in rural areas, have more clinical complexity, and to utilize more mental health services compared to FPNTs. CONCLUSIONS: There has been an increase in the use of telepsychiatry by patients and family physicians over the study period, although there remains opportunity for significant growth.

Respondents knowledge revealed that: 1509 (65.40%) had poor knowledge ( 50% score), and 798 (34.6%) had good knowledge (> 50% score) (P < 0.001) about COVID-19. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that higher-earning positively correlated, while private jobs were negatively associated, with good knowledge. CONCLUSION: FB and WA were the 2 common social media used by study participants (a third had good knowledge). COVID-19 affected the social, mental, and psychological well-being of individuals.

However, this assumption remains untested. Surface electromyographic signals were collected using two 32-channel electrode matrices placed on soleus and tibialis anterior of 25 older adults (70  4 years) and 17 young adults (29  5 years) to investigate motor unit discharge behaviors. Participants performed triangular-shaped plantar and dorsiflexion contractions to 20% of maximum torque at a rise-decline rate of 2%/s of each participants maximal torque. Pairwise and composite paired-motor unit analyses were adopted to calculate delta frequency (F), which has been used to differentiate between the effects of synaptic excitation and intrinsic motoneuronal properties and is assumed to be proportional to PIC amplitude. Soleus and tibialis anterior motor units in older adults had lower Fs calculated with either the pairwise [-0.99 and -1.46 pps; -35.4 and -33.5%, respectively] or composite (-1.18 and -2.28 pps; -32.1 and -45.2%, respectively) methods.

These results demonstrate reduced intrinsic motoneuron excitability during low-force contractions in older adults, likely mediated by decreases in the amplitude of persistent inward currents. Our findings might be explained by deterioration in the motoneuron or monoaminergic systems and could contribute to the decline in motor function during aging; these assumptions should be explicitly tested in future investigations.

Cannabidiol (CBD) is a phytocannabinoid isolated from the cannabis plant which was reported to have antidepressant-like and anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of the present study is to examine the effects of CBD on IRS, CIRS, M1, T helper (Th)-1, Th-2, Th-17, T regulatory (Treg) profiles, and growth factors in depression and healthy controls. Methods Culture supernatant of stimulated (5 microg/mL of PHA and 25 micro956;g/mL of LPS) whole blood of 30 depressed patients and 20 controls was assayed for cytokines using the LUMINEX assay. The effects of three CBD concentrations (0.1 microg/ml, 1 microg/mL, and 10 microg/mL) were examined. Results Depression was characterized by significantly increased Th-1, Th-2, Th-17, Treg, IRS, CIRS and neurotoxicity profiles. CBD 0.1 microg/mL did not have any immune effects. CBD 1.0 microg/mL decreased CIRS activities but increased growth factor production, while CBD 10.0 microg/mL suppressed Th-1, Th-17, IRS, CIRS, and a neurotoxicity profile and enhanced T cell growth and growth factor production.

Because Omicron was recognized very recently, many knowledge gaps exist about its epidemiology and clinical severity and disease course. A comprehensive genome sequencing study of SARS-CoV-2 in the Houston Methodist healthcare system identified 862 symptomatic patients with infections caused by Omicron from late November 2021 through December 18, 2021. Omicron very rapidly increased in only three weeks to cause 90% of all new COVID-19 cases. Compared to patients infected with either Alpha or Delta variants in our healthcare system, Omicron patients were significantly younger, had significantly increased vaccine breakthrough rates, and were significantly less likely to be hospitalized. Omicron patients required less intense respiratory support and had a shorter length of hospital stay, consistent with decreased disease severity.

Diet has a marked influence on gastrointestinal tract function and the manipulation of dietary composition provides clinicians with a powerful therapeutic tool. During acute gastroenteritis, a short period of fasting is recommended. Feeding through diarrhoea (without a period of fasting) is recommended in human infants but has limited applicability in dogs and cats, primarily because different types of diarrhoea are commonly treated by veterinary surgeons compared to physicians. Following the fast, a change from the animal's regular food to a diet containing novel protein sources is advisable. This minimises the likelihood of acquired food allergies to staple proteins. Allergy avoidance may require special techniques such as rotation diets or protein hydrolysates. Dietary fat is usually kept to a minimum during gastrointestinal dysfunction as malabsorbed fatty acids and bile acids promote secretory diarrhoea in the large bowel. Recommendations to feed high fat rather than high carbohydrate diets to cats with diarrhoea need to be objectively examined. The type of fat fed may also prove to be an important consideration.

Using a simple model for the spreading disease and parsimonious assumptions on the relationship between the infection and the associated economic backlashes, we show how different policy schemes tend to induce heterogeneous distributions of losses at the regional level depending on mobility restrictions.

Indeed, most studies thus far have focused on the risk of increase and aggravation of other psychiatric disorders as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Yet, risk of onset or aggravation of panic disorder, especially the subtype with prominent respiratory symptoms, which is characterized by a fear response conditioning to interoceptive sensations (e.g., respiratory), and hypervigilance to these interoceptive signals, could be expected in the current situation. Indeed, respiratory symptoms, such as coughs and dyspnea, are among the most commonly associated with the SARS-CoV-2 (59-82% and 31-55%, respectively), and respiratory symptoms are associated with a poor illness prognosis. Hence given that some etiological and maintenance factors associated with panic disorder - i.e., fear conditioning to abnormal breathing patterns attributable or not to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), as well as hypervigilance towards breathing abnormalities - are supposedly more prevalent, one could expect an increased risk of panic disorder onset or aggravation following the COVID-19 epidemic in people who were affected by the virus, but also those who were not. In people with the comorbidity (i.e., panic disorder or panic attacks and the COVID-19), it is particularly important to be aware of the risk of hypokalemia in specific at-risk situations or prescriptions. For instance, in the case of salbutamol prescription, which might be overly used in patients with anxiety disorders and COVID-19, or in patients presenting with diarrhea and vomiting. Hypokalemia is associated with an increased risk of torsade de pointe, thus caution is required when prescribing specific psychotropic drugs, such as the antidepressants citalopram and escitalopram, which are first-line treatments for panic disorder, but also hydroxyzine, aiming at anxiety reduction.

We hypothesized that adding telenursing to usual care could fill a gap in currently available services, including offering patients easy accessibility to a nurse with specific expertise in PD. We explored this hypothesis by prospectively assessing the effects of a telenursing intervention on motor and non-motor symptoms in a patient with PD. During a threemonth intervention period which comprised 13 telephone contacts, the patient reported a remarkable reduction in number of falls, from 99 falls per three months to 3 falls per three months; and a reduction in non-motor symptoms.

Although many commercially available antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 are recommended by the WHO, their diagnostic performance has not yet been assessed in Ethiopia. So far, the vast majority of studies assessing diagnostic accuracies of rapid antigen tests considered RT-PCR as a gold standard, which inevitably leads to bias when RT-PCR is not 100% sensitive and specific. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Panbio COVID-19 rapid antigen test jointly together with the RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. MethodsA prospective cross-sectional study was done from July to September 2021 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, during the third wave of the pandemic involving two health centers and two hospitals. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of Panbio rapid antigen test and RT-PCR were obtained using Bayesian Latent-Class Models (BLCM). Results438 COVID-19 presumptive clients were enrolled, 239 (54.6%) were females, of whom 196 (44.7%) had a positive RT-PCR and 158 (36.1%) were Ag-RDT positive. The Ag-RDT and RT-PCR had a sensitivity (95% CrI) of 99.6 (98.4-100), 89.3 (83.2-97.6) and specificity (95% CrI) of 93.4 (82.3 - 100), 99.1 (97.5-100) respectively.

Through our recent work tracking the well-being of frontline workers in the UK and Ireland (the CV19 Heroes project), we have uncovered additional psychological factors that have not been accounted for in previous models of occupational stress or burnout. In recent months, frontline workers have worked to protect the community from the threat of SARS-CoV-2 and, simultaneously, have evaluated their perceptions of collective efforts of others as either congruent or incongruent with collective goals (e.g., lowered mortality and morbidity): we call this novel aspect solidarity appraisal. These frontline workers have been hailed as heroes, which we argue has led to the creation of an implicit psychological contract (the hero contract) between frontline workers and the public. Here, the heroes are willing to \\"go above and beyond\\" for the greater good, with the expectation that we (the public) do our part by adhering to public health guidelines. Where frontline workers perceive incongruence between the words and actions of others in working toward collective goals this drives negative affect and subsequent burnout. In this perspective article, we evaluate the cultural context of the pandemic in the UK and Ireland and suggest important socio-cultural factors that contribute to perceptions of solidarity, and how this may relate to burnout and worker welfare during and beyond the pandemic context.","output":"\\"It's Like a Kick in the Teeth\\": The Emergence of Novel Predictors of Burnout in Frontline Workers During Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with specific hematological malignancies (HM) are at increased risk for severe disease and death from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In healthy subjects, vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated to be highly effective in disease prevention; however, immunocompromised patients were largely excluded from vaccine randomized controlled trials. In this review, we overview available non-randomized studies addressing effectiveness and safety of several coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in patients with HM. Overall, COVID-19 vaccines are safe in patients with HM, with adverse events similar to those in the general population. Though serology testing is not recommended as a test to evaluate vaccine effectiveness, a correlation between higher antibody levels and protection against infection has been reported. Studies evaluating humoral response to COVID-19 vaccine in HM patients demonstrate low immunogenicity, mainly in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders, as well as with certain drugs, including mainly anti-CD20 antibodies, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and also ruxolitinib and venetoclax. Seropositivity rates of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia following mRNA vaccination reach 40%C50%. T-cell responses to vaccination are also impaired among these patients. Better humoral response rates are reported in multiple myeloma patients and hematopoietic stem-cell transplant, reaching 75%C80%, but not in patients following chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and myeloproliferative diseases have high response rate to vaccination. Third mRNA vaccine dose is currently recommended to all HM patients.

Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology is the specialty that can most benefit from the advantages of these tools. The purpose of this study is to present the results of the integration of 3D printing technology in a Department of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology and to identify the productive model of the point-of-care manufacturing as a paradigm of personalized medicine. METHODS: Observational, descriptive, retrospective and monocentric study of a total of 623 additive manufacturing processes carried out in a Department of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology from November 2015 to March 2020. Variables such as product type, utility, time or materials for manufacture were analyzed. RESULTS: The areas of expertise that have performed more processes are Traumatology, Reconstructive and Orthopedic Oncology. Pre-operative planning is their primary use. Working and 3D printing hours, as well as the amount of 3D printing material used, vary according to the type of product or material delivered to perform the process. The most commonly used 3D printing material for manufacturing is polylactic acid, although biocompatible resin has been used to produce surgical guides. In addition, the hospital has worked on the co-design of customized implants with manufacturing companies.

Loneliness may further catalyze numerous poor health outcomes including impaired sleep. This study aimed to assess COVID-19 related worries and resilience as potential moderators of the loneliness-sleep problems link. METHOD: In the midst of the lock-down period of COVID-19, we collected data using a web-based public platform from 243 Israeli older adults (mean age = 69.76, SD = 6.69, age range = 60C92). Participants completed measures of COVID-19 related loneliness, sleep problems, COVID-related worries, and resilience. RESULTS: COVID-19 related loneliness was related to more sleep problems. The loneliness-sleep association was especially strong among those with more COVID-19 related worries or among those with lower resilience. CONCLUSION: The relationship between COVID-19 related loneliness and sleep problems is not uniform across older adults. The subjective sleep quality of those with more COVID-19 related worries or less resilience (i.e., feeling less being able to adapt to the challenging circumstances) is more susceptible to feeling lonely. Considering these variables may facilitate detection of and intervention for older adults vulnerable to aversive results in the context of COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 related loneliness and sleep problems in older adults: Worries and resilience as potential moderators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to clarify the status of hand hygiene practices among ordinary citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, in conjunction with the total frequency of daily hand hygiene as an indicator of education and evaluation.

Among chronic diseases, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrigs disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of adulthood, caused by the loss of spinal, bulbar and cortical motor neurons, which leads to paralysis of the voluntary muscles and, also, involves respiratory ones. Therefore, remote monitoring and teleconsulting are essential services for ALS patients with limited mobility, as the disease progresses, and for those living far from ALS centres and hospitals. In addition, the COVID 19 pandemic has increased the need to remotely provide the best care to patients, avoiding infection during ALS centre visits. The paper illustrates an innovative, secure medical monitoring and teleconsultation mobile cloud-based system for disabled people, such as those with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis).

The current research aims to address whether these individual differences not only affect peoples reactions to the pandemic, but also their actual likelihood of contracting COVID-19. In the early months of the pandemic, U.S. participants responded to a variety of individual difference measures as well as questions specific to the pandemic itself. Four months later, 2120 of these participants responded with whether they had contracted COVID-19. Nearly all of our included individual difference measures significantly predicted whether a person reported testing positive for the virus in this four-month period. Additional analyses revealed that all of these relationships were primarily mediated by whether participants held accurate knowledge about COVID-19. These findings offer useful insights for developing more effective interventions aimed at slowing the spread of both COVID-19 and future diseases.

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted many aspects of sexual lifestyles, triggering an urgent need for population-level data on sexual behaviour, relationships, and service use at a time when gold-standard in-person, household-based surveys with probability sampling were not feasible. We designed the Natsal-COVID study to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the nations SRH and assessed the sample representativeness. Methods: Natsal-COVID Wave 1 data collection was conducted four months (29/7-10/8/2020) after the announcement of Britains first national lockdown (23/03/2020). This was an online web-panel survey administered by survey research company, Ipsos MORI. Eligible participants were resident in Britain, aged 18-59 years, and the sample included a boost of those aged 18-29. Questions covered participants sexual behaviour, relationships, and SRH service use. Quotas and weighting were used to achieve a quasi-representative sample of the British general population. Participants meeting criteria of interest and agreeing to recontact were selected for qualitative follow-up interviews. Comparisons were made with contemporaneous national probability surveys and Natsal-3 (2010-12) to understand bias. Results: 6,654 participants completed the survey and 45 completed follow-up interviews. The weighted Natsal-COVID sample was similar to the general population in terms of gender, age, ethnicity, rurality, and, among sexually-active participants, numbers of sexual partners in the past year. However, the sample was more educated, contained more sexually-inexperienced people, and included more people in poorer health. Conclusions: Natsal-COVID Wave 1 rapidly collected quasi-representative population data to enable evaluation of the early population-level impact of COVID-19 and lockdown measures on SRH in Britain. Although sampling was less representative than the decennial Natsals, Natsal-COVID will complement national surveillance data and Natsal-4 (planned for 2022).","output":"Methodology of Natsal-COVID Wave 1: a large, quasi-representative survey with qualitative follow-up measuring the impact of COVID-19 on sexual and reproductive health in Britain [version 2;peer review: 2 approved]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is challenging in symptomatic COVID-19 patients since shortness of breath, chest pain, tachycardia, tachypnoea, fever, oxygen desaturation and high D-dimer blood levels might be features of both diseases.

Furthermore, the aim of the study was to explore the mediating role of job crafting, considered as a second-order construct consisting of two dimensions (increasing structural resources and increasing challenging demands) in the abovementioned relation. Participants were 530 workers experiencing remote working or work-from-home during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Italy (MarchCMay 2020). Hypotheses were explored by using three different latent variables, measured reflexively through indicators on a 5-point scale, extracted from validated questionnaires. Data analysis was performed through Structural Equation Modeling; to test the mediation, bootstrap validation was computed (n = 2,000). Results showed that the mediation of job crafting was partial. More specifically, the direct effect between work overload and behavioral stress was positive; moreover, the indirect, negative effect through the mediation of job crafting was also significant. Therefore, results showed that job crafting can play a crucial role as a protective factor supporting the activation and adjustment of suitable resources; these resources can be useful to deal with the negative effects of work overload, particularly under the condition of heavy remote working and use of technologies, on individual outcomes. Starting from the current global scenario of the pandemic that has not yet ceased its effects, the study suggested decisive theoretical and practical implications. Accordingly, findings extended the current trends in occupational health psychology research, with special reference to the mainstream topic work and COVID-19 in the Italian context.

SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on two proteins present on the surface of host cells, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The nasal cavity is thought to be one of the initial sites of infection and a possible reservoir for dissemination within and between individuals. However, it is not known how the expression of these genes is regulated in the nasal mucosa. Objective: In this study, we examined whether the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is affected by innate immune signals in the nasal mucosa. We also investigated how fluticasone propionate (FP), a corticosteroid used as an intranasal steroid spray, affects the gene expression. Methods: Primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) were collected from the nasal mucosa and incubated with Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists and/or fluticasone propionate (FP), followed by quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence, and immunoblot analyses. Results: Among the TLR agonists, the TLR3 agonist Poly(I:C) significantly increased ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in HNECs (ACE2 36.21211.600-fold change, p<0.0001; TMPRSS2 5.5982.434-fold change, p=0.031).

A straightforward way to assess this is to tally the active cases and the recovered ones throughout the epidemic. Here, we show how epidemic control can be assessed with molecular information during a well characterized epidemic in Iceland. We demonstrate how the viral concentration decreased in those newly diagnosed as the epidemic transitioned from exponential growth phase to containment phase. The viral concentration in the cases identified in population screening decreased faster than in those symptomatic and considered at high risk and that were targeted by the healthcare system. The viral concentration persists in recovering individuals as we found that half of the cases are still positive after two weeks. We demonstrate that accumulation of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome can be exploited to track the rate of new viral generations throughout the different phases of the epidemic, where the accumulation of mutations decreases as the transmission rate decreases in the containment phase. Overall, the molecular signatures of SARS-CoV-2 infections contain valuable epidemiological information that can be used to assess the effectiveness of containment measures.","output":"Molecular benchmarks of a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Respiratory motion-compensated (MC) 3D cardiac fat-water imaging at 7T. METHODS: Free-breathing bipolar 3D triple-echo gradient-recalled-echo (GRE) data with radial phase-encoding (RPE) trajectory were acquired in 11 healthy volunteers (7M\\\\4F, 21-35 years, mean: 30 years) with a wide range of body mass index (BMI; 19.9-34.0 kg/m2 ) and volunteer tailored B 1 + shimming. The bipolar-corrected triple-echo GRE-RPE data were binned into different respiratory phases (self-navigation) and were used for the estimation of non-rigid motion vector fields (MF) and respiratory resolved (RR) maps of the main magnetic field deviations (B0 ). RR B0 maps and MC B0 maps were compared to a reference respiratory phase to assess respiration-induced changes. Subsequently, cardiac binned fat-water images were obtained using a model-based, respiratory motion-corrected image reconstruction. RESULTS: The 3D cardiac fat-water imaging at 7T was successfully demonstrated. Local respiration-induced frequency shifts in MC B0 maps are small compared to the chemical shifts used in the multi-peak model. Compared to the reference exhale B0 map these changes are in the order of 10 Hz on average. Cardiac binned MC fat-water reconstruction reduced respiration induced blurring in the fat-water images, and flow artifacts are reduced in the end-diastolic fat-water separated images. CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates the feasibility of 3D fat-water imaging at UHF for the entire human heart despite spatial and temporal B 1 + and B0 variations, as well as respiratory and cardiac motion.","output":"Motion-compensated fat-water imaging for 3D cardiac MRI at ultra-high fields"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic pose a threat to psychological well-being in different spheres of life. In accordance with Self-Determination Theory, it is assumed that working conditions during a pandemic frustrate the psychological needs of people in the workplace, thereby increasing their alienation. Objective: To study the influence of working conditions on work alienation among employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. As factors of working conditions, we studied workplace distancing (isolation), temporary flexibility of work, the use of information and communication technologies (ICT), and job insecurity. Design: The study had a correlation design, used a survey, and consisted of two parts. The first part studied a sample of 62 university professors for dynamics of work alienation at three periods of time. The second part studied 104 subjects for the effect of workplace distancing (isolation), temporary flexibility, ICT, and job insecurity on work alienation. Results: In the first part of the study, it was found that work alienation increased during the pandemic. The second part showed that workplace distancing, temporary flexibility of work, ICTs, and job insecurity are significant predictors of work alienation among university professors. Conclusion: Changes in working conditions during a pandemic have negative consequences for employees in the form of alienation from work. This finding can have practical application in recommendations for organizations planning structural changes or transfer of employees to telecommuting.

Viral infection was associated with upregulation of viral defenses regardless of the disease state, but to a greater degree in FIP. FIP was associated with higher pro-inflammatory pathway enrichment, whilst non-FIP FCoV-positive cats showed lower enrichment of humoral immunity pathways, below that of uninfected cats in the case of immunoglobulin production pathways. This host response is presumed to be protective. In FIP, downregulation of T cell-related processes was observed, which did not occur in non-FIP FCoV-positive cats.

Emerging diseases place an additional burden on developing countries which are often struggling to manage the diseases they already have. New diseases spread through weather, insects or other vectors, or by the movement of people, animals or goods. This study examines the role of cross-border travel in the spread of diseases. A survey of travelers and of residents along the Malawi-Mozambique border found that most cross it frequently and that they rarely travel empty-handed, often taking plants and animals with them. People also cross borders seeking medical attention. Attempting to limit travel would hamper an already struggling economy, where many people make a living by producing, processing or transporting plants and animals for food.

Vitamin D modulates the development and activity of the immune system and a low vitamin D status during pregnancy and in early life might be associated with an increased risk to develop an allergy during early childhood. This review studies the effects of vitamin D during gestation and early life, on allergy susceptibility in infants. The bioactive form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D, inhibits maturation and results in immature dendritic cells that cause a decreased differentiation of naive T cells into effector T cells. Nevertheless, the development of regulatory T cells and the production of interleukin-10 was increased. Consequently, a more tolerogenic immune response developed against antigens. Secondly, binding of 1,25(OH)2D to epithelial cells induces the expression of tight junction proteins resulting in enhanced epithelial barrier function. Thirdly, 1,25(OH)2D increased the expression of anti-microbial peptides by epithelial cells that also promoted the defense mechanism against pathogens, by preventing an invasive penetration of pathogens. Immune intervention by vitamin D supplementation can mitigate the disease burden from asthma and allergy. In conclusion, our review indicates that a sufficient vitamin D status during gestation and early life can lower the susceptibility to develop an allergy in infants although there remains a need for more causal evidence.","output":"Vitamin D and Allergy Susceptibility during Gestation and Early Life"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is spreading worldwide. To date, no specific treatment has convincingly demonstrated its efficacy. Hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir have potential interest, but virological and clinical data are scarce, especially in critically ill patients. METHODS: The present report took the opportunity of compassionate use and successive drug shortages to compare the effects of two therapeutic options, lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine, as compared to standard of care only. The primary outcomes were treatment escalation (intubation, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation support, or renal replacement therapy) after day 1 until day 28. Secondary outcomes included ventilator-free days at day 28, mortality at day 14 and day 28, treatment safety issues and changes in respiratory tracts, and plasma viral load (as estimated by cycle threshold value) between admission and day 7. RESULTS: Eighty patients were treated during a 4-week period and included in the analysis: 22 (28%) received standard of care only, 20 (25%) patients received lopinavir/ritonavir associated to standard of care, and 38 (47%) patients received hydroxychloroquine and standard of care. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the 3 groups. Treatment escalation occurred in 9 (41%), 10 (50%), and 15 (39%) patients who received standard of care only, standard of care and lopinavir/ritonavir, and standard of care and hydroxychloroquine, respectively (p = 0.567). There was no significant difference between groups regarding the number of ventilator-free days at day 28 and mortality at day 14 and day 28. Finally, there was no significant change between groups in viral respiratory or plasma load between admission and day 7. CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia, no difference was found between hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir as compared to standard of care only on the proportion of patients who needed treatment escalation at day 28.

The participants were divided into two groups, namely, Group A, consisting of 100 minor, teenage childbearing women under the age of 18, and Group B, consisting of 100 childbearing women over 18 years of age. Results Group A had a mean age of 16.56  1.65. The percentage of births in very young girls (13-15 years) from group A is 28%. In 65 adolescents, sexual intercourse began at the age of 14. Pregnancy monitoring, expressed by the number of medical examinations, shows significant differences between the studied groups. The Short Assessment of Health Literacy (SAHL) test applied to both groups revealed a low level of health literacy in group A.

However, whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can affect multiple organs is still unclear. In this study, postmortem percutaneous biopsies of multiple organs from deceased patients were performed to understand the histopathological changes caused by COVID-19. METHODS: Biopsy specimens of pulmonary, cardiac, hepatic and lymphoid tissues were obtained from three patients, who died due to COVID-19 pneumonia. H&E stain, Masson trichrome stain, immunohistochemistry stain and in-situ hybridisation were used. RESULTS: Pulmonary damages caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). In the early phase, the histological findings were mainly those of exudative features of DAD. The later phase was characterised by organisation of DAD combined with bacterial pneumonia. No serious damage was found in the bronchiolar epithelium and submucosal glands. The hepatic tissue revealed features of ischaemic necrosis, but findings suggestive of mild lobular hepatitis were also observed. The lymphoid tissue revealed features of non-specific acute lymphadenitis. The cardiac tissue revealed changes of underlying disease. SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were not detected in hepatocytes, cholangiocytes and lymphocytes of lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 predominantly involves the pulmonary tissue, causes DAD and aggravates the cardiovascular disease. However, other extrapulmonary tissues did not reveal any virus-specific findings, but were affected by multiple factors.

The C-terminal cleavage site of the 100-kDa protein was defined to be the Q891(1b)-S892(1b)dipeptide bond encoded by nucleotides 15,129 to 15,134 (Liu and Brown, 1995). In this report, other cleavage sites of the 3C-like proteinase in the polyprotein encoded by the ORF 1b region were mapped by coexpression, deletion, and site-directed mutagenesis studies.

Cleavage at these four positions would result in the release of four mature products with molecular masses of approximately 68, 58, 39, and 35 kDa. Among them, the 39- and 35-kDa proteins were specifically identified in IBV-infected cells.

A total of 102 active compounds with corresponding 189 targets were identified from HLJDD, and 41 common targets were further identified by intersecting with RA-related targets. Functional enrichment analysis was performed to screen the biological pathways associated with RA. Ten hub targets were further identified through constructing the proteinCprotein interaction (PPI) network of common targets, which were mainly enriched in the interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling pathway, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Furthermore, a complex botanical drugs-ingredients-hub-targets-disease network was successfully constructed. The molecular docking results exhibited that these vital ingredients of HLJDD had a stable binding to the hub targets.

Here, we present a method that enables large scale SARS-CoV-2 serological studies by combining self or office collection of fingerprick blood with a volumetric absorptive microsampling device (Mitra, Neoteryx, LLC) with a high-throughput electrochemiluminescence-based SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay (Roche Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics, Inc.) that is emergency use authorization (EUA) approved for use on serum samples and widely used by clinical laboratories around the world. We found that the Roche Elecsys assay has a high dynamic range that allows for accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples diluted 1:20 as well as contrived dried blood extracts. Extracts of dried blood from Mitra devices acquired in a community seroprevalence study showed near identical sensitivity and specificity in detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as compared to neat sera using predefined thresholds for each specimen type. Overall, this study affirms the use of Mitra dried blood collection device with the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay for remote or at-home testing as well as large-scale community seroprevalence studies.","output":"Remote fingerstick blood collection for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the average human life expectancy is 78.8 years.

METHODS A prioritization tool was formulated based on clinically relevant elements and previous literature. Nine pediatric orthopaedic surgeons from North American institutions evaluated 25 clinical scenarios on 2 occasions separated in time. Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were calculated [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)]. Surgeons also ranked the importance of each element and how confident they were with scoring each factor. RESULTS Intra-rater ICC for total score showed good to excellent consistency; highest at 0.961 for length of stay (LOS) and lowest at 0.705 for acuity. Inter-rater ICC showed good to excellent agreement for American Society of Anesthesiologists score, LOS, duration of surgery, and transfusion risk and moderate agreement for surgical acuity and personal protective equipment (PPE) use. Transfusion risk and duration of surgery were deemed least important, and surgeons were least confident in scoring PPE and transfusion risk. Based on findings, the novel Elective-Pediatric Orthopedic Surgical Timing (E-POST) score for prioritizing elective cases was developed, consisting of 5 factors: surgical acuity, global health status, LOS, duration of surgery, and PPE requirement.

Intermittent hypoxia (IH) is recognized as a principal mediator of pathophysiology associated with sleep apnea, yet the basis by which IH contributes to impaired cognition remains poorly defined. Using a mouse model exposed to IH, this study examines how the transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor 1a (HIF1a), contributes to disrupted synaptic physiology and spatial memory. In wild-type mice, impaired performance in the Barnes maze caused by IH coincided with a loss of NMDA receptor (NMDAr)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in area CA1 and increased nuclear HIF1a within the hippocampus. IH-dependent HIF1a signaling caused a two-fold increase in expression of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating enzyme NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4). These changes promoted a pro-oxidant state and the downregulation of GluN1 within the hippocampus. The IH-dependent effects were not present in either mice heterozygous for Hif1a (HIF1a(+/?)) or wild-type mice treated with the antioxidant manganese (III) tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin (MnTMPyP). Our findings indicate that HIF1a-dependent changes in redox state are central to the mechanism by which IH disrupts hippocampal synaptic plasticity and impairs spatial memory.

Throughout most of the pandemic, mitigating its spread has relied on human behavior, namely on adherence to protective behaviors (e.g., wearing a face mask). This research proposes that Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) can contribute to understanding differences in individual adherence to COVID-19 behavioral guidelines. PMT identifies four fundamental cognitive components that drive responses to fear appeals: perceptions of susceptibility (to the disease), severity (of the disease), self-efficacy (to protect oneself), and response efficacy (i.e., recommended behaviors' effectiveness). Two online self-report studies assessed PMT components' capacity to predict adherence to protective behaviors concurrently and across culturally different countries (Israel, Germany, India; Study 1), and again at six-week follow-up (Israeli participants; Study 2). Study 1's findings indicate excellent fit of the PMT model, with about half of the variance in adherence explained. No significant differences were found between participants from Israel (n = 917), Germany (n = 222) and India (n = 160). Study 2 (n = 711) confirmed that PMT components continue to predict adherence after six weeks. In both studies, response efficacy was the PMT component most strongly associated with adherence levels. This study demonstrates that PMT can serve as a theoretical framework to better understand differences in adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors.

Furthermore, people may have opted against HIV testing during this period to avoid COVID-19 exposure. We investigated the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV testing and the number of reported HIV cases in Japan. METHODS: We analyzed quarterly HIV/AIDS-related data from 2015 to the second quarter of 2020 using an anomaly detection approach. The data included the number of consultations, the number of HIV tests performed by public health centers or municipalities, and the number of newly reported HIV cases with and without an AIDS diagnosis. We further performed the same analysis for 2 subgroups: men who have sex with men (MSM) and non-Japanese persons. RESULTS: The number of HIV tests (9,584 vs. 35,908 in the year-before period) and consultations (11,689 vs. 32,565) performed by public health centers significantly declined in the second quarter of 2020, whereas the proportion of new HIV cases with an AIDS diagnosis (36.2% vs. 26.4%) significantly increased after removing the trend and seasonality effects. HIV cases without an AIDS diagnosis decreased (166 vs. 217), but the reduction was not significant. We confirmed similar trends for the men who have sex with men and non-Japanese subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the current HIV testing system in Japan seems to have missed more cases of HIV before developing AIDS.

METHODS The RCT is a pragmatic, two-arm, individually randomised, parallel group RCT designed to test clinical and cost-effectiveness of REACH Pregnancy Circles compared with standard care. Recruitment will be through NHS services. The sample size is 1732 (866 randomised to the intervention and 866 to standard care). The primary outcome measure is a 'healthy baby' composite measured at 1 month postnatal using routine maternity data. Secondary outcome measures will be assessed using participant questionnaires completed at recruitment (baseline), 35 weeks gestation (follow-up 1) and 3 months postnatal (follow-up 2). An integrated process evaluation, to include exploration of fidelity, will be conducted using mixed methods. Analyses will be on an intention to treat as allocated basis. The primary analysis will compare the number of babies born \\"healthy\\" in the control and intervention arms and provide an odds ratio. A cost-effectiveness analysis will compare the incremental cost per Quality Adjusted Life Years and per additional 'healthy and positive birth' of the intervention with standard care.

Methods The survey included questions that allowed us to collect demographic data (e.g. age), professional qualifications (e.g. nurse, nurse aid) and data regarding the federal states and settings in which the participants worked. In additon, we asked the participants to describe their COVID-19 symptoms, if any were experienced, and the result of COVID-19 testing that they underwent. We used descriptive statistics as well as bivariate analysis methods to calculate differences. Findings More than 80% of the nursing staff (N = 2600) were women, nearly half of these staff members worked in the province of Styria and about three-quarters worked in hospitals. In general, nearly every sixth nurse reported experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. We found statistically significant differences between the settings and the federal provinces with regard to the COVID-19 symptoms reported, but not the test results. The highest porportion of nurses who experienced symptoms worked in lower Austria and in the primary care sector. In total, 1.6% of the participating nurses were tested for COVID-19, as well as about 1% of the nurses who worked in the nursing homes. The highest number of tests were carried out in Vienna followed by the province of Burgenland. In total, all of the nurses who underwent testing were diagnosed with COVID-19. Conclusions Only 1% of the nurses who worked in nursing homes were tested. This group of nurses takes care of the most vulnerable and high-risk group in Austrian society. Therefore, the nursing home staff should have the possibility to be tested even though they did not experience/report any symptoms. The highest prorportion of nurses who experienced symptoms worked in the primary care sector. In the future during a pandemic, health care staff should be comprehensively tested in all settings. Clinical Relevance Providing insights into COVID-19 symptoms experienced by nursing staff workforce and testing for COVID-19 can help us address these aspects in future pandemics more efficiently. In addition, these insights can help to shift the perspectives from critical and acute settings to other settings, e.g. nursing homes. This is an important change in perspectives, as these nurses have worked with the most vulnerable and high-risk group during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensuring the safety of nursing home residents and providing, high-quality nursing care and interventions can reduce hospital admission rates, decrease health care costs during such pandemics and might even reduce secondary morbidity and mortality.","output":"COVID-19 among nursing staff: Settings and regional differences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global healthcare sector is currently in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, a low-chance, high-impact event which will require healthcare systems, and the organisations within them, to maintain organisational resilience in order to respond effectively. However, contrary to the instinctive reaction to tighten control, the quality of response depends on healthcare systems capacity to loosen control and, subsequently, enhance improvisation. Three factors critical to enhancing an organisations capacity for improvisation are highlighted; increasing autonomy, maintaining structure and creating a shared understanding. By drawing on the case of Christchurch Hospitals response to a major earthquake, this paper demonstrates the vital role that improvisation can play within a clinical setting, when responding to a low-chance, high-impact event.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic: resilient organisational response to a low-chance, high-impact event"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 emergency and the cities lockdown have had a strong impact on transport and mobility. In particular, travel demand has registered an unprecedented overall contraction, dramatically dropping down with peaks of - 90%-95% passengers for public transport (PT). During the re-opening phase, demand is gradually resuming the levels before the crisis, although some structural changes are observed in travel behaviour, and containment measures to reduce the risk of contagion are still being applied, affecting transport supply. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims at assessing to what extent keeping a one-meter interpersonal distancing on-board trains is sustainable for public transport companies. METHOD: The analysis is based on travel demand forecasting models applied to two case-studies in Italy: a suburban railway line and a High-speed Rail (HSR) line, differentiated by demand characteristics (e.g. urban vs. ex-urban) and train access system (free access vs. reservation required). RESULTS: In the suburban case, the results show the need of new urban policies, not only limited to the transport domain, in order to manage the demand peaks at the stations and on-board vehicles. In the ex-urban case, the outputs suggest the need for public subsidies in order for the railways undertakings to cope with revenue losses and, at the same time, to maintain service quality levels.","output":"Impacts of interpersonal distancing on-board trains during the COVID-19 emergency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of coronary stents has represented a revolution in the treatment of coronary heart disease.

Hypersensitivity to stent components and drugs prescribed after stent insertion together with any environmental exposure seem to contribute to these adverse reactions. Patients can present to the hospital with a wide range of symptoms and multiple complications, the most important ones being instent restenosis and stent thrombosis. Although not very common (and not always easy to identify), allergic reactions after coronary or peripheral stents should be taken into account.

The two theoretical models of cyberchondria involve reassurance seeking and specific metacognitive beliefs. Cyberchondria has relationships with health anxiety, problematic Internet use and symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, with public health implications pertaining to functional impairment and altered healthcare utilization. Suggestions about prevention and management of cyberchondria have been put forward, but not tested yet. SUMMARY: Research interest in cyberchondria has steadily increased.

However, the validity of such scores in COVID-19 is unknown. METHODS: The North West Collaborative Organisation for Respiratory Research performed a multicentre prospective evaluation of adult patients admitted to the hospital with confirmed COVID-19 during a 2-week period in April 2020. Clinical variables measured as part of usual care at presentation to the hospital were recorded, including the Confusion, Urea, Respiratory Rate, Blood Pressure and Age Above or Below 65 Years (CURB-65), National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) and Quick Sequential (Sepsis-Related) Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) scores. The primary outcome of interest was 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Data were collected for 830 people with COVID-19 admitted across seven hospitals. By 30 days, a total of 300 (36.1%) had died and 142 (17.1%) had been in the intensive care unit. All scores underestimated mortality compared with pre-COVID-19 cohorts, and overall prognostic performance was generally poor. Among the 'low-risk' categories (CURB-65 score<2, NEWS2<5 and qSOFA score<2), 30-day mortality was 16.7%, 32.9% and 21.4%, respectively. NEWS2&#8805;5 had a negative predictive value of 98% for early mortality. Multivariable logistic regression identified features of respiratory compromise rather than circulatory collapse as most relevant prognostic variables. CONCLUSION: In the setting of COVID-19, existing prognostic scores underestimated risk. The design of new prognostic tools should focus on features of respiratory compromise rather than circulatory collapse. We provide a baseline set of variables which are relevant to COVID-19 outcomes and may be used as a basis for developing a bespoke COVID-19 prognostication tool.","output":"Utility of established prognostic scores in COVID-19 hospital admissions: multicentre prospective evaluation of CURB-65, NEWS2 and qSOFA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed four myths in bioethics.

Chemistry's roles in resilience are explored for the first time, with its technical capacities set in the wider contexts of cross-disciplinary working and the intersecting worlds of science, society and policy. The roles are framed by chemistry's contributions to the sustainability of people and planet, examined via the human security framework's four material aspects of food, health, economic and environmental security. As the science of transformation of matter, chemistry is deeply involved in these material aspects and in their interfacing with human security's three societal and governance aspects of personal, community and political security. Ultimately, strengthening resilience requires making choices about the present use of resources as a hedge against future hazards and adverse events, with these choices being co-determined by technical capacities and social and political will. It is argued that, to intensify its contributions to resilience, chemistry needs to take action along at least three major lines: (i) taking an integrative approach to the field of chemistry and resilience; (ii) rethinking how the chemical industry operates; and (iii) engaging more with society and policy-makers.","output":"A shared future: chemistry's engagement is essential for resilience of people and planet"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Patients with cancer have an increased risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and an attenuated responses to various vaccines. This meta-analysis aims to assess the serologic response to COVID-19 vaccination in patients with cancer. METHODS: Electronic databases were systematically searched on August 1, 2021 for studies that reported the serologic response to COVID-19 vaccine in cancer patients. Random effects models were used to achieve pooled serologic response rates and odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: We analyzed 16 observational studies with a total of 1453 patients with cancer. A majority of studies used mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273). The proportion of patients achieving a serologic response after a single and two doses of COVID-19 vaccine were 54.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 41.0C66.9) and 87.7% (95% CI 82.5C91.5), respectively. Patients with hematologic cancers had a lower response rate after the second dose of vaccine compared to those with solid organ cancers (63.7% vs. 94.9%), which was attributable to the low response rates associated with certain conditions (chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoma) and therapies (anti-CD20, kinase inhibitors). A lower proportion of patients with cancer achieved a serologic response compared to control patients after one and two doses of vaccine (OR0.073 [95% CI 0.026C0.20] and 0.10 [95% CI 0.039C0.26], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cancer, especially those with hematologic B-cell malignancies, have a lower serologic response to COVID-19 vaccines.

This study explored the influence of altruism on negative affect and mental health (anxiety and depressive symptoms) during the COVID-19 pandemic while people self-isolated at home in China. METHOD: University students were recruited to participate in a cross-sectional online survey during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Self-reported perceived risk, altruism, negative affect, anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured using the Self-Report Altruism Scale (SRA scale), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-9). A structural equation model was used to analyse the mediating and moderating effects on mental health. RESULTS: The final sample comprised 1346 Chinese participants (Mage = 19.76  2.23 years, 73% female). Overall, the higher the risk the participants perceived, the more negative affect they exhibited (? = 0.16, p < .001), and thus, the more anxious and depressed they felt (? = 0.134, p < .001); however, this relationship between risk perception and negative affect was moderated by altruism. In contrast to previous studies, the increase in negative affect associated with the increased perceived risk was pronounced among individuals with high altruism (t = 7.68, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with high altruism exhibited more negative affect than those with low altruism, which indirectly increased their anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Simvastatin has been shown to be cardioprotective by decreasing matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activity. The study was designed to determine whether simvastatin inhibits MMPs activity, decreases the severity of inflammation and contractile dysfunction of the heart in experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM). Methods: Simvastatin (3 or 30 mg/kg/day) was given to experimental rats with EAM by gastric gavage for 21 days. Then transthoracic echocardiography was performed, MMPs activity and troponin I level were determined and tissue samples were assessed under a light and transmission electron microscope. Results: Hearts treated with simvastatin did not show left ventricular enlargement. As a result of EAM, there was an enhanced activation of MMP-9, which was significantly reduced in the high-dose simvastatin group compared to the low-dose group. It was accompanied by prevention of myofilaments degradation and reduction of severity of inflammation. Conclusions: The cardioprotective effects of simvastatin in the acute phase of EAM are, at least in part, due to its ability to decrease MMP-9 activity and subsequent decline in myofilaments degradation and suppression of inflammation.

Current measures of patient experience within GI endoscopy are largely clinician derived and measured; however, these do not fully represent the experiences of patients themselves. It is important to measure the entirety of experience and not just experience directly during the procedure. We aimed to develop a patient-reported experience measure (PREM) for GI procedures. DESIGN: Phase 1: semi-structured interviews were conducted in patients who had recently undergone GI endoscopy or CT colonography (CTC) (included as a comparator). Thematic analysis identified the aspects of experience important to patients. Phase 2: a question bank was developed from phase 1 findings, and iteratively refined through rounds of cognitive interviews with patients who had undergone GI procedures, resulting in a pilot PREM. Phase 3: patients who had attended for GI endoscopy or CTC were invited to complete the PREM. Psychometric properties were investigated. Phase 4 involved item reduction and refinement. RESULTS: Phase 1: interviews with 35 patients identified six overarching themes: anxiety, expectations, information & communication, embarrassment & dignity, choice & control and comfort.

Self-reported walking difficulties over a 2 km distance were categorized into no difficulty, difficulty, and unable to walk. The total UJACAS score declined 24.9 points (SD 23.5) among those without walking difficulty, 27.0 (SD 25.0) among those reporting walking difficulty and 19.5 (SD 31.2) among those unable to walk 2 km.

Bartlett Specialty practice experienced disruptions in viral load (VL) monitoring due to 1) conversion to telemedicine visits and 2) closure of the onsite lab from March 16-July 13, 2021. We described the impact of the pandemic on VL monitoring. Methods We measured time from all index VLs collected during 3 periods: January 1, 2019 to March 15, 2020 (pre-pandemic);March 16 to July 12, 2020 (pandemic, closed onsite lab);and July 13 to December 31, 2020 (pandemic, open onsite lab) until a subsequent VL, 1 year after the index VL, or administrative censoring on December 31, 2020, whichever came first. We classified follow-up time according to these periods (treating period as a time-varying variable). We report hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) from a Cox proportional hazards model comparing the hazard of a VL during the pandemic periods to the pre-pandemic period, stratified by whether the index VL was suppressed (200 copies/mL). We tested for interactions between patient characteristics (age, sex at birth, race, ethnicity, and recent substance use) and period, to investigate differential effects of the pandemic on delayed VL. Results After 7,760 suppressed VL measurements, median times to subsequent VL during the pre-pandemic, pandemic (closed lab) and pandemic (open lab) periods, were 4.6 (HR=1.0), 8.9 (HR=0.34, CI:0.30, 0.37), and 5.8 (HR=0.73, CI:0.68,0.78) months respectively. After 1,025 non-suppressed VL measurements, median times to subsequent VL were 2.0 (HR=1.0), 3.9 (HR=0.57, CI:0.42,0.79), and 2.1 (HR=0.92, CI:0.76,1.10) months respectively. Time to subsequent VL after an index suppressed VL was less affected by the pandemic for patients who are white;had private insurance;or had no recent cocaine or heroin use. The effect of the pandemic on time to subsequent VL after a non-suppressed index VL did not significantly differ across patient characteristics. Conclusion Onsite lab closure disrupted VL collection for all groups. Once the onsite lab opened, the pandemic period was still associated with a delay among suppressed patients, but not non-suppressed patients. Further studies are needed to investigate if these delays are associated with lapses in viral suppression.

New surveillance and control strategy was set up to detect emerging outbreaks. AIM: To detect and describe the evolution of COVID-19 clusters and cases during the 2020 summer in Spain. METHODS: A near-real time surveillance system to detect active clusters of COVID-19 was developed based on Kulldorfs prospective space-time scan statistic (STSS) to detect daily emerging active clusters. RESULTS: Analyses were performed daily during the summer 2020 (June 21st August 31st) in Spain, showing an increase of active clusters and municipalities affected. Spread happened in the study period from a few, low-cases, regional-located clusters in June to a nationwide distribution of bigger clusters encompassing a higher average number of municipalities and total cases by end-August. CONCLUSION: STSS-based surveillance of COVID-19 can be of utility in a low-incidence scenario to help tackle emerging outbreaks that could potentially drive a widespread transmission. If that happens, spatial trends and disease distribution can be followed with this method. Finally, cluster aggregation in space and time, as observed in our results, could suggest the occurrence of community transmission.","output":"Real time surveillance of COVID-19 space and time clusters during the summer 2020 in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Although recent technological developments and improved endoscopic procedures have further spread the application of laparoscopic liver resection, laparoscopic anatomical liver resection still presents major technical difficulties, such as pedicle control.

Here, we dissect the contributions of the individual complement activation pathways to the protection from WNV disease. Genetic deficiencies in C1q, C4, factor B, or factor D all resulted in increased mortality in mice, suggesting that all activation pathways function together to limit WNV spread. In the absence of alternative pathway complement activation, WNV disseminated into the central nervous system at earlier times and was associated with reduced CD8(+) T cell responses yet near normal anti-WNV antibody profiles. Animals lacking the classical and lectin pathways had deficits in both B and T cell responses to WNV. Finally, and somewhat surprisingly, C1q was required for productive infection in the spleen but not for development of adaptive immune responses after WNV infection. Our results suggest that individual pathways of complement activation control WNV infection by priming adaptive immune responses through distinct mechanisms.","output":"Protective immune responses against West Nile virus are primed by distinct complement activation pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the public health challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic is the management of patients with chronic neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis Here, we present the case of a 45-year-old male patient with severe multiple sclerosis without disease-modifying therapy who was admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia, treated with dexamethasone and Remdesivir, and then discharged Subsequently, the patient was readmitted twice in the next month for complications arising from worsening dysphagia, musculoskeletal weakness, and neurogenic bladder On the first of these re-admissions, the patient presented with altered mental status, secondary to uremic encephalopathy due to acute kidney injury precipitated by lack of adequate PO hydration This admission was complicated by multiple pulmonary emboli necessitating transfer from the floor to the ICU, in addition to central line placement, candidemia, Pseudomonas urinary tract infection, and hemorrhagic cystitis Despite this protracted course, the patient's mental function and orientation slowly improved as his renal function improved secondary to intravenous fluid administration Because the patient's worsening dysphagia and weakness made adequate hydration by mouth untenable, the possibility of PEG tube placement was broached with the patient and his family After consent was obtained, a PEG tube was placed, and the patient was subsequently discharged home under the care of his family Two days after discharge, however, the patient presented to the Emergency Department, again with altered mental status due to uremic encephalopathy secondary to dehydration During this admission, blood cultures also revealed Pseudomonal sepsis, likely secondary to recurrent UTI ultimately caused by neurogenic bladder Accordingly, a suprapubic catheter was placed, and the care team worked with the patient's family to develop an adequate hydration regime before discharge This case study suggests that COVID-19 may exacerbate ongoing neuropathological processes in patients with chronic neurological disease, and illustrates strategies clinicians and patients use to grapple with these changes","output":"COVID-19 Pneumonia and Exacerbation of Multiple Sclerosis Flares Necessitating Placement of Suprapubic Catheter and PEG Tube: A Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION As the coronavirus pandemic emerged in late 2019, a task force was founded in the Sheba Medical Center and began preparing for the arrival of the pandemic to Israel.

The Corona ICU began operating in March 2020, with a multi-disciplinary team, gathered from ICU units, an internal medicine ward, an anesthesiology department, social workers and psychologists. Simultaneously, the routine medical center functions in non-corona sections were maintained, as much as possible. The coronavirus pandemic entails challenges of many aspects: an unfamiliar pathogen causing an unknown illness, a necessity for social distancing, ambiguity regarding the risk factors for contamination and illness severity, and medical crews put at risk. Consequently, the pandemic involves ethical, social, economic and moral aspects, affecting the medical crew members and system, the patients and their families, and our society as a whole.

The electrostatic charge and filtration efficiency of the composite fabrics were highly improved compared to the commercial polypropylene melt-blown fabrics. Moreover, due to its electrostatic charge induced by self-polarization, the photochromic Spiropyran(SP)/polystyrene(PS) electret fabrics can maintain high filtration performance (over 95%) towards PM0.3 particles and low air flow resistance (<343.2 Pa) even after 5 times of washing (by 75% ethanol)/drying cycles.

This study aimed to present which regional and social characteristics make COVID-19 cluster with high risk. Methods: By analyzing the data of all confirmed cases (14,423) in Korea between January 10 and August 3, 2020, provided by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, we manually linked each case and discovered clusters. After classifying the cases into clusters as nine types, we compared the duration and size of clusters by types to reveal high-risk cluster types. Also, we estimated odds for the risk factors for COVID-19 clustering by a spatial autoregressive model using the Bayesian approach. Results: Regarding the classified clusters (n = 539), the mean size was 19.21, and the mean duration was 9.24 days. The number of clusters was high in medical facilities, workplaces, and nursing homes. However, multilevel marketing, religious facilities, and restaurants/business-related clusters tended to be larger and longer when an outbreak occurred. According to the spatial analysis in COVID-19 clusters of more than 20 cases, the global Moran's I statistics value was 0.14 (p < 0.01). After adjusting for population size, the risks of COVID-19 clusters were related to male gender (OR = 1.29) and low influenza vaccination rate (OR = 0.87). After the spatial modeling, the predicted probability of forming clusters was visualized and compared with the actual incidence and local Moran's I statistics 2 months after the study period. Conclusions: COVID-19 makes different sizes of clusters in various contact settings; thus, precise epidemic control measures are needed. Also, when detecting and screening for COVID-19 clusters, regional risks such as vaccination rate should be considered for predicting risk to control the pandemic cost-effectively.","output":"Epidemiology and Regional Predictors of COVID-19 Clusters: A Bayesian Spatial Analysis Through a Nationwide Contact Tracing Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: COVID-19 brought about unprecedented challenges to healthcare, with nuclear medicine (NM) being no exception. The British Nuclear Medicine Society (BNMS) COVID-19 survey assessed the impact of the first wave of pandemic on NM services in the UK. With COVID-19 resurge compounded by seasonal winter pressures, we reflect and share lessons learnt from the first wave of pandemic to guide future strategy. METHODS: A questionnaire consisting of 34 questions was sent out to all BNMS members over 2 weeks in May 2020, to evaluate the impact of 'lockdown'. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-eight members (92 sites) from a multidisciplinary background responded. There was a 65% reduction across all services; 97.6% of respondents reported some reduction in diagnostic procedures and 71.3% reduction in therapies; 85% worked with a reduced workforce. The North East of England, Greater London and South East and Wessex were most affected by staff absences. The North East reported the highest number of COVID-19 positive staff; London reported the greatest lack of testing. The reported time required to clear the backlog was 1-12 months. Seventy-one percent of participants used BNMS COVID-19 guidance. CONCLUSION: The first wave caused a major disruption of NM service delivery and impacted on the workforce. The departmental strategies should tailor services to evolving local and regional differences in prevalence of COVID-19. A blanket shutdown of services with a 'one size fits all' strategy would likely have a severe impact on future delivery of NM and health services in general.

We included publications from 1 January 2019 to 3 April 2020 which focused on clinical features and treatments. We found that infection is transmitted from human to human and through contact with contaminated environmental surfaces. Hand hygiene is fundamental to prevent contamination. Wearing personal protective equipment is recommended in specific environments. The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, fatigue, slight dyspnoea, sore throat, headache, conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal issues.

DPT aims to notify app users about proximity exposures to persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 so that they can self-quarantine. The success of DPT apps depends on user acceptance and the embedding of DPT into the pandemic mitigation strategy. OBJECTIVE: By searching for media articles published during the first 3 months after DPT launch, the implementation of DPT in Switzerland was evaluated to inform similar undertakings in other countries. The second aim of the study was to create a link between reported DPT implementation challenges and normalization process theory for planning and optimizing complex digital health interventions, which can provide useful guidance for decision-making in DPT design and implementation. METHODS: A Swiss media database was searched for articles on the Swiss DPT app (SwissCovid) published in German or French between July 4 and October 3, 2020. In a structured process, topics were extracted and clustered manually from articles that were deemed pertinent. Extracted topics were mapped to four NPT constructs, which reflected the flow of intervention development from planning, stakeholder onboarding, and execution to critical appraisal. Coherence constructs describe sense-making by stakeholders, cognitive participation constructs reflect participants' efforts to create engagement with the intervention, collective actions refer to intervention execution and joint stakeholder efforts to make the intervention work, and reflexive monitoring refers to collective risk-benefit appraisals to create improvements. RESULTS: Out of 94 articles deemed pertinent and selected for closer inspection, 38 provided unique information on implementation challenges. Five challenge areas were identified: communication challenges, challenges for DPT to interface with other processes, fear of resource competition with established pandemic mitigation measures, unclear DPT effectiveness, and obstacles to greater user coverage and compliance. Specifically, several articles mentioned unclear DPT benefits to affect commitment and to raise fears among different health system actors regarding resource competition. Moreover, media reports indicated process interface challenges such as delays or unclear responsibilities in the notification cascade, as well as misunderstandings and unmet communication needs from health system actors. Finally, reports suggested misaligned incentives, not only for app usage by the public but also for process engagement by other actors in the app notification cascade. NPT provided a well-fitting framework to contextualize the different DPT implementation challenges and to highlight improvement strategies, namely a better alignment of stakeholder incentives, or stakeholder-specific communication to address their concerns about DPT. CONCLUSIONS: Early experiences from one of the first adopters of DPT indicate that nontechnical implementation challenges may affect the effectiveness of DPT.

Ghanaians generally have a strong communal life which transcends their sociocultural background. The sociocultural impact of the coronavirus restrictions therefore was pronounced on the people because a lot of their economic activities were negatively affected since such activities thrive best on a strong sociocultural base.

Various approaches have been proposed to counteract the bacterial resistance development. Tackling bacterial virulence is one of the most promising approaches that confer several merits. The bacterial virulence is mainly regulated by a communication system known as quorum sensing (QS) system. Meanwhile, bacteria can sense the adrenergic hormones and eavesdrops on the host cells to establish their infection, adrenergic hormones were shown to enhance the bacterial virulence. In this study, -adrenoreceptor blockers were proposed not only to stop bacterial espionage on our cells but also as inhibitors to the bacterial QS systems. In this context, a detailed in silico study has been conducted to evaluate the affinities of twenty-two -blockers to compete on different structural QS receptors. Among the best docked and thermodynamically stable -blockers; atenolol, esmolol, and metoprolol were subjected to further in vitro and in vivo investigation to evaluate their anti-QS activities against Chromobacterium violaceum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. The three tested -blockers decreased the production of QS-controlled C. violaceum, and the formation of biofilm by P. aeruginosa and S. typhimurium. Additionally, the tested -blockers down-regulated the P. aeruginosa QS-encoding genes and S. typhimurium sensor kinase encoding genes.

The MERS-CoV spike (S) protein is a major target for neutralizing antibodies in infected patients. The MERS-CoV microneutralization test (MNt) is the gold standard method for demonstrating prior infection.

OBJECTIVE To systematically map the accessible research literature to answer the research question: Which non-surgical, non-pharmacological interventions are used in the treatment of dysphagia in patients with moderate and severe ABI in the acute and subacute phase? DESIGN: Scoping review based on the methodology of Arksey and O'Malley and methodological advancement by Levac et al. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, OTseeker, speechBITE and PEDro were searched up until 14 March 2021. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA All studies reporting rehabilitative interventions within 6 months of injury for patients with moderate-to-severe ABI and dysphagia were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data was extracted by two independent reviewers and studies were categorised based on treatment modality. RESULTS A total of 21 396 records were retrieved, and a final of 26 studies were included. Interventions were categorised into cortical or non-cortical stimulation of the swallowing network.

Majority of information and evidence gathered so far regarding COVID-19 has been derived from data and studies in adult populations. Crucial information regarding the characterization, clinical symptomatology, sequelae, and overall outcomes in the pediatric population is lacking. As such, we aimed to conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis and systematic review to collect and analyze current evidence about COVID-19 in the pediatric population. METHOD: A systematic search and review of scientific literatures was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Medline, and Google Scholar databases.

In pooled data, majority (25% [CI 18-32], I 2 59%) of overall COVID-19 positive patients fell in the 6-10yr age group. 13% ([CI 11-14], I 2 78%) of the patients were asymptomatic, with headache (67% [CI 60-74], I 2 46%), fever (55% [CI 52-58], I 2 61%), and cough (45% [CI 42- 49], I 2 79%) accounting for the most prevalent physical signs seen in symptomatic patients. Leukopenia (12% [CI 9-15], I 2 50%) and lymphopenia (15% [CI 13-19], I 2 85%) was common. Elevated Ferritin (26% [CI 16-40], I 2 73%), Procal (25% [CI 21- 29%], I 2 83%), and CRP (19% [CI 16-22%], I 2 74%) were other laboratory abnormalities commonly observed. Common radiological features were ground-glass opacities (36% [CI 32-39%], I 2 92%), normal finding (33% [CI 30-36%], I 2 81%), and consolidation. 29% ([CI 26-33], I 2 85%) of the patient cases was non-severe, whereas only 5% ([CI 1-8], I 2 87%) was severe. Mortality was observed in 0.3% ([CI 0.1-0.4], I 2 0%) of the overall cases. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is prevalent across all pediatric age-groups and presents with varying degree of symptomology. However, children have a milder course of the disease with extremely favorable prognosis. Laboratory and radiological features are inconsistent and require further investigations. Additional studies are needed on this topic to corroborate findings and establish evidence-based and consistent characterization of COVID-19 in the pediatric population.","output":"Prevalence, Clinical characteristics, and Outcomes of Pediatric COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vero cells are highly susceptible to many viruses in humans and animals, and its membrane proteins (MPs) are responsible for virus entry.

This leads to an investigation into the racial disparity between Asian American offenders and those of other races. The nature and characteristics of hate crimes against Asian Americans are compared to those of hate crimes against African Americans in our research. According to studies of all victim-related factors, hate crimes against Asian Americans are similar to those against African Americans.

Although the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) has been used in India, no study has adapted the measure in full for use with this population. Similarly, the PTSD checklist-5 (PCL-5) has not yet been validated in India. This study describes the adaptation, validation, and results from the adapted HTQ, and embedded PCL-5, for Indian women from slums reporting GBV. METHOD: This study used the adaptation framework proposed by the HTQ measure developers. The adapted HTQ contained a (1) trauma screen relevant for stressors faced by Indian women from slums, (2) description of the index trauma, (3) description of any ongoing stressors, (4) universal trauma reactions (i.e., PTSD measured by the PCL-5), and culturally relevant trauma reactions (i.e., idioms of distress measured by a scale developed for the study). This measure was piloted on 111 women from Indian slums in face-to-face interviews. Trauma characteristics, types of ongoing stressors, and psychometric properties of the PCL-5 and idioms of distress scale were explored. These scales were validated against measures of depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and somatic complaints (PHQ-15). RESULTS: The majority of participants (77%) reported physical beatings, 18% reported unwanted sexual touch, and 28.8% reported infidelity as the primary emotional abuse. Further, 96.7% of GBV was perpetrated by partner or family member and over half reported ongoing stressors (e.g., poverty-related strain). The PCL-5 embedded in the HTQ yielded good internal consistency (Cronbachs alpha = .88) as did the idioms of distress scale with deletion of one item (Cronbachs alpha = .80). Both scales were externally valid, yielding large correlations with depression, anxiety, and somatic complaints (rs between .54 and .80, ps < .05). DISCUSSION: This is the first study to develop a comprehensive measure of trauma exposure with universal and culturally relevant trauma reactions in India. This study also enhances HTQ usage in India by delineating all the steps in the adaptation process. Results can inform the development of trauma-focused interventions for Indian women from slums.

All participants received adequate training for chest tube insertion by a recently graduated general surgeon. Chest tubes insertion skill was assessed using the tool for assessing chest tube insertion competency (TACTIC) test. RESULTS: Post-TACTIC test score was significantly higher (p=0.001) than Pre-TACTIC test score in both groups. However, a comparison of mean Pre-TACTIC test scores and mean Post-TACTIC test scores between group A and group B showed that PAL effectiveness in group A was significantly higher (p=0.001) than group B.

The problem can be visualized as a leader-follower game in which the operator is the leader that opens facilities, whereas the customer is the follower who observes the operator's location decision at first and then seeks services from the most preferred facility. Such a modeling perspective is of practical importance as we have witnessed its applications to various problems, such as the establishment of power plants in energy markets and the location of healthcare service centers for COVID-19 Vaccination.

Moreover, due to the hardness of the problems, existing exact approaches have limited performance. Motivated by these observations, we aim to develop an efficient exact algorithm for solving large-scale PUP models. We first propose a branch-and-cut decomposition algorithm and then design accelerated techniques to further enhance the performance. Using a broad testbed, we show that our algorithm outperforms various exact approaches by a large margin, and the advantage can go up to several orders of magnitude in terms of computational time in some datasets.

However, soon it became clear that long-term predictions were extremely challenging to address. In addition, it is still unclear which metric shall be used for a global description of the evolution of the outbreaks. Yet a robust modelling of pandemic dynamics and a consistent choice of the transmission metric is crucial for an in-depth understanding of the macroscopic phenomenology and better-informed mitigation strategies. In this study, we propose a Markovian stochastic framework designed for describing the evolution of entropy during the COVID-19 pandemic together with the instantaneous reproductive ratio. Then, we introduce and use entropy-based metrics of global transmission to measure the impact and the temporal evolution of a pandemic event. In the formulation of the model, the temporal evolution of the outbreak is modelled by an equation governing the probability distribution that describes a nonlinear Markov process of a statistically averaged individual, leading to a clear physical interpretation. The time-dependent parameters are formulated by adaptive basis functions, leading to a parsimonious representation. In addition, we provide a full Bayesian inversion scheme for calibration together with a coherent strategy to address data unreliability. The time evolution of the entropy rate, the absolute change in the system entropy, and the instantaneous reproductive ratio are natural and transparent outputs of this framework. The framework has the appealing property of being applicable to any compartmental epidemic model. As an illustration, we apply the proposed approach to a simple modification of the susceptibleCexposedCinfectedCremoved model. Applying the model to the Hubei region, South Korean, Italian, Spanish, German, and French COVID-19 datasets, we discover significant difference in the absolute change of entropy but highly regular trends for both the entropy evolution and the instantaneous reproductive ratio.","output":"The dynamics of entropy in the COVID-19 outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic.

This system was compared with the conventional solar still (CSS) in the same climatic conditions. Phosphate bags are placed vertically to increase the energy storage capacity, and the water's surface area since the capillaries inside the phosphate bags play an important role in increasing the energy storage capacity.

METHODS: We analysed the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance physician registry (from 24 March 2020 to 12 April 2021). We investigated b/tsDMARD use for RA at the clinical onset of COVID-19 (baseline): abatacept (ABA), rituximab (RTX), Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi), interleukin 6 inhibitors (IL-6i) or tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi, reference group). The ordinal COVID-19 severity outcome was (1) no hospitalisation, (2) hospitalisation without oxygen, (3) hospitalisation with oxygen/ventilation or (4) death. We used ordinal logistic regression to estimate the OR (odds of being one level higher on the ordinal outcome) for each drug class compared with TNFi, adjusting for potential baseline confounders. RESULTS: Of 2869 people with RA (mean age 56.7 years, 80.8% female) on b/tsDMARD at the onset of COVID-19, there were 237 on ABA, 364 on RTX, 317 on IL-6i, 563 on JAKi and 1388 on TNFi. Overall, 613 (21%) were hospitalised and 157 (5.5%) died. RTX (OR 4.15, 95% CI 3.16 to 5.44) and JAKi (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.65) were each associated with worse COVID-19 severity compared with TNFi. There were no associations between ABA or IL6i and COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: People with RA treated with RTX or JAKi had worse COVID-19 severity than those on TNFi. The strong association of RTX and JAKi use with poor COVID-19 outcomes highlights prioritisation of risk mitigation strategies for these people.","output":"Associations of baseline use of biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs with COVID-19 severity in rheumatoid arthritis: Results from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance physician registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One type of change that has lurked at the edges of scholarly discussions of international politicsoften assumed, invoked, and alluded to, but rarely interrogatedis learning Learning entails a very particular type of change It is deliberate, internal, transformative, and peaceful (in the sense of being uncoerced) In this contribution to the roundtable International Institutions and Peaceful Change, I ask whether intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) can learn in a way that is comparable to the paradigmatic learning of individual human beings In addressing this question, I take three steps First, I explore references to corporate entities learning within the discipline of international relations (IR) and ask whether what is being proposed is, in fact, genuine learning by the organizations themselves Second, I attempt to construct a robust account of institutional learning that departs from these conceptions and acknowledges instead the self-reflection and structural transformation that I argue learning at the corporate level requires Third, for the purpose of illustration, I turn briefly to the UN following the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and the slaughter of more than eight thousand men and boys outside Srebrenica in 1995 to identify examples of each stage of institutional learning Finally, I offer three provisional claims about my proposed conception of institutional learning that warrant attention in future work Namely, I suggest that institutional learning: (1) cannot be equated with moral progress;(2) is possible despite formal organizations being incapable of emotional responses such as shame or regret;and, perhaps most controversially, (3) can occur at the level of the IGO without prior or parallel learning taking place at the level of the state or individual human actor","output":"Intergovernmental Organizations and the Possibility of Institutional Learning: Self-Reflection and Internal Reform in the Wake of Moral Failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION We investigated public interest in shopping and point-of-sales (POS) of JUUL and Puff Bar products in the context of five regulatory, company sales policy and other events of interest that may have influenced the trajectory of these products during 2019-2021.

It was first introduced into Scotland in February 2020 associated with returning travellers and visitors. By March it was circulating in communities across the UK, and to control COVID-19 cases, and prevent overwhelming of the National Health Service (NHS), a 'lockdown' was introduced on 23rd March 2020 with a restriction of people's movements. To augment the public health efforts a large-scale genome epidemiology effort (as part of the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium) resulted in the sequencing of over 5000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes by 18th August 2020 from Scottish cases, about a quarter of the estimated number of cases at that time. Here we quantify the geographical origins of the first wave introductions into Scotland from abroad and other UK regions, the spread of these SARS-CoV-2 lineages to different regions within Scotland (defined at the level of NHS Health Board) and the effect of lockdown on virus 'success'. We estimate that approximately 300 introductions seeded lineages in Scotland, with around 25% of these lineages composed of more than five viruses, but by June circulating lineages were reduced to low levels, in line with low numbers of recorded positive cases. Lockdown was, thus, associated with a dramatic reduction in infection numbers and the extinguishing of most virus lineages. Unfortunately since the summer cases have been rising in Scotland in a second wave, with >1000 people testing positive on a daily basis, and hospitalisation of COVID-19 cases on the rise again. Examining the available Scottish genome data from the second wave, and comparing it to the first wave, we find that while some UK lineages have persisted through the summer, the majority of lineages responsible for the second wave are new introductions from outside of Scotland and many from outside of the UK. This indicates that, while lockdown in Scotland is directly linked with the first wave case numbers being brought under control, travel-associated imports (mostly from Europe or other parts of the UK) following the easing of lockdown are responsible for seeding the current epidemic population. This demonstrates that the impact of stringent public health measures can be compromised if following this, movements from regions of high to low prevalence are not minimised.","output":"Epidemic waves of COVID-19 in Scotland: a genomic perspective on the impact of the introduction and relaxation of lockdown on SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this COVID-19 pandemic, learners across the world are encouraged to stay at home receiving online education, which has nearly caused various learning outcomes.

Therefore, we analyzed associations between changes in PE hospitalizations and (1) the incidence of non-Covid-19 pneumonia, (2) the use of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), (3) volume depletion and (4) preceding Covid-19 infection numbers in Germany. Methods: Claims data of Helios hospitals in Germany were used and consecutive cases with a hospital admission between May 6 and December 15, 2020 (PE surplus period) were analyzed and compared to corresponding periods covering the same weeks in 2016-2019 (control period). We analyzed the number of PE cases in the target period with multivariable Poisson general linear mixed models (GLMM) including (a) cohorts of 2020 versus 2016-2019, (b) the number of cases with pneumonia, (c) CTPA, and (d) volume depletion and adjusted for age and sex. In order to associate the daily number of PE cases in 2020 with the number of preceding SARS-CoV-2 infections in Germany, we calculated the average number of daily infections (divided by 10,000) occurring 14 up to 90 days with increasing window sizes before PE cases and modelled the data with Poisson regression. Results: There were 2,404 PE hospitalizations between May 6 and December 15, 2020 as opposed to 2,112-2,236 (total 8,717) in the corresponding 2016-2019 control periods. (crude rate ratio [CRR] 1.10, 95% CI 1.05-1.15, P<0.01). Using multivariable Poisson GLMM adjusted for age, sex and volume depletion, PE cases were significantly associated with the number of cases with pneumonia (CRR 1.09, 95 % CI 1.07-1.10, P<0.01), and with CTPA (CRR 1.10, 95 % CI 1.09-1.10, P<0.01). The increase of PE cases in 2020 compared with the control period remained significant (CRR 1.07, 95 % CI 1.02-1.12, P<0.01) when controlling for those factors. In the 2020 cohort, number of preceding average daily Covid-19 infections were associated with increased PE case incidence in all investigated windows, i.e. including preceding infections from 14 to 90 days. The best model (log likelihood -576) was with a window size of 4 days, i.e. average Covid-19 infections 14-17 days before PE hospitalization had a risk of 1.20 (95 % CI 1.12-1.29, P<0.01). Conclusions: There is an increase in PE cases since early May 2020 compared to corresponding periods in 2016-2019. This surplus was significant even when controlling for changes in potential modulators such as demographics, volume depletion, non-Covid-19 pneumonia, CTPA use and preceding Covid-19 infections.

At the cellular surface, electrolytes play an important role, especially in the interaction of proteins near the membrane surface. Additionally, the binding interface of the CoV-2 RBD - ACE2 complex is highly hydrophilic. We simulated the CoV-2 RBD - ACE2 complex at varying salt concentrations over the concentration range from 0.03 M to 0.3 M of calcium and sodium chloride over an individual simulation length of 750 ns in 9 independent simulations (6.75 s total). We observe that the CoV-2 RBD - ACE2 complex is stabilized independent of the salt concentration. We identify a strong negative electrostatic potential at the N-terminal part of CoV-2 RBD and we find that CoV-2 RBD binds even stronger at higher salt concentrations. We observe that the dynamics of the N-terminal part of CoV-2 RBD stabilize the protein complex leading to strong collective motions and a stable interface between CoV-2 RBD and ACE2. We state that the sequence of CoV-2 RBD might be optimized for a strong binding to ACE2 at varying salt concentrations at the cellular surface, which acts as a key component in the activation of CoV-2 for its viral entry.

The CoV-2 spike protein is a major target for the development of a vaccine and potential strategies to inhibit the viral entry into human cells.

The use of mesh may reduce this recurrence rate. The indication for mesh use, the type of mesh to use, and the placement technique are controversial. A survey of surgeon practice was undertaken to obtain a better understanding of the controversies surrounding this clinical problem. METHODS A questionnaire on the technique and results of mesh hiatal herniorrhaphy was sent to 1,192 members of the Society of Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES). RESULTS There were 275 responses; 261 of these were analyzed. A total of 5,486 hiatal hernia repairs with mesh were reported; 77% and 23% were performed laparoscopically vs open, respectively. The most common indication for mesh usage was an increased size hiatal defect (46% of respondents). The most common mesh types were biomaterial (28%), polytetrafluoroethylene (25%), and polypropylene (21%). Suture anchorage was the most common fixation technique (56% of respondents). The findings showed a failure rate of 3%, a stricture rate of 0.2%, and an erosion rate of 0.3%.

This report assesses risk factors associated with mortality in patients presenting with Covid-19 infection and healthcare disparities. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients presenting to emergency departments within an integrated health system who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 7 and April 30, 2020 in Metropolitan Detroit. The primary outcomes were hospitalization and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 3,633 patients with mean age of 58 years were included. The majority were female and black non-Hispanic. Sixty-four percent required hospitalization, 56% of whom were black. Hospitalized patients were older, more likely to reside in a low-income area, and had a higher burden of comorbidities. By 30-days, 433 (18.7%) hospitalized patients died. In adjusted analyses, the presence of comorbidities, age >60 years and more severe physiological disturbance were associated with 30-day mortality. Residence in low income areas (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval 0.76 - 1.36), and public insurance (odds ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval 0.76 - 2.01) were not independently associated with higher risk of mortality. Black female patients had a lower adjusted risk of mortality (odds ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of COVID-19 patients, those with comorbidities, advanced age, and physiological abnormalities on presentation had higher odds of death.

METHODS: Secondary analysis of COVID-19_URG-HCSC registry. We included all consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the ED of the University Hospital Clinico San Carlos (Madrid, Spain). The population was divided into six age groups. Demographic, baseline and acute clinical data, and in-hospital and 30-day outcomes were collected. RESULTS: 1379 confirmed COVID-19 cases (mean age 62 (SD 18) years old; 53.5% male) were included (18.1% < 45 years; 17.8% 45-54 years; 17.9% 55-64 years; 17.2% 65-74 years; 17.0% 75-84 years; and 11.9% &#8805; 85 years). A statistically significant association was found between demographic, comorbidity, clinical, radiographic, analytical, and therapeutic variables and short-term results according to age-dependent categories. There were less COVID-specific symptoms and more atypical symptoms among older people. Age was a prognostic factor for hospital admission (aOR = 1.04; 95% CI 1.02-1.05) and in-hospital (aOR = 1.08; 95% CI 1.05-1.10) and 30-day mortality (aOR = 1.07; 95% CI 1.04-1.09), and was associated with not being admitted to intensive care (aOR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.93-0.98).

METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search on Cochrane, MEDLINE, and EMBASE as per guidelines of PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews). A total of 41 case reports and case series describing 97 patients, and 5 original articles describing 15,585,309 participants were selected as part of this review. RESULTS: Of the 97 reported cases describing vaccine-associated myocarditis/pericarditis, 67 (69%) patients received Pfizer-BioNTech and 25 (25.7%) received Moderna. The mean onset of symptoms after vaccine administration was 3.8  4.5 days with three-quarters developing symptoms after the second dose. Chest pain (n = 88, 90%) and fever (n = 33, 34%) were the most common presenting complaints. Out of 97, 80 (82.5%) patients recovered while 4 (4.1%) patients expired. The pooled incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis extrapolated from original studies is 0.001% and 0.0004%, respectively. In the original studies, nearly all the cases of myocarditis and pericarditis were mild. Chest pain and fever were the most common presenting symptoms.

I found 19 ORF8 nonsense mutations, most of them occurring in the 5 half of the gene. The ORF8-deficient lineages were rare, representing 0.67% of sequenced genomes. Nevertheless, I identified two clusters of related sequences that emerged recently and spread in different countries. The widespread D614G spike mutation was found in most ORF-deficient lineages. Although less frequent, HV69-70del and L5F spike mutations occurred in the background of six different ORF8 nonsense mutations. I also confirmed that VOC-202012/01 is the ORF8-deficient variant with more spike mutations reported to date, although other variants could have up to six spike mutations, some of putative biological relevance.

METHODS: In total, 112 subjects with immunosuppressive state were enrolled from a comprehensive tertiary hospital in Central China between July 2019 and December 2021. Eight-one fungal isolates were clinically recovered by fungus-culturing approaches. The identifications were conducted through a mass spectrometry detecting platform. The susceptibilities to antifungals were tested using the broth micro-dilution method, and the possible antifungal azole-resistance mechanism in specific Candida species was availably explored by sequencing. Patient medical profiles were accessed via the digitized retrieval system of hospital, from which clinical outcomes and multiple risk factors for immunosuppressed patients with clinically diagnosed IFIs were explicitly documented for evaluation. RESULTS: Candida species predominated in clinically diagnosed IFIs of immunosuppressed patients (accounting for 88.88%), followed by Trichosporon and Aspergillus species (6.17% and 4.94%, respectively). The source types of specimen were primarily comprised of urine (41.98%), respiratory samples (33.33%) and peripheral blood (9.88%). Frequently isolated Candida and Trichosporon species exhibited a high level of in vitro sensitivity for amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine, whereas a substantial portion of Candida species including C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis complex and C. tropicalis, and Trichosporon species showed lowered sensitivity patterns toward itraconazole, fluconazole and voriconazole at different levels. Specifically, gene mutations of ERG11 were identified in azole-resistant C. tropicalis. Distinct risk factors were analyzed to be highly associated with the clinically diagnosed IFI incidence, mainly including hospitalization duration, surgical procedures, immunosuppressive treatments, underlying diseases and other conditions. CONCLUSION: Candida, Trichosporon and Aspergillus species were the top three pathogenic fungal agents causing clinically diagnosed IFIs in immunosuppressed patients. The attenuated sensitivity to azoles in Candida and Trichosporon species needs close surveillance, and ERG11 polymorphism might contribute to azole resistance in specific Candida species. Multiple featured risk factors for immunosuppressed patients developing clinically diagnosed IFIs require further consideration during clinical practice.","output":"Immunosuppressed Patients with Clinically Diagnosed Invasive Fungal Infections: The Fungal Species Distribution, Antifungal Sensitivity and Associated Risk Factors in a Tertiary Hospital of Anhui Province"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chest X-ray becomes one of the most common medical diagnoses due to its noninvasiveness.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study including the first consecutive 5000 patients with COVID-19 in Qatar who completed 60 days of follow up by June 17, 2020. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 60 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. In addition, we explored risk factors for admission to ICU. RESULTS: Included patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 28 and April 17, 2020. The majority (4436, 88.7%) were males and the median age was 35 years [interquartile range (IQR) 28-43]. By 60 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, 14 patients (0.28%) had died, 10 (0.2%) were still in hospital, and two (0.04%) were still in ICU. Fatal COVID-19 cases had a median age of 59.5 years (IQR 55.8-68), and were mostly males (13, 92.9%). All included pregnant women (26, 0.5%), children (131, 2.6%), and healthcare workers (135, 2.7%) were alive and not hospitalized at the end of follow up. A total of 1424 patients (28.5%) required hospitalization, out of which 108 (7.6%) were admitted to ICU. Most frequent co-morbidities in hospitalized adults were diabetes (23.2%), and hypertension (20.7%). Multivariable logistic regression showed that older age [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.041, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.022-1.061 per year increase; P < 0.001], male sex (aOR 4.375, 95% CI 1.964-9.744; P < 0.001), diabetes (aOR 1.698, 95% CI 1.050-2.746; P 0.031), chronic kidney disease (aOR 3.590, 95% CI 1.596-8.079, P 0.002), and higher BMI (aOR 1.067, 95% CI 1.027-1.108 per unit increase; P 0.001), were all independently associated with increased risk of ICU admission.

METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O'Mallay. Five online databases, along with grey literature, were searched for articles published until 22 May 2020, and we included 62 articles in the review. The research domains, methodological characteristics, and key conclusions were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Retrospective observational studies comprised more than one third (41.9%) of the included publications, and 77.8% were conducted on living patients. The incidence of liver injury varied widely across the studies (4.8%-78%), and liver injury was frequently associated with severe COVID-19. We identified the following risk factors for liver injury: male sex, lymphopoenia, gastrointestinal involvement, old age, increased neutrophil count, and the use of hepatotoxic drugs. Histopathological findings indicate that COVID-19 has direct cytopathic effects and causes liver function test derangements secondary to inflammation, hypoxia, and vascular insult. CONCLUSIONS: Liver injury following COVID-19 infection is common and primarily hepatocellular, with a greater elevation of aspartate aminotransferase than of alanine aminotransferase. However, the evidence regarding hepatic failure secondary to COVID-19 is insufficient. Standardised criteria to diagnose liver injury need to be devised.

The initial response can be crucial to outcomes, all the while recognising that changes may be needed as the emergency progresses. The recent coronavirus pandemic demonstrated how the course of action taken by authorities endorsing these protective behaviours early on can save thousands of lives. Factors that determine response success include public compliance with authorities' recommendations and cooperation between experts and rescuers. In particular, the way rescuers perceive the risks of ionising radiation hazards will influence their preparedness to respond in case of a radiological or nuclear emergency. Having found no previous studies on radiological hazard and risk perception amongst rescuers in Portugal, mental models were used as a descriptive approach. The target groups were firefighters and the military formally trained to deal with radiation hazard emergencies. Their representations of radiological hazards and risks were analysed in the light of an expert model built ad hoc. The results show several overlays between experts and rescuers on the understanding of radiation hazards and potential risks. We conclude that the main gap between radiation risk perceptions by rescuers and experts involves the concepts and mechanisms of radiation contamination and its spread among individuals, in particular, if persons exposed to radioactive sources may also become a radioactive source themselves. This gap can have practical implications for an emergency response.","output":"Ionising radiation risk perception through mental models: towards radiological emergency preparedness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY DESIGN: Psychometric study, transverse study.

METHODS: MSES assesses confidence in the performance of daily activities. The original scale was translated from English into Italian using international guidelines. MSES-IT's internal consistency and inter-rater reliability were examined through the Cronbach alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), respectively. Its concurrent validity was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficients with the Italian version of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure-Self Reported (SCIM-SR) and the Italian version of the Quality-of-Life Assessment Questionnaire (SF-36). RESULTS: The MSES-IT was administered to 65 subjects. Cronbach's alpha for the MSES-IT was 0.87, and the test-retest reliability (ICC) was 0.99 (95% Confidence Interval). The validity analysis showed significant moderate correlations (0.30 <  < 0.44) between the MSES-IT and the following components of SF-36: Role limitations physical health; Role limitations emotional problems; Emotional well-being; General health. However, no correlations emerged between MSES-IT and SCIM-SR. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed strong values of Cronbach's alpha and ICC of MSES-IT that make it a useful clinical and research tool.

Although generally safe when used for approved indications such as autoimmune disease or malaria, the safety and benefit of these treatment regimens are poorly evaluated in COVID-19. METHODS: We did a multinational registry analysis of the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19. The registry comprised data from 671 hospitals in six continents. We included patients hospitalised between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020, with a positive laboratory finding for SARS-CoV-2. Patients who received one of the treatments of interest within 48 h of diagnosis were included in one of four treatment groups (chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide), and patients who received none of these treatments formed the control group. Patients for whom one of the treatments of interest was initiated more than 48 h after diagnosis or while they were on mechanical ventilation, as well as patients who received remdesivir, were excluded. The main outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias (non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation). FINDINGS: 96 032 patients (mean age 538 years, 463% women) with COVID-19 were hospitalised during the study period and met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 14 888 patients were in the treatment groups (1868 received chloroquine, 3783 received chloroquine with a macrolide, 3016 received hydroxychloroquine, and 6221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide) and 81 144 patients were in the control group. 10 698 (111%) patients died in hospital. After controlling for multiple confounding factors (age, sex, race or ethnicity, body-mass index, underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, diabetes, underlying lung disease, smoking, immunosuppressed condition, and baseline disease severity), when compared with mortality in the control group (93%), hydroxychloroquine (180%; hazard ratio 1335, 95% CI 1223C1457), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (238%; 1447, 1368C1531), chloroquine (164%; 1365, 1218C1531), and chloroquine with a macrolide (222%; 1368, 1273C1469) were each independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Compared with the control group (03%), hydroxychloroquine (61%; 2369, 1935C2900), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (81%; 5106, 4106C5983), chloroquine (43%; 3561, 2760C4596), and chloroquine with a macrolide (65%; 4011, 3344C4812) were independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalisation. INTERPRETATION: We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19.

Currently, the evidence regarding the link between OSA and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still conflicting. This study aims to analyze the relationship between OSA and poor outcomes of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed and Europe PMC database using specific keywords related to our aims until December 10th, 2020. All articles published on COVID-19 and OSA were retrieved. The quality of the study was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) tool for observational studies. Statistical analysis was done using Review Manager 5.4 software. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies with 54,276 COVID-19 patients were included in this meta-analysis. This meta-analysis showed that OSA was associated with composite poor outcome [OR 1.72 (95% CI 1.55-1.91), p < 0.00001, I2 = 36%, random-effect modeling] and its subgroup which comprised of severe COVID-19 [OR 1.70 (95% CI 1.18-2.45), p = 0.005], ICU admissions [OR 1.76 (95% CI 1.51-2.05), p < 0.00001], the need for mechanical ventilation [OR 1.67 (95% CI 1.48-1.88), p < 0.00001], and mortality [OR 1.74 (95% CI 1.39-2.19), p < 0.00001]. CONCLUSIONS: Extra care and close monitoring should be provided to patients with OSA to minimize the risk of infections.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), one of the causative agents of respiratory viral infections, is the most common cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in children and adults. METHODS: Respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal aspirate, nasal swab, throat swab, etc.), which were sent to the Department of laboratory medicine from January 2012 to December 2018 for detection of respiratory viruses via real time reverse transcription PCR (Real time RT-PCR) were used in this study. RSV detected by real-time RT-PCR were analyzed on the basis of co-infection, sex and age of the patients, and year and month of sample collection. RESULTS: During the study period, we observed that the RSV detection rate was 12.8% (n = 1150/9010); the detection rate of RSV-A (7.1%) was higher than that of RSV-B (5.8%). The detection rate of RSV was the highest at 36.5% in December, and RSV-A and RSV-B were in vogue every year. Co-infection rate of RSVs was the highest in the patients over 80 years of age; RSVs showed the highest Co-infection with Rhinoviruses. CONCLUSIONS: During the study period, prevalence was different among the two subtypes of RSV, and the average age of RSV-B-positive patients was higher than that of RSV-A. Co-infection rate tended to increase every year. RSVs cause mild as well as severe infections. There are reports of serious clinical progress as RSVs cause overlapping infections with other viruses and increase the risk of secondary bacterial infections.

Prior to the epidemic (2019), the American Medical Association (AMA) conducted a routine study to compare physicians adoption of emerging technologies to a similar survey in 2016. Most notable was a doubling in the adoption of telehealth/virtual technology to 28% and increases in the use of remote monitoring and management for improved care (13C22%). These results may now seem insignificant when compared to the unprecedented surge in telehealth visits because of SARS-CoV-2. Even as this surge levels off and begins to decline, many observers believe we will continue to see a persistent increase in the use of virtual visits compared to face-to-face care. The requirements for adoption communicated by physicians in both the 2016 and 2019 surveys are now more relevant than ever: Is remote care as effective as in-person care and how best to determine when to use these modalities? How do I safeguard my patients and my practice from liability and privacy concerns? How do I optimize using these technologies in my practice and, especially integration with my EHR and workflows to improve efficiency? And how will a mix of virtual and in-person visits affect practice revenue and sustainability? Consumers have also expressed concerns about payment for virtual visits as well as privacy and quality of care.

Studies indicated that psychology students may be less stressed during the pandemic than other students. This study compares psychology students and students from other disciplines regarding their mental health, alcohol consumption, and partnerships after the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The study sample consisted of n = 127 psychology students and n = 579 students from other disciplines at the TU Braunschweig in Germany who participated in an online survey in June/July of 2021. To analyze the differences between the psychology students and students from other disciplines after the third wave, we calculated t-tests, Chi2-tests, and U-tests separately for female and male students. Results: Significantly fewer female psychology students were above the cut-off values for clinically relevant depressive symptoms (31.5%;p <.001, Cramer's V =.32) and anxiety symptoms (22.2%;p <.001, Cramer's V =.27) than other female students (depressive symptoms: 66.1%;anxiety symptoms: 41.9 %). The small sample of male psychology students showed similar tendencies. While female psychology students rated their general health and life satisfaction higher than other female students, male psychology students were less concerned about their professional future than their respective counterparts.

The modified (Poly(TY-G)LMWCNTPE) and unmodified (MWCNTPE) electrode materials were characterized through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) approaches. The characterization data confirms the good conducting and electrocatalytic nature with more electrochemical active sites on the Poly(TY-G)LMWCNTPE than MWCNTPE towards the FLFT analysis in the presence of UA. Poly(TY-G)LMWCNTPE easily separates the two drugs (FLFT and UA) even though they both have nearer oxidation peak potential. The electro-catalytic activity of the developed electrode is fast and clear for FLFT electro-oxidation in 0.2 M phosphate buffer (PB) of pH 6.5. The Poly(TY-G)LMWCNTPE offered a well-resolved peak with the highest electro-oxidation peak current at the peak potential of 0.538 V than MWCNTPE. The potential scan rate and oxidation peak growth time studies show the electrode reaction towards FLFT electro-oxidation is continued through a diffusion-controlled step. The variation of concentration of FLFT in the range from 0.2 to 1.5 M (absence of UA) and 3.0 to 8.0 M (presence of UA) provides a good linear relationship with increased peak current and a lower limit of detection (LOD) values of 0.0128 M and 0.0129 M, respectively.

Looking back in history, airborne transimission diseases have caused huge casualties several times. COVID-19 as a typical airborne disease caught our attention and reminded us of the importance of preventing such diseases. Therefore, this study focuses on finding a new way to guard against the spread of these diseases such as COVID-19. This paper studies the dynamic electromechanical response of metal-core piezoelectric fiber/epoxy matrix composites, designed as mass load sensors for virus detection, by numerical modelling. The dynamic electromechanical response is simulated by applying an alternating current (AC) electric field to make the composite vibrate. Furthermore, both concentrated and distributed loads are considered to assess the sensitivity of the biosensor during modelling of the combination of both biomarker and viruses. The design parameters of this sensor, such as the resonant frequency, the position and size of the biomarker, will be studied and optimized as the key values to determine the sensitivity of detection. The novelty of this work is to propose functional composites that can detect the viruses from changes of the output voltage instead of the resonant frequency change using piezoelectric sensor and piezoelectric actuator. The contribution of this detection method will significantly shorten the detection time as it avoids fast Fourier transform (FFT) or discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The outcome of this research offers a reliable numerical model to optimize the design of the proposed biosensor for virus detection, which will contribute to the production of high-performance piezoelectric biosensors in the future.","output":"Design and finite element simulation of metal-core piezoelectric fiber/epoxy matrix composites for virus detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The viral load of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the new coronavirus infection, is becoming increasingly important in clinical and epidemiological contexts Despite this, there are significant complexities in the implementation of viral load quantitative measurement into clinical practice due to the limited approaches to its assessment The aim of this work was to develop an approach for SARS-CoV-2 viral load analysis by the value of sample threshold cycles (Ct) relative to the Ct of the internal control sample obtained in routine PCR diagnostics of the COVID-19, and to use this approach for quantitative monitoring of viral load in patients with first positive SARS-CoV-2 test from the Irkutsk region Materials and methods Using regression models based on the least squares method, an approach to determine the number of copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 1 ml of nasopharyngeal secretion was developed The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed in nasopharyngeal and pharyngeal samples obtained from 1370 patients from Irkutsk and Angarsk with primary diagnosed positive PCR result in the period from July 1 to November 10, 2020 Results A tenfold increase in the average monthly viral load among patients in September-October 2020 was revealed We assume that the change in the epidemiological pattern of the spread of the new coronavirus infection during this period is associated with an increase in the number of contacts in the population due to the school year beginning Higher viral loads are observed in populations at risk for COVID-19 - among healthcare workers and adults/elderly patients Conclusion The development of a standardized quantification of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the nasopharyngeal samples can be a predictive clinical marker and a reliable tool for improving COVID-19 surveillance using the proposed approach to assess average viral load in a local population ? 2021 Acta Biomedica Scientifica All rights reserved","output":"Viral load in COVID-19: Underestimated clinical and epidemiological marker"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The newly emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) continues to infect humans, and no effective treatment has yet been found.

The virus is spontaneously cleared from the mice by 4 weeks postinfection (WPI), a time when remyelination is starting. 2. At 3 WPI total MBP transcripts are decreased by 75% in demyelinating lesions compared to control white matter. Using RNase protection assays andin situ hybridization with probes for particular MBP exons, we detected an increase in MBP transcripts containing exon 2 information, coincident with the earliest histological signs of remyelination. 3. The expression of MBP transcripts containing exon 2 information was first seen clustered in the perinuclear cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes scattered within the lesions. This is reminiscent of the increased levels and perinuclear clustering of MBP transcripts containing exon 2 seen during early developmental myelination. The peak abundance of exon 2-containing transcripts in the lesions was 13-fold that seen in control white matter. At later stages of remyelination, additional forms of MBP transcripts (without exon 2) increased and their distribution was more diffuse. 4.

Currently investigated platform approaches include virally vectored and RNA-based vaccines, as well as DNA vaccines and recombinant protein expression system platforms, each featuring different advantages and challenges. Viral vector-based and DNA vaccines in particular have received a large share of research funding to date. Platform vaccine technologies may feature dual-use potential through informing or enabling pathogen engineering, which may raise the risk for the occurrence of deliberate, anthropogenic biological events. Research on virally vectored vaccines exhibits relatively high dual-use potential for two reasons. First, development of virally vectored vaccines may generate insights of particular dual-use concern such as techniques for circumventing pre-existing anti-vector immunity. Second, while the amount of work on viral vectors for gene therapy exceeds that for vaccine research, work on virally vectored vaccines may increase the number of individuals capable of engineering viruses of particular concern, such as ones closely related to smallpox. Other platform vaccine approaches, such as RNA vaccines, feature relatively little dual-use potential. The biosecurity risk associated with platform advancement may be minimised by focusing preferentially on circumventing anti-vector immunity with non-genetic rather than genetic modifications, using vectors that are not based on viruses pathogenic to humans, or preferential investment into promising RNA-based vaccine approaches. To reduce the risk of anthropogenic pandemics, structures for the governance of biotechnology and life science research with dual-use potential need to be reworked. Scientists outside of the pathogen research community, for instance those who work on viral vectors or oncolytic viruses, need to become more aware of the dual-use risks associated with their research.

BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many non-urgent elective cardiac MRI (CMR) appointments were cancelled to minimise the risk of infection to patients coming to hospital. At the time of the first lockdown, our scanning schedule allowed on average 228 scans/month. Non-urgent elective studies were cancelled from April-June 2020, resulting in 684 scans added to the waiting list. Upon reactivation of our clinical CMR service, we developed a service quality improvement initiative consisting of using a Rapid CMR protocol to reduce scanning time without compromising the tests diagnostic accuracy, increase our scanning capacity and improve efficiency in reducing the backlog of requests. PURPOSE: To demonstrate the increased scanning capacity generated by the adoption of the \\"Rapid CMR\\" protocol. METHODS: The Rapid CMR protocol was implemented in November 2020 to all scans requiring cines, late gadolinium enhancement  adenosine stress (non-stress and stress studies). The protocol was modelled on prior published experiences[1,2]. Patients who underwent these scans with additional imaging (e.g. T2-STIR imaging) were excluded. Data was collected from Nov 2020 to Jan 2021 and compared with the same time period the previous year when the standard protocol was used (cf. Image 1). Data collected included scan duration (time from first to last image), whether the Rapid CMR studies maintained diagnostic quality (yes/no), and the did-not-attend (DNA) rate.

Median scanning time in minutes for non-stress was 29 (IQR 25-34; Rapid) vs 37 (IQR 33-41; standard); (p < 0.001). For stress studies the median scanning time in minutes was 32 (IQR 28-36; Rapid) vs 41 (IQR 29-45; standard; (p < 0.001). The rate of suboptimal imaging due to patient factors (such as breathing or arrhythmia) was similar for each protocol (14.4% Rapid, 20.2% standard; p = 0.04). All Rapid studies were of diagnostic quality (Table 1). Saving c.8 minutes per scan led to an improved scanning time and schedule capacity of 21%. Fewer patients were scanned with the Rapid protocol due to pandemic related issues: patient reluctance to accept appointments (unfilled slots), cleaning measures between patients (on average 5 mins per slot reducing overall capacity), and a higher DNA rate: 15.3% (Rapid) vs 6.5% (standard); p < 0.001. CONCLUSION: The Rapid CMR protocol resulted in a statistically significant reduction in scanning time (-8 min for both stress and non-stress CMRs) increasing our schedule capacity and improving efficiency by 21%, whilst maintaining diagnostic quality. The implementation of the Rapid CMR protocol is a feasible and effective strategy to tackle the backlog of CMR clinical request accumulated during the pandemic.","output":"Implementation of Rapid CMR Protocol in the COVID-19 era: improving scanning efficiency and increasing scanning capacity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Mentorship increases trainee productivity, promotes career satisfaction and reduces burnout. Beginning in 2016, our Medicine-Paediatrics residency program developed and implemented a longitudinal mentorship curriculum among trainees. We report initial experiences with that program and discuss potential future directions. CURRICULUM STRUCTURE AND METHOD OF IMPLEMENTATION: We implemented and adapted a peer mentorship model and expanded it to include guest lectures and workshops centred around 13 core topics. Our expanded model included five longitudinal components: (1) peer mentorship; (2) virtual check-ins with residency leadership; (3) focussed didactics and workshops; (4) small-group dinners highlighting different career paths; and (5) dedicated faculty who pair residents with mentors based on common interests. We compared annual survey results on resident satisfaction with program mentorship, using chi-square and fishers exact tests to assess statistically significant differences pre- (2012C2016) and post-intervention (2016C2020). RESULTS: We analysed 112 responses with annual response rate varying between 41.2% and 100%. Overall satisfaction with mentorship improved from 57.6% to 73.4% (p = .53), satisfaction with emotional support improved from 63.1% to 71.6% (p = .21), and satisfaction with career-specific mentorship improved from 48.5% to 59.5% (p = .70). Residents reported consistently high satisfaction with peer mentorship (77.8%C100%). The percent of residents reporting they had identified a career mentor increased from 60.0% in 2017 to 88.9% in 2019, which was sustained at 90.0% in 2020. CONCLUSION: KEY MESSAGES: Among resident physicians in a single training program, a mix of mentorCmentee dyads, group-based peer mentoring and a structured curriculum has shown promise in improving resident-reported satisfaction with programmatic mentorship. While we attempted to adapt the mentorship curriculum to an online platform with the development of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, reported satisfaction in overall mentorship and emotional support decreased in comparison to the prior year, an important focus for future work.","output":"Implementation and first experiences with a multimodal mentorship curriculum for medicine-paediatrics residents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Demonstrate the feasibility of using the existing sentinel surveillance infrastructure to conduct the second round of the serial cross-sectional sentinel-based population survey. Assess active infection, seroprevalence, and their evolution in the general population across Karnataka. Identify local variations for locally appropriate actions. Additionally, assess the clinical sensitivity of the testing kit used on account of variability of antibody levels in the population. Methods The cross-sectional study of 41,228 participants across 290 healthcare facilities in all 30 districts of Karnataka was done among three groups of participants (low, moderate, and high-risk). The geographical spread was sufficient to capture local variations. Consenting participants were subjected to real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, and antibody (IgG) testing. Clinical sensitivity was assessed by conducting a longitudinal study among participants identified as COVID-19 positive in the first survey round. Results Overall weighted adjusted seroprevalence of IgG was 15.6% (95% CI: 14.9C16.3), crude IgG prevalence was 15.0% and crude active infection was 0.5%. Statewide infection fatality rate (IFR) was estimated as 0.11%, and COVID-19 burden estimated between 26.1 to 37.7% (at 90% confidence). Further, Cases-to-infections ratio (CIR) varied 3-35 across units and IFR varied 0.04C0.50% across units. Clinical sensitivity of the IgG ELISA test kit was estimated as 38.9%. Conclusion We demonstrated the feasibility and simplicity of sentinel-based population survey in measuring variations in subnational and local data, useful for locally appropriate actions in different locations. The sentinel-based population survey thus helped identify districts that needed better testing, reporting, and clinical management. The state was far from attaining natural immunity during the survey and hence must step up vaccination coverage and enforce public health measures to prevent the spread of COVD-19.","output":"Second round statewide sentinel-based population survey for estimation of the burden of active infection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the general population of Karnataka, India, during January-February 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been previously reported that macrophages may be involved in diabetic nephropathy (DN) development.

Moreover, BTK knockout mice were used to establish a diabetic model for further research. The results demonstrated that BTK was activated in the kidneys of patients with DN and was associated with the progression of proteinuria, creatinine levels, estimated glomerular filtration rate and pathological changes in the kidneys of patients with DN. Furthermore, BTK knockout was observed to reduce urinary protein excretion, alleviate renal injury and decrease renal inflammation in diabetic mice. This protection may be attributed to BTK-induced suppression of the activation of the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome.

For a successful eradication campaign, molecular diagnostic tools are preferred for their specificity, efficacy and robustness to compliment prophylactic measures and surveillance methods. However, molecular tools have a few limitations including, costly equipment, multi-step template preparation protocols, target amplification and analysis that restrict their use to the sophisticated laboratory settings. As reverse transcription-loop mediated isothermal amplification assay (RT-LAMP) has such an intrinsic potential for point of care diagnosis, this study focused on the genetic detection of causative PPR virus (PPRV) in field conditions. It involves the use of a sample buffer that can precipitate out virus envelope and capsid proteins through ammonium sulphate precipitation and exposes viral RNA, present in the clinical sample, to the LAMP reaction mixture. RESULTS The test was evaluated using 11 PPRV cultures, and a total of 46 nasal swabs (n = 32 collected in the field outbreaks, n = 14 collected from experimentally inoculated animals). The RT-LAMP was compared with the reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) for its relative specificity, sensitivity and robustness. RT-LAMP detected PPRV in all PPRV cultures in or less than 30 min. Its detection limit was of 0.0001TCID50 (tissue culture infective dose-50) per ml with 10-fold higher sensitivity than that of RT-PCR. In 59.4% of the field samples, RT-LAMP detected PPRV within 35-55 min. The analytical sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP were equivalent to that of the RT-qPCR. The time of detection of PPRV decreased by at least forty minutes or 3-4 h in case of in the RT-LAMP as compared with the RT-qPCR and the RT-PCR, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The sensitive and specific RT-LAMP test developed in this study targeting a small fragment of the N gene of PPRV is a rapid, reliable and applicable molecular diagnostic test of choice under the field conditions. RT-LAMP requiring minimal training offers a very useful tool for PPR diagnosis especially during the \\"Global PPR Eradication Campaign\\".","output":"Genetic detection of peste des petits ruminants virus under field conditions: a step forward towards disease eradication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Information disclosure is a top priority for official responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. The timely and standardized information published by authorities as a response to the crisis can better inform the public and enable better preparations for the pandemic; however, there is limited evidence of any systematic analyses of the disclosed epidemic information. This in turn has important implications for risk communication. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe and compare the officially released content regarding local epidemic situations as well as analyze the characteristics of information disclosure through local communication in major cities in China. METHODS: The 31 capital cities in mainland China were included in this city-level observational study. Data were retrieved from local municipalities and health commission websites as of March 18, 2020. A checklist was employed as a rapid qualitative assessment tool to analyze the information disclosure performance of each city. Descriptive analyses and data visualizations were produced to present and compare the comparative performances of the cities. RESULTS: In total, 29 of 31 cities (93.5%) established specific COVID-19 webpages to disclose information. Among them, 12 of the city webpages were added to their corresponding municipal websites. A majority of the cities (21/31, 67.7%) published their first cases of infection in a timely manner on the actual day of confirmation. Regarding the information disclosures highlighted on the websites, news updates from local media or press briefings were the most prevalent (28/29, 96.6%), followed by epidemic surveillance (25/29, 86.2%), and advice for the public (25/29, 86.2%). Clarifications of misinformation and frequently asked questions were largely overlooked as only 2 cities provided this valuable information. The median daily update frequency of epidemic surveillance summaries was 1.2 times per day (IQR 1.0-1.3 times), and the majority of these summaries (18/25, 72.0%) also provided detailed information regarding confirmed cases. The reporting of key indicators in the epidemic surveillance summaries, as well as critical facts included in the confirmed case reports, varied substantially between cities. In general, the best performance in terms of timely reporting and the transparency of information disclosures were observed in the municipalities directly administered by the central government compared to the other cities. CONCLUSIONS: Timely and effective efforts to disclose information related to the COVID-19 epidemic have been made in major cities in China. Continued improvements to local authority reporting will contribute to more effective public communication and efficient public health research responses. The development of protocols and the standardization of epidemic message templates-as well as the use of uniform operating procedures to provide regular information updates-should be prioritized to ensure a coordinated national response.","output":"Information Disclosure During the COVID-19 Epidemic in China: City-Level Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, SARS-CoV-2 virus is an emerging pathogen that has posed a serious threat to public health worldwide. However, no agents have been approved to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections to date, underscoring the great need for effective and practical therapies for SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.

Public health interventions to minimize the spread of the virus have had the unintended consequences of worsening social isolation, financial stress, and unemployment. Results of early research efforts assessing the impact of these interventions on the mental health of older adults have been mixed. Available findings suggest that a subset of community-dwelling older adults have been less negatively impacted than younger adults, while people of color, the poor, residents of nursing homes and other communal living environments, and those living with dementia and their caregivers are more likely to suffer from COVID-related health problems.

Timely and accurate diagnosis, prompt provision of individualized care using both pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic interventions, adoption of new technologies that permit care to be provided safely at a distance and which allow for virtual social interactions, coupled with ongoing advocacy for policy changes that address significant health care disparities and provide older adults continued access to health care and relief from financial hardship, will help older adults remaining as healthy as possible during the pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 Associated Suicidal Ideation in Older Adults: Two Case Reports With a Review of the Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Over the past decades, there has been an increase in overweight and obesity in women of childbearing age, as well as the general population. Overweight and obesity are related to a later, increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Increasing weight between pregnancies has a negative impact on the development of the fetus in a subsequent pregnancy. It is also related to long-term obesity and overweight for the woman. Accordingly, weight control in women of the childbearing age is important for both women and their offspring. Information and communication technology (ICT) has become an integrated part of many peoples' lives, and it has the potential to prevent disease. In this systematic review, we summarize the evidence from randomized controlled trials to compare effects of different ICT-based interventions to support postpartum women to achieve weight loss. METHODS A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane, searching on terms, such as postpartum, weight loss, telemedicine, and randomized controlled trials. Two independent researchers undertook study selection and data extraction. Results were reported narratively. The systematic review only included studies that were randomized controlled trials. RESULTS Eight studies were included in the systematic review. All of them were characterized by applying one or more ICT components to assist postpartum women in weight control, and had weight loss as an outcome measure. A significant difference was found in weight loss between control group and intervention group in the majority of the studies. However, five of the studies had a relatively short follow-up period (40 days to 16 weeks), six of the studies had a relatively small sample size (18 to 66 women), and half of the studies indicated challenges with adherence to the interventions over time. CONCLUSION ICT-based interventions can support postpartum women to achieve a healthy lifestyle and weight control.

However, due to limited contact, adequate rehabilitation is difficult to provide for quarantined patients. Telerehabilitation technology could be a solution; however, issues specific to COVID-19 should be taken into consideration, such as strict quarantine and respiratory symptoms, as well as accessibility to deal with rapid increases in need due to the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and to investigate the feasibility of a telerehabilitation system for patients who are quarantined due to COVID-19 by combining existing commercial devices and computer applications. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team has identified the requirements for a telerehabilitation system for COVID-19 and developed the system to satisfy those requirements. In the subsequent feasibility study, patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (N=10; mean age 60 years, SD 18 years) were included. A single session of telerehabilitation consisted of stretching exercises, a 15-minute exercise program, and a video exercise program conducted under real-time guidance by a physical therapist through a video call. The system included a tablet computer, a pulse oximeter, videoconferencing software, and remote control software. The feasibility of the system was evaluated using the Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQ; 14 items) and an additional questionnaire on the telerehabilitation system (5 items). Each item was rated from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. RESULTS: The telerehabilitation system was developed by combining existing devices and applications, including a pulse oximeter and remote control mechanism, to achieve user-friendliness, affordability, and safety, which were determined as the system requirements. In the feasibility study, 9 out of 10 patients were able to use the telerehabilitation system without any on-site help. On the TSQ, the mean score for each item was 4.7 (SD 0.7), and in the additional items regarding telerehabilitation, the mean score for each item was 4.3 (SD 1.0).

METHODS: Individuals with MM and monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) with concurrent DECT and BM biopsy between May 2018 and July 2020 were included in this retrospective observational study. Two pathologists and three radiologists reported BM infiltration and presence of osteolytic bone lesions, respectively. Bone mineral density (BMD) was quantified CT-based by a CE-certified software. Automated spine segmentation was implemented by a pre-trained convolutional neural network. The non-fatty portion of BM was defined as voxels > 0 HU in VNCa. For statistical assessment, multivariate regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) were conducted. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (mean age 65  12 years; 18 female) were evaluated. The non-fatty portion of BM significantly predicted BM infiltration after adjusting for the covariable BMD (p = 0.007, r = 0.46). A non-fatty portion of BM > 0.93% could anticipate osteolytic lesions and the clinical diagnosis of MM with an area under the ROC curve of 0.70 [0.49C0.90] and 0.71 [0.54C0.89], respectively. Our approach identified MM-patients without osteolytic lesions on conventional CT with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.63 and 0.71, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Automated, AI-supported attenuation assessment of the spine in DECT VNCa is feasible to predict BM infiltration in MM. Further, the proposed method might allow for pre-selecting patients with higher pre-test probability of osteolytic bone lesions and support the clinical diagnosis of MM without pathognomonic lesions on conventional CT.

The brain's response to anesthetic drugs is often measured clinically by processed electroencephalogram (EEG) indices. Thus, we developed a processed EEG-based measure of the brain's resistance to volatile anesthetics and hypothesized that low scores on it would be associated with postoperative delirium risk. METHODS We defined the Duke Anesthesia Resistance Scale (DARS) as the average bispectral index (BIS) divided by the quantity (2.5 minus the average age-adjusted end-tidal minimum alveolar concentration [aaMAC] inhaled anesthetic fraction). The relationship between DARS and postoperative delirium was analyzed in 139 older surgical patients (age 65) from Duke University Medical Center (n = 69) and Mt Sinai Medical Center (n = 70). Delirium was assessed by geriatrician interview at Duke, and by research staff utilizing the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) instrument at Mt Sinai. We examined the relationship between DARS and delirium and used the Youden index to identify an optimal low DARS threshold (for delirium risk), and its associated 95% bootstrap confidence bounds. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the relationship between low DARS and delirium risk. RESULTS The relationship between DARS and delirium risk was nonlinear, with higher delirium risk at low DARS scores. A DARS threshold of 28.755 maximized the Youden index for the association between low DARS and delirium, with bootstrap 95% confidence bounds of 26.18 and 29.80. A low DARS (<28.755) was associated with increased delirium risk in multivariable models adjusting for site (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval {CI}] = 4.30 [1.89-10.01]; P = .001), or site-plus-patient risk factors (OR [95% CI] = 3.79 [1.63-9.10]; P = .003). These associations with postoperative delirium risk remained significant when using the 95% bootstrap confidence bounds for the low DARS threshold (P < .05 for all). Further, a low DARS (<28.755) was associated with delirium risk after accounting for opioid, midazolam, propofol, phenylephrine, and ketamine dosage as well as site (OR [95% CI] = 4.21 [1.80-10.16]; P = .002). This association between low DARS and postoperative delirium risk after controlling for these other medications remained significant (P < .05) when using either the lower or the upper 95% bootstrap confidence bounds for the low DARS threshold. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate that an intraoperative processed EEG-based measure of lower brain anesthetic resistance (ie, low DARS) is independently associated with increased postoperative delirium risk in older surgical patients.","output":"A Processed Electroencephalogram-Based Brain Anesthetic Resistance Index Is Associated With Postoperative Delirium in Older Adults: A Dual Center Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Die Mikrobiologie und Infektionsepidemiologie umfasst die Laboratoriumsdiagnostik mikrobiell bedingter Erkrankungen und die Aufkl?rung ihrer epidemiologischen Zusammenh?nge und Ursachen.

The posterior distribution of model parameters and the transition matrices are estimated by a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that also provides predictions and allows us to compute the reproduction number [Formula: see text]. All estimates and predictions are endowed with an accuracy measure obtained thanks to the Bayesian approach. We present results concerning data collected during the first wave of the pandemic in Italy and Lombardy and study the effect of nonpharmaceutical interventions. Suitable discrepancy measures defined to check and compare models show that the Dirichlet\\\\multinomial model has an adequate fit and provides good predictive performance in particular for H and ICU patients.","output":"A multivariate statistical approach to predict COVID\\\\19 count data with epidemiological interpretation and uncertainty quantification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La pandemia por SARS-CoV-2 ha causado un gran impacto desde el punto de vista sanitario, econmico y social.

The trachea could not be intubated with a videolaryngoscope, and successful intubation was achieved with a laryngeal mask airway device (LMAD) and a fibreoptic bronchoscope (FOB). CLINICAL FEATURES A 65-yr-old male developed sudden tetraplegia after a fall. Initial attempts at securing his airway were unsuccessful with a videolaryngoscope, but success was achieved with a LMAD and a FOB. Diagnostic imaging revealed no cervical spine fracture but demonstrated severe airway distortion from DISH and a spinal cord contusion accounting for his tetraplegia. Subcutaneous neck emphysema likely secondary to difficult intubation was also identified, but it did not result in additional morbidity. CONCLUSIONS Although often considered to be a benign entity, DISH can predispose patients to catastrophic cervical injury and difficult airway management. Careful review of plain radiographs in the spinal cord injury patient may assist with appropriate selection of airway interventions. The videolaryngoscope is useful for difficult airways, but its effectiveness may be compromised with an anteriorly displaced airway in combination with restricted cervical movement and limited oropharyngeal airspace.","output":"Failed videolaryngoscope intubation in a patient with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and spinal cord injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Driven by an increasing number of connected medical devices, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), as an application of Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare, is developed to help collect, analyze and transmit medical data During the outbreak of pandemic like COVID-19, IoMT can be useful to monitor the status of patients and detect main symptoms remotely, by using various smart sensors However, due to the lack of emotional care in current IoMT, it is still a challenge to reach an efficient medical process Especially under COVID-19, there is a need to monitor emotion status among particular people like elderly In this work, we propose an emotion-aware healthcare monitoring system in IoMT, based on brainwaves With the fast development of EEG (electroencephalography) sensors in current headsets and some devices, brainwave-based emotion detection becomes feasible The IoMT devices are used to capture the brainwaves of a patient in a scenario of smart home Also, our system involves the analysis of touch behavior as the second layer to enhance the brainwave-based emotion recognition In the user study with 60 participants, the results indicate the viability and effectiveness of our approach in detecting emotion like comfortable and uncomfortable, which can complement existing emotion-aware healthcare applications and mechanisms IEEE","output":"Hybrid Emotion-aware Monitoring System based on Brainwaves for Internet of Medical Things"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary fibrosis arises from the repeated epithelial mild injuries and insufficient repair lead to over activation of fibroblasts and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix, which result in a mechanical stretched niche. However, increasing mechanical stress likely exists before the establishment of fibrosis since early micro injuries increase local vascular permeability and prompt cytoskeletal remodeling which alter cellular mechanical forces. It is noteworthy that COVID-19 patients with severe hypoxemia will receive mechanical ventilation as supportive treatment and subsequent pathology studies indicate lung fibrosis pattern. At advanced stages, mechanical stress originates mainly from the stiff matrix since boundaries between stiff and compliant parts of the tissue could generate mechanical stress. Therefore, mechanical stress has a significant role in the whole development process of pulmonary fibrosis. The alveoli are covered by abundant capillaries and function as the main gas exchange unit. Constantly subject to variety of damages, the alveolar epithelium injuries were recently recognized to play a vital role in the onset and development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In this review, we summarize the literature regarding the effects of mechanical stress on the fundamental cells constituting the alveoli in the process of pulmonary fibrosis, particularly on epithelial cells, capillary endothelial cells, fibroblasts, mast cells, macrophages and stem cells.

Improved strategies for real-time tracking and estimation of population-level behavior regarding vaccinations are needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether online search trends for COIVD-19 and influenza mirror vaccination rates. State-level weekly fraction of online searches for top vaccination-related search terms and CDC vaccination data were obtained from June 1, 2020, to May 31, 2021. Next, trends in online search and vaccination data for COVID-19 and influenza were analyzed for visual and quantitative correlation patterns using Spearmans rank correlation analysis. Online searches in the US for COVID-19 vaccinations increased 2.71-fold (95% CI: 1.98-3.45) in the 4 weeks after the FDA emergency authorization compared to the precedent 4 weeks. In March-April 2021, US online searches reached a plateau that was followed by a decline of 83.3% (95% CI: 31.2%-135.3%) until May 31, 2021. The timing of peaks in online searches varied across US states. Online searches were strongly correlated with vaccination rates (r=0.71, 95% CI: 0.45 - 0.87), preceding actual reported vaccination rates in 44 of 51 states. Online search trends preceded vaccination trends by a median of 3.0 weeks (95% CI: 2.0-4.0 weeks) across all states. For influenza vaccination searches, seasonal peaks in September-October between 2016-2020 were noted. Influenza search trends highly correlated with the timing of actual vaccinations for the 2019-2020 (r=0.82, 95% CI: 0.64 C 0.93) and 2020-2021 season (r=0.91, 95% CI: 0.78 C 0.97). Search trends and real-world vaccination rates are highly correlated.

Adenovirus infections can result in severe complications in some cases, such as in adenovirus type 11 infection in immunocompromised patients. However, effective treatment methods for adenovirus infections are currently unavailable. This prompted the search for antiviral agents effective against adenovirus infections. In the present study, adenovirus E1A was targeted by RNA interference (RNAi) using synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in an attempt to inhibit viral replication, since adenovirus E1A proteins are known to be involved in the transcriptional activation of the viral and cellular genes necessary for controlling the cell cycle and viral replication. The results indicated that the siRNAs effectively reduced the amount of adenovirus E1A mRNA and the levels of replicative intermediates. Additionally, siRNA-mediated gene silencing inhibited adenovirus replication by suppressing the E1A mRNA.

These bacteria are endophytic and nonculturable, which makes experimental approaches challenging and highlights the need for bioinformatic analysis in advancing our understanding about Liberibacter pathogenesis. Here, we performed an in-depth comparative phylogenomic analysis of the Liberibacter pathogens and their free-living, nonpathogenic, ancestral species, aiming to identify major genomic changes and determinants associated with their evolutionary transitions in living habitats and pathogenicity. Using gene neighborhood analysis and phylogenetic classification, we systematically uncovered, annotated, and classified all prophage loci into four types, including one previously unrecognized group. We showed that these prophages originated through independent gene transfers at different evolutionary stages of Liberibacter and only the SC-type prophage was associated with the emergence of the pathogens. Using ortholog clustering, we vigorously identified two additional sets of genomic genes, which were either lost or gained in the ancestor of the pathogens. Consistent with the habitat change, the lost genes were enriched for biosynthesis of cellular building blocks. Importantly, among the gained genes, we uncovered several previously unrecognized toxins, including new toxins homologous to the EspG/VirA effectors, a YdjM phospholipase toxin, and a secreted endonuclease/exonuclease/phosphatase (EEP) protein. Our results substantially extend the knowledge of the evolutionary events and potential determinants leading to the emergence of endophytic, pathogenic Liberibacter species, which will facilitate the design of functional experiments and the development of new methods for detection and blockage of these pathogens. IMPORTANCE Liberibacter pathogens are associated with several severe crop diseases, including citrus Huanglongbing, the most destructive disease to the citrus industry. Currently, no effective cure or treatments are available, and no resistant citrus variety has been found. The fact that these obligate endophytic pathogens are not culturable has made it extremely challenging to experimentally uncover the genes/proteins important to Liberibacter pathogenesis. Further, earlier bioinformatics studies failed to identify key genomic determinants, such as toxins and effector proteins, that underlie the pathogenicity of the bacteria. In this study, an in-depth comparative genomic analysis of Liberibacter pathogens along with their ancestral nonpathogenic species identified the prophage loci and several novel toxins that are evolutionarily associated with the emergence of the pathogens. These results shed new light on the disease mechanism of Liberibacter pathogens and will facilitate the development of new detection and blockage methods targeting the toxins.","output":"Comparative Phylogenomic Analysis Reveals Evolutionary Genomic Changes and Novel Toxin Families in Endophytic Liberibacter Pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Azithromycin (AZ), a broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic, is being investigated in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHODS: We described a COVID-19 symptom to isolation cascade and barriers among symptomatic persons who tested polymerase chain reaction positive for severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at a low-barrier testing site serving a low-income Latinx community in San Francisco. Steps in the cascade are defined as days from symptom onset to test, test to result, and result to counseling on self-isolation. We examined SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold (Ct) values to assess the likelihood of infectiousness on the day of testing and during missed isolation days. RESULTS: Among 145 persons, 97% were Latinx and 81% had an income of <$50( )000. The median time from symptom onset to isolation (interquartile range [IQR]) was 7 (5C10) days, leaving a median (IQR) of 3 (0C6) days of isolation. Eighty-three percent had moderate to high levels of virus (Ct <33), but by disclosure 23% were out of their isolation period. The longest intervals were symptom onset to test (median [IQR], 4 [2C9] days) and test to results notification (median [IQR], 3 [2C4] days). Access to a test site was the most common barrier to testing, and food and income loss was the most common barrier to isolation. CONCLUSIONS: Over half of the 10-day isolation period passed by the time of disclosure, and over a fifth of people were likely outside the window of infectiousness by the time they received results.

The international rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has provided varying degrees of protection and enabled the understanding of vaccine efficacy and safety. The immune response to COVID-19 vaccines is lower in most patients with immune-mediated kidney diseases; either related to immunosuppression or to co-morbidities and complications caused by the underlying disease. Humoral vaccine response, measured by the presence of antibodies, is impaired or absent in patients receiving rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), higher doses of glucocorticoids and likely other immunosuppressants, such as cyclophosphamide. Timing between the use of these agents and administration of vaccines associate with the level of immune response: with rituximab, vaccine response can only be expected once B cells start to recover and patients with transient discontinuation of MMF mount a humoral response more frequently. The emergence of new COVID-19 variants and waning of vaccine induced immunity highlight the value of booster dose and need to develop mutant proof vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines are safe, exhibiting a very low risk of de novo or relapsing immune-mediated kidney disease. Population-based studies will determine whether this is causal or co-incidental.

We investigated whether the creation of an intestinal stenosis could alter the severity of the expected Crohn-like ileitis, in a Crohn's disease animal model, the TNFare/+ mouse. METHODS Thirty-six, 6-weeks-old TNFare/+ mice, were divided into 3 intervention groups: triple suture, single suture and sham. In the terminal ileum, in the first group, a triple suture stenosis was created, whereas, in the second, a loose suture was placed. Same triple-suture stenosis was performed on twelve wild type mice. All animals were sacrificed at 6 weeks post-operatively and the ileum parts were evaluated histopathologically. A summative total ileitis score was applied in each sample using a bespoke semiquantitative histological scoring system for the Crohn-like changes. RESULTS The triple suture stenosis induced significant muscular hypertrophy proximal to interventional site which was more prominent in TNFare/+ than wild type mice. In triple suture group, the total ileitis score was significantly increased proximal to the intervention as compared to the single suture (P: 0.004) and the sham groups (P: 0.013).

Despite the high number of patients treated worldwide, data on respiratory mechanics are currently scarce and the optimal setting of MV remains to be defined. This scoping review aims to provide an overview of available data about respiratory mechanics, gas exchange and MV settings in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) for COVID-19-associated acute respiratory failure, and to identify knowledge gaps. MAIN TEXT: PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE databases were searched from inception to October 30, 2020 for studies providing at least one ventilatory parameter collected within 24 h from the ICU admission. The quality of the studies was independently assessed using the NewcastleCOttawa Quality Assessment Form for Cohort Studies. A total of 26 studies were included for a total of 14,075 patients. At ICU admission, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) values ranged from 9 to 16.5 cm of water (cmH(2)O), suggesting that high levels of PEEP were commonly used for setting MV for these patients. Patients with COVID-19 are severely hypoxemic at ICU admission and show a median ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) ranging from 102 to 198 mmHg. Static respiratory system compliance (Crs) values at ICU admission were highly heterogenous, ranging between 24 and 49 ml/cmH(2)O. Prone positioning and neuromuscular blocking agents were widely used, ranging from 17 to 81 and 22 to 88%, respectively; both rates were higher than previously reported in patients with classical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). CONCLUSIONS: Available data show that, in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19, respiratory mechanics and MV settings within 24 h from ICU admission are heterogeneous but similar to those reported for classical ARDS.

While previous research has mostly focused on the\\"number of mentions\\"of scientific research on social media, the current study applies\\"topic networks\\"to measure public attention to scientific research on Twitter. Topic networks are the networks of co-occurring author keywords in scholarly publications and networks of co-occurring hashtags in the tweets mentioning those scholarly publications. This study investigates which topics in opioid scholarly publications have received public attention on Twitter. Additionally, it investigates whether the topic networks generated from the publications tweeted by all accounts (bot and non-bot accounts) differ from those generated by non-bot accounts. Our analysis is based on a set of opioid scholarly publications from 2011 to 2019 and the tweets associated with them. We use co-occurrence network analysis to generate topic networks. Results indicated that Twitter users have mostly used generic terms to discuss opioid publications, such as\\"Opioid,\\"\\"Pain,\\"\\"Addiction,\\"\\"Treatment,\\"\\"Analgesics,\\"\\"Abuse,\\"\\"Overdose,\\"and\\"Disorders.\\"Results confirm that topic networks provide a legitimate method to visualize public discussions of health-related scholarly publications and how Twitter users discuss health-related scientific research differently from the scientific community. There was a substantial overlap between the topic networks based on the tweets by all accounts and non-bot accounts.

Neuroprotective therapies have been implemented to stabilize, prevent, or reduce brain lesions, thus improving neurological outcomes and survival rates. Hypothermia is the most effective approach, mainly attributed to the reduction in cellular metabolic activity. Whole-body cooling is currently implemented by healthcare professionals; however, adverse events are frequent, limiting the potential benefits of therapeutic hypothermia. Therefore, selective methods have been developed to reduce adverse events while delivering neuroprotection. Nasopharyngeal approaches are the safest and most effective methods currently considered. Our primary objective was to determine the effects of a novel nasopharyngeal catheter on the brain temperature of pigs. METHODS: In this prospective, non-randomized, interventional experimental trial, 10 crossbred pigs underwent nasopharyngeal cooling for 60 min followed by 15 min of rewarming. Nasopharyngeal catheters were inserted into the left nostril and properly positioned at the nasopharyngeal cavity. RESULTS: Nasopharyngeal cooling was associated with a decrease in brain temperature, which was more significant in the left cerebral hemisphere (p = 0.01). There was a reduction of 1.47  0.86 C in the first 5 min (p < 0.001), 2.45  1.03 C within 10 min (p < 0.001), and 4.45  1.36 C after 1 h (p < 0.001). The brain-core gradient was 4.57  0.87 C (p < 0.001). Rectal, esophageal, and pulmonary artery temperatures and brain and systemic hemodynamic parameters, remained stable during the procedure. Following brain cooling, values of oxygen partial pressure in brain tissue significantly decreased. No mucosal lesions were detected during nasal, pharyngeal, or oral inspection after nasopharyngeal catheter removal. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a novel nasopharyngeal cooling catheter effectively induced and maintained exclusive brain cooling when combined with effective counter-warming methods. Exclusive brain cooling was safe with no device-related local or systemic complications and may be desired in selected patient populations.","output":"Inducing Brain Cooling Without Core Temperature Reduction in Pigs Using a Novel Nasopharyngeal Method: An Effectiveness and Safety Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To examine whether patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) demonstrated well-defined clinical features distinct from other febrile outpatients, given the difficulties of seeing acute care visits during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic and the risks associated with both over- and underdiagnosis of MIS-C. STUDY DESIGN: This case-controlled study compared patients diagnosed with and treated for MIS-C at a large urban children's hospital with patients evaluated for fever at outpatient acute care visits during the peak period of MIS-C. Symptomatology and available objective data were extracted. Comparisons were performed using t tests with corrections for multiple comparisons, and multivariable logistic regression to obtain ORs. RESULTS: We identified 44 patients with MIS-C between April 16 and June 10, 2020. During the same period, 181 pediatric patients were evaluated for febrile illnesses in participating outpatient clinics. Patients with MIS-C reported greater median maximum reported temperature height (40C vs 38.9, P < .0001), and increased frequency of abdominal pain (OR 12.5, 95% CI [1.65-33.24]), neck pain (536.5, [2.23-129,029]), conjunctivitis (31.3, [4.6-212.8]), oral mucosal irritation (11.8, [1.4-99.4]), extremity swelling or rash (99.9, [5-1960]), and generalized rash (7.42, [1.6-33.2]).

This study is an evaluation of the use of PC during the current coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic at a single hospital. METHODS Fifty patients with AC were admitted as of the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey through June 2020. Patients with pancreatitis, cholangitis, and/or incomplete data were excluded from the study. Data of the remaining 36 patients included in the study were recorded and a descriptive statistical analysis was performed. The patients were divided into three groups: PC (n=14), only conservative treatment with antibiotherapy (OC) (n=14), and LC (n=8). The findings were compared with a group of 70 similar patients from the pre-pandemic period. RESULTS The mean age of the pandemic period patients was 53 years (range: 26-78 years). The female/male ratio was 1.11. PC was preferred in eight (11%) patients in the same period of the previous year, whereas 14 (39%) patients underwent PC in the pandemic period. Four of the 36 pandemic patients were positive for COVID-19, including one member of the PC group. There was one (7.1%) mortality in the pandemic-period PC group due to cardiac arrest. The length of hospital stay between the groups based on the type of treatment was not statistically significant.

Tracheostomy is not recommended by current guidelines as it is considered a super-spreading event due to aerosolization that unduly risks healthcare workers. Methods Patients with severe COVID-19 that were on mechanical ventilation  5 days were evaluated for percutaneous dilational tracheostomy. We developed a novel percutaneous tracheostomy technique that placed the bronchoscope alongside the endotracheal tube, not inside it. This improved visualization during the procedure and continued standard mechanical ventilation after positioning the inflated endotracheal tube cuff in the distal trachea. This technique offers a significant mitigation for the risk of virus aerosolization during the procedure. Results From March 10 to April 15, 2020, 270 patients with COVID-19 required invasive mechanical ventilation at New York University Langone Health Manhattans campus of which 98 patients underwent percutaneous dilational tracheostomy. The mean time from intubation to the procedure was 10.6 days (SD 5 days). Currently, thirty-two (33%) patients do not require mechanical ventilatory support, 19 (19%) have their tracheostomy tube downsized and 8 (8%) were decannulated. Forty (41%) patients remain on full ventilator support, while 19 (19%) are weaning from mechanical ventilation. Seven (7%) died as result of respiratory and multiorgan failure. Tracheostomy related bleeding was the most common complication (5 patients). None of health care providers have developed symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19.

Results showed that PA significantly predicted psychological well-being, with no significant difference evident in psychological well-being dependent on whether PA was nature or non-nature-based. Nature-based PA was a stronger predictor of intrinsic motivation compared to non-nature-based PA, and intrinsic motivation was positively associated with psychological well-being. In contrast, non-nature-based PA was a stronger predictor of introjected regulation compared to nature-based PA, which was negatively associated with psychological well-being. Overall, these findings suggest that (1) weekly PA was associated with increased psychological well-being during the lockdown, and (2) nature-based PA may foster psychological well-being via effects on motivation.

METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted using a thematic analysis approach. Fifteen older adults aged 60 years and above who lived in a community-based setting of Shiraz, Iran were selected based on purposive sampling. The data were collected using semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: The findings indicated two themes, namely dualization of common challenges and fitness with limitations, and nine sub-themes, which showed the experiences of older adults regarding the main theme of facing the double jeopardy of the COVID-19 pandemic and driving cessation. DISCUSSION: Facing the double jeopardy created unique challenges for older adults, as the combined adverse effects of the two sources simultaneously put them at a greater risk. This double jeopardy endangered the health of older adults in various dimensions. This can be the beginning of a new era in older adults' life and care.

We aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on cognitive functions of patients admitted to the COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit of the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 87 patients admitted to the COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit from March 27th to June 20th 2020 were included. Patients underwent Mini Mental State Evaluation (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Data were divided in 4 groups according to the respiratory assistance in the acute phase: Group1 (orotracheal intubation), Group2 (non-invasive ventilation using Biphasic Positive Airway Pressure), Group3 (Venturi Masks), Group4 (no oxygen therapy). Follow-ups were performed at one month after home-discharge. RESULTS: Out of the 87 patients (62 Male, mean age 67.23  12.89 years), 80% had neuropsychological deficits (MoCA and MMSE) and 40% showed mild-to-moderate depression. Group1 had higher scores than Group3 for visuospatial/executive functions (p = 0.016), naming (p = 0.024), short- and long-term memory (p = 0.010, p = 0.005), abstraction (p = 0.024), and orientation (p = 0.034).

CONCLUSION: Patients with severe functional impairments had important cognitive and emotional deficits which might have been influenced by the choice of ventilatory therapy, but mostly appeared to be related to aging, independently of FIM scores. These findings should be integrated for correct neuropsychiatric assistance of COVID-19 patients in the subacute phase of the disease, and show the need for long-term psychological support and treatment of post-COVID-19 patients.","output":"COVID-19 cognitive deficits after respiratory assistance in the subacute phase: A COVID-rehabilitation unit experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Understanding food insecurity and its health consequences is important for identifying strategies to best target support for individuals and communities.

the seventh of the coronavirus family viruses known to cause human disease, little is known about potential symptoms and syndromes secondary to the compromise of the central and peripheral nervous systems. We reviewed neurological manifestations due to the new coronavirus, thus far published in the literature, as well as guidelines issued by sub-specialties in Neurology, to tackle the disease. Methods: we searched medical databases, such as PubMed, PubMed Central, LILACS and Google scholar for papers (case reports, short letters, case series, etc) describing neurological symptoms in patients with confirmed or suspect COVID-19 diagnosis and also searched webpages of associations and organizations that deal with neurological disorders. Results: we describe briefly each article considered for this review. Forty-one papers were found associating neurological conditions and COVID-19. Cases are divided by disease groups and, within each disease group, results are listed in chronological order or publication date. We also discuss briefly recommendations for neurological patients, according to disease group. Conclusion: Although there is evidence of neurological manifestations with previous coronaviruses, COVID-19 is assuring a volume of published papers not seen before for other coronavirus infections. Most neurological cases are not life-threatening, but 10 to 20% of cases will require hospitalization and are in risk for sequelae and death.

There is a great scientific community effort to obtain a therapy capable of reaching the multiple affected organs in order to contribute for tissue repair and regeneration. In this regard, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as potential candidates concerning the promotion of beneficial actions at different stages of COVID-19. MSCs are promising due to the observed therapeutic effects in respiratory preclinical models, as well as in cardiac, vascular, renal and nervous system models. Their immunomodulatory properties and secretion of paracrine mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and extracellular vesicles allow for long range tissue modulation and, particularly, blood-brain barrier crossing. This review focuses on SARS-CoV-2 impact to lungs, kidneys, heart, vasculature and central nervous system while discussing promising MSC's therapeutic mechanisms in each tissue.

Vaccination status is monitored through a service-wide immunization registry. Active Duty and Reserve (military) CG members are required to report any new positive test for COVID-19 to a centralized database. MethodsBetween May and August 2021, vaccination effectiveness (VE) against any new report of COVID-19 was calculated according to standard formulas, using registry immunization status of cases and monthly mid-point vaccine coverage data. CG members recorded as fully vaccinated with a two-dose vaccine were compared with those with any other vaccine status. Sub-analyses were also conducted according to geographic area (Atlantic vs Pacific), age, and type of vaccine received. ResultsEffectiveness of full vaccination reached a peak of 89.0% in June, then declined over the rest of the study period to 62.7% in August. In July and August, steeper declines in VE were seen in the Atlantic region. The rate of breakthrough infections remained under 1% in two-dose vaccine recipients, and did not differ between those who received the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines. No hospitalizations or deaths due to COVID-19 disease were recorded in fully vaccinated Coast Guard members. ConclusionCoincident with the national spread of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, overall vaccine effectiveness among CG personnel decreased during the summer months of 2021, but continued to provide substantial protection, as well as full protection against the most serious outcomes.

However, the complex relationship between antigen-specific B and T cells and the level of B cell repopulation necessary to achieve anti-vaccine responses remain largely unknown. Methods: Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and induction of antigen-specific B and CD4/CD8 T cell subsets were studied in 19 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) patients receiving RTX, 12 RA patients on other therapies and 30 healthy controls after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with either mRNA or vector based vaccines. Results: A minimum of 10 B cells/uL in the peripheral circulation was necessary in RTX patients to mount seroconversion to anti-S1 IgG upon SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. RTX patients lacking IgG seroconversion showed reduced antigen-specific B cells, lower frequency of TfH-like cells as well as less activated CD4 and CD8 T cells compared to IgG seroconverted RTX patients. Functionally relevant B cell depletion resulted in impaired IFNgamma secretion by spike-specific CD4 T cells. In contrast, antigen-specific CD8 T cells were reduced in patients independently of IgG formation. Conclusions: Patients receiving rituximab with B cell numbers above 10 B cells/ul were able to mount humoral and more robust cellular responses after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination that may permit optimization of vaccination in these patients.

In this paper, an epidemic model based on system of ordinary differential equations is formulated by taking into account the transmission routes from symptomatic, asymptomatic and hospitalized individuals. The model is fitted to the corresponding cumulative number of hospitalized individuals (active cases) reported by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), and parameterized using the least squares method. The basic reproduction number which measures the potential spread of COVID-19 in the population is computed using the next generation operator method. Further, Lyapunov function is constructed to investigate the stability of the model around a disease-free equilibrium point. It is shown that the model has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium if the basic reproduction number of the novel coronavirus transmission is less than one. Sensitivities of the model to changes in parameters are explored, and safe regions at certain threshold values of the parameters are derived. It is revealed further that the basic reproduction number can be brought to a value less than one in Nigeria, if the current effective transmission rate of the disease can be reduced by 50%. Otherwise, the number of active cases may get up to 2.5% of the total estimated population. In addition, two time-dependent control variables, namely preventive and management measures, are considered to mitigate the damaging effects of the disease using Pontryagins maximum principle.

CASE REPORT: This patient presented with cough, sore throat, anorexia and pyrexia. On examination, he had gross cervical lymphadenopathy and palpable splenomegaly. Nose and throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive and blood tests revealed pancytopaenia with very high ferritin, triglyceride and d-dimer levels. The patients HScore(2) was calculated at 220, suggesting probability of HLH of 93-96%. Considering Russell and colleagues(3) comments about potential harm of corticosteroid use in patients with Covid-19 infection, the patient was commenced on treatment with the selective IL-1 receptor antagonist drug, Anakinra, and a two day course of intravenous immunoglobulin. RESULTS: The patient responded rapidly to treatment, becoming apyrexial after 24 hours.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common vestibular disorder. The diagnosis typically rests on the description of the symptoms along with the nystagmus observed at a well-established positional testing. Objectives The aim of the present study was to propose a teleconsultation and teletreatment protocol to manage patients with BPPV during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Specialists in the vestibular field met through remote access technologies to discuss the best strategy to manage BPPV patients by teleconsultation and teletreatment system. Additionally, several scientific sources were consulted. Technical issues, patient safety, and clinical assessment were independently analyzed. All relevant information was considered in order to design a clinical protocol to manage BPPV patients in the pandemic context. Results Teleconsultation for BPPV patients requires a double way (video and audio) digital system. An adapted informed consent to follow good clinical practice statements must be considered. The time, trigger and target eye bedside examination (TiTRaTe) protocol has proven to be a valuable first approach. The bow and lean test is the most rational screening maneuver for patients with suspected positional vertigo, followed by most specific maneuvers to diagnostic the sub-variants of BPPV.

Clinical observations are of little help to recognise myxovirus infection and implement appropriate prevention measures. The limited use of molecular tools underestimates the role of other common pathogens. OBJECTIVES: During the early weeks of the 2009C2010 flu pandemic, a clinical and virological survey was conducted in adult and paediatric patients with ILI referred to two French University hospitals in Paris and Tours. Aims were to investigate the different pathogens involved in ILI and describe the associated symptoms. METHODS: H1N1v pandemic influenza diagnosis was performed with real time RT-PCR assay. Other viral aetiologies were investigated by the molecular multiplex assay RespiFinder19?. Clinical data were collected prospectively by physicians using a standard questionnaire. RESULTS: From week 35 to 44, endonasal swabs were collected in 413 patients. Overall, 68 samples (16.5%) were positive for H1N1v. In 13 of them, other respiratory pathogens were also detected. Among H1N1v negative samples, 213 (61.9%) were positive for various respiratory agents, 190 in single infections and 23 in mixed infections. The most prevalent viruses in H1N1v negative single infections were rhinovirus (62.6%), followed by parainfluenza viruses (24.2%) and adenovirus (5.3%). 70.6% of H1N1v cases were identified in patients under 40 years and none after 65 years. There was no difference between clinical symptoms observed in patients infected with H1N1v or with other pathogens. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the high frequency of non-influenza viruses involved in ILI during the pre-epidemic period of a flu alert and the lack of specific clinical signs associated with influenza infections.

DESIGN: Mixed-methods study. SETTING: Six countries of the WHO European Region. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: The questionnaire is based on lessons learnt in previous studies, and was developed in three sequential phases: (1) WHO Quality Measures were prioritised and content, construct and face validity were assessed through a Delphi involving a multidisciplinary board of experts from 11 countries of the WHO European Region; (2) translation/back translation of the English version was conducted following The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research guidelines; (3) internal consistency, intrarater reliability and acceptability were assessed among 600 health workers in six countries. RESULTS: The questionnaire included 40 items based on WHO Standards Quality Measures, equally divided into four domains: provision of care, experience of care, availability of human and physical resources, organisational changes due to COVID-19; and its organised in six sections. It was translated/back translated in 12 languages: Bosnian, Croatian, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish. The Cronbachs alpha values were 0.70 for each questionnaire section where questions were hypothesised to be interrelated, indicating good internal consistence. Cohen K or Gwets AC1 values were 0.60, suggesting good intrarater reliability, except for one question. Acceptability was good with only 1.70% of health workers requesting minimal changes in question wording.

The virus caused several outbreaks in the Asia-Pacific region during the past two decades and has been considered a significant public health problem in the post-poliovirus eradication era. Unlike poliovirus, there is no effective vaccine or approved antivirals against EV71. To explore anti-EV71 agents therefore is of vital importance. Several strategies have been employed to develop antivirals based on the molecular characteristics of the virus. Among these, some small molecules that were developed against human rhinoviruses and poliovirus are under evaluation. In this review, we discuss the recent development of such small molecules against EV71, known drug resistance and possible solutions to it, and animal models for evaluating the efficacy of these antivirals. Although further investigation is required for clinical applications of the existing candidates, the molecular mechanisms revealed for the inhibition of EV71 replication can be used for designing new molecules against this virus in the future.","output":"Strategies to develop antivirals against enterovirus 71"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pour qui a particip  la prise en charge de patients covid-19, en tant qui plus est impliqu dans la rflexion thique au sein de son tablissement et dans le cadre dun enseignement aux futurs professionnels de la sant, on ne peut quavoir t saisi au fur et  mesure du dveloppement de la pandmie par la limitation des ressources, qui a ncessairement abouti  des prises de dcision thiques de nature utilitaristes.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic led to significant consumer and medical concern regarding the possible risks of immunosuppressive medications during the pandemic. This study aimed to examine medication adherence and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) usage during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was sent to patients from two tertiary IBD units. The survey included medication nonadherence attributed to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, complementary therapy, and IBD medication use. Validated measures of IBD disease activity, medication adherence, and beliefs about medicines were obtained. RESULTS: Of 262 respondents (median age of 46, 58% female) 14 (5%) patients reported self\\\\initiated missed doses or dose reduction of IBD medications directly attributed to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Positive associations with medication nonadherence included current corticosteroid requirement (P = 0.022), higher disease activity scores (P = 0.026), and higher concern about medicines score (P = 0.04). CAM usage was common, aimed at treating mental health in most cases, and infrequently attributed to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Even in the setting of low COVID\\\\19 prevalence, the pandemic reduced IBD medication adherence in 1 in 20 patients.

The discontinuity of care is a cause of great concern, mainly in vulnerable regions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM) regarding the frequency of consultations and whether their disease was kept under control. The study also aimed to develop and implement a digital solution to improve monitoring at home. METHODS: This is a multimethodological study. A quasiexperimental evaluation assessed the impact of the pandemic on the frequency of consultations and control of patients with hypertension and DM in 34 primary health care centers in 10 municipalities. Then, an implementation study developed an app with a decision support system (DSS) for community health workers (CHWs) to identify and address at-risk patients with uncontrolled hypertension or DM. An expert panel assessment evaluated feasibility, usability, and utility of the software. RESULTS: Of 5070 patients, 4810 (94.87%) had hypertension, 1371 (27.04%) had DM, and 1111 (21.91%) had both diseases. There was a significant reduction in the weekly number of consultations (107, IQR 60.0-153.0 before vs 20.0, IQR 7.0-29.0 after social restriction; P<.001). Only 15.23% (772/5070) of all patients returned for a consultation during the pandemic. Individuals with hypertension had lower systolic (120.0, IQR 120.0-140.0 mm Hg) and diastolic (80.0, IQR 80.0-80.0 mm Hg) blood pressure than those who did not return (130.0, IQR 120.0-140.0 mm Hg and 80.0, IQR 80.0-90.0 mm Hg, respectively; P<.001). Also, those who returned had a higher proportion of controlled hypertension (64.3% vs 52.8%). For DM, there were no differences in glycohemoglobin levels. Concerning the DSS, the experts agreed that the CHWs can easily incorporate it into their routines and the app can identify patients at risk and improve treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant drop in the number of consultations for patients with hypertension and DM in primary care.

Health systems worldwide responded with swift changes to increase workflow capacity while protecting the vulnerable, including those with cancer. This led to unprecedented and rapid restructuring of health service provision. Published data from the 2003 SARS pandemic focuses on medical and nursing staff, overlooking other departmental employees such as administration officers or food service workers. Our protocol aims to document directives and adjustments communicated to staff in two cancer care departments and correlate this with measures of distress and perceived preparedness across the spectrum of all staff involved in cancer care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We use a semiqualitative approach comprising weekly diarising of events and simultaneous staff surveys. Principal investigators will document changes at a metropolitan quaternary cancer centre and a regional cancer centre. Communications, directives and changes will be diarised in real time in four executional domains. Simultaneously, prospective voluntary self-administered online surveys will be conducted at regular intervals by staff. The survey assesses the perceived institutional preparedness and personal well-being, with a combination of Likert scaled and open response questions. A semiquantitative self-assessment of distress adapted from National Comprehensive Cancer Network distress thermometer is incorporated. Additionally, open-text personal reflections on themes including difficult decisions will be invited. Survey participants will be drawn from various work areas of the cancer care departments: administrative staff, health professionals, for example, allied health, ancillary workers, nursing and medical. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been reviewed and approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (LNR/2020/QRBW/62982). Published literature on domains of distress neglects categories of healthcare worker who form an essential part of the care delivery team.

Statins are well-known lipid-lowering drugs, but they have also anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. This study aimed to investigate the effects of statins on the survival of COVID-19 hospitalized patients. METHODS: This retrospective study was performed on 583 patients admitted to a highly referenced hospital in Tabas, Iran, between February 2020 and December 2020. One hundred sixty-two patients were treated with statins and 421 patients were not. Demographic information, clinical signs, and the results of laboratory, and comorbidities were extracted from patients' medical records and mortality and survival rates were assessed in these two groups. RESULTS: The results of the Cox crude regression model showed that statins reduced mortality in COVID-19 patients (HR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.97; p = 0.040), although this reduction was not significant in the adjusted model (HRs=0.51, 95%CI: 0.22, 1.17; p = 0.114).

Design/methodology/approach: Focus group discussions were conducted with 20 journalists from Egypt, Jordan, Libya and Tunisia. Findings: The results of the study indicated that journalists in these countries experience violence in many forms as follows: torture, imprisonment, closure of their websites and censorship of content. In the four countries investigated, the results revealed that there is severe censorship (self-censoring and the governments) of the content presented to the public, an element that is inconsistent with the Arab Constitution, as well as international law, thus violating human rights laws. In addition, governments publish COVID-19 misinformation and at the same time, do little to support an independent media environment. Practical implications: Arab societies are in dire need of freedom of expression and the right to access information to give journalists an opportunity to cover the news during the pandemic. Originality/value: This study is important because it investigates the political changes that occurred after the Arab Spring revolutions in three countries, Egypt, Tunisia and Libya and the freedom of expression and rights is still restricted. In the same way, Jordan is a royal government that is trying to achieve democracy under a dictatorial regime. This study attempts to suggest practical solutions for journalists through various stakeholders by highlighting the importance of access to information and freedom of expression, particularly during the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

To document possible changes in rat populations, we: (i) examined public service requests in the 6 years before, and during, lockdown in New York City; (ii) used spatial analyses to identify calls in proximity to food service establishments (FSE); and (iii) surveyed pest-management companies. Over 6 years prior to the pandemic, we found a consistent moderate spatial association (r = 0.35) between FSE and rat-related calls. During the early stages of the pandemic, the association between rat reports and food services did not decrease as would be expected by restaurant closures, but instead modestly increased (r = 0.45). There was a 29.5% decrease in rat reports, overall. However, hotspot analysis showed that new reports were highly localized, yet absent in several industrial areas they were previously observed in, potentially masking a higher proportion of calls in neighborhoods near closed restaurants. Additionally, 37% of pest management companies surveyed reported that, unlike previous years, 50C100% of requests were from new clients and addresses. The finding that hotspots remained nearby dense clusters of restaurants does not support the common narrative that rats moved long distances.

Skilled immigrant women face additional gendered disadvantages, including a disproportionate domestic burden, interrupted careers and gender segmentation in occupations and organizations. This study explores how the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic impacted skilled newcomer women's labour market outcomes and work experiences. Design/methodology/approach: The authors draw on 50 in-depth questionnaires with skilled women to elaborate on their work experiences during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: The pandemic pushed skilled immigrant women towards unemployment, lower-skilled or less stable employment. Most study participants had their career trajectory delayed, interrupted or reversed due to layoffs, decreased job opportunities and increased domestic burden. The pandemic's gendered nature and the reliance on work-from-home arrangements and online job search heightened immigrant women's challenges due to limited social support and increased family responsibilities. Originality/value: This paper adds to the conversation of increased integration challenges under pandemic conditions by contextualizing the pre-pandemic literature on immigrant work integration to the pandemic environment. Also, this paper contributes a better understanding of the gender dynamics informing the COVID-19 socio-economic climate. ? 2021, Luciara Nardon, Amrita Hari, Hui Zhang, Liam P.S.

However, TIP/S effect on the CF sputum microbiome has not been explored. We hypothesised that TIP/S has additional 'off-target' effects beyond merely P. aeruginosa and that baseline microbiome prior to initiation of therapy is associated with subsequent patient response. METHODS: We drew sputum samples from a prospectively collected biobank. Patients were included if they had one sputum sample in the 18 months before and after TIP/S. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene profiling was used to characterise the sputum microbiome. RESULTS: Forty-one patients met our inclusion criteria and 151 sputum samples were assessed. At baseline, median age was 30.4 years (IQR 24.2-35.2) and forced expiratory volume in 1 (FEV1) second was 57% predicted (IQR 44-74). Nineteen patients were defined a priori as responders having no net decrease in FEV1 in the year following TIP/S. No significant changes were observed in key microbiome metrics of alpha (within-sample) or beta (between-sample) diversity for samples collected before and after TIP/S. However, significant beta-diversity (Bray-Curtis) differences were noted at baseline between patients based on response status. Notably, responders were observed to have a higher abundance of Staphylococcus in pretherapy baseline samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our longitudinal study demonstrates that the sputum microbiome of patients with CF is relatively stable following inhaled tobramycin over many months.

Methods We enrolled 94 patients (age  18 years) scheduled for thoracic surgery using double-lumen tube intubation. Before intubation, 0.2 mg/kg of dexamethasone was administered intravenously and 2 ml of normal saline was sprayed into the oropharyngeal cavity (Group D; n = 45), or 0.04 ml/kg normal saline was administered intravenously and 1 g of Neo Mucosal Activator? mixed with 1 ml of normal saline was sprayed into the oropharyngeal cavity (Group N; n = 43), in a double blind and prospectively randomized manner. Postoperative sore throat and hoarseness were recorded using a numeral rating scale and a 4-point scale to detect a change in voice quality following tracheal extubation (at 1, 6, and 24 h). The primary outcome was the incidence of sore throat at 24 h following surgery. The secondary outcomes were incidence and severity of sore throat and hoarseness.

Thus, early identification of patients at risk of poor outcomes is critical. Our objective was to analyse SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in serum as a severity biomarker in COVID-19. Methods and Findings Retrospective observational study including 193 patients admitted for COVID-19. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum (CoVemia) was performed with samples collected at 48-72 hours of admission by two techniques from Roche and Thermo Fischer Scientific (TFS). Main outcome variables were mortality and need for ICU admission during hospitalization for COVID-19. CoVemia was detected in 50-60% of patients depending on technique. The correlation of Ct in serum between both techniques was good (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.612; p < 0.001). Patients with CoVemia were older (p = 0.006), had poorer baseline oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2; p < 0.001), more severe lymphopenia (p < 0.001) and higher LDH (p < 0.001), IL-6 (p = 0.021), C-reactive protein (CRP; p = 0.022) and procalcitonin (p = 0.002) serum levels. We defined \\"relevant CoVemia\\" when detection Ct was < 34 with Roche and < 31 for TFS. These thresholds had 95% sensitivity and 35 % specificity. Relevant CoVemia predicted death during hospitalization (OR 9.2 [3.8 - 22.6] for Roche, OR 10.3 [3.6 - 29.3] for TFS; p < 0.001). Cox regression models, adjusted by age, sex and Charlson index, identified increased LDH serum levels and relevant CoVemia (HR = 9.87 [4.13-23.57] for TFS viremia and HR = 7.09 [3.3-14.82] for Roche viremia) as the best markers to predict mortality. Conclusions CoVemia assessment at admission is the most useful biomarker for predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of 4-342 primary and secondary school students from Shanghai, China was conducted during March 13-23, 2020. Besides demographic information, psychological distress (including depression, anxiety, and stress), life satisfaction, perceived impact of home quarantine, and parent-child discussions on COVID-19 were assessed. RESULTS: The three most prevalent symptoms were: anxiety (24.9%), depression (19.7%), and stress (15.2%). Participants were generally satisfied with life and 21.4% became more satisfied with life during school closures. Senior grades were positively correlated with psychopathological symptoms and negatively associated with life satisfaction, whereas the perceived benefit from home quarantine and parent-child discussions on COVID-19 were negatively correlated with psychopathological symptoms and positively correlated with life satisfaction. Among participants who perceived no benefit from home quarantine, those who had discussions with their parents about COVID-19 experienced less depression, anxiety, and stress. LIMITATIONS: Limitations included the inability to infer the casual relationship, no parental report for mental health of children aged 6 to 9, and the inadequate measurement of parent-child discussion.

Emerging evidence demonstrates that older individuals and people with underlying metabolic conditions of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality. The SARS-CoV-2 infects humans through the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) receptor. The ACE-2 receptor is a part of the dual system renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) consisting of ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis and ACE-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis. In metabolic disorders and with increased age, it is known that there is an upregulation of ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis with a downregulation of ACE-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis. The activated ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis leads to pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects in respiratory system, vascular dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, nephropathy, and insulin secretory defects with increased insulin resistance. On the other hand, the ACE-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis has anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects on the respiratory system and anti-inflammatory, antioxidative stress, and protective effects on vascular function, protects against myocardial fibrosis, nephropathy, pancreatitis, and insulin resistance. In effect, the balance between these two axes may determine the prognosis. The already strained ACE-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas in metabolic disorders is further stressed due to the use of the ACE-2 by the virus for entry, which affects the prognosis in terms of respiratory compromise. Further evidence needs to be gathered on whether modulation of the renin angiotensin system would be advantageous due to upregulation of Mas activation or harmful due to the concomitant ACE-2 receptor upregulation in the acute management of COVID-19.","output":"The ACE-2 in COVID-19: Foe or Friend?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has placed considerable strain on the wellbeing of individuals across the world, and resources have been already put in place to assess the psycho-social aftermath of this pandemic.

Whilst several parameters influencing infection transmission are expected to be consistent across populations, the serial interval can vary across and within populations over time. Therefore, local estimates are preferable for use in epidemiological models developed at a regional level. We used data collected as part of the national contact tracing process in Ireland to estimate the serial interval of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Irish population, and to estimate the proportion of transmission events that occurred prior to the onset of symptoms. RESULTS: After data cleaning, the final dataset consisted of 471 infected close contacts from 471 primary cases. The median serial interval was 4 days, mean serial interval was 4.0 (95% confidence intervals 3.7, 4.3) days, whilst the 25th and 75th percentiles were 2 and 6 days respectively. We found that intervals were lower when the primary or secondary case were in the older age cohort (greater than 64 years). Simulating from an incubation period distribution from international literature, we estimated that 67% of transmission events had greater than 50% probability of occurring prior to the onset of symptoms in the infector. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst our analysis was based on a large sample size, data were collected for the primary purpose of interrupting transmission chains. Similar to other studies estimating the serial interval, our analysis is restricted to transmission pairs where the infector is known with some degree of certainty. Such pairs may represent more intense contacts with infected individuals than might occur in the overall population. It is therefore possible that our analysis is biased towards shorter serial intervals than the overall population.","output":"Estimation of the serial interval and proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission events of COVID- 19 in Ireland using contact tracing data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human civilization is experiencing a critical situation that presents itself for a new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Concerns about potential (systemic) risks resulting from overdependence on global supply networks have been magnified during the lockdowns triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic in the last year. Strengthening local and/or domestic networks may be an adequate approach to overcome the severe economic implications of this overdependence, but it also rises the question of how one can measure the strength of domestic supply/production networks and design an appropriate structure. The objective of this paper is to propose a method for measurement and to provide a first-cut analysis with this method on a sample of economies. Building on ecological network analysis, we borrow the Finn cycling index from its toolbox and show a ranking of countries with respect to the strength of their domestic production networks based on this index. The results suggest that the countries are very heterogeneous both in terms of the level of cycling index and its sectoral decomposition. Using panel-econometric techniques, we point out the role of the openness and structural asymmetry in shaping this strength, also controlling for other macroeconomic characteristics of the economies. The estimates reveal that openness has a negative, while asymmetry has a positive effect on this index, but other country-specific characteristics also play a role in shaping the systemic operation of national economies as measured by the Finn cycling index.","output":"The strength of domestic production networks: an economic application of the Finn cycling index"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loss-of-function mutations in the synaptic protein neurexin1&#945; (NRXN1&#945;) are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and many of these disorders are defined by core deficits in social cognition. Mouse models of Nrxn1&#945; deficiency are not amenable to studying aspects of social cognition because, in general, mice do not engage in complex social interactions such as social play or prosocial helping behaviors. Rats, on the contrary, engage in these complex, well-characterized social behaviors. Using the Nrxn1tm1Sage Sprague Dawley rat, we tested a range of cognitive and social behaviors in juveniles with haplo- or biallelic Nrxn1&#945; mutation. We found a deficit in ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) of male and female neonatal rats with Nrxn1&#945; deficiency. A male-specific deficit in social play was observed in Nrxn1&#945;-deficient juveniles, although sociability and social discrimination were unaltered. Nurturing behavior induced by exposure to pups was enhanced in male and female juveniles with biallelic Nrxn1&#945; mutation. Performance in tasks of prosocial helping behavior and food retrieval indicated severe deficits in learning and cognition in juveniles with biallelic Nrxn1&#945; mutation, and a less severe deficit in haploinsufficient rats, although Pavlovian learning was altered only in haploinsufficient males. We also observed a male-specific increase in mobility and object investigation in juveniles with complete Nrxn1&#945; deficiency. Together, these observations more fully characterize the Nrxn1tm1Sage Sprague Dawley rat as a model for Nrxn1&#945;-related neurodevelopmental disorders, and support a rationale for the juvenile rat as a more appropriate model for disorders that involve core deficits in complex social behaviors.

This study compared the short-term outcomes of SPSG, RPSG, and conventional laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (CLSG). This is a single-center retrospective study of 238 morbidly obese patients, of whom 148 (62.2%) patients completed follow-up one year after surgery. Propensity score matching was performed on factors influencing the choice of approach, and fifty patients from the SPSG + RPSG and CLSG groups were successfully matched. The groups were comparable in postoperative weight loss, morbidity, pain, and resolution of obesity-related comorbidities. The percentage of excess weight loss after one year was 90.0% in the SPSG + RPSG group and 75.2% in the CLSG group (P < 0.001). Complication rates showed no significant difference. The CLSG group was superior in dyslipidemia remission (17 [37.0%] vs. 28 [63.6%], P = 0.018) in the total cohort; however, this difference disappeared after matching.

Herein, we fabricated a series of micro-nanopatterns with different microisland sizes and arginineglycineaspartate (RGD) nanospacings on a nonfouling poly(ethylene glycol) background. Besides reproducing that nanospacing of RGD, a ligand of its receptor integrin (a membrane protein), significantly influences specific cell adhesion on bioactive nanoarrays, we confirmed that the concept of critical adhesion area originally suggested in studies of cells on micropatterns was justified also on the micro-nanopatterns, yet the latter exhibited more characteristic behaviors of cell adhesion. We found increased critical adhesion areas of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on nanoarrayed microislands with increased RGD nanospacings. However, the numbers of nanodots with respect to the critical adhesion areas were not a constant. A unified interpretation was then put forward after combining nonspecific background adhesion and specific cell adhesion.

Now, with many institutions returning to the classroom or a hybrid structure, students are re-adjusting to in-person learning. However, students may have new concerns regarding their education given the ongoing risk posed by COVID-19, particularly social and professional disruptions. In this study, we assess student concerns related to the return to in-person learning among Physician Assistant (PA) students using Q methodology (QM). METHODS This IRB-approved study had PA students sort and rank a set of 43 statements to which they most strongly disagreed to agreed. Statements were generated to encompass a comprehensive list of concerns PA students may have returning to in-person programming during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students in all cohorts (PA1-PA3) were invited to participate in a survey that included demographic information, a QM sorting activity, and free responses to explain their strongest rankings. The sorts were analyzed using PQMethod 2.35 program and a factor analysis was performed using the recommended settings. Written statements were analyzed using a thematic analysis to assist in interpretation of the QM. RESULTS A total of 15 students across all cohorts completed the Q sort (13%). QM sorted the students into one of three statistically significant groups that varied in cohort composition: Employment Concerns (n=6), Social Readjustments (n=5), and Missed Opportunities (n=2). Two students did not load onto a factor. Students in the Employment Concerns group worried about job prospects after graduation and increased risk of COVID-19 exposure and exposing others. Students in the Social Readjustment group were most concerned about changing routine, re-building relationships, and returning to classroom learning. The Missed Opportunities group were concerned about missed time in clinic and networking, and how that might affect jobs. Free responses supported the QM results and indicated participants were most concerned with the pandemic's impact on future employment across all cohorts. These concerns primarily consist of the availability of positions and perceived negative impacts on their training by future employers. DISCUSSION PA students concerns regarding return to in-person instruction transcended cohort and environment. This suggests PA students share similar types of concerns about daily activities and their future as a PA regardless of whether they are in gross anatomy lab or the clinic. Increased exposure was only perceived as a concern for a small group of students as it related to the availability of PPE while for others this concern was mitigated by the availability of vaccines and COVID-19 testing. SIGNIFICANCE The results of this study will inform instructors and program directors of perceived concerns that may be unique to the pandemic. Thus, allowing these concerns to be addressed to limit their potential impact on the learning environment and, ultimately, student well-being.","output":"Assessing Attitudes About Returning to In-person Learning Among Physician Assistant Students Using Q Methodology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a previous study, we identified a 117 base severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequence in the human genome with 94.6% identity.

The sequence matched a sequence in the SARS-CoV-2 Orf1b gene in non-structural protein 14 (NSP14), which is an exonuclease and NSP15, an endoribonuclease. In the current study we compared the human genome with other viral genomes to determine some of the characteristics of human sequences found in the latter. Most of the viruses had human sequences, but they were short. Hepatitis A and St Louis encephalitis had human sequences that were longer than the 117 base SARS-Cov-2 sequence, but they were in non-coding regions of the human genome.

The 117 base SARS-CoV-2 human sequence is relatively close to the viral spike sequence, separated only by NSP16, a 904 base sequence. The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the binding of the virus spike protein to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and internalization of the complex by the host cell.

There was suspicion that populations of A. diaperinus had developed resistance to insecticides in poultry farms in France. Here, we evaluate the insecticide susceptibility of adult A. diaperinus from ten populations sampled from different poultry farms. The insects were exposed to four commercial insecticides: two pyrethroids, one pyrethroid/neonicotinoid and one organophosphate. Our results strongly suggest the occurrence of resistance to pyrethroid-based formulations in some farm populations from Brittany (France). ABSTRACT: The control of insect pests often relies on the recurrent application of insecticides. This is the case for the lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus, an invasive beetle infesting poultry farms. There is evidence that A. diaperinus can develop resistance to several insecticides. Evaluation of such resistance has never been conducted in France, despite the beetles presence since the 1970s. We assess insecticide susceptibility in 10 populations from French poultry farms and compare patterns with two susceptible populations. Adults are subjected to short-term exposures (4 h) to four commercial insecticides and their recovery is assessed. Temporal survival also is scored during constant exposures for seven days. Clear-cut differences among the farm populations are found. Except for three populations that have patterns similar to those of the two susceptible populations, all the other farm populations have a much greater capacity to recover and survive insecticide exposures, especially to pyrethroid-based formulations. Three populations in particular even exhibit clear signs of resistance to pyrethroids, with median lethal times more than 10-fold superior to values of the susceptible population. No insect in any population recovers from the pirimiphos-methyl exposure, and all beetles are apparently dead after 15 h. Our results demonstrate the existence of resistant populations to pyrethroids in Brittany France.","output":"Differences in the Susceptibility to Commercial Insecticides among Populations of the Lesser Mealworm Alphitobius diaperinus Collected from Poultry Houses in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Using personal protective equipment (PPE) is one of several fundamental measures to prevent the transmission of infection and infectious diseases and is particularly pertinent in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate use of PPE by healthcare workers is, however, often suboptimal. Training and monitoring of PPE competency are essential components of an infection prevention and control program but there is a paucity of research and data on the content of such training programs across Australasia. This paper reports the results of a survey that characterised the nature of PPE training in Australian and New Zealand hospitals. METHODS: A population-based online survey was distributed to members of three major Australasian colleges representing infection prevention and control. RESULTS: Results indicate that, although training is frequently provided at orientation, many healthcare workers do not receive regular updates. Training programmes combine online and classroom sessions, but over a third do not include a practical component. The frequency of monitoring PPE competency is variable with one third of respondents indicating that no auditing occurs. PPE items used for high-level training are variable, with use of powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) uncommon. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that HCWs confidence, competence and familiarity with PPE are a concern, which in the context of the current global COVID-19 pandemic is problematic. More research is needed into how PPE training programs could be better designed, to prepare HCWs for practice using PPE safely and confidently.","output":"Characteristics of personal protective equipment training programs in Australia and New Zealand hospitals: A survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the ecological and epidemiological roles of pets in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for animal and human health, identifying household reservoirs, and predicting the potential enzootic maintenance of the virus We conducted a longitudinal household transmission study of 76 dogs and cats living with at least one SARS-CoV-2-infected human in Texas and found that 17 pets from 25 6% of 39 households met the national case definition for SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals This includes three out of seventeen (17 6%) cats and one out of fifty-nine (1 7%) dogs that were positive by RT-PCR and sequencing, with the virus successfully isolated from the respiratory swabs of one cat and one dog Whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from all four PCR-positive animals were unique variants grouping with genomes circulating among people with COVID-19 in Texas Re-sampling showed persistence of viral RNA for at least 25 d-post initial test Additionally, seven out of sixteen (43 8%) cats and seven out of fifty-nine (11 9%) dogs harbored SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies upon initial sampling, with relatively stable or increasing titers over the 2C3 months of follow-up and no evidence of seroreversion The majority (82 4%) of infected pets were asymptomatic Reverse zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected people to animals may occur more frequently than recognized","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infections and Viral Isolations among Serially Tested Cats and Dogs in Households with Infected Owners in Texas, USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To analyze epidemiology and burden of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) in Italy.

RESULTS 7195 hospitalizations for NTDs were retrieved, accounting for 7375 diagnoses, 60% in Italians and 40% in foreigners. Male-to-female ratio was 2; the age group more commonly affected was 25-44 years (32.5%). The most common diagnoses were leishmaniasis (34%), schistosomiasis (29%), strongyloidiasis (12%), Chagas disease (8%), and dengue (8%). Average yearly hospitalization rate per 100,000 residents for all NTDs was 2.05, 1.33, and 10.39 in general population, Italians, and foreign citizens, respectively. Hospitalization rates higher than 100 per 100,000 subjects were found in citizens from Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and Bolivia. CONCLUSIONS NTDs have a not negligible burden in Italy.

Furthermore, the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants in the human population and recurrent coronavirus spillovers highlight the need for broadly neutralizing antibodies that are not affected by an antigenic drift that could limit future zoonotic infection.

Here we provide the first description of a previously unidentified coronavirus lineage detected from wild Asian leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis) and Chinese ferret badgers (Melogale moschata) during virological surveillance in southern China.

Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the envelope, membrane, and nucleoprotein structural proteins and the two conserved replicase domains, putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase, of these novel coronaviruses were most closely related to those of group 3 coronaviruses identified from birds, while the spike protein gene was most closely related to that of group 1 coronaviruses from mammals. However, these viruses always fell into an outgroup phylogenetic relationship with respect to other coronaviruses and had low amino acid similarity to all known coronavirus groups, indicating that they diverged early in the evolutionary history of coronaviruses. These results suggest that these viruses may represent a previously unrecognized evolutionary pathway, or possibly an unidentified coronavirus group.

However, the role of salience biasthe change in perception of risk due to increased familiarity with the outcomein decisions to vaccinate children has not been explicitly studied. OBJECTIVE: To assess for salience bias in parental decisions to vaccinate children. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used a time-to-event (survival) analysis to compare vaccination rates of children whose mothers had a history of cervical cancer or a cervical biopsy, who have experienced adverse vaccine-preventable outcomes, and for whom vaccination may be more salient, with a control group of children whose mothers had no such history. Participants were accrued from the MarketScan Commercial Database, including US children who turned 11 years old, when HPV vaccination is recommended, from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2018. Data were analyzed from December 29, 2020, to September 17, 2021. EXPOSURES: Maternal history of cervical cancer or cervical biopsy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Vaccination against HPV. RESULTS: A total of 757 428 children (370 878 girls [49.0%] and 386 550 boys [51.0%]) were identified, of whom 38 366 had mothers with a history of cervical biopsy alone and 1084 had mothers with a history of cervical cancer. Overall, 54.2% of children (55.7% of girls and 52.7% of boys) received at least 1 vaccination by 16 years of age. In a time-to-event analysis, HPV vaccination did not differ between children whose mothers had cervical cancer vs those whose mothers did not (hazard ratio [HR] for girls, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.86-1.13]; HR for boys, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.94-1.24]). Maternal history of cervical biopsy was associated with a minimally increased hazard of vaccination (HR for girls, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.04-1.09]; HR for boys, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.01-1.06]). There were no clinically meaningful differences between groups for the tetanus/diphtheria/acellular pertussis and meningococcal vaccinations, which are also recommended at 11 years of age. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this analysis of salience bias in childhood vaccination decisions, mothers personal history of cervical cancer or cervical biopsy was not associated with greater vaccination rates among children against HPV. These findings suggest that salience of vaccine-preventable outcomes may not have a major impact on childhood vaccine hesitancy in HPV; the role of salience should be investigated for other vaccines.","output":"Association of Maternal Cervical Disease With Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Among Offspring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Decontamination using hand hygiene remains one of the most important and effective methods for reducing healthcare-associated infections and cross-infection between patients.

Patients with deficits of controlled semantic retrieval in the context of semantic aphasia (SA) after stroke may benefit from this approach since their deficits tend to be accompanied by deficits of cognitive control. We assessed the effect of both extrinsic and intrinsic motivation in healthy controls and semantic aphasia patients. Experiment 1 manipulated extrinsic reward using high or low levels of points for correct responses during a semantic association task. Experiment 2 manipulated the intrinsic value of items using self-reference; allocating pictures of items to the participant (self) or researcher (other) in a shopping game before people retrieved their semantic associations. These experiments revealed that patients, but not controls, showed better performance when given an extrinsic reward, consistent with the view that increased external motivation may help to ameliorate patients semantic control deficits. However, while self-reference was associated with better episodic memory, there was no effect on semantic retrieval. We conclude that semantic control deficits can be reduced when extrinsic rewards are anticipated; this enhanced motivational state is expected to support proactive control, for example, through the maintenance of task representations.

A method of blood collection that requires only a few drops of whole blood, dried on filter paper (DBS) and can be used for analyzing full fatty acid profiles offers advantages in clinical application. METHODS: This study compared the use of whole blood, and whole blood DBS, serum or plasma for use in evaluating circulating fatty acid composition in African savannah elephants.

The incidence of complications and associated mortality rates are high. Cardiac damage, which is related to survival, is one of these. The purpose of this study is to assess the role of BNP, a cardiac biomarker, in predicting mortality in COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS This single-center, prospective observational study was performed from July to September 2020 in a tertiary university hospital designated for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Patients whose diagnoses were confirmed with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tested nasopharyngeal swabs and with thoracic computed tomography (CT) findings compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the study. All clinical and laboratory data were obtained within the first 24 hours of hospital admission. To determine the risk of in-hospital death, patients were followed from admission until their discharge (1 to 15 days). The primary outcome was in-hospital death, defined as the case-fatality ratio. RESULTS Among all biomarkers that were included in the multivariate analysis only high BNP levels was independently associated with mortality [Mean 1.012, 95% CI (1.005 - 1.02 pg/mL) (p = 0.002)]. Mortality was found to be significantly associated with older age and higher BNP, LDH, AST, HGB, PLT, ferritin, D-dimer, and CRP levels. In addition, mortality was found to be higher with longer duration of hospitalization (p = 0.041).

Viruses can also spread through fusion of infected with uninfected cells. We compared the requirements of ACE2 expression, proteolytic activation, and the sensitivity to inhibitors for SARS2-S-mediated and SARS-CoV-S(SARS1-S)-mediated cell-cell fusion. SARS2-S-driven fusion was moderately increased by TMPRSS2 and strongly by ACE2, while SARS1-S-driven fusion was strongly increased by TMPRSS2 and less so by ACE2 expression. In contrast to SARS1-S, SARS2-S-mediated cell-cell fusion was efficiently activated by Batimastat-sensitive metalloproteases. Mutation of the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site reduced effector-target-cell fusion when ACE2 or TMPRSS2 were limiting and rendered SARS2-S-driven cell-cell fusion more dependent on TMPRSS2. When both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were abundant, initial target-effector-cell fusion was unaltered compared to wt SARS2-S, but syncytia remained smaller. Mutation of the S2' site specifically abrogated activation by TMPRSS2 for both cell-cell fusion and SARS2-S-driven pseudoparticle entry but still allowed for activation by metalloproteases for cell-cell fusion and by cathepsins for particle entry. Finally, we found that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor Bromhexine was unable to reduce TMPRSS2-activated cell-cell fusion by SARS1-S and SARS2-S as opposed to the inhibitor Camostat. Paradoxically, Bromhexine enhanced cell-cell fusion in the presence of TMPRSS2, while its metabolite Ambroxol exhibited inhibitory activity in some conditions. On Calu-3 lung cells, Ambroxol weakly inhibited SARS2-S-driven lentiviral pseudoparticle entry, and both substances exhibited a dose-dependent trend towards weak inhibition of authentic SARS-CoV-2.IMPORTANCE Cell-cell fusion allows the virus to infect neighboring cells without the need to produce free virus and contributes to tissue damage by creating virus-infected syncytia. Our results demonstrate that the S2' cleavage site is essential for activation by TMPRSS2 and unravel important differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, among those greater dependence of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2 expression and activation by metalloproteases for cell-cell fusion. Bromhexine, reportedly an inhibitor of TMPRSS2, is currently tested in clinical trials against coronavirus disease 2019. Our results indicate that Bromhexine enhances fusion in some conditions. We therefore caution against use of Bromhexine in higher dosage until its effects on SARS-CoV-2 spike activation are better understood. The related compound Ambroxol, which similarly to Bromhexine is clinically used as an expectorant, did not exhibit activating effects on cell-cell fusion. Both compounds exhibited weak inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection at high concentrations, which might be clinically attainable for Ambroxol.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike-mediated cell-cell fusion differ in the requirements for receptor expression and proteolytic activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has quickly become an unprecedented challenge for many countries at a global level, requiring a significant amount of financial resources to support the National Healthcare System (NHS).

Extracellular orf8 protein was detected in cell culture supernatant and in sera of COVID-19 patients. In addition, orf8 was found highly immunogenic in COVID-19 patients, who showed early seropositivity for anti-orf8 IgM, IgG, and IgA.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may regulate the antioxidant signaling pathway and modulate inflammatory processes.

Longitudinal prospective cohort studies demonstrate that there is an association between moderate intake of the omega-6 PUFA linoleic acid and lower risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), most likely as a result of lower blood cholesterol concentration. Current evidence suggests that increasing intake of arachidonic acid (up to 1500 mg/day) has no adverse effect on platelet aggregation and blood clotting, immune function and markers of inflammation, but may benefit muscle and cognitive performance. Many studies show that higher intakes of omega-3 PUFAs, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are associated with a lower incidence of chronic diseases characterized by elevated inflammation, including CVDs. This is because of the multiple molecular and cellular actions of EPA and DHA.

The objectives of this study were to (1) describe acute care general surgery procedures performed at the largest referral hospital in Rwanda and (2) understand the geographic distribution of disease presentations and referral patterns. METHODS We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected acute care surgery cases performed at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Kigali (CHUK) in Rwanda between June 1 and December 1, 2011. Using Pearson's (2) test and the Fisher exact test, we compared cases originating from within Kigali and transfers from other provinces. Geospatial analyses also were used to further describe transfer patterns. RESULTS During the study period, 2,758 surgical interventions were performed, of which 25.6% (707/2,758) were general surgery operations. Of these, 45.4% (321/707) met the definition of acute care surgery. Only about one-third-32.3% (92/285)-of patients resided within Kigali, whereas about two-thirds-67.7% (193/285)-were transferred from other provinces. Most patients transferred from other provinces were younger than 18 years of age (40.4%; 78/193), and 83.0% (39/47) of patients older than 50 years of age originated from outside of Kigali. Specific operative indications and surgical procedures varied substantially between patients from Kigali and patients transferred from other provinces. CONCLUSION Emergency surgical conditions remain important contributors to the global burden of disease, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed at providing preliminary estimates of influenza and other respiratory infections circulating among adults in Qatar. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data of about 44,000 patients who visited Hamad General Hospital clinics, sentinel sites, and all primary healthcare centers in Qatar between 2012 and 2017. All samples were tested for influenza viruses, whereas about 38,000 samples were tested for influenza and a panel of respiratory viruses using Fast Track Diagnostics (FTD) RT-PCR kit. RESULTS: Among all ILIs cases, 20,278 (46.5%) tested positive for at least one respiratory pathogen. Influenza virus was predominating (22.6%), followed by human rhinoviruses (HRVs) (9.5%), and human coronaviruses (HCoVs) (5%). A detection rate of 2C3% was recorded for mycoplasma pneumonia, adenoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). ILIs cases were reported throughout the year, however, influenza, RSV, and HMPV exhibited strong seasonal peaks in the winter, while HRVs circulated more during fall and spring. Elderly (>50 years) had the lowest rates of influenza A (13.9%) and B (4.2%), while presenting the highest rates of RSV (3.4%) and HMPV (3.3%). While males had higher rates of HRVs (11.9%), enteroviruses (1.1%) and MERS CoV (0.2%), females had higher proportions of influenza (26.3%), HPIVs (3.2%) and RSV (3.6%) infections. CONCLUSION: This report provides a comprehensive insight about the epidemiology of ILIs among adults in the Qatar, as a representative of Gulf States. These results would help in improvement and optimization of diagnostic procedures, as well as control and prevention of the respiratory infections.","output":"Epidemiology of respiratory infections among adults in Qatar (2012-2017)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recently emerged B.1.1.529 (Omicron) SARS-CoV-2 variant has a highly divergent spike (S) glycoprotein.

Relative to these variants, B.1.1.529 S exhibits decreased processing, resulting in less efficient syncytium formation and lower S incorporation into virus particles. Nonetheless, B.1.1.529 S supports virus infection equivalently. B.1.1.529 and B.1.617.2 S glycoproteins bind ACE2 with higher affinity than D614G S.

This paper proposes a Black-Box Optimizer for Compression (B-BOC): given a black-box compression algorithm and assuming not all sentences need be compressed -- find the best candidates for compression in order to maximize both compression rate and quality. Given a required compression ratio, we consider two scenarios: (i) single-sentence compression, and (ii) sentences-sequence compression. In the first scenario, our optimizer is trained to predict how well each sentence could be compressed while meeting the specified ratio requirement. In the latter, the desired compression ratio is applied to a sequence of sentences (e.g., a paragraph) as a whole, rather than on each individual sentence. To achieve that, we use B-BOC to assign an optimal compression ratio to each sentence, then cast it as a Knapsack problem, which we solve using bounded dynamic programming. We evaluate B-BOC on both scenarios on three datasets, demonstrating that our optimizer improves both accuracy and Rouge-F1-score compared to direct application of other compression algorithms.","output":"With Measured Words: Simple Sentence Selection for Black-Box Optimization of Sentence Compression Algorithms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The oskar transcript, acting as a noncoding RNA, contributes to a diverse set of pathways in the Drosophila ovary, including karyosome formation, positioning of the microtubule organizing center, integrity of certain ribonucleoprotein particles, control of nurse cell divisions, restriction of several proteins to the germline, and progression through oogenesis. How oskar mRNA acts to perform these functions remains unclear. Here we use a knock down approach to identify the critical phases when oskar is required for three of these functions. The existing transgenic shRNA for removal of oskar mRNA in the germline targets a sequence overlapping a regulatory site bound by Bruno1 protein to confer translational repression, and was ineffective during oogenesis. Novel transgenic shRNAs targeting other sites were effective at strongly reducing oskar mRNA levels and reproducing phenotypes associated with the absence of the mRNA. Using GAL4 drivers active at different developmental stages of oogenesis, we found that early loss of oskar mRNA reproduced defects in karyosome formation and positioning of the microtubule organizing center, but not arrest of oogenesis. Loss of oskar mRNA at later stages was required to prevent progression through oogenesis. The noncoding function of oskar mRNA is thus required for more than a single event.","output":"Knock down analysis reveals critical phases for specific oskar noncoding RNA functions during Drosophila oogenesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As coronaviruses (CoVs) replicate in the host cell cytoplasm, they rely on their own capping machinery to ensure the efficient translation of their mRNAs, protect them from degradation by cellular 5 exoribonucleases, and escape innate immune sensing. The CoV nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) is a bi-functional replicase subunit harboring an N-terminal 3-to-5 exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain and a C-terminal (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domain that is presumably involved in viral mRNA capping. Here, we aimed to integrate structural, biochemical, and virological data to assess the importance of conserved N7-MTase residues for nsp14s enzymatic activities and virus viability. We revisited the crystal structure of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV nsp14 to perform an in silico comparative analysis between betacoronaviruses. We identified several residues likely involved in the formation of the N7-MTase catalytic pocket, which presents a fold distinct from the Rossmann fold observed in most known MTases. Next, for SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV, site-directed mutagenesis of selected residues was used to assess their importance for in vitro enzymatic activity. Most of the engineered mutations abolished N7-MTase activity, while not affecting nsp14-ExoN activity. Upon reverse engineering of these mutations into different betacoronavirus genomes, we identified two substitutions (R310A and F426A in SARS-CoV nsp14) abrogating virus viability and one mutation (H424A) yielding a crippled phenotype across all viruses tested. Our results identify the N7-MTase as a critical enzyme for betacoronavirus replication and define key residues of its catalytic pocket that can be targeted to design inhibitors with a potential pan-coronaviral activity spectrum. Significance Statement The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic emphasizes the urgent need to develop efficient broad-spectrum anti-CoV drugs. The structure-function characterization of conserved CoV replicative enzymes is key to identifying the most suitable drug targets. Using a multidisciplinary comparative approach and different betacoronaviruses, we characterized the key conserved residues of the nsp14 (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase, a poorly defined subunit of the CoV mRNA-synthesizing machinery. Our study highlights the unique structural features of this enzyme and establishes its essential role in betacoronavirus replication, while identifying two residues that are critical for the replication of the four betacoronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Structure-function analysis of the nsp14 N7-guanine methyltransferase reveals an essential role in Betacoronavirus replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent evidence suggests individuals with a history of COVID-19 are more likely to experience Adverse Events (AEs) following vaccination.

Clinical observations of the severe and critical course of infection showed the hyperinflammation and cytokine storm. In organs and tissues that are a target for viral entry the lymphocytes and monocytes are dominant cells in tissue infiltration. There are different ways and different mechanisms leading to immune response disorders. In peripheral blood in the severe and fatal course of disease lymphopenia is frequent as a poor prognosis factor. Reduced numbers of lymphocytes, mainly T cells and NK cells, are noted in the majority of these patients. The NK cells belonging to the innate immunity system are dedicated to the antiviral response due to production of interferon (IFN) and direct lysis of virus infected cells.

The research community is interested to know what are the hotspots in coronavirus (CoV) research and how much is known about COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of publications involving coronaviruses as well as COVID-19 by using a topic modeling analysis. Methods: We extracted all abstracts and retained the most informative words from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, which contains all the 35,092 pieces of coronavirus related literature published up to March 20, 2020. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation modeling, we trained an eight-topic model from the corpus. We then analyzed the semantic relationships between topics and compared the topic distribution between COVID-19 and other CoV infections. Results: Eight topics emerged overall: clinical characterization, pathogenesis research, therapeutics research, epidemiological study, virus transmission, vaccines research, virus diagnostics, and viral genomics. It was observed that COVID-19 research puts more emphasis on clinical characterization, epidemiological study, and virus transmission at present. In contrast, topics about diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, genomics and pathogenesis only accounted for less than 10% or even 4% of all the COVID-19 publications, much lower than those of other CoV infections. Conclusions: These results identified knowledge gaps in the area of COVID-19 and offered directions for future research.

We analyze and evaluate the remote test process from the learners' perspectives, taking into account three different dimensions. First, the proficiency in conducting remote tests by learners. This is considered by evaluating ease of access and conducting tests, availability of appropriate test environment, and ability to focus adequately during tests. Second, controlling and managing test processes by institutions, i.e. availability of needed educational and technical support for learners.

Case presentation: A 62-year-old man presented with acute weakness of the left hand and lack of coordination in the left arm. Nine days earlier, he was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. The brain images revealed two subacute infarcts, one corresponding to the territory of the right middle cerebral artery, and the other in the right frontal cortical vein. Conclusion: The existence of both venous and arterial brain infarcts due to COVID-19 infection, has been previously reported once. Most of the cases of stroke are due to only arterial thrombosis, therefore this could be the starting point to start collecting data about simultaneous compromise in order to assess and compare outcomes, severity of the disease, among other variables.","output":"Simultaneous Arterial and Venous Brain Infarctions in a Patient with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led a global pandemic cross the world. Most countries took two main interventions: suppression like immediate lockdown cities at epicenter or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both strategies have their apparent merits and limitations; it becomes extremely hard to conduct one intervention as the most feasible way to all countries. Targeting at this problem, this paper conducted a feasibility study by defining a mathematical model named SEMCR, it extended traditional SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model by adding two key features: a direct connection between Exposed and Recovered populations, and separating infections into mild and critical cases. It defined parameters to classify two stages of COVID-19 control: active contain by isolation of cases and contacts, passive contain by suppression or mitigation. The model was fitted and evaluated with public dataset containing daily number of confirmed active cases including Wuhan and London during January 2020 and March 2020. The simulated results showed that 1) Immediate suppression taken in Wuhan significantly reduced the total exposed and infectious populations, but it has to be consistently maintained at least 90 days (by the middle of April 2020). Without taking this intervention, we predict the number of infections would have been 73 folders higher by the middle of April 2020. Its success requires efficient government initiatives and effective collaborative governance for mobilizing of corporate resources to provide essential goods. This mode may be not suitable to other countries without efficient collaborative governance and sufficient health resources. 2) In London, it is possible to take a hybrid intervention of suppression and mitigation for every 2 or 3 weeks over a longer period to balance the total infections and economic loss. While the total infectious populations in this scenario would be possibly 2 times than the one taking suppression, economic loss and recovery of London would be less affected. 3) Both in Wuhan and London cases, one important issue of fitting practical data was that there were a portion (probably 62.9% in Wuhan) of self-recovered populations that were asymptomatic or mild symptomatic. This finding has been recently confirmed by other studies that the seroprevalence in Wuhan varied between 3.2% and 3.8% in different sub-regions. It highlights that the epidemic is far from coming to an end by means of herd immunity. Early release of intervention intensity potentially increased a risk of the second outbreak.","output":"Feasibility study of mitigation and suppression strategies for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in London and Wuhan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has progressed into a global pandemic. To date, thousands of genetic variants have been identified across strains of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from worldwide patients. However, there is still little direct evidence linking viral variants and clinical features. Based on two tightly linked SNPs, we previously divided SARS-CoV-2 into two major lineages: the ancestral S lineage (U8,782 and C28,144) and the derived L lineage (C8,782 and U28,144). Here, we identified SARS-CoV-2 lineages from 271 COVID-19 patients during the early outbreak of this pandemic in Wuhan, including 73 S- and 198 L-lineage patients. The S-lineage patients exhibited significantly worse clinical severity than the L-lineage patients, even after excluding other risk factors.

METHODS: All consecutive patients with COVID-19 with acute ischemic stroke due to LVO treated in our institution during the 6 first weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak were included. Baseline clinical and radiological findings, treatment, and short-term outcomes are reported. RESULTS: We identified 10 patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated for an acute ischemic stroke due to LVO. Eight were men, with a median age of 59.5 years. Seven had none or mild symptoms of COVID-19 at stroke onset. Median time from COVID-19 symptoms to stroke onset was 6 days. All patients had brain imaging within 3 hours from symptoms onset.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective chart analysis. METHODS Chart data were collected from pediatric patients who underwent adenotonsillectomy from 2011 to 2013. Monopolar electrocautery, radiofrequency ablation, and PlasmaBlade instruments were compared for intraoperative surgical time and postoperative hemorrhage rate. Univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) and (2) analysis was utilized to evaluate differences between instrumentation and variables. Cost analysis examining instrumentation and intraoperative anesthesia was also reviewed. RESULTS A total of 1,280 patients who underwent adenotonsillectomy were evaluated. There was no significant overall difference in age, sex, or preoperative diagnosis identified between the three instrumentation groups. When examining the various instruments' effect on procedure time in minutes, univariate ANOVA demonstrated a significant difference overall among the three groups (F = 8.79; P < .001). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons identified significantly faster surgical times for monopolar cautery than either PlasmaBlade (P = .03) or radiofrequency ablation (P < .001). The difference in the number of patients who experienced a postoperative bleed by instrument was not statistically significant ((2) = 2.36; P = .31). After instrumentation expenses were added to anesthesia cost, the overall average costs by instrument and surgical time were estimated to be $30.04 for monopolar cautery, $246.95 for PlasmaBlade, and $244.32 for radiofrequency ablation. CONCLUSIONS The ideal surgical instrumentation should be cost and time efficient with a low complication rate.

METHODS: This 15-week, randomized proof-of-concept study explored the acceptability of a digital parent mediated intervention online reciprocal imitation training (RIT; a naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention) and compared it to a treatment as usual (TAU) control on parent and child outcomes. Eligible children were between 18 and 60 months, met the cutoff for ASD on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2nd Edition and demonstrate significant social imitation deficits. Primary outcomes include the acceptability of RIT (Scale of Treatment Perceptions) and the feasibility of the Online RIT digital intervention (online RIT attributes). Secondary outcomes included parent fidelity (RIT parent fidelity form) and parental self-efficacy (Early Intervention Parenting Self-Efficacy Scale). Exploratory outcome measures included child social communication (Social Communication Checklist), child imitation skills (Unstructured Imitation Assessment), and family quality of life (Beach Center Family Quality of Life Scale). RESULTS: Twenty participants were randomized in a 1:1 fashion. The acceptability and feasibility of RIT and the Online RIT digital intervention were rated highly. Among the secondary outcomes, there were significant group differences in parent fidelity (p < .001) and self-efficacy (p = .029). On exploratory outcomes, there were group differences in child social communication (p = .048). There were no significant group differences in imitation ability (p = .05) or family quality of life (p = .22).

The physical examination presents fever, pallor whereas bleeding, hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly and bruising were absent, abdominal ultrasonography confirmed the absence of hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly and lymphodenopathy. The laboratory investigation parameters were: haemoglobin 6.2 g/L, total leucocytes count 1.51, neutrophils 0.47%, absolute reticulocyte count 0.5%, Monocytes 0.16%, red cell count 3.2 mil/uL, Picked cell volume (PCV) 30.13%, Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) 78 fL, Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) 26.3 pg. The liver enzymes were alanine aminotransferease (ALT) 98 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 114 IU/L. Serologic and molecular tests for hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, TTV, B19 were negative, whereas HGV RNA PCR test was found positive for hepatitis G virus. The bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy examination revealed hypo- cellularity, erythropoiesis, myelopoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. CONCLUSION: HAAA is an uncommon but severe condition, which may occur following idiopathic cases of acute hepatitis. Our finding suggests the involvement of HGV in the development of aplastic anemia. In patients presenting with pancytopenia after an episode of acute hepatitis, the definitive diagnosis should be considered and confirmed by RT-PCR and if possible by bone marrow biopsy.","output":"Hepatitis G Virus associated aplastic anemia: A recent case from Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and HCL-like disorders such as hairy cell leukemia variant (HCL-V) and splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma (SDRPL) are rare indolent B-cell malignancies. Purine analogs (PNAs), alone or in association with rituximab (R), are the standard of care for HCL in the first-line setting. However, PNAs are toxic and patients may become resistant to these drugs. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed. Several recent in vitro studies highlighted the importance of the interactions between HCL cells and their microenvironment, in particular with bone marrow stromal cells, endothelial cells, and the extracellular matrix. In these interactions, chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules play a major role. Moreover, the importance of signaling pathways, like BRAF, BCR, and CXCR4 has been underlined. Brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a fundamental signal transmitter of BCR and CXCR4 in HCL. Preclinical and recent clinical data showed an efficacy of ibrutinib, a BTK inhibitor (BTKi), in HCL and HCL-V. These promising results joined those of other emerging drugs like BRAF or MEK inhibitors and anti-CD22 immunotoxins. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors (BTKi) in hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and variant-type HCL The treatment of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) has changed significantly in recent years. In the first-line settings, treatment with purine analogs (PNAs) with or without anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies remains the gold standard in 2022. In relapsed/refractory HCL, other drugs are needed: BRAF inhibitors: vemurafenib monotherapy with or without rituximab or dabrafenib in combination with trametinib, an MEK inhibitor (MEKi), as well as the anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugate moxetumomab pasudotox. There are arguments for the use of Brutons tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi). Ibrutinib was recently tested in a multisite phase 2 study in 37 patients with either HCL (28 patients: 76%) or HCL-V (nine patients: 24%) including two who were previously untreated. Patients received single-agent ibrutinib at 420 mg daily (24 patients) or 840 mg daily (13 patients) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The overall response rate (ORR) at 32 weeks was 24%, increasing to 36% at 48 weeks and reaching 54% at any time since starting ibrutinib. Seven patients achieved a complete response (CR) as the best response at any time on study, while 13 patients had a partial response (PR) and 10 patients had stable disease (SD). Interestingly, the response rate was not statistically different between HCL and HCL-V patients, suggesting that ibrutinib could be an option in both entities. The estimated 36-month progression-free survival (PFS) was 73% and the estimated 36-month overall survival (OS) was 85%, with no differences between HCL and HCL-V. The frequency of cardiovascular grade 1C2 adverse events (AEs) was 16% for atrial fibrillation; 3% for atrial flutter; 32% for hypertension; and 0%, 3%, and 11%, respectively, for grade ? 3 AEs. Unlike in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), where the mechanism of action of ibrutinib is well known, the mechanism of action of ibrutinib in HCL appears to be unclear. No mutations were identified in patients with progressive disease, suggesting that the mechanisms of resistance could be different between HCL and CLL. The BTKi that are not yet approved are challenged by the new other targeted treatments.","output":"Updates in hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and variant-type HCL (HCL-V): rationale for targeted treatments with a focus on ibrutinib"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Zhizhu Xiang (ZZX for short) is the root and rhizome of Valeriana jatamansi Jones, which is a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) used to treat various mood disorders for more than 2,000 years, especially anxiety. However, there have been few investigations to clarify the compounds in ZZX for the treatment of anxiety. AIM OF THE STUDY Our previous study has identified five anti-anxiety components, including hesperidin, isochlorogenic acid A, isochlorogenic acid B and isochlorogenic acid C and chlorogenic acid, from extract of ZZX. In order to find the optimal combination and the underlying mechanism of these five components in the treatment of anxiety disorder, researches were designed based on uniform design method and proteomic technology. MATERIALS AND METHODS The samples with different proportion and content of the five active components were arranged by uniform design method. Then a mathematical model was formulated using partial least square method and stepwise regression analysis. Moreover, the empty bottle stress-induced anxiety rat model was established, and the anti-anxiety effect was recorded by the unconditioned reflex elevated maze test and the open field test. In addition, the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technique, along with the multidimensional liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry were applied in proteomic study. At last, the result of proteomic analysis was further confirmed by Western blot. RESULTS The optimal combination of the components from the extract of ZZX was 1.153 mg/kg hesperidin, 2.197 mg/kg Isochlorogenic acid A, 0.699 mg/kg Isochlorogenic acid B and 1.249 mg/kg Chlorogenic acid. Total 6818 proteins were identified using proteomic analysis and 80 differentially expressed proteins were used for further bioinformatic analysis. These proteins were involved in the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, protein digestion and absorption, cholesterol metabolism, Chagas disease, and AGE/RAGE signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS The composition and proportion of anti-anxiety components in extract of ZZX was disclosed, and there was an anti-anxiety effect for the combined components of flavonoids and phenolic acids. Through proteomic analysis and Western blot, it was found that the effective components of extract of ZZX can exert synergistic anti-anxiety effects via the regulation of multi-signaling pathways. These findings could provide a preliminary research basis for the development of new low-toxic, efficient, stable and controllable anti-anxiety drugs.","output":"Discovery and Proteomics Analysis of Effective Compounds in Valeriana jatamansi Jones for the Treatment of Anxiety."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A case of leishmaniasis with predominantly ocular signs in a cat living in Switzerland and it's treatment is reported.

The process of homologous repair can be exploited to integrate, in principle, any foreign DNA into a target site, provided the introduced DNA is flanked at both the 5 and 3 ends by sequences homologous to the region surrounding the double-strand break. We have developed a tool set that requires a minimum of steps to induce double-strand breaks at chromosomal target sites with the meganuclease I-SceI and select integration events at those sites. We demonstrate this method in two different applications. First, the introduction of site-specific single-nucleotide phosphorylation site mutations into the S. cerevisiae gene SPO12. Second, the precise chromosomal replacement of eleven S. cerevisiae proteasome genes with their human orthologs. Placing the human genes under S. cerevisiae transcriptional control allowed us to update our of model of functional replacement. Our experience suggests that using native promoters may be a useful general strategy for the coordinated expression of foreign genes in S. cerevisiae.

This treatment can cause many severe cardiac side effects that makes us discuss its utility. The aim of this study is to describe the cardiovascular effect of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin by analyzing surface ECG in patients with COVID-19. This observational cohort study included Moroccan patients with COVID-19 diagnosis and were hospitalized in Cheikh Khalifa International University Hospital, Casablanca, Morocco between March 26 and April 20, 2020. Patients were treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin over a period of at least ten days. We were interested in the effects of this combination on the electrocardiogram. A total of 118 eligible patients were enrolled in the study. QT interval prolongation was observed in 19% of patients under the treatment. Only 5 patients required discontinuation of treatment. The factors associated with QT prolongation are male gender (P value 0,043), age over 68 years (P value 0,09), cardiovascular comorbidity (P value 0,013), tisdale score 11 (P value < 0,001), and a severe form of COVID-19 (P value < 0,001). First degree atrioventricular block was observed in 2 patients. No serious rhythm or conduction disorders were observed in this study. QT prolongation is a real risk with the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. In the current context, it is necessary to select patients at high risk of severe rhythm disturbances that require closer ECG monitoring. Treatment should be discontinued if there are alarming signs such as QTc prolongation beyond 550 ms and the development of ventricular extrasystole or torsade de pointe.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin as a Treatment of COVID-19: Electrocardiogram Variability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background : After discovering racial/ethnic disparities in adherence to well-child visits, UMass Memorial Health worked to identify and mitigate barriers to adherence for patients and families across 53 primary care practices in Central Massachusetts. Methods : Once the system-wide goal to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in well-child visit adherence was established, a multidisciplinary team of leaders from UMass Memorial Health worked together to engage patients and stakeholders to identify obstacles to adherence; transportation, language, and scheduling were identified as barriers. The team employed a number of countermeasures to address these barriers; a new workflow was created for requesting free curb-to-curb transportation for Medicaid patients, practices were provided with tip sheets for accessing interpreter services, and a protocol for scheduling appointment reminders was developed. In addition, the team leveraged robust data analytics to communicate real-time data to practices to keep them informed of their progress toward the system's health equity goal. Primary data results are reported from October 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021. Results : For patients who identified as Hispanic/Latinx, adherence rose from 64.3% at baseline to 74.1% (p <0.001); and for patients who identified as Black/African American adherence rose from 58.7% at baseline to 71.9% (p<0.001). The gap in adherence to well-child visits for Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx children compared to white children narrowed (12.4% to 5.1%; p<0.001; 6.8% to 2.9%; p<0.001). Conclusion : Through a unique partnership between health system leaders, frontline staff, and the system's informatics team and by engaging caregivers to identify and address barriers to well-child visits, UMass Memorial Health was able to improve adherence to well-child visits among patients who identify as Black/African American or Hispanic/Latinx.","output":"Prioritizing Child Health: Promoting Adherence to Well-Child Visits in an Urban, Safety-Net Health System During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polls report nearly one-third of the United States population is skeptical or opposed to getting the COVID-19 vaccine.

Hence, it will be critical to find a new strategy for COVID-19. The study is to explore whether convalescent plasma transfusion may be beneficial in the treatment of severe patients with COVID-19. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of three severe patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and admitted in Fuzhou pulmonary hospital of Fujian province from February 18th, to May 15th,who met the following criteria: (1) within 3 weeks of symptom onsetlaboratory confirmed cases or who had viremia conformed by clinical experts2Severe patients with rapidly progress or the early stage of critically ill patients or who required plasma therapy were comprehensively evaluated by clinical experts. The data of clinical manifestations and the progresses of disease monitored by blood-gas analysis, biochemical tests, routine examine, radiological exam were abstracted and then analysis the changes before and after convalescent plasma transfusion. Results: All three patients (one male and two females;age range, 57-65years) were treated with convalescent plasma during the study. Two patients had underlying chronic diseases, including diabetes and hypertension. The most common symptoms were fever (three cases, 3/3) and cough (two cases, 2/3). All patients were treated with a combination of two antiviral drugs (lopinaviritonavir or arbidol combined with IFN-), whereas none of the patients were given glucocorticoids. Following plasma transfusion, the symptoms of the whole group improved to some degree, mainly manifested as reducing in coughing and body temperature normalized. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pre-transfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.97  10 9 /L vs. 1.08  10 9 /L) and decreased IL-6 (41.34 pg/ml vs. 13.83 pg/ml). The density of bilateral infiltration on CT imaging showed varying degrees of absorption within 7days. Throat swab nucleic acid test of most patients became negative for the novel coronavirus within 3 days after the transfusion. No adverse effects and severe complications were observed. Conclusions: In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 3severe patients with COVID-19, convalescent plasma could be as a promising therapy for COVID-19 without corticosteroids and no serious adverse reactions associated with the transfusion of convalescent plasma were observed, which would improve the clinical outcomes following by improvement in their clinical status.

For telemedicine, dermatologists request that patients submit images of their lesions for assessment. However, these images are often of insufficient quality to make a clinical diagnosis since patients do not have experience taking clinical photos. A clinician has to manually triage poor quality images and request new images to be submitted, leading to wasted time for both the clinician and the patient. We propose an automated image assessment machine learning pipeline, TrueImage, to detect poor quality dermatology photos and to guide patients in taking better photos. Our experiments indicate that TrueImage can reject ~50% of the sub-par quality images, while retaining ~80% of good quality images patients send in, despite heterogeneity and limitations in the training data.

The paper presents the result of a functional analysis of 155 patients in the Moscow Region who were examined at the Central Clinical Hospital of the Russian Academy of Sciences during the first wave of the pandemic (FebruaryCJuly, 2020). The inclusion criteria were a positive PCR test and typical, computed tomographic findings of viral pneumonia in the form of ground-glass opacities. A clinical correlation analysis was performed in four groups of patients: (1) those who were not on mechanical ventilation, (2) those who were on mechanical ventilation, and (3) those who subsequently recovered or (4) died. The correlation analysis also considered confounding comorbidities (diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, etc.). The immunological status of the patients was examined (levels of immunoglobulins of the M, A, G classes and their subclasses, as well as the total immunoglobulin level) using an original SARS-CoV-2 antibody ELISA kit. The ELISA kit was developed using linear S-protein RBD-SD1 and NTD fragments, as well as the N-protein, as antigens. These antigens were produced in the prokaryotic E. coli system. Recombinant RBD produced in the eukaryotic CHO system (RBD CHO) was used as an antigen representing conformational RBD epitopes. The immunoglobulin A level was found to be the earliest serological criterion for the development of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and it yielded the best sensitivity and diagnostic significance of ELISA compared to that of class M immunoglobulin. We demonstrated that the seroconversion rate of early N-protein-specific IgM and IgA antibodies is comparable to that of antibodies specific to RBD conformational epitopes. At the same time, seroconversion of SARS-CoV-2 N-protein-specific class G immunoglobulins was significantly faster compared to that of other specific antibodies. Our findings suggest that the strong immunogenicity of the RBD fragment is for the most part associated with its conformational epitopes, while the linear RBD and NTD epitopes have the least immunogenicity. An analysis of the occurrence rate of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins of different classes revealed that RBD- and N-specific antibodies should be evaluated in parallel to improve the sensitivity of ELISA. An analysis of the immunoglobulin subclass distribution in sera of seropositive patients revealed uniform induction of N-protein-specific IgG subclasses G1CG4 and IgA subclasses A1CA2 in groups of patients with varying severity of COVID-19.

This unprecedented collaborative effort culminated in the generation of 1275 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, which represent 15.5% of all confirmed cases in March 2020, making Portugal one of the countries generating the highest volumes of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data during early COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We reconstructed and characterized the spatio-temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and early dissemination in Portugal using recent phylodynamic models that allow integration of individual-based travel history, in order to obtain a more realistic reconstruction of the viral dynamics. Results: We detected at least 277 independent SARS-CoV-2 introductions, mostly from European countries (namely the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Italy and Switzerland), which was broadly consistent with the available travel history data, as well as with the countries with most frequent connectivity and/or with the highest number of Portuguese immigrants. Although most introductions were estimated to have occurred during the last week of February and the first week of March 2020, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 was silently circulating in Portugal several weeks before the first confirmed local cases on March 2, 2020. Discussion and Conclusion: While the implemented preventive and early control measures seem to have been successful in mitigating community transmission from most independent introductions, our results suggest that their earlier implementation could have largely minimized the number of introductions and subsequent virus expansion. Here we lay the foundation for genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Portugal, and highlight the need for systematic, continuous and geographically-representative genomic surveillance to guide national and international public health authorities toward the characterization and control of SARS-CoV-2 circulating diversity.","output":"The early dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this chapter, principles and concepts of modern infectious disease epidemiology Epidemiology are presented.

There are number of molecules which have been approved by the FDA as RdRp inhibitors such as ribavirin, remdesivir, sofosbuvir, etc. The reported inhibitors for RdRp enzyme is being used by the various researchers for repurposing of drugs against SARS-Cov-2 RdRp enzyme by implementing different computational methodologies. Molecular modeling and cheminformatics approaches have been used for the design and identification of novel molecules having medicinal applications in various areas. The preliminary studies in computational drug discovery (CDD) and in silico approaches are important parts of the modern drug discovery practices, and they are frequently applied in the identification of new drugs or for the prediction of biological activity of chemical series. Now, in the ongoing corona pandemic, in silico modeling is being proved very helpful for easy identification of novel inhibitors. The current chapter presents recent reports on the application of computational modeling approaches for the design and identification of ligands against RdRp associated with SARS-CoV-2. Here, we will illustrate recently published computational studies for the identification or development of novel RdRp inhibitors applying different computational approaches, encompassing homology modeling, molecular docking, virtual screening, and molecular dynamics simulations.

The newly developed C-MAC Video Stylet promises to combine the advantages of rigid stylets and flexible optical scopes. We therefore evaluated the feasibility of awake orotracheal intubations with this device. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, three anesthesiologists experienced in advanced airway management performed each 12 awake oral intubations with this device on adult patients with known or predicted intubation difficulties. The primary outcome was overall intubation success. Secondary outcomes were total attempts, successful time, first post-operative day sequelae, and subjective intubation difficulty rated on a visual analogue scale (1, very easy; 10, extremely difficult). RESULTS: Ten (28%) patients were female, aged 64 +/-13 years, with BMI 26 +/- 5 kg.m- 1. ASA status (II/III/IV) was 8 (22%) /, 23 (64%) / 5 (14%). Indications for awake oral intubation were: oropharyngeal tumor 20 (56%), cervical-spine fracture 8 (22%), previously known difficult airway 4 (11%), spinal canal stenosis 3 (8%), and bilateral peritonsillar abscess 1 (3%). Overall 97% were successfully intubated in 45 s (31-88). First-attempt success rate was 80% in 37 s (29-54); 92% of patients would choose the same procedure again. On the first post-operative day, 11 (31%) patients complained of sore throat; 5 (14%) had minor injuries. Ease of intubation was rated as median VAS (IQR) 3 (1-7).

We assessed the alignment of COVID-19 communication with LEP constituents' needs by examining multilingual content availability on the health department websites of the largest U.S. cities by population. To guide content analysis, we designed a codebook to evaluate six content types, six delivery modes, and three score measures for each website; for each, we measured Holsti's percent of agreement. We then compared the amount of information provided in all combined content types across cities and languages by delivery mode. We thematically analyzed open-ended responses about users' experiences with each city's webpages. We found that COVID-19 information was not presented consistently across languages: many cities provided less information among several delivery modes in other languages compared to English. We found a discrepancy in the amount of information, presentation quality, and ease of navigability of the information among languages and between cities.

To date, several studies have investigated why certain people experience discomfort when looking at clustered patterns. Recently, involuntary protection against dermatosis (IPAD) hypothesis was proposed to explain the causes of trypophobia. The IPAD hypothesis suggests that involuntary aversive responses to skin diseases cause discomfort in response to image clusters. However, this idea has not been fully investigated empirically. Therefore, the present study used a modified version of the priming procedure and tested whether the activation of the concept of skin-related diseases affected the evaluation of trypophobic images. In Experiment 1, participants engaged in a lexical decision task in which words related to skin problems, negative events, or neutral events were presented. Then, they evaluated the discomfort of trypophobic, negative, and neutral images. The results indicated that participants evaluated trypophobic images as more discomforting after they were exposed to skin-problem-related words, whereas the exposure to words related to skin-problems did not enhance the discomfort of negative images. These findings demonstrate that the association with skin-related problems increases the discomfort of trypophobic images. In Experiment 2, we further tested the reproducibility of the priming effect observed in Experiment 1 and investigated the effect of priming with words related to COVID-19 in the context of a spreading infection. Contrary to predictions, no priming effect was produced by either skin-related words or COVID-19-related words.

STUDY POPULATION: Data were obtained from the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service of Korea, including all patients older than 40 years who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing in South Korea between January 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020 (excluding self-referral). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: SARS-CoV-2 test positivity was the primary outcome and severe clinical outcome of COVID-19 was the secondary outcome. RESULTS: The unmatched cohort consisted of 135,435 patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 4531 (3.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 5493 (4.1%) patients had AMD. After propensity score matching, exudative AMD was associated with an increased likelihood of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-2.25), and a considerably greater risk of severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (aOR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.02 to 5.26), but not any AMD and non-exudative AMD.

This study investigates psychological functioning in the context of COVID-19, including fear and avoidance in the context of COVID-19, specifically its association with daily functioning, and the role of psychological flexibility, among people with chronic pain. METHODS: Responses from 555 adults with chronic pain were collected through a cross-sectional online survey and analyzed. RESULTS: Eight out of 10 participants reported significant depression and nearly 9 out of 10 reported significant functional impairment. COVID-19-related fear and avoidance significantly correlated with pain, pain-related disability, depression, and work and social adjustment (ra?=a?18-.32), as well as psychological flexibility processes, including pain acceptance, self-as-context, and committed action, |r|=.13-.30. COVID-19-related fear and avoidance and COVID-19-related interference were significant predictors of some measures of daily functioning beyond demographics and pain, ?a?=a?.09-.14. However, these associations weakened when psychological flexibility processes were factored into the models, with fear of COVID-19 no longer being a significant predictor of pain-related disability or depression, and COVID-19 avoidance no longer a significant predictor of depression.

Psychological flexibility may have a role in these associations for people with chronic pain in the pandemic.

Methods: The task force created a list of free wellness resources: daily yoga and guided meditation, snacks, tea and coffee (nourish stations), continuous access to mental health counseling and organized employees into neighborhood support groups. We evaluated the program in May 2020 using a cross-sectional survey of clinical and non-clinical employees. The survey included questions on responsibility changes related to COVID-19, fulfillment and burnout and wellness services used. Responders were grouped in none or some and most or all responsibilities changed. We described our results using Pearson's chi-square and Student's t-tests. Results: We received 736 responses, a response rate of 45%.

We reviewed the impacts of Big Events with relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic on drug-related risk and harms and access to drug treatment and harm reduction services. METHODS: We conducted a rapid review of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods literature relating to the following Big Events: respiratory infection pandemics, natural disasters, financial crises, and heroin shortages. Included studies reported data on changes to risks, harms, and/or service provisioning for people who use illicit drugs (other than cannabis) in the context of these Big Events. Searches were conducted in PubMed in May 2020, and two reviewers screened studies for inclusion. Peer-reviewed studies published in English or French were included. We used a narrative synthesis approach and mapped risk pathways identified in the literature. RESULTS: No studies reporting on respiratory infection pandemics were identified. Twelve studies reporting on natural disaster outcomes noted marked disruption to drug markets, increased violence and risk of drug-related harm, and significant barriers to service provision caused by infrastructure damage. Five studies of the 2008 global financial crisis indicated increases in the frequency of drug use and associated harms as incomes and service funding declined. Finally, 17 studies of heroin shortages noted increases in heroin price and adulteration, potentiating drug substitutions and risk behaviors, as well as growing demand for drug treatment. CONCLUSION: Current evidence reveals numerous risk pathways and service impacts emanating from Big Events. Risk pathway maps derived from this literature provide groundwork for future research and policy analyses, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: The COVID-19 Pandemic AI System (CPAIS) integrated two data sets: the data set from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker from the Blavatnik School of Government, which is maintained by the University of Oxford, and the data set from the COVID-19 Data Repository, which was established by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. This study utilized four statistical and deep learning techniques for forecasting: autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), feedforward neural network (FNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, and long short-term memory (LSTM). With regard to 1-year records (ie, whole time series data), records from the last 14 days served as the validation set to evaluate the performance of the forecast, whereas earlier records served as the training set. RESULTS: A total of 171 countries that featured in both databases were included in the online system. The CPAIS was developed to explore variations, trends, and forecasts related to the COVID-19 pandemic across several counties. For instance, the number of confirmed monthly cases in the United States reached a local peak in July 2020 and another peak of 6,368,591 in December 2020. A dynamic heat map with policy measures depicts changes in COVID-19 measures for each country. A total of 19 measures were embedded within the three sections presented on the website, and only 4 of the 19 measures were continuous measures related to financial support or investment. Deep learning models were used to enable COVID-19 forecasting; the performances of ARIMA, FNN, and the MLP neural network were not stable because their forecast accuracy was only better than LSTM for a few countries. LSTM demonstrated the best forecast accuracy for Canada, as the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were 2272.551, 1501.248, and 0.2723075, respectively. ARIMA (RMSE=317.53169; MAPE=0.4641688) and FNN (RMSE=181.29894; MAPE=0.2708482) demonstrated better performance for South Korea. CONCLUSIONS: The CPAIS collects and summarizes information about the COVID-19 pandemic and offers data visualization and deep learning-based prediction. It might be a useful reference for predicting a serious outbreak or epidemic. Moreover, the system undergoes daily updates and includes the latest information on vaccination, which may change the dynamics of the pandemic.","output":"A COVID-19 Pandemic Artificial Intelligence-Based System With Deep Learning Forecasting and Automatic Statistical Data Acquisition: Development and Implementation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination has recently started worldwide. As the vaccine supply will be limited for a considerable period of time in many countries, it is important to devise the effective vaccination strategies that reduce the number of deaths and incidence of infection. One of the characteristics of COVID-19 is that the symptom, severity, and mortality of the disease differ by age. Thus, when the vaccination supply is limited, age-dependent vaccination priority strategy should be implemented to minimize the incidences and mortalities. In this study, we developed an age-structured model for describing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, including vaccination. Using the model and actual epidemiological data in Korea, we estimated the infection probability for each age group under different levels of social distancing implemented in Korea and investigated the effective age-dependent vaccination strategies to reduce the confirmed cases and fatalities of COVID-19. We found that, in a lower level of social distancing, vaccination priority for the age groups with the highest transmission rates will reduce the incidence mostly, but, in higher levels of social distancing, prioritizing vaccination for the elderly age group reduces the infection incidences more effectively. To reduce mortalities, vaccination priority for the elderly age group is the best strategy in all scenarios of levels of social distancing. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of vaccine supply and efficacy on the reduction in incidence and mortality.","output":"Vaccination Prioritization Strategies for COVID-19 in Korea: A Mathematical Modeling Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has prompted significant changes in patient care in rheumatology and gastroenterology, with clinical guidance issued to manage ongoing therapy while minimising the risk of nosocomial infection for patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Subcutaneous (SC) formulations of biologics enable patients to self-administer treatments at home; however, switching between agents may be undesirable. CT-P13 SC is the first SC formulation of infliximab that received regulatory approval and may be termed a biobetter as it offers significant clinical advantages over intravenous (IV) infliximab, including improved pharmacokinetics and a convenient mode of delivery. Potential benefits in terms of reduced immunogenicity have also been suggested. With a new SC formulation, infliximab provides an additional option for dual formulation, which enables patients to transition from IV to SC administration route without changing agent. Before COVID-19, clinical trials supported the efficacy and safety of switching from IV to SC infliximab for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and SC infliximab may have been selected on the basis of patient and HCP preferences for SC agents. During the pandemic, patients with rheumatic diseases and IBD have successfully switched from IV to SC infliximab, with some clinical benefits and high levels of patient satisfaction. As patients switched to SC therapeutics, the reduction in resource requirements for IV infusion services may have been particularly welcome given the pandemic, facilitating reorganisation and redeployment in overstretched healthcare systems, alongside pharmacoeconomic benefits and a reduction in exposure to nosocomial infection. Telemedicine and contactless healthcare have been pushed to the forefront during the pandemic, and a lasting shift towards remote patient management and community/home-based drug administration is anticipated. SC infliximab supports the implementation of this paradigm for future improvements of healthcare value delivered. The accumulation of real-world data during the pandemic supports the high level of confidence, with patients, physicians, and healthcare systems benefitting from its uptake.

This is especially true in clinically vulnerable sections of society including the elderly. Using sera from BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccinated individuals aged between 70 and 89 (vaccinated with two doses 3-weeks apart) we examined the neutralising antibody (nAb) response to wildtype SARS-CoV-2. Between 3 and 20-weeks post 2nd dose, nAb titres dropped 4.9-fold to a median titre of 21.3 (ND80) with 21.6% of individuals having no detectable nAbs at the later time point. Experiments examining the neutralisation of twenty-one different SARS-CoV-2 variant spike proteins confirmed a significant potential for antigenic escape, especially for the Omicron (BA.1), Beta (B.1.351), Delta (B.1.617.2), Theta (P.3), C.1.2 and B.1.638 variants. Interestingly, however, the recently-emerged sub-lineage AY.4.2 was more efficiently neutralised than parental Delta pseudotypes. Combining pseudotype neutralisation with specific receptor binding domain (RBD) ELISAs we confirmed that changes to position 484 in the spike RBD were predominantly responsible for SARS-CoV-2 nAb escape, although the effect of spike mutations is both combinatorial and additive. Lastly, using sera from the same individuals boosted with a 3rd dose of BNT162b2 we showed that high overall levels of neutralising antibody titre can provide significant levels of cross-protection against Omicron. These data provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies wane over time and that antigenically variable SARS-CoV-2 variants are circulating, highlighting the importance of ongoing surveillance and booster programmes. Furthermore, they provide important data to inform risk assessment of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as Omicron, as they emerge.","output":"Neutralising antibody activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron, in an elderly cohort vaccinated with BNT162b2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Didymosphenia geminata is a species of freshwater diatom that is known as invasive and is propagating quickly around the world.

METHODS: We launched a survey composed of 25 questions about how COVID-19 has changed the safety and organization of daily activity in Italian radiology units. RESULTS: A total of 2136/10,564 (20.2%) radiologists of the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology participated. Two-thirds performed at least one diagnostic/interventional procedure on COVID-19 patients. The 88.1% reported a reduction in the elective imaging volumes, with US, mammography, and MRI having shown the greater decrease (41.1%, 23.9%, and 21.1%, respectively). In 69.6% of cases, institutions had trouble getting personal protective equipment (PPE), especially public hospitals and southern institutions. Less than 30% of participants were subjected to RT-PCR swab test, although 81.5% believed that it should be done on all health workers and 70% suggested it as the most important measure to improve safety at work. Slightly more than half of participants declared to work safely and felt to be adequately protected by their institutions. Up to 20% of northern participants were redeployed to clinical services. The first imaging examination performed by admitted COVID-19 patients was chest radiography in 76.3% of cases. Almost half of participants reported that less than 30% of health workers were infected in their radiology department, with higher rates in northern regions and public institutions. CONCLUSIONS: This snapshot of the current situation in Italian radiology departments could be used to harmonize the organization of working activity in order to safely and effectively face this pandemic. KEY POINTS: ? More than two-thirds of institutions had trouble getting PPE for health workers, with public hospitals and southern institutions that presented more procurement problems ? A substantial drop of imaging volumes was observed in the vast majority of Italian radiology departments, mostly due to the decrease of ultrasound, mammography, and MRI, especially in private practice were working activity was stopped in 13.3% of institutions ?

Here, we showed that key phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) binding residues of the TIM-1 IgV domain are critical for Ebola virus (EBOV) entry through direct interaction with PtdSer on the viral envelope. PtdSer liposomes but not phosphatidylcholine liposomes competed with TIM-1 for EBOV pseudovirion binding and transduction. Further, annexin V (AnxV) substituted for the TIM-1 IgV domain, supporting a PtdSer-dependent mechanism. Our findings suggest that TIM-1-dependent uptake of EBOV occurs by apoptotic mimicry. Additionally, TIM-1 enhanced infection of a wide range of enveloped viruses, including alphaviruses and a baculovirus. As further evidence of the critical role of enveloped-virion-associated PtdSer in TIM-1-mediated uptake, TIM-1 enhanced internalization of pseudovirions and virus-like proteins (VLPs) lacking a glycoprotein, providing evidence that TIM-1 and PtdSer-binding receptors can mediate virus uptake independent of a glycoprotein. These results provide evidence for a broad role of TIM-1 as a PtdSer-binding receptor that mediates enveloped-virus uptake.

We found female but not male mice, both BALB/c and C57BL/6, and human females were enriched with CECs. CECs, mainly their progenitors defined as CD45+CECs expressed higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), PDL-1, VISTA, Arginase II and Arginase I compared to their CD45? counterparts. Consequently, CECs by the depletion of L-arginine suppress T cell activation and proliferation. Expansion of CECs in anemic mice and also post-menstrual cycle in women can result in L-arginine depletion in different microenvironments in vivo (e.g. spleen) resulting in T cell suppression. As proof of concept, we found that anemic female mice and mice adoptively transferred with CECs from anemic mice became more susceptible to Bordetella pertussis infection. These observations highlight the role of sex and anemia-mediated immune suppression in females. Notably, enriched CD45+CECs may explain their higher immunosuppressive properties in female BALB/c mice. Finally, we observed significantly more splenic central macrophages in female mice, which can explain greater extramedullary erythropoiesis and subsequently abundance of CECs in the periphery.

Unlike standard endovascular treatments used to exclude directly the aneurysm bulge from the parent vessel, FDS induce reduction in the intra-aneurysmal flow and promote progressive and stable thrombosis therein. The advent of FDS has therefore increased the need for understanding of IA hemodynamics. METHODS We proposed the use of the most recently evolved four-dimensional (4D) flow MRI technique to evaluate qualitatively and quantitatively post-FDS flow modification in 10 patients. We report intra-aneurysmal velocity measurements and the influence of metal artifacts induced by the stent. RESULTS An index was defined to quantitatively measure flow changes-namely, the proportional velocity reduction ratio (PVRR)-with ranges from 34.6% to 71.1%. Furthermore, we could compare streamlines characterizing the post-stent flow patterns in five patients in whom the intra-aneurysmal velocity was beyond the visualization threshold of 7.69 cm/s.

As an example, results obtained for the NanoCleaner (R), a filter designed to clean cabin air in vehicles, are presented. Validation with soot particles produced with a CAST soot generator revealed a filter efficiency higher than 99.5%. To assess the relevance of the test filter system to measure efficiency for viral particles removal, MS2 bacteriophages, also called Escherichia virus MS2, were used as virus surrogate and aerosolized into the filter test system with the commercially available Eraser nebulizer. Filter efficiencies of more than 99% for MS2 bacteriophages were achieved using the NanoCleaner (R) in the filter test system. Experiments with ceramic wall-flow filters showed similar results.

HKU1 spike antibodies were detected in all children with acute COVID-19, MIS-C, and healthy controls. Although children with MIS-C had significantly higher HKU1 spike titers than healthy children (GMT 37239 vs. 7551, P = 0.012), these titers correlated positively with both SARS-CoV-2 binding (r = 0.7577, P<0.001) and neutralizing (r = 0.6201, P = 0.001) antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Prior murine exposure to HKU1 spike protein completely impeded the development of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, consistent with original antigenic sin. In contrast, the presence of HKU1 spike IgG antibodies in children with acute COVID-19 or MIS-C was not associated with diminished neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Original antigenic sin responses to Betacoronavirus spike proteins are observed in a mouse model, but are not apparent in children following SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The identification of critical periods and business cycles contributes significantly to the analysis of financial markets and the macroeconomy. Financialization and cointegration place a premium on the accurate recognition of time-varying volatility in commodity markets, especially those for crude oil and refined fuels. This article seeks to identify critical periods in the trading of energy-related commodities as a step toward understanding the temporal dynamics of those markets. This article proposes a novel application of unsupervised machine learning. A suite of clustering methods, applied to conditional volatility forecasts by trading days and individual assets or asset classes, can identify critical periods in energy-related commodity markets. Unsupervised machine learning achieves this task without rules-based or subjective definitions of crises. Five clustering methodsaffinity propagation, mean-shift, spectral, k-means, and hierarchical agglomerative clusteringcan identify anomalous periods in commodities trading. These methods identified the financial crisis of 2008C2009 and the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Applied to four energy-related marketsBrent, West Texas intermediate, gasoil, and gasolinethe same methods identified additional periods connected to events such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and the 2003 Persian Gulf war. t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding facilitates the visualization of trading regimes. Temporal clustering of conditional volatility forecasts reveals unusual financial properties that distinguish the trading of energy-related commodities during critical periods from trading during normal periods and from trade in other commodities in all periods. Whereas critical periods for all commodities appear to coincide with broader disruptions in demand for energy, critical periods unique to crude oil and refined fuels appear to arise from acute disruptions in supply. Extensions of these methods include the definition of bull and bear markets and the identification of recessions and recoveries in the real economy.","output":"A Pattern New in Every Moment: The Temporal Clustering of Markets for Crude Oil, Refined Fuels, and Other Commodities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In this paper, we predict the health and economic consequences of immediate investment in personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers (HCWs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: To account for health consequences, we estimated mortality for health care workers (HCW), and present a cost-effectiveness and return on investment (ROI) analysis using a decision-analytic model with Bayesian multivariate sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. Inputs were used from the World Health Organization Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool and the Imperial College of London epidemiologic model. Results: An investment of $9.6 billion USD would adequately protect HCWs in all LMICs. This intervention saves 2,299,543 lives across LMICs, costing $59 USD per HCW case averted and $4,309 USD per HCW life saved. The societal ROI is $755.3 billion USD, the equivalent of a 7,932% return. Regional and national estimates are also presented. In scenarios where PPE remains scarce, 70-100% of HCWs will get infected, irrespective of nationwide social distancing policies. Maintaining HCW infection rates below 10% and mortality below 1% requires inclusion of a PPE scale-up strategy as part of the pandemic response. Discussion: In conclusion, wide-scale procurement and distribution of PPE for LMICs is an essential strategy to prevent widespread HCW morbidity and mortality.

For this purpose, we have made use of a single countrys computable general equilibrium model and formulated two alternative scenarios (optimistic and pessimistic). While the baseline already shows a worrying food situation, our results suggest that the pandemic of Covid-19 contributes to a worsening of food security. First, the food deficit of poor rural and urban households worsens. Second, even if their food consumption decreases, the urban non-poor households seem to be resilient to the Covid-19 pandemic. The severity of food insecurity is increasing among poor households in rural and urban areas, whereas the non-poor rural households are likely to fall into the category of vulnerable people. Third, the negative impacts on food security can be explained by the combination of several factors such as a rise in food prices, a decrease in households incomes and remittances. Finally, the negative impact on food security seems permanent, as the deviation from the baseline persists over 10 years (2020C2030).","output":"Could Covid-19 Worsen Food Insecurity in Burkina Faso?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on frontline health care workers have been well described, the effects of the COVID-19 response on the U.S. public health workforce, which has been impacted by the prolonged public health response to the pandemic, has not been adequately characterized.

However, physicians, payers and healthcare systems are challenged to select among these novel treatments for both effectiveness and value. Reliance on change in relative, rather than absolute, risk often makes discrimination of treatment effects between medications impractical, with potentially misleading conclusions. Number Needed to Treat (NNT), the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction, can be a valuable alternative in assessing benefit:risk. The objective of the current analysis was to calculate NNT for reported endpoints of COVID-19 treatments.MethodsClinical information was captured from published literature and pre-prints from investigations of COVID-19 treatments. NNTs were calculated for reported endpoints. Outpatient treatments to reduce viral load included neutralizing antibody cocktails REGN-COV21 and bamlanivimab/etesevimab.2 Inpatient treatments included the anti-viral: remdesivir 3,4;and immune modulators: baricitinib5, and lenzilumab.6ResultsREGN-COV2 reduced the number of medically attended visits with NNT of 33.3. The NNT for hospitalization or death was 20 for bamlanivimab/etesevimab. NNTs for 28-day mortality with inpatient treatment were 37 for baricitinib, 26.3 for remdesivir alone, and 22.7 for lenzilumab. Additional analyses of lenzilumab resulted in NNT of 14.7 when combined with remdesivir and corticosteroids, 15.4 when combined with remdesivir, and 13.9 in patients with baseline CRP<150mg/L and age<85 years. The NNT for lenzilumab to prevent survival without ventilation (SWOV) was 15.4 which, decreased to 6.4 in patients with baseline CRP<150mg/L and age<85 years. The number needed to prevent a serious adverse event was 20 for baricitinib, 15 for remdesivir, and 20.4 for lenzilumab.ConclusionThe NNT for COVID-19 treatments varied with setting, endpoint, and mechanism. The NNT for lenzilumab improved with refinement of concomitant medications and patient phenotype.

With a survey sample (N = 721), we empirically examined the proposed model and tested the hypotheses. The results indicate that sadness, anxiety, and cognitive dissonance, which were a result of perceived threat and perceived information overload, had heterogeneous effects on information avoidance. Anxiety and cognitive dissonance increased information avoidance intention, while sadness decreased information avoidance intention. Moreover, information avoidance predicted a reluctance on the part of consumers to engage in preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings not only contribute to the information behavior literature and extend the concept of information avoidance to a public health emergency context, but also yield practical insights for global pandemic control.","output":"What motivates Chinese consumers to avoid information about the COVID-19 pandemic?: The perspective of the stimulus-organism-response model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A safe, efficacious and deployable vaccine is urgently needed to control COVID-19 pandemic.

We investigated and discussed such use of technologies, wondering if and how it helped to compensate for the diminishment in social health, usually gained trough social interactions and the practice of sport and physical activity. We examined how reduction of mobility, social distancing and isolation measures imposed by the government to reduce the spread of COVID-19, affected the living conditions of the older adults, in particular their social health, and the level of sport and physical activity they were engaged in. We collected data through interviews with the subjects, assessing their social networks, the perceived social support provided by their family members, friends and caregivers, and the level of sport and physical activity they were engaged in. Moreover, we analysed the impact of technological communications devices, which were employed to help older adults to maintain their relationships with the outside world and to preserve their active life. The interview questions were formulated based on the Lubben Social Network Scale-Revised (LSNS-R), the short version of the Social Support List (SSL12-I) for the elderly and the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE). A relationship was found between the social health related to physical activity of the older adults subjects during the COVID-19 emergency and the use of communications technologies, which played a role in mitigating the impact of the crisis on their social health by helping them to keep physically and socially active.

Reactivation of HBV refers to an increase in the HBV load caused by chemotherapy in a patient with HBV infection. Reactivation of HBV is classified into 2 categories: reactivation in a carrier and reactivation in a patient with resolved HBV infection. Because hepatitis caused by HBV reactivation is more likely to become severe and makes the treatment of original diseases difficult, it is most important to prevent the onset of hepatitis. The basic strategy for prevention and treatment of HBV reactivation associated with powerful chemotherapy regimens should follow the guidelines for the management of hepatitis B virus infection by the Japan Society of Hepatology. Risk of HBV reactivation is determined by HBV infection status and the degree of immunosuppression. HBV infection status is classified into chronic active hepatitis, inactive carrier, and resolved infection. This corresponds, in descending order, to the risk of reactivation. Patients undergoing chemotherapy should be screened for HBV infection. HBsAg levels should be measured in all patients prior to commencement of treatment. In HBsAg-positive patients, HBeAg, anti-HBe antibody, and HBV DNA levels should also be measured. In HBsAg-negative patients, anti-HBc antibody and anti-HBs antibody should be measured. The next step for patients with resolved HBV infection is measurement of HBV DNA levels. In patients with resolved HBV infection whose HBV DNA level is 20 IU/mL or higher, as in inactive carriers, prophylactic therapy should be commenced before chemotherapy. In patients with resolved HBV infection whose HBV DNA level is less than 20 IU/mL, periodic monitoring of HBV DNA should be performed during and after chemotherapy. Preemptive therapy should be started immediately if the HBV DNA level ex- ceeds 20 IU/mL.","output":"[Viral Hepatitis]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mental health providers' usage of telehealth modalities saw an exponential increase in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Some experts have suggested that it takes considerable time, education, consultation, and/or supervision to develop the new technology-based competencies. Education is required to understand not just the technologies, but the practices (e.g., ethical, legal, safety planning), differences from face-to-face care, and workflows. Given the need for rapid transition due to COVID-19, it is unclear how providers prepared for the integration of telehealth with their traditional practices. As such, the purpose of the present study was to examine mental health providers' educational activities prior to and post telehealth implementation. Four hundred and four practicing providers (i.e., psychologists, counselors, therapists, social workers) were assessed via an online researcher-created survey. Results indicated significant increases in telehealth usage following COVID-19, with videoconferencing being the most common modality used. Although approximately 74% of surveyed providers sought telehealth education prior to usage, approximately 26% did not. In supplement of anything learned prior, approximately 61% indicated pursuing additional education post implementation. Taken together, a significant portion of providers can be viewed as having gained information that guided ethical, legal, and safe clinical services. Nevertheless, with consideration of the breadth and duration of the educational activities pursued, many providers would likely still benefit from additional education to foster a more complete understanding of the new telehealth competencies. Details regarding usage and educational activities are discussed. Application of information is outlined. Findings can help provide direction for additional educational efforts for providers.

As new competencies, the use of telehealth methods requires specialized education to develop both knowledge and skill. Such expertise is essential due to the unique factors of telehealth utilization, including how the technology can require modification of one's clinical practice when compared to face-to-face care. Although many surveyed providers indicated seeking education prior to and post telehealth implementation, a portion provided responses suggesting that they could benefit from additional education to ensure the highest levels of competency, and thus care. Additional education should focus on both knowledge and applied skill development.

As such, there is urgent need to identify predictors of clinical severity in COVID-19 patients. This may be useful for early identification of patients who may require life-saving interventions. In this meta-analysis, we evaluated whether malignancies are associated with a significantly enhanced odds of COVID-19 severity and mortality. METHOD: A systematic search of literature was conducted between November 1, 2019, to May 26th, 2020 on PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) to identify studies reporting data on cancers in patients with or without severe COVID-19 were included. The primary outcome of interest was the association between malignancies and COVID-19 severity, while the secondary outcome was the association between malignancies and COVID-19 mortality. Data were pooled into a meta-analysis to estimate pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for either outcome. RESULTS: A total of 20 studies (n = 4549 patients) were included. Overall, malignancies were found to be associated with significantly increased odds of COVID-19 severity (OR = 2.17; 95% CI 1.47-3.196; p < 0.001) and mortality (OR = 2.39; 95% CI 1.18-4.85; p = 0.016). No heterogeneity was observed for both outcomes (Cochran's Q = 6.558, p = 0.922, I2 = 0% and Cochran's Q = 2.91, p = 0.71, I2 = 0% respectively). CONCLUSION: Malignancies were significantly associated with a 2-fold increase in the odds of developing severe COVID-19 disease, as well as mortality. Larger studies are needed to corroborate these findings. These patients should be closely monitored for any signs of unfavorable disease progression.","output":"Cancer is associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severity and mortality: A pooled analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine hesitancy has surfaced globally within the last few decades, and the fears and misconceptions of people about vaccine safety and effectiveness have been identified as key factors for their under-utilization.

The present exploratory cross-sectional study was designed, planned and carried out on students enrolled in health science and non-health science courses in one of the public universities of Malaysia. A research instrument that had been formulated, validated and subjected to reliability testing was used to collect the data, which were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. A response rate of 80.8% (n = 202) was obtained: the majority were female (n = 161, 79.7%), and had been vaccinated before (n = 190, 97.5%), while a mere 2% did not support vaccination for reasons pertaining to safety issues. The vaccine familiarity score was 10.79  1.4, which significantly differed among the study disciplines (p < 0.001).

This study developed a robust and straightforward assay that detected the molecular interaction between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of viral spike protein and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in just 10 min. A drug library of 1068 approved compounds was used to screen for SARS-CoV2 entry inhibition, and 9 active drugs were identified as specific pseudovirus entry inhibitors. A plaque reduction neutralization test using authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus in Vero E6 cells confirmed that 2 of these drugs (Etravirine and Dolutegravir) significantly inhibited the infection of SARS-CoV-2. With molecular docking, we showed that both Etravirine and Dolutegravir are preferentially bound to primary ACE2-interacting residues on the RBD domain, implying that these two drug blocks may prohibit the viral attachment of SARS-CoV-2. We compared the neutralizing activities of these entry inhibitors against different pseudoviruses carrying spike proteins from alpha, beta, gamma, and delta variants. Both Etravirine and Dolutegravir showed similar neutralizing activities against different variants, with EC50 values between 4.5 to 5.8 nM for Etravirine and 10.2 to 22.9 nM for Dolutegravir.

Neutralization experiments revealed that immunity induced by COVID vaccines widely administered to human populations is not effective against BA.2, similar to BA.1, and that the antigenicity of BA.2 is notably different from that of BA.1. Cell culture experiments showed that the BA.2 spike confers higher replication efficacy in human nasal epithelial cells and is more efficient in mediating syncytia formation than the BA.1 spike.

The inhibition of the activity of the two key cytokines, IFN and IL-6, can significantly reduce or even reverse the development of the cytokine storm. The objective of our investigations is to reveal the anti-inflammatory potential of heparin for prevention and suppression of the development of CRS in acute COVID-19 patients. The effect of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) on IFN signalling inside the stimulated WISH cells was investigated by measuring its antiproliferative activity and the translocation of phosphorylated STAT1 in the nucleus. The mechanism of heparin binding to IFN and IL-6 and therefore inhibition of their activity was studied by means of extensive molecular-dynamics simulations. We find that LMWH binds with high affinity to IFN and is able to inhibit fully the interaction with its cellular receptor. It also influences the biological activity of IL-6 by binding to either IL-6 or IL-6/IL-6R thus preventing the formation of the IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 signaling complex. Our conclusion is that heparin is a potent anti-inflammatory agent that can be used in acute inflammatory conditions, due to its potential to inhibit both IFN  and IL-6 signalling pathways. Based on our results and available clinical observations, we suggest the administration of LMWH to COVID-19 patients in the initial stages of the acute phase. The beginning of the treatment and the dosage should be based on a careful follow-up of the platelet count and the D-dimer, IL-6, IFN, T-cells, and B-cells levels.","output":"Heparin as an Anti-Inflammatory Agent"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study analyzes five publicly posted videos wherein Asians experience interpersonal discrimination because of COVID-19.

Then, we investigate how the non-Gaussianity of the variables affects the coupling structure of them. By applying the multifractal method, one can see that the non-Gaussianity depends on the scales. While the non-Gaussianity of unemployment is noticeable only for periods smaller than 1 year and for longer periods tends to Gaussian behavior, the non-Gaussianities of inflation persist for all time scales. Also, it is observed that the coupling structure of these variables tends to a Gaussian behavior after $2$ years.","output":"Coupled criticality analysis of inflation and unemployment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Little is known as yet about the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children being treated for cancer.

The secondary aims were to identify any other prognostic factors for cholesteatoma recidivism. METHODS: A retrospective single-centre study of 312 patients who underwent cholesteatoma surgery under the care of a single-surgeon, between 2004 and 2018, was performed. Waiting times for surgery were categorised into &#8804; 90 days, 91-180 days, 181-270 days and > 271 days. The outcome measures were cholesteatoma recidivism and major complications (facial nerve palsy or intracranial complications). RESULTS: The mean age was 36.1 years  21.5 with 242 adults (77.6%) and 70 children (22.4%). The mean waiting time for surgery was 126.2 days (4.1 months)  96.0 days and the overall rate of recidivism was 11.2% (35/312 patients). No instances of facial nerve palsy or intracranial complications were identified.

Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the cumulative incidence of hepatic encephalopathy in the TIPS group was higher than that of the drug combined gastroscopy group (&#967;(2) = 11.29, P < 0.01). The incidence of severe hepatic encephalopathy ( grade III to IV) at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery in the TIPS group was 2.7% (2/74), 0, 0, and 0, respectively. The incidence of severe hepatic encephalopathy in drug combined gastroscopy group was 0, and there was no statistically significant difference in development of hepatic encephalopathy between the two groups (P > 0.05). The re-bleeding rates of TIPS group and drug combined gastroscopy group were 0 and 27.3% (18/66), respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (&#967;(2) = 22.42, P < 0.01). There was no death reported during the follow-up period between both groups. The hospitalization frequency times (1.45  0.80) in TIPS group was lower than that of the drug combined gastroscopy group times (3.24  1.80), and the difference was statistically significant (U = -4.52, P < 0.01). Conclusion: In the prevention of esophageal-gastric variceal bleeding, TIPS (ePTFE-covered stent) treatment has the advantages of reducing re-bleeding rate, high ascites remission rate and hospitalizations frequency. In addition, patients treated with TIPS have a higher incidence of hepatic encephalopathy than that of drugs combined with gastroscopy. However, TIPS did not exacerbate the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy, and there was no significant difference in the 1-year survival rate after TIPS and drugs combined with gastroscopy treatment.","output":"[Comparison of the curative effect of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene-covered stent and drug combined with gastroscopy as the secondary prevention of esophageal -gastric variceal bleeding in portal hypertension]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper identifies the perceptions of first-year undergraduate students from the Faculty of Physical Education and Sports in Galati on online teaching activities, dominant and needful in the current pandemic context.

Emerging emergence has suggested that several factors may be associated with increased risk from severe outcomes or death from COVID-19. Clinical risk prediction tools have significant potential to generate individualised assessment of risk and may be useful for population stratification and other use cases. Methods and analysis: We will use a prospective open cohort study of routinely collected data from 1205 general practices in England in the QResearch database. The primary outcome is COVID-19 mortality (in or out-of-hospital) defined as confirmed or suspected COVID-19 mentioned on the death certificate, or death occurring in a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection between 24th January and 30th April 2020. Our primary outcome in adults is COVID-19 mortality (including out of hospital and in hospital deaths). We will also examine COVID-19 hospitalisation in children. Time-to-event models will be developed in the training data to derive separate risk equations in adults (19-100 years) for males and females for evaluation of risk of each outcome within the 3-month follow-up period (24th January to 30th April 2020), accounting for competing risks. Predictors considered will include age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass index, pre-existing medical co-morbidities, and concurrent medication. Measures of performance (prediction errors, calibration and discrimination) will be determined in the test data for men and women separately and by ten-year age group. For children, descriptive statistics will be undertaken if there are currently too few serious events to allow development of a risk model. The final model will be externally evaluated in (a) geographically separate practices and (b) other relevant datasets as they become available.

METHODS: Design: Descriptive analysis of CRE HAIs and retrospective observational cohort study using national HAI surveillance data. Setting: Egyptian hospitals participating in the HAI surveillance system. The patient population included patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in participating hospitals. Enterobacteriaceae HAI cases were Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter isolates from blood, urine, wound or respiratory specimen collected on or after day 3 of ICU admission. CRE HAI cases were those resistant to at least one carbapenem. For CRE HAI cases reported during 2011C2017, a hospital-level and patient-level analysis were conducted using only the first CRE isolate by pathogen and specimen type for each patient. For facility, microbiology, and clinical characteristics, frequencies and means were calculated among CRE HAI cases and compared with carbapenem-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae HAI cases through univariate and multivariate logistic regression using STATA 13. RESULTS: There were 1598 Enterobacteriaceae HAI cases, of which 871 (54.1%) were carbapenem resistant. The multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that carbapenem resistance was associated with specimen type, pathogen, location prior to admission, and length of ICU stay. Between 2011 and 2017, there was an increase in the proportion of Enterobacteriaceae HAI cases due to CRE (p-value = 0.003) and the incidence of CRE HAIs (p-value = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrated a high and increasing burden of CRE in Egyptian hospitals, highlighting the importance of enhancing infection prevention and control (IPC) programs and antimicrobial stewardship activities and guiding the implementation of targeted IPC measures to contain CRE in Egyptian ICUs .","output":"Epidemiology of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in Egyptian intensive care units using National HealthcareCassociated Infections Surveillance Data, 2011C2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to assess COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among Muslims in Malaysia.

The risks of low performing supply chains are detrimental for the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, with potential consequences to future supply in the case of adverse events. For this reason, a study was set up to explore the involvement of developing country manufacturers in the vaccine supply chain over the next decade to determine the areas where innovations could have a positive impact on the supply chain, focusing on the secondary stages of production where formulation, filling and packaging take place. An expert desk review identified eight areas of interest for the vaccine supply chain and informed the development of a survey to assess the relevance of the areas identified. The review also conjectured whether the overall effect of the identified areas is cost-neutral or resulting in net savings to countries. Overall, respondents identified five areas as of highest interest and subsequently an expert working group of representative manufacturers prioritized three of them. Specifically, traceability in the context of global digital health initiatives, stockpiling in the context of addressing vaccine shortages, stock-outs, outbreaks and epidemic prevention, and new packaging technologies are discussed in this report.

METHODS: We propose a novel, integrative, and neural network-based literature-based discovery (LBD) approach to identify drug candidates from PubMed and other COVID-19-focused research literature. Our approach relies on semantic triples extracted using SemRep (via SemMedDB). We identified an informative and accurate subset of semantic triples using filtering rules and an accuracy classifier developed on a BERT variant. We used this subset to construct a knowledge graph, and applied five state-of-the-art, neural knowledge graph completion algorithms (i.e., TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, and STELP) to predict drug repurposing candidates. The models were trained and assessed using a time slicing approach and the predicted drugs were compared with a list of drugs reported in the literature and evaluated in clinical trials. These models were complemented by a discovery pattern-based approach. RESULTS: Accuracy classifier based on PubMedBERT achieved the best performance (F1 = 0.854) in identifying accurate semantic predications. Among five knowledge graph completion models, TransE outperformed others (MR = 0.923, Hits@1 = 0.417). Some known drugs linked to COVID-19 in the literature were identified, as well as others that have not yet been studied. Discovery patterns enabled identification of additional candidate drugs and generation of plausible hypotheses regarding the links between the candidate drugs and COVID-19. Among them, five highly ranked and novel drugs (i.e., paclitaxel, SB 203580, alpha 2-antiplasmin, metoclopramide, and oxymatrine) and the mechanistic explanations for their potential use are further discussed. CONCLUSION: We showed that a LBD approach can be feasible not only for discovering drug candidates for COVID-19, but also for generating mechanistic explanations.

Methods: Forty-six hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia hospitalized at Wuhan Union Hospital from January 20 to February 25, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether they received corticosteroid treatment. The clinical symptoms and chest computed tomography(CT) results were compared. Results: A total of 26 patients received intravenous administration of methylprednisolone with a dosage of 1-2mg/kg/d for 5-7 days, while the remaining patients not. There was no significant difference in age, sex, comorbidities, clinical or laboratory parameters between the two groups on admission. The average number of days for body temperature back to the normal range was significantly shorter in patients with administration of methylprednisolone when compared to those without administration of methylprednisolone (2.06  0.28 vs. 5.29  0.70, P=0.010). The patients with administration of methylprednisolone had a faster improvement of SpO2, while patients without administration of methylprednisolone had a significantly longer interval of using supplemental oxygen therapy (8.2days[IQR 7.0-10.3] vs. 13.5days(IQR 10.3-16); P<0.001). In terms of chest CT, the absorption degree of the focus was significantly better in patients with administration of methylprednisolone. Conclusion: Our data indicate that in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early, low-dose and short-term application of corticosteroid was associated with a faster improvement of clinical symptoms and absorption of lung focus.","output":"Early, low-dose and short-term application of corticosteroid treatment in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia: single-center experience from Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals have developed visitor restriction policies in order to mitigate spread of infection. We reviewed hospital visitor restriction policies for consistency and to develop recommendations to highlight fair and transparent restrictions, exceptions, and appeals in policy development and implementation. DESIGN: Collection and analysis of public-facing visitor restriction policies during the first 3 months of the pandemic. SETTING: General acute care hospitals representing 23 states across all 4 major regions of the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of the 70 largest hospitals by total bed capacity. MEASUREMENTS: Characteristics of visitor restriction policies including general visitor restriction statement, changes/updates to policies over time, exceptions to policies, and restrictions specific to COVID-19-positive patients. RESULTS: Sixty-five of the 70 hospitals reviewed had public-facing visitor restriction policies. Forty-nine of these 65 policies had general \\"no-visitor\\" statements, whereas 16 allowed at least 1 visitor to accompany all patients. Sixty-three of 65 hospitals included exceptions to their visitor restriction policies. Setting-specific exceptions included pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, emergency department, behavioral health, inpatient rehabilitation, surgery, and outpatient clinics. Exceptions that applied across settings included patients at end of life and patients with disabilities. CONCLUSION: Visitor restriction policies varied significantly among hospitals in this review. These variances create challenges in that their fair application may be problematic and ethical issues related to allocation may arise. Five recommendations are offered for hospitals revising or creating such policies, including that offering transparent, accessible, public-facing policies can minimize ethical dilemmas. In addition, hospitals would benefit from communicating with each other in the development of visitor policies to ensure uniformity and support patients and family members as they navigate hospital visitation.","output":"Hospital Policies During COVID-19: An Analysis of Visitor Restrictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. n) is an important opportunistic pathogen causing oral and gastrointestinal disease. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. p) is a next-generation probiotic and could serve as a biomarker of gut eubiosis/dysbiosis to some extent. Alterations in the human oral and gut microbiomes are associated with viral respiratory infection. The aim of this study was to characterise the oral and fecal bacterial biomarker (i.e., F. n and F. p) in COVID-19 patients by qPCR and investigate the pharyngeal microbiome of COVID-19 patients through metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). RESULTS: Pharyngeal F. n was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients, and it was higher in male than female patients. Increased abundance of pharyngeal F. n was associated with a higher risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adjusted OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.06 ~ 1.65, P < 0.05). A classifier to distinguish COVID-19 patients from the healthy controls based on the pharyngeal F. n was constructed and achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.843 (95% CI = 0.688 ~ 0.940, P < 0.001). However, the level of fecal F. n and fecal F. p remained unaltered between groups. Besides, mNGS showed that the pharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients were dominated by opportunistic pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Pharyngeal but not fecal F. n was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients, clinicians should pay careful attention to potential coinfection. Pharyngeal F. n may serve as a promising candidate indicator for COVID-19.

Our knowledge concerning every aspect of COVID-19 is evolving rapidly, given the increasing data from all over the world. In this narrative review, the Turkish Thoracic Society Early Career Taskforce members aimed to provide a summary on recent literature regarding epidemiology, clinical findings, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control of COVID-19. Studies revealed that the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus showed significant identity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor is an important target of the SARS-CoV-2 while entering an organism. Smokers were more likely to develop the disease and have a higher risk for ICU admission. The mean incubation period was 6.4 days, whereas asymptomatic transmission was reported up to 25 days after infection. Fever and cough were the most common symptoms, and cardiovascular diseases and hypertension were reported to be the most common comorbidities among patients. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic and mild disease to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Several patients showed typical symptoms and radiological changes with negative RT-PCR but positive IgG and IgM antibodies. Although radiological findings may vary, bilateral, peripherally distributed, ground-glass opacities were typical of COVID-19. Poor prognosis was associated with older age, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and high D-dimer level. Chloroquine was found to be effective in reducing viral replication in vitro. Likewise, protease inhibitors, including lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, and nucleoside analogue remdesivir were proposed to be the potential drug candidates in COVID-19 management.

These fatty acids, conjugated to trehalose or to arabinogalactan form the backbone of the mycomembrane. While mycolic acids are essential to the survival of some species, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, their absence is not lethal for Corynebacterium glutamicum, which has been extensively used as a model to depict their biosynthesis. Mycolic acids are first synthesized on the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane and transferred onto trehalose to give trehalose monomycolate (TMM). TMM is subsequently transported to the periplasm by dedicated transporters and used by mycoloyltransferase enzymes to synthesize all the other mycolate-containing compounds. Using a random transposition mutagenesis, we recently identified a new uncharacterized protein (Cg1246) involved in mycolic acid metabolism. Cg1246 belongs to the DUF402 protein family that contains some previously characterized nucleoside phosphatases. In this study, we performed a functional and structural characterization of Cg1246. We showed that absence of the protein led to a significant reduction in the pool of TMM in C. glutamicum, resulting in a decrease in all other mycolate-containing compounds. We found that, in vitro, Cg1246 has phosphatase activity on organic pyrophosphate substrates but is most likely not a nucleoside phosphatase. Using a computational approach, we identified important residues for phosphatase activity and constructed the corresponding variants in C. glutamicum. Surprisingly complementation with these non-functional proteins fully restored the defect in TMM of the cg1246 mutant strain, suggesting that in vivo, the phosphatase activity is not involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis.","output":"Cg1246, a new player in mycolic acid biosynthesis in Corynebacterium glutamicum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main purpose of this research was to demonstrate the changes in 25(OH)D concentration, bone resorption markers, and physical fitness along the one-year training season in young soccer players.

The role of thyroid autoimmunity and SARS-CoV-2 viral load in SARS-CoV-2-related thyroid dysfunction is unclear. We evaluated the thyroid function of a cohort of COVID-19 patients, in relation to their clinical features, biochemical, immunological and inflammatory markers. METHODS: Consecutive adult patients, without known thyroid disorders, admitted to Queen Mary Hospital for COVID-19 from 21 July to 21 August, 2020 were included. Serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine (fT3) and anti-thyroid antibodies were measured on admission. RESULTS: Among 191 patients with COVID-19 (mean age 53.5  17.2 years; 51.8% male), 84.3% were mild, 12.6% were moderate, and 3.1% were severe. 13.1% had abnormal thyroid function. Ten patients had isolated low TSH, suggestive of subclinical thyrotoxicosis due to thyroiditis, although the contribution of autoimmunity was likely in two of them. Autoimmune thyroiditis probably also contributed to subclinical hypothyroidism in another patient. Ten patients had isolated low fT3, likely representing non-thyroidal illness syndrome. Lower SARS-Cov-2 PCR cycle threshold values and elevated C-reactive protein were independently associated with occurrence of low TSH (p=0.030) and low fT3 (p=0.007) respectively. A decreasing trend of fT3 with increasing COVID-19 severity (p=0.032) was found. Patients with low fT3 had more adverse COVID-19-related outcomes. CONCLUSION: Around 15% of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 had thyroid dysfunction. There may be a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 on thyroid function, potentially leading to exacerbation of pre-existing autoimmune thyroid disease. Low fT3, associated with systemic inflammation, may have a prognostic significance.","output":"Thyroid Dysfunction in Relation to Immune Profile, Disease Status and Outcome in 191 Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Angioplasty and Stenting of intracranial atherosclerotic lesions have a higher complication rate and a large proportion of this is attributable to side branch arterial occlusion from forceful displacement of the atheroma into the ostia or snowplowing effect.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We present a series of 6 cases utilizing a new dual catheter technique for maintaining the patency of at-risk vessels during angioplasty and stenting. There are several methods previously described to help reduce the incidence of stroke but because they do not have a physical presence in the ostia to protect it, they are unable to guarantee the patency of the vessel. RESULTS All 6 patients underwent angioplasty and stenting with the technique. The patients were assessed for complications with post-procedure magnetic resonance imaging and no complications were found. CONCLUSION In this preliminary series, the dual catheter technique appears to safe and effective in preventing occlusion of the adjacent branch arteries.

Patients and Methods: Using the nationwide health insurance claims data of 7590 confirmed COVID-19 patients, we estimated average medical expenses and inpatient days per patient, and performed multivariate negative binomial, and gamma regressions to determine influencing factors for higher outcomes. Results: According to the results, COVID-19 patients with history of ICU admission, chest CT imaging, lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine use stayed longer in the hospital and spent more on medical expenses, and anti-hypertensive drugs were insignificantly associated with the outcomes. Female patients stayed longer in the hospital in the over 65 age group but spent less in medical expenses that the 20-39 group. In the 40-69 age group, patients with health insurance stayed longer in the hospital and spent more on medical expenses than those aged over 65 years. Comorbidities did not affect outcomes in most age groups. Conclusion: In summary, contrary to popular beliefs, medical expenses and length of hospitalization were mostly influenced by age, and not by comorbidities, anti-viral, or anti-hypertensive drugs.

An early lytic gene of KSHV encodes viral interleukin-6 (vIL-6), a viral homologue of the proinflammatory cytokine and an autocrine/paracrine growth factor human IL-6. In this study, we examined the effects of suppressing vIL-6 expression in PEL cells with antisense peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMO). PPMO are ssDNA-analogues that have a modified backbone and enter cells readily. Treatment of PEL cells with a PPMO designed against vIL-6 mRNA led to a marked reduction in the proportion of vIL-6-positive cells detected by immunofluorescence assay. Analysis by Western blot confirmed a specific reduction in the vIL-6 protein level and showed that the reduction was dependent on the dose of vIL-6 PPMO. PEL cells treated with the vIL-6 PPMO exhibited reduced levels of cellular growth, IL-6 expression and KSHV DNA, and an elevated level of p21 protein. Treatment of PEL cells with a combination of two vIL-6 PPMO compounds targeting different sequences in the vIL-6 mRNA led to an inhibitory effect that was greater than that achieved with either PPMO alone. These results show that PPMO targeting vIL-6 mRNA can potently reduce vIL-6 protein translation and indicate that further exploration of these compounds in an animal model for potential clinical application is warranted.","output":"Blockade of viral interleukin-6 expression of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a deep impact on the way we perceive our world.

We conducted a series of surveys based on open and closed questions. Before the pandemic, surveys were carried out in situ in eight parks of six districts, randomly chosen. During the confinement, online surveys were conducted. According to our results, the mean UGS density in CABA is 6.09 m 2 /person, but marked differences between districts exist, ranging from 0.02 m 2 /person to 17.68 m 2 /person. This uneven distribution causes differences in the quality of life of CABA inhabitants, perhaps more pronounced during reduced-mobility situations like COVID-19 confinement. Regarding UGS visitors, before the confinement, the majority of respondents were employees or students;during the confinement, employees and retirees predominated. When asked to choose important attributes to describe their perception about the UGS from a given list, respondents selected calm, green, and sounds of nature, without differences before and during the confinement. However, when asked about the UGS role, the main answer was a place to be with nature before the confinement and an important place in the city during it.

The purpose of this study was to examine the safety and efficacy of percutaneous ablation in achieving pain palliation and local tumor control of osseous metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS A retrospective review was performed of 76 musculoskeletal metastases in 45 patients treated with percutaneous ablation. 63% (48/76) were treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), 35% (27/76) with cryoablation, and 1.3% (1/76) with microwave ablation (MWA). In 70% (53/76) of cases, associated cementoplasty was performed. Primary outcomes measured were pre- and post-procedure pain scores 4 weeks after treatment and local tumor control at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. RESULTS Mean age of the cohort was 63.6  9.5 years. Median tumor diameter was 3.60 cm (range 1.0-10.0 cm). Mean and median pain scores before treatment were 7.5  2.3 and 8.0, respectively. Post-procedure, patients reported significantly decreased pain scores at 4 weeks (mean, 3.7  3.5; median, 3.0; p < 0.00001).

Thus, great efforts have been devoted to optimizing process parameters to minimize the warpage and shrinkage deformations of products during the last decades. In this review, we begin by introducing the manufacturing process in PIM and the cause of warpage and shrinkage deformations, followed by the mechanism about how process parameters, like mold temperature, melt temperature, injection rate, injection pressure, holding pressure, holding and cooling duration, affect those defects. Then, we summarize the recent progress of the design of experiments and four advanced methods (artificial neural networks, genetic algorithm, response surface methodology, and Kriging model) on optimizing process parameters to minimize the warpage and shrinkage deformations.

Materials and Methods: In this survey study, an online questionnaire consisting of 40 questions was directed to actively working ophthalmologists. The questions asked about demographic characteristics, working conditions and schedule, follow-up of ophthalmology patients, and levels of knowledge and anxiety about the pandemic. Results: This study included 161 ophthalmologists (78 women and 83 men). They were predominantly consultant ophthalmologists (71%), with 128 living in metropolitan areas. More than half (54.4%) reported decreased weekly working hours, 52.5% were attending routine outpatient clinics, 52.8% were working in COVID-19-related units, 67.1% were performing only emergency operations, and 52% reported disrupted follow-up of chronic eye patients. Sixty-four percent thought that ophthalmologists were in the high-risk group, and nearly all participants used masks while working (99%). Additionally, 91% expressed high anxiety regarding the pandemic, most commonly due to the risk of transmitting the disease to family (83%), and 12.5% considered their level of knowledge about the pandemic to be insufficient. Forty-six percent of the participants thought that daily life conditions would normalize in 2 to 5 months. Conclusion: Close proximity during patient examination causes ophthalmologists concern about their risk. The increasing number of COVID-19 cases resulted in a proportional decrease in the number of patients and surgeries in ophthalmology clinics in our country. As a result, ophthalmologists are unwillingly appointed to high-risk units.

In the absence of feasible local options, free tissue transfer can be a versatile and reliable alternative. The aim of this study was to describe our experience with the use of the free proximal ulnar artery perforator flap (PUPF). Methods: Our prospectively maintained free flap database was inquired for patients that had undergone digital reconstructions with free PUPFs. Results: Six patients that underwent digital reconstruction were eligible. The ipsilateral forearm was donor site of choice, with all flaps based on a perforator of the ulnar artery, without the need to compromise the main vessel. A superficial vein was routinely included with the flap. No flap failures were encountered. Mean hospital stay was 5.5 days, and all patients achieved a satisfactory functional result. Conclusions: The proximal ulnar perforator free flap offers an alternative for finger reconstruction, having the advantage of including thin and hairless skin from the proximal ulnar forearm. The vascular anatomy of the ulnar perforators seems to be constant. Furthermore, donor site morbidity is low, as the ulnar artery is not harvested with the flap, the donor site defect can generally be closed directly, and the scar is well concealed.","output":"Reconstruction of Digital Defects with the Free Proximal Ulnar Artery Perforator Flap"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Low dose dexamethasone demonstrated clinical improvement in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) needing oxygen therapy; however, evidence on the efficacy of high dose of dexamethasone is limited. METHODS: We performed a randomised, open-label, controlled trial involving hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia needing oxygen therapy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive low dose dexamethasone (6 mg once daily for 10 days) or high dose dexamethasone (20 mg once daily for 5 days, followed by 10 mg once daily for additional 5 days). The primary outcome was clinical worsening within 11 days since randomisation. Secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality, time to recovery, and clinical status at day 5, 11, 14 and 28 on an ordinal scale ranging from 1 (discharged) to 7 (death). RESULTS: A total of 200 patients (mean (sd) age, 64 (14) years; 62% male) were enrolled. Thirty-two patients of 102 (31.4%) enrolled in the low dose group and 16 of 98 (16.3%) in the high dose group showed clinical worsening within 11 days since randomisation (rate ratio, 0.427; 95% CI, 0.216C0.842; p=0.014).

For this perspective paper, we posit that they do not. Concepts and measures related to the adaptive functions and well-being areas of emotion research cannot simply be transferred for use in advertising research. When a commercial elicits emotions, the emotions staged in the commercial must not be directly associated with the emotions felt by consumers when exposed to those commercials. This is why aesthetic emotions seem more appropriate than utilitarian emotions in advertising research, with the former generally felt more significantly than they are acted upon. Aesthetic emotions elicit limited physiological change, and they rely on the intrinsic pleasantness appraisal of commercials. Accordingly, pleasure and displeasureas observed through expressive and subjective components of aesthetic emotionoften form the first and only step of commercial appraisal, and they are directed toward attitude formation rather than overt behaviors. Our preliminary psychophysiological study shows this by investigating the contributions of psychophysiological and self-reported measures of aesthetic emotions induced by commercials to explain attitudes toward advertisements. The results show that only two components of aesthetic emotion positively influenced attitudes toward the advertisements: expressive (measured by facial electromyography) and subjective (measured by the self-assessment manikin scale). Also, the subjective component of aesthetic emotion partially mediates the effects of the expressive components on attitudes toward the ads. Our exploratory study illustrates the relevance of focusing on aesthetic emotions in advertising research. It also shed new light on the contributions of the physiological, expressive, and subjective feelings components of aesthetic emotions in advertising effectiveness.","output":"Looking at Aesthetic Emotions in Advertising Research Through a Psychophysiological Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Suicide and suicidal behaviors were already a global public health problem, producing preventable injuries and deaths.

Previous studies, performed in serum-free media, determined that retrocyclins 1 (RC1) and RC2 could prevent successful germination of Bacillus anthracis spores, kill vegetative B. anthracis cells, and inactivate anthrax lethal factor. We now report that retrocyclins are extensively bound by components of native mouse, human, and fetal calf sera, that heat-inactivated sera show greatly enhanced retrocyclin binding, and that native and (especially) heat-inactivated sera greatly reduce the direct activities of retrocyclins against spores and vegetative cells of B. anthracis. Nevertheless, we also found that retrocyclins protected mice challenged in vivo by subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, or intranasal instillation of B. anthracis spores. Retrocyclin 1 bound extensively to B. anthracis spores and enhanced their phagocytosis and killing by murine RAW264.7 cells. Based on the assumption that spore-bound RC1 enters phagosomes by \\"piggyback phagocytosis,\\" model calculations showed that the intraphagosomal concentration of RC1 would greatly exceed its extracellular concentration.

The majority of children have mild or no symptoms. Similar to adults, a minority of children can be severely affected with respiratory distress requiring intensive care. Finally, they may develop a phenomenon presumed unique to children termed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). MIS-C is a hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by fever and organ dysfunction (particularly cardiac) in the setting of recent COVID-19 infection. Reports from the adult literature have invoked thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and complement activation as a potential cause for severe manifestations of COVID-19 (Zhang et al. NEJM. 2020; Campbell et al. Circulation 2020). Soluble C5b9 (sC5b-9), the terminal complement complex, has been implicated as a marker of hematopoietic stem cell transplant associated TMA (HSCT-TMA; Jodele et al. Blood 2014). We sought to elucidate the role of terminal complement activation and TMA in the different pediatric disease phenotypes. Methods: We enrolled children admitted to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia during the COVID-19 pandemic who had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from mucosa, or met clinical criteria for MIS-C. Patients (pts) were classified in to 3 categories: minimal COVID-19 symptoms or incidental finding of SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe COVID-19 requiring ventilatory support, or MIS-C. To investigate the role of TMA in children with COVID-19 we measured sC5b-9 in plasma of pts with the 3 manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, and in healthy controls. sC5b9 was measured in triplicate at two dilutions by ELISA. Proinflammatory cytokines were measured using V-Plex Pro-inflammatory Panel 1 Human Kits and analyzed on a QuickPlex SQ120. P-values were computed using Dunn's multiple comparisons test after Kruskal-Wallis testing. Blood smears were examined by a hematologist and hematopathologist for schistocytes. Results: 50 pts were enrolled on whom complete sC5b9 data were available: minimal COVID-19 (N=18), severe COVID-19 (N=11), and MIS-C (N=21). Plasma was obtained on healthy controls (N=26). The median sC5b9 level in healthy controls (57 ng/mL) differed significantly (p<0.001 in each case; Figure 1A) from that in pts with minimal disease (392 ng/mL), severe disease (646 ng/mL), and MIS-C (630 ng/mL); differences between MIS-C, minimal, and severe were not statistically significant. Elevations in sC5b9 correlated in a statistically significant manner with the maximum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) measured during hospitalization (Figure 1B&C), but not age (p=0.512). sC5b9 did not correlate with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), nor with the lowest levels of fibrinogen, hemoglobin or platelet counts. Of pts with available data, 19/26 (73.1%) had elevated LDH, 2/31 (6.4%) had hypofibrinogenemia, 35/47 (74.5%) were anemic, and 28/47 (59.6%) were thrombocytopenic. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured. Of particular interest to TMA is the neutrophil chemotactic factor IL-8, because of its role as a marker of endothelial damage (Dvorak et al. Front Pediatr 2019). Levels of IL-8 differed significantly between pts with MIS-C (p=0.0166) or pts with severe COVID-19 (p=0.0079), when compared to minimal COVID-19 pts; but not between pts with MIS-C and severe disease (p = 0.99). Blood smears were available on 34 patients. Schistocytes were present in 13/15 (87%) patients with MIS-C, 7/8 (87%) patients with severe COVID-19 and 5/11 (45%) patients with minimal COVID-19 (2=6.59, p=0.037). Conclusions: We demonstrate derangements of the final common pathway of complement activation in children with the 3 presentations of SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, sC5b9s were abnormal even in children with minimal disease or incidental infection. Renal dysfunction correlated with elevations in sC5b9, strengthening the evidence that TMA plays a role in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future work is aimed at further characterizing the role of the complement cascade in the pathogenesis of MIS-C and COVID-19 in children. The long-term complications of endothelial damage and complement activation are unknown and extended follow-up is warranted.

We examined adverse events (AE) following vaccination with 4vHPV from 11 years of post-marketing data, focusing on a period of enhanced surveillance and adverse events of special interest (AESI). METHODS: AE following 4vHPV doses administered between April 2007 and December 2017 reported to Australia's national regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, were examined; reports collected during enhanced surveillance in 2013 and 2014 were analyzed separately. Age and sex-specific rates, using denominator data from the national HPV vaccination register, were determined. Pre-specified AESI were identified using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA?) Preferred Terms and examined in detail. FINDINGS: Following nine million doses of 4vHPV vaccine administered in Australia, 4551 AE reports were identified. The crude reporting rate was 39.8 per 100 000 doses in the funded cohorts, excluding the enhanced surveillance period. The reported rate of syncope in 12 to 13-year-old males and females was 29.6 per 100 000 doses during enhanced surveillance and 7.1 per 100 000 doses during the remaining study period; rates of syncope were higher in younger compared to older adolescents. The rate of anaphylaxis (0.32 per 100 000 doses) was consistent with published rates. Other AESI including autoimmune disease, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, primary ovarian insufficiency, Guillain-Barr syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome and venous thromboembolism, were reported at low rates and analysis did not reveal unexpected patterns that would suggest causal association. INTERPRETATION: AESI, apart from syncope, were reported rarely. The higher rate of syncope among younger adolescents highlights the need for management protocols to prevent syncope-related injury.

The area under the ROC curves of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio was 0.918 (CI 95% 0.885-0.950) and 0.901 (CI 95% 0.872-0.930) for PaO2/FiO2 thresholds of 300 and 400 mmHg, respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) of an SpO2/FiO2 threshold of 350 for PaO2/FiO2 inferior to 300 mmHg was 0.88 (CI95% 0.84-0.91), whereas the negative predictive value (NPV) of the SpO2/FiO2 threshold of 470 for PaO2/FiO2 inferior to 400 mmHg was 0.89 (CI95% 0.75-0.96). No significant differences were found between the subgroups.

This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and identify the factors associated with suboptimal glycemic control among patients with type 2 DM during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was used to elicit information from DM patients attending six hospitals located in Chiang Rai Province, northern Thailand, between February and May 2021. A validated questionnaire and 5 mL blood specimens were used as the research tools. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) greater than 7.0% among DM patients at least two years after diagnosis was defined as suboptimal glycemic control. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to identify the associations between variables at the significance level  = 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 967 patients were recruited for this study; 54.8% 530 had suboptimal glycemic control, 58.8% were female, 66.5% were aged 50-69 years, and 78.5% were married (78.5%). Six variables were found to be associated with suboptimal glycemic control in multivariable logistic regression. Participants aged <49, 50-59, and 60-69 years had 3.32 times (95% CI = 1.99-5.53), 2.61 times (95% CI = 1.67-4.08), and 1.93 times (95% CI = 1.26-2.95) greater odds of having suboptimal glycemic control, respectively, than those aged 70 years. Married individuals had 1.64 times (95% CI = 1.11-2.41) greater odds of having suboptimal glycemic control than those ever married. Participants who consumed sticky rice had 1.61 times (95% CI = 1.19-2.61) greater odds of having suboptimal glycemic control than those who did not consume sticky rice in daily life. Participants who had been diagnosed with DM for 11-20 years and 21 years had 1.98 times (95% CI = 1.37-2.86) and 2.46 times (1.50-4.04) greater odds of having suboptimal glycemic control, respectively, than those who had been diagnosed  10 years. Participants who had experienced forgetting to take their medication had 2.10 times (95% CI = 1.43-3.09) greater odds of having suboptimal glycemic control than those who did not, and those who had their medical expenses covered by the national scheme had 2.67 times (95% CI = 1.00-7.08) greater odds of suboptimal glycemic control than those who self-paid. CONCLUSION: Effective health interventions to control blood glucose among DM patients during ongoing treatment are urgently required. The interventions should focus on patients aged less than 69 years, marital status, forgetting to take their medication, and a longer time since diagnosis, including reducing their sticky rice consumption. The effects of copayments should also be considered.","output":"Prevalence and predictors of suboptimal glycemic control among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in northern Thailand: A hospital-based cross-sectional control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is one of the leading causes of intensive care unit admission and is associated with high mortality. Noninvasive oxygenation strategies such as high-flow nasal cannula, standard oxygen therapy, and noninvasive ventilation (delivered by either face mask or helmet interface) are widely available interventions applied in these patients. It remains unclear which of these interventions are more effective in decreasing rates of invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality. The primary objective of this network meta-analysis is to summarize the evidence and compare the effect of noninvasive oxygenation strategies on mortality and need for invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. METHODS: We will search key databases for randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of noninvasive oxygenation strategies in adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. We will exclude studies in which the primary focus is either acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality (longest available up to 90 days). The secondary outcomes will be receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation (longest available up to 30 days). We will assess the risk of bias for each of the outcomes using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Bayesian network meta-analyses will be conducted to obtain pooled estimates of head-to-head comparisons. We will report pairwise and network meta-analysis treatment effect estimates as risk ratios and 95% credible intervals. Subgroup analyses will be conducted examining key populations including immunocompromised hosts. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted by excluding those studies with high risk of bias and different etiologies of acute respiratory failure. We will assess certainty in effect estimates using GRADE methodology. DISCUSSION: This study will help to guide clinical decision-making when caring for adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and improve our understanding of the limitations of the available literature assessing noninvasive oxygenation strategies in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Recovery strategies of paying ransom to the attackers with follow-on restoration and in-house full system restoration from backup are compared. METHODS: A multi-unit, patient-based and resource-constrained discrete-event simulation model of a typical U.S. urban tertiary hospital is adapted to model the attack, its impacts, and tested recovery strategies. The model is used to quantify the hospital's resilience to cyberattack. Insights were gleaned from systematically designed numerical experiments. RESULTS: While paying the ransom was found to result in some short-term gains assuming the perpetrators actually provide the decryption key as promised, in the longer term, the results of this study suggest that paying the ransom does not pay off. Rather, paying the ransom, when considered at the end of the event when services are fully restored, precluded significantly more patients from receiving critically needed care. Also noted was a lag in recovery for the intensive care unit as compared with the emergency department. Such a lag must be considered in preparedness plans. CONCLUSION: Vulnerability to cyberattacks is a major challenge to the healthcare system. This paper provides a methodology for assessing the resilience of a hospital to cyberattacks and analyzing the effects of different response strategies. The model showed that paying the ransom resulted in short-term gains but did not pay off in the longer term.","output":"Assessing resilience of hospitals to cyberattack"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the deadliest diseases in the world, especially in developed nations In recent years, it has become rampant in the developing nations such as Nigeria, posing more threats to individuals in the latter than those in the former More than 415 million people were reported to suffer from DM worldwide as of 2015, with type 2 of the disease accounting for approximately 90% of the cases The number of people with DM is expected to rise to 592 million by the year 2035 Therefore, DM is one of the growing public health concerns in Nigeria In this study, the diagnostic dataset of DM type 2 was collected from the Murtala Mohammed Specialist Hospital, Kano, and used to develop predictive supervised machine learning models based on logistic regression, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, random forest, naive Bayes and gradient booting algorithms The random forest predictive learning-based model appeared to be one of the best developed models with 88 76% in terms of accuracy;however, in terms of receiver operating characteristic curve, random forest and gradient booting predictive learning-based models were found to be the best predictive learning models with 86 28% predictive ability, respectively","output":"Predictive Supervised Machine Learning Models for Diabetes Mellitus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Murine noroviruses (MNV) are newly identified pathogens which infect laboratory mice.

Since then huSARS-CoV has evolved further into highly virulent strains with genotype T and a 29-nt deletion mutation, and weakly virulent strains with genotype C but without the 29-nt deletion. The former can cause pneumonia in humans and could be the major causative pathogen of the SARS outbreak, whereas the latter might not cause pneumonia in humans, but evolved the ability to co-utilize civet ACE2 as an entry receptor, leading to interspecies transmission between humans and civets. Three crucial time points - 1991, for the cross-species jump from bats to humans; 1998, for the formation of the human-adapted SARS-CoV; and 2003, when there was an outbreak of SARS in humans - were found to associate with anomalously low annual precipitation and high temperatures in Guangdong.

Six topics were addressed in detail by speakers and workshop participants and are reported in a series of six reports. This workshop report, the second in the series, provides recommendations for current and future use of non-animal methods and strategies for veterinary vaccine potency testing. Workshop participants recommended that future efforts to replace animal use give priority to vaccines (1) that use large numbers of animals per test and for which many serials are produced annually, (2) that involve significant animal pain and distress during procedures, (3) for which the functional protective antigen has been identified, (4) that involve foreign animal/zoonotic organisms that are dangerous to humans, and (5) that involve pathogens that can be easily spread to wildlife populations. Vaccines identified as the highest priorities were those for rabies, Leptospira spp., Clostridium spp., Erysipelas, foreign animal diseases (FAD), poultry diseases, and fish diseases. Further research on the identification, purification, and characterization of vaccine protective antigens in veterinary vaccines was also identified as a priority. Workshop participants recommended priority research, development, and validation activities to address critical knowledge and data gaps, including opportunities to apply new science and technology. Recommendations included (1) investigations into the relative impact of various adjuvants on antigen quantification assays, (2) investigations into extraction methods that could be used for vaccines containing adjuvants that can interfere with antigen assays, and (3) review of the current status of rabies and tetanus human vaccine in vitro potency methods for their potential application to the corresponding veterinary vaccines. Workshop participants recommended enhanced international harmonization and cooperation and closer collaborations between human and veterinary researchers to expedite progress.

Methods This is a single-center, cross-sectional cohort study of patients with COVID-19 admitted from 15 March 2020 to 30 April 2020 to MacNeal Hospital. A retrospective chart review was performed including patients >18 years and a positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR. Demographical data, comorbidities, clinical data, treatment regimen, and patient outcomes were collected. Results A total of 257 patients were included in the study of which 60.4% were identified as Hispanic. The median age at admission of Hispanic patients was significantly lower compared to non-Hispanic patients (56.6 vs. 65.7 years, p<0.01). Non-Hispanic patients had lower prevalence of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic lung disease. Most common at presentation were shortness of breath (69.6%), cough (69.2%), and fever (64%). Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (53.6%). Approximately 89% of the patients received antibiotics, 40.4% hydroxy-chloroquine, 13.2% steroids, and 6% tocilizumab. Twenty six percent required mechanical ventilation (MV), and over half of them (56.7%) were Hispanic. The strongest factors associated with MV were smoking (OR 2.97, 95%CI 1.01-8.69), CRP >10 mg/dL (OR 4.53, 95%CI 1.49-13.38) and D-dimer >1.5 mcg/mL (OR 3.63, 95%CI 1.31-10.05).

There are numerous triggers for POTS including viruses, vaccines, and an autoimmune basis. This case report is clinically relevant to better understand the pathophysiology behind the messenger RNA (mRNA) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine and the mechanism that triggers autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Furthermore, the overall goal of this case study is to report a unique side effect associated with the novel mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. A 42-year-old male, with no prior symptoms of sinus tachycardia and presyncope episodes, is diagnosed with POTS secondary to the first dose of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Symptoms to this date include sinus tachycardia, dizziness, headaches, and fatigue that are often triggered after a large meal or standing for a longer duration. Numerous diagnostic tests and images failed to confirm any other diagnosis other than POTS. There was a sequential connection between the onset of symptoms approximately one week after taking the first dose of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Currently, POTS in this patient is controlled by lifestyle modification. This case report has broader implications as it can help us understand how the mRNA vaccine works on the body relative to the immune system. Our theory is that the development of antibodies activates an autoimmune reaction that triggers POTS disease. The prevalence of the POTS dysautonomia post-vaccination will be clearer as more data and research are conducted on the side effects from the innovative mRNA vaccines created to combat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","output":"A Case of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome Secondary to the Messenger RNA COVID-19 Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We explore here how variation in the SARS-CoV-2 virus tropism could influence epidemic spread.

The disease presentation varies from mild respiratory symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately death. Several risk factors have been shown to worsen the severity of COVID-19 outcomes (such as age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity). Since many of these risk factors are known to be influenced by obstructive sleep apnea, this raises the possibility that OSA might be an independent risk factor for COVID-19 severity. A shift in the gut microbiota has been proposed to contribute to outcomes in both COVID-19 and OSA. To further evaluate the potential triangular interrelationships between these three elements, we conducted a thorough literature review attempting to elucidate these interactions. From this review, it is concluded that OSA may be a risk factor for worse COVID-19 clinical outcomes, and the shifts in gut microbiota associated with both COVID-19 and OSA may mediate processes leading to bacterial translocation via a defective gut barrier which can then foster systemic inflammation. Thus, targeting biomarkers of intestinal tight junction dysfunction in conjunction with restoring gut dysbiosis may provide novel avenues for both risk detection and adjuvant therapy.","output":"Obstructive Sleep Apnea as a Risk Factor for COVID-19 SeverityThe Gut Microbiome as a Common Player Mediating Systemic Inflammation via Gut Barrier Dysfunction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lassa virus (LASV) and Mopeia virus (MOPV) are two closely related, rodent-born mammarenaviruses. LASV is the causative agent of Lassa fever, a deadly hemorrhagic fever endemic in West Africa, whereas MOPV is non-pathogenic in humans. The Z matrix protein of arenaviruses is essential to virus assembly and budding by recruiting host factors, a mechanism that remains partially defined. To better characterize the interactions involved, a yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted using the Z proteins from LASV and MOPV as a bait. The cellular proteins ITCH and WWP1, two members of the Nedd4 family of HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases, were found to bind the Z proteins of LASV, MOPV and other arenaviruses. The PPxY late-domain motif of the Z proteins is required for the interaction with ITCH, although the E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity of ITCH is not involved in Z ubiquitination. The silencing of ITCH was shown to affect the replication of the old-world mammarenaviruses LASV, MOPV, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and to a lesser extent Lujo virus (LUJV). More precisely, ITCH was involved in the egress of virus-like particles and the release of infectious progeny viruses.

In a recent manuscript, only 23% of participants in a cohort of persons with CKD had been diagnosed by their physicians as having CKD while 29% has a diagnosis of cancer and 82% had a diagnosis of hypertension. For the wider public and health authorities, CKD evokes kidney replacement therapy (KRT). In Spain, the prevalence of KRT is 0.13%. A prevalent view is that for those in whom kidneys fail, the problem is solved by dialysis or kidney transplantation. However, the main burden of CKD is accelerated aging and all-cause and cardiovascular premature death. CKD is the most prevalent risk factor for lethal COVID-19 and the factor that most increases the risk of death in COVID-19, after old age. Moreover, men and women undergoing KRT still have an annual mortality which is 10C100-fold higher than similar age peers, and life expectancy is shortened by around 40 years for young persons on dialysis and by 15 years for young persons with a functioning kidney graft. CKD is expected to become the fifth global cause of death by 2040 and the second cause of death in Spain before the end of the century, a time when 1 in 4 Spaniards will have CKD.

With a focus on patients with KOA, we investigated the willingness of patients to use telemedicine by assessing factors such as the patients age, smartphone possession, hospital visiting time, and severity of KOA. METHODS: Data of patients who regularly consulted orthopedic surgeons at our institutions from April 2020 to June 2020 were retrospectively analyzed using an electronic medical database. The patients were diagnosed with KOA according to clinical and radiological findings, according to the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) classification. included were patients with KOA with KL classification above grade 2. All patients were asked: 1) whether they were willing to use telemedicine (Yes or No), 2) the reason why they answered Yes, 3) the reason why they answered No, 4) if they possessed a smartphone, 5) their numeric rating scale for pain at their last outpatient visit after the Sars-CoV-2 epidemic emerged, and 6) the time required for visiting hospital from their house. Patients were stratified into 2 groups depending on whether they answered Yes (Group Y) or No (group N). Comparisons between the groups concerning smartphone possession, NRS pain, hospital visiting times, and distribution of KL grade were made. RESULTS: Only 36.7% of the patients with KOA said they were willing to use telemedicine. The average age of group Y was significantly younger than that of group N (67.9  9.1 vs 73.1  8.0, P = 0.0026) and the cutoff age was 70.0 years. In addition, the rate of smartphone possession was significantly higher in group Y than in group N (82.5% vs 34.5%, P < 0.001).

The T-cell repertoire derives this high diversity through somatic recombination of the T-cell receptor (TCR) locus, a random process that results in repertoires that are largely private to each individual. However, certain factors such as low junctional diversity, thymic selection, and T-cell proliferation upon antigen exposure can affect TCR sharing among individuals. By immunosequencing the TCR variable region of 426 healthy individuals, we find that fewer than 1% of TCR clones are shared between individuals on average, consistent with largely private TCR repertoires. However, we detect a significant correlation between increased HLA allele sharing and increased number of shared TCR clones, with each additional shared HLA allele contributing to an increase in 0.01% of the total TCR clones being shared, supporting a key role for HLA type in shaping the immune repertoire. Surprisingly, we find that shared antigen exposure to CMV leads to fewer shared TCR clones, even after controlling for HLA, indicative of a largely private response to major viral antigenic exposure. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that increased age is correlated with decreased overall TCR clone sharing, indicating that the pattern of private TCR clonal expansion is a general feature of the T-cell response to other infectious antigens. All of these factors contribute to shaping the TCR repertoire, and understanding their interplay has important implications for the use of T cells for therapeutics and diagnostics.","output":"HLA Type and Chronic Viral Infection Impact Peripheral T-cell Receptor Sharing Between Unrelated Individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prior existence of human ACE2 protein-expressing mice used to study SARS-CoV and the rapid development of mouse-adapted virus strains have allowed the study of SARS-CoV-2 in mice, even as we are still learning about its natural pathology in humans.

Given the breadth of potential research, a targeted agenda identifying the questions most critical to effective and coordinated progress in different disciplines of biological security is required. We used expert elicitation to generate 80 policy-relevant research questions considered by participants to have the greatest impact on UK biological security. Drawing on a collaboratively-developed set of 450 questions, proposed by 41 experts from academia, industry and the UK government (consulting 168 additional experts) we subdivided the final 80 questions into six categories: bioengineering; communication and behaviour; disease threats (including pandemics); governance and policy; invasive alien species; and securing biological materials and securing against misuse. Initially, the questions were ranked through a voting process and then reduced and refined to 80 during a one-day workshop with 35 participants from a variety of disciplines. Consistently emerging themes included: the nature of current and potential biological security threats, the efficacy of existing management actions, and the most appropriate future options. The resulting questions offer a research agenda for biological security in the UK that can assist the targeting of research resources and inform the implementation of the UK Biological Security Strategy. These questions include research that could aid with the mitigation of Covid-19, and preparation for the next pandemic.

The objective of this study will be to identify the most effective interventions to relieve pain and reduce disability in acute and sub-acute non-specific LBP. METHODS/DESIGN We will search electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL) from inception onwards. The eligible population will be individuals with non-specific LBP older than 18 years, both males and females, who experience pain less than 6 weeks (acute) or between 6 and 12 weeks (subacute). Eligible interventions and comparators will include all conservative rehabilitation or pharmacological treatments provided by any health professional; the only eligible study design will be a randomized controlled trial. The primary outcomes will be pain intensity and back-specific functional status. Secondary outcomes will be any adverse events. Studies published in languages other than English will also potentially be included. Two reviewers will independently screen the titles and abstracts retrieved from a literature search, as well as potentially relevant full-text articles. General characteristics, potential effect modifiers, and outcome data will be extracted from the included studies, and the risk of bias will be appraised.

A cross-sectional online survey was conducted on healthy adults living in Israel (n = 697). The survey assessed the intention to comply with the state COVID-19 regulations and explored possible correlations with demographic and psychosocial factors.

Data were analyzed to find correlations between anxiety, uncertainty, media exposure and other variables and the level of intention to comply as self-reported. Moderation and mediation effects were studied by an integrative model of influencing factors. We found that media exposure change, trust in responsible agencies and anxiety were positively correlated with compliance, while uncertainty was correlated with noncompliance. The effect of media exposure on compliance had two components. First, media exposure was positively correlated with compliance. On the other hand, media exposure was positively correlated with uncertainty, and uncertainty was negatively correlated with compliance. Interestingly, anxiety, which was positively correlated with media exposure, also moderated the negative correlation between uncertainty and compliance. Our results highlight the important role of uncertainty and anxiety as moderators between media exposure and compliance.

Socioeconomic data were obtained from the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatstica (https://www.ibge.gov.br/). Using the polynomial interpolation methods, daily cases, deaths and acceleration were calculated. Moreover, the correlation coefficient between the epidemic curve data and socioeconomic data was determined. RESULTS: The combination of daily data and case acceleration determined that Brazilian states were in different stages of the epidemic. Maximum case acceleration, peak of cases, maximum death acceleration, and peak of deaths were associated with the Gini index of the gross domestic product of Brazilian states and population density but did not correlate with the per capita gross domestic product of Brazilian states.

We aimed to characterize the capacity and geographic location of healthcare facilities in the country and calculate the proportion of the population with access to breast cancer care. METHODS: A facility-based assessment tool was administered to secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities and private medical centers and clinics in The Gambia. GPS coordinates were obtained, and proximity of service availability and population analysis were performed. Distance thresholds of 10, 20, and 45 km were chosen to determine access to screening, pathologic diagnosis, and surgical management. An additional population analysis was performed to observe the potential impact of targeted development of resources for breast cancer care. RESULTS: All 102 secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities and private medical centers and clinics in The Gambia were included. Breast cancer screening is mainly performed through clinical breast examination and is available in 52 facilities. Seven facilities provide pathologic diagnosis and surgical management of breast cancer. The proportion of the Gambian population with access to screening, pathologic diagnosis, and surgical management is 72, 53, and 62%, respectively. A hypothetical targeted expansion of resources would increase the covered population to 95, 62, and 84%. CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of the Gambian population does not have access to pathologic diagnosis and surgical management of breast cancer within the distance threshold utilized in the study. Mapping and population analysis can identify areas for targeted development of resources to increase access to breast cancer care.","output":"Geospatial analysis and impact of targeted development of breast cancer care in The Gambia: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computational drug design based on artificial intelligence is an emerging research area.

It allows randomness to the infectivity of individuals rather than a constant reproduction number as assumed by standard models. Key epidemiological quantities, such as the distribution of final epidemic size and expected epidemic duration, are derived and estimated based on real data for various regions and countries. The associated time lag of the effect of intervention in each country or region is estimated. Our results are consistent with the incubation time of COVID-19 found by recent medical study. We demonstrate that our model could potentially be a valuable tool in the modeling of COVID-19. More importantly, the proposed model of 2P-DCP could also be used as an important tool in epidemiological modelling as this type of contagion models with very simple structures is adequate to describe the evolution of regional epidemic and worldwide pandemic.","output":"A Two-Phase Dynamic Contagion Model for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, a framework for safe provision of elective orthopaedic surgery must be developed in order to restore and maintain activity. The aim of this study was to explore patient attitudes to surgery and theatre efficiency as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and assess a potential framework for the delivery of such services. METHODS: Prospectively collected data on theatre timings and procedures completed per session used to assess theatre efficiency comparing June 2019 to June 2020. Information on patient compliance with 14-day household isolation and attitudes to surgery were collected prospectively over a seven-week period using a questionnaire. Follow-up data were collected via telephone consultation a minimum of two weeks after discharge. RESULTS: Significant reduction in the number of points per session (p = 0.02) with a mean of 3.19 in 2019 and 2.42 in 2020. Only 18 of 31 patients were compliant with pre-operative isolation with individual failures accounting for four of 13 and failures by household members accounting for nine. Impact of COVID-19 and precautions on patient anxiety was mixed. No patients required symptomatic COVID-19 swab post-operatively. CONCLUSION: With the restrictions of COVID-19, there are significant problems with theatre efficiency, in effect losing an operation a list. Furthermore, compliance with pre-operative isolation was poor but to the best of our knowledge no patients became unwell from COVID-19 post-operatively.

This study explored the mechanism and prevention of such injuries, and devised a novel emergent strategy, which was supported by a multicenter self-controlled study in 1161 frontline healthcare professionals. In this study, according to the anatomy of the face and the characteristics of facial pressure injuries, a respirator liner was designed using a polyurethane foam to redistribute the pressure across the face. A pre-clinical crossover trial was performed on eight participants to evaluate its efficacy. The strategy was then widely applied among 11 100 healthcare workers in seven frontline hospitals, and 1161 of them were sampled for a questionnaire investigation. The pre-clinical crossover trial showed that the novel strategy was very effective in preventing facial pressure injuries. The questionnaire investigation showed that pain score, wearing disturbance, and the incidence of pressure injury in the healthcare professionals were significantly correlated with wearing time (all  = 0.986). The new strategy significantly reduced the incidence of pressure injury from 84.7% to 11.1%, pain score IQR from 5 (2) to 1 (2), and wearing disturbance rate from 91.6% to 6.3%, and the results analyzed according to individual hospitals or different wearing time showed similar trends (all P < 0.0005).

Off-site oriented modular construction is ideal to provide these requirements at very short notice for emergencies. Modular units made of steel components are a leading choice due to the exceptional strength and rigidity for lightweight construction. A new weight optimisation procedure was developed for Cold-Formed Steel (CFS) joists in varying shapes of and results show that weight for per unit length of the joists can be reduced up to 24% without compromising structural capacity. This was verified with validated Finite Element (FE) models. In order to improve the faster jointing method, a novel cut and bend intra-module connection was also introduced. In addition, strap bracing is used for the lateral stability of steel-framed modular buildings. Modular breathing panels are proposed to be employed in corner post modules as sidewalls to improve the indoor air quality and reduce the spread of disease. Based on the comprehensive assessment and numerical results conceptual design of performance improved steel-framed corner post modular unit was proposed to offer short-to-medium (in response to emergencies), as well as long-term solutions for the construction industry.","output":"Development of affordable steel-framed modular buildings for emergency situations (Covid-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In California, molecular testing was useful in decreasing suspicion for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), by detecting common respiratory pathogens (influenza A/B, human metapneumovirus, picornavirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia spp., parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus) in 23 (45%) of 51 patients with suspected SARS and 9 (47%) of 19 patients with probable SARS.","output":"SARS and Common Viral Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the 2008 economic and financial crisis, the rise of populism and nationalism has been associated with increased protectionism and policy uncertainty in the world trade system, with profound side effects for international business (IB) activities and global value chains (GVCs).

Eleven young (16.6  1.2 years) martial arts fighters were exposed to three different intervention protocols in distinct sessions. The interventions consisted of wrapping the ankle (ANKLE) or calf (CALF) with an elastic band for 3 sets of 2 min (2 min rest) to create vascular occlusion. A third intervention without wrapping the elastic band served as a control condition (CON). Active range of motion for ankle (AROM), plantarflexor maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), and soleus H reflex were assessed before (PRE), after (POST), and 10 min after (POST10) the intervention. The H reflex, level of pain (NRS) and wrapping pressure were also assessed during the intervention. Both CALF and ANKLE protocols induced a significant drop in H reflex during the intervention. However, the CALF protocol resulted in a significantly larger H reflex reduction during and after the flossing intervention (medium to large effect size). H reflexes returned to baseline levels 10 min after the intervention in all conditions. AROM and MVC were unaffected by any intervention. The results of this study suggest that tissue flossing can decrease the muscle soleus H reflex particularly when elastic band is wrapped around the calf muscles.

Compared to Western countries, in Asia, T2DM occurs in patients with a lower body mass index (BMI) due to central obesity and decreased pancreatic -cell function. The efficacy of laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass (LMGB) in obese patients with T2DM has been proven by numerous studies. Treatment outcomes of LMGB for non-obese T2DM patients are also estimated to be excellent. The aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LMBG in non-obese T2DM patients (BMI 25-30 kg/m(2)). METHODS Ten consecutive patients underwent LMGB at our hospital from August 2009 to October 2009. Preoperative data including glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2 h postprandial glucose (2-h PPG) were compared with data collected at 1, 3, and 6 postoperative months. RESULTS All procedures were completed laparoscopically. Mean age of the patients was 46.9 years, mean BMI was 27.2 kg/m(2), mean operative time was 150.5 min, and mean postoperative hospital stay was 5.3 days. Neither mortality nor major complications occurred. Mean preoperative glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h PPG, and C-peptide level were 9.7%, 222 mg/dl, 343 mg/dl, and 2.78 ng/ml, respectively.

This can have significant implications when cattle are exposed to pesticide residues in feed. Recent studies indicate that the fungicide prochloraz activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway, increasing bovine ABCG2 (bABCG2) gene expression and efflux activity. This could enhance the accumulation of bABCG2 substrates in dairy milk, impacting pesticide risk assessment. We therefore investigated whether 13 commonly used pesticides in Europe are inducers of AhR and bABCG2 activity. MDCKII cells expressing mammary bABCG2 were incubated with pesticides for up to 72 h. To reflect an in vivo situation, applied pesticide concentrations corresponded to the maximum residue levels (MRLs) permitted in bovine fat or muscle. AhR activation was ascertained through CYP1A mRNA expression and enzyme activity, measured by qPCR and 7-ethoxyresorufin-&#927;-deethylase (EROD) assay, respectively. Pesticide-mediated increase of bABCG2 efflux activity was assessed using the Hoechst 33342 accumulation assay. For all assays, the known AhR-activating pesticide prochloraz served as a positive control, while the non-activating tolclofos-methyl provided the negative control. At 10-fold MRL concentrations, chlorpyrifos-methyl, diflufenican, ioxynil, rimsulfuron, and tebuconazole significantly increased CYP1A1 mRNA levels, CYP1A activity, and bABCG2 efflux activity compared to the vehicle control. In contrast, dimethoate, dimethomorph, glyphosate, iprodione, methiocarb and thiacloprid had no impact on AhR-mediated CYP1A1 mRNA levels, CYP1A activity or bABCG2 efflux. In conclusion, the MDCKII-bABCG2 cell model proved an appropriate tool for identifying AhR- and bABCG2-inducing pesticides.

Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study utilizing census sampling. The data was obtained through medical records. Inclusion criteria: COVID-19 diagnosis through RT-PCR/chest CT among those who received SACT in the Chemotherapy Departments of Hematology Center after prof. Yeolyan and Institute of Surgery after Mikaelyan Yerevan, Armenia between March 1, 2020, and February 1, 2021. Descriptive analysis was done to characterize the cohort. We run logistic regression to evaluate the risk of COVID-19 severity (mild, severe/critical) among those receiving SACT (high, intermediate, and low-risk protocols of febrile neutropenia (FN), age, gender, smoking status, comorbidities). Results: In total 75 cancer patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 in both centers. Data of only 72 patients were analyzed, as the outcome variable of the excluded patients was unknown. The male-to-female ratio was 1:1.5, age range was 31-80 years (median age: 61). The patients received SACT with high (13.9 %), intermediate (63.9 %), and low (8.3 %) risk for FN. The others did not receive SACT at the moment of COVID-19 diagnosis. Infection-associated pneumonia was developed in 63% of cases. Mild COVID-19 was diagnosed in 76.4% and severe/critical in 23.6% of cases. Infected patients hospitalization rate was 28%. The case fatality rate was 8%. Only patients who underwent SACT at the time of COVID-19 infection were included in logistic regression analysis (n=62). Significant association between COVID-19 severity and the risk of SACT-induced FN, gender, smoking status, comorbidities was not found. Contrary, COVID-19 severity was significantly associated with age when adjusted to other predictors (p=0.017, 95% CI = 1.021-1.230).

Methods: We did a national cross-sectional survey of all LTCFs providing dementia care or care to adults aged 65 years or older in England between May 26 and June 19, 2020. The survey collected data from managers of eligible LTCFs on LTCF characteristics, staffing factors, the use of disease control measures, and the number of confirmed cases of infection among staff and residents in each LTCF. Survey responses were linked to individual-level SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results obtained through the national testing programme in England between April 30 and June 13, 2020. The primary outcome was the weighted period prevalence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in residents and staff reported via the survey. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with infection in staff and residents, an outbreak (defined as at least one case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a resident or staff member), and a large outbreak (defined as LTCFs with more than a third of the total number of residents and staff combined testing positive, or with >20 residents and staff combined testing positive) using data from the survey and from the linked survey-test dataset. Findings: 9081 eligible wLTCFs were identified, of which 5126 (564%) participated in the survey, providing data on 160a033 residents and 248a594 staff members. The weighted period prevalence of infection was 105% (95% CI 99-111) in residents and 38% (34-42) in staff members. 2724 (531%) LTCFs reported outbreaks, and 469 (91%) LTCFs reported large outbreaks.

Significantly increased odds of infection in residents (101 [101-101], p<00001) and staff (100 [100-101], p=00005), and of outbreaks (108 [105-110], p<00001) were associated with each one unit increase in the number of new admissions to the LTCF relative to baseline (March 1, 2020). The odds of infection in residents (119 [112-126], p<00001) and staff (119 [110-129], p<00001), and of large outbreaks (165 [107-254], p=0024) were significantly higher in LTCFs that were for profit versus those that were not for profit. Frequent employment of agency nurses or carers was associated with a significantly increased odds of infection in residents (aOR 165 [156-174], p<00001) and staff (185 [172-198], p<00001), and of outbreaks (233 [172-316], p<00001) and large outbreaks (242 [167-351], p<00001) compared with no employment of agency nurses or carers. Compared with LTCFs that did not report difficulties in isolating residents, those that did had significantly higher odds of infection in residents (133 [128-138], p<00001) and staff (148 [141-156], p<00001), and of outbreaks (184 [148-230], p<00001) and large outbreaks (162 [124-211], p=00004). Interpretation: Half of LTCFs had no cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first wave of the pandemic. Reduced transmission from staff is associated with adequate sick pay, minimal use of agency staff, an increased staff-to-bed ratio, and staff cohorting with either infected or uninfected residents. Increased transmission from residents is associated with an increased number of new admissions to the facility and poor compliance with isolation procedures.

METHODS: Systematic review of published scientific evidence. A search of six bibliographic databases and grey literature was executed to identify relevant studies conducted in Malawi in the English language, with no time or study design restrictions. Data extraction was conducted in Excel and evidence synthesis followed a thematic analysis approach to identify and compare emerging themes. RESULTS: One hundred and one unique records were retrieved and 6 studies were selected for final inclusion in the review. Multiple factors affect breast and cervical cancer service delivery in Malawi, operating at three interlinked levels. At the patient level, lack of knowledge and awareness of the disease, location, poor screening environment and perceived quality of care may act as deterrent to participation in screening; at the health facility level, services are affected by the availability of resources and delivery modalities; and at the healthcare system level, inadequate funding and staffing (distribution, supervision, retention), and lack of appropriate monitoring and guidelines may have a negative impact on services. Convenience of screening, in terms of accessibility (location, opening times) and integration with other health services (e.g. reproductive or HIV services), was found to have a positive effect on service uptake. Building awareness of cancer and related services, and offering quality screening (dedicated room, privacy, staff professionalism etc.) are significant determinants of patient satisfaction.

The discovery of opiums ability to relieve pain stimulated the refinement of opium and generation of synthetic analogues to create more effective, potent, and faster-acting analgesics. The social and economic value of opioids has remained high not only due to their demonstrated efficiency in mitigating pain but also their noteworthy ability to reliably produce rewarding psychological effects. Consequently, at various times during the past several hundred years, opioids have sparked wars, fueled black markets and cartel crime, and triggered numerous opioid addiction and overdose death epidemics around the world. The increased therapeutic desire to address pain together with pharmaceutical discoveries in medication design, rapid manufacture, and highly effective opioid marketing and distribution has led more recently to increased availability and accessibility to potent prescription opioids, which has sparked the deadliest overdose crisis in human history. This chapter describes the etiology and epidemiology of the opioid crisis using public health and Health Belief Model frameworks and reviews approaches that have been applied to address supply (e.g., overprescribing) and demand (e.g., medication treatments) sides of the equation. Causes of the growth and spread of the overdose epidemic are analyzed as a way to inform a successful end to the current crisis as well as to prevent future epidemics.","output":"Killing More than Pain: Etiology and Remedy for an Opioid Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Orthopoxviruses spill over from animal reservoirs to accidental hosts, sometimes causing human infections.

Here, we describe the development and validation of an in-house RNA-Seq-based test system (FusionSeq? 2.0) for the detection of clinically actionable gene fusions, in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens, using seventy tumor samples with varying fusion status. Conditions were optimized for RNA input of 50 ng, shown to be adequate to call known fusions at as low as 20% neoplastic content. Evaluation of assay performance between FFPE and fresh-frozen (FF) tissues exhibited little to no difference in fusion calling capability. Performance analysis of the assay validation data determined 100% accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. This clinically developed and validated RNA-Seq-based approach for fusion detection in FPPE samples was shown to be on par if not superior to off-the-shelf commercially offered assays.

Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-6 receptor, is being administered off-label to some patients with COVID-19, and although early small studies suggested a benefit, there are no conclusive data proving its usefulness. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with or without treatment with Tocilizumab. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective study of 1938 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to hospitals within the Jefferson Health system in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, between March 25, 2020 and June 17, 2020, of which 307 received Tocilizumab. EXPOSURES: Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes data related to length of stay, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), requirement of mechanical ventilation, and mortality were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The average age was 65.2, with 47% women; 36.4% were African-American. The average length of stay was 22 days with 26.3% of patients requiring admission to the ICU and 14.9% requiring mechanical ventilation. The overall mortality was 15.3%. Older age, admission to an ICU, and requirement for mechanical ventilation were associated with higher mortality. Treatment with Tocilizumab was also associated with higher mortality, which was mainly observed in subjects not requiring care in an ICU with estimated odds ratio (OR) of 2.9 (p = 0.0004). Tocilizumab treatment was also associated with higher likelihood of admission to an ICU (OR = 4.8, p < 0.0001), progression to requiring mechanical ventilation (OR = 6.6, p < 0.0001), and increased length of stay (OR = 16.2, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Our retrospective analysis revealed an association between Tocilizumab administration and increased mortality, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and length of stay in subjects with COVID-19.

Because most patients are on a long-term immunosuppressive therapy, which renders them vulnerable to infections, a new challenge appears in front of physicians in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era. Immune mechanisms are substantial for the control and ceasing of viral infections, and their impairment may cause serious complications; however, data from immunosuppressed transplant patients do not reveal a higher frequency or diseases severity in those infected by COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: To examine changes in health service use among community-dwelling persons with dementia, persons with PD, and older adults without neurodegenerative disease during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Repeated cross-sectional analysis using population-based administrative data among community-dwelling persons with dementia, persons with PD, and adults 65 years and older at the start of each week from March 1 through the week of September 20, 2020 (pandemic period), and March 3 through the week of September 22, 2019 (historical period), in Ontario, Canada. EXPOSURES: COVID-19 pandemic as of March 1, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Main outcomes were weekly rates of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, nursing home admissions, home care, virtual and in-person physician visits, and all-cause mortality. Poisson regression models were used to calculate weekly rate ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs comparing pandemic weeks with historical levels. RESULTS: Among those living in the community as of March 1, 2020, persons with dementia (n = 131 466; mean [SD] age, 80.1 [10.1] years) were older than persons with PD (n = 30 606; 73.7 [10.2] years) and older adults (n = 2 363 742; 74.0 [7.1] years). While all services experienced declines, the largest drops occurred in nursing home admissions (RR for dementia: 0.10; 95% CI, 0.07-0.15; RR for PD: 0.03; 95% CI, 0.00-0.21; RR for older adults: 0.11; 95% CI, 0.06-0.18) and emergency department visits (RR for dementia: 0.45; 95% CI, 0.41-0.48; RR for PD: 0.40; 95% CI, 0.34-0.48; RR for older adults: 0.45; 95% CI, 0.44-0.47). After the first wave, most services returned to historical levels except physician visits, which remained elevated (RR for dementia: 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05-1.09; RR for PD: 1.10, 95% CI, 1.06-1.13) and shifted toward virtual visits. Older adults continued to experience lower hospitalizations. All-cause mortality was elevated across cohorts. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this population-based repeated cross-sectional study in Ontario, Canada, those with dementia, those with PD, and older adults sought hospital care far less than usual, were not admitted to nursing homes, and experienced excess mortality during the first wave of the pandemic. Most services returned to historical levels, but virtual physician visits remained a feature of care.

METHODS Data of 257 Covid-19 patients hospitalized between 30th September 2020 and 2nd March 2021 have been collected retrospectively. The following parameters were collected: age, gender, serum level of 25-OH-Vitamin D3, outcome (survival/death) comorbidities (cancer, diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Serum VD measurement was done within 3 days of admission. RESULTS VD levels were significantly lower in patients who did not survive, however, in this patients group the average age was significantly higher than among those, who survived. After age-matching, in a subgroup of patients with risk factors and/or 60 years of age or older who survived had significantly higher VD level in their serum than those who deceased. Serum C-reactive protein, lactate-dehydrogenase and creatinin-kinase were significantly higher in the group in which the patients died, however these laboratory parameters did not correlate with the VD levels. CONCLUSION We found that in COVID-19 infection, when old age as risk factor (60 years of age or older) was pooled with risk factors (cancer, diabetes and/or COPD), the VD levels were significantly lower in the patient group, in which the patients did not survive.

Among these assays, the extracts showed the best effect on the inhibition of linoleic peroxidation with the lowest IC50 values and with an inhibition rate over 90% at concentration of 0.8C1.6 mg/ml, more stable than that of -tocopherol, a recognised natural antioxidant. The scavenging activities on superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals of the two extracts were slightly lower than that of butylated hydroxytoluene.

Over the last 40 years, assisted reproductive technology (ART) has helped millions of childless couples. However, ART is limited by a low success rate and risk of multiple gestations. Devising methods for selecting the best gamete or embryo that increases the ART success rate and prevention of multiple gestation has become one of the key goals in ART today. Special emphasis has been placed on the development of non-invasive approaches, which do not require perturbing the embryonic cells, as the current morphology-based embryo selection approach has shortcomings in predicting the implantation potential of embryos. An observed association between embryo metabolism and viability has prompted researchers to develop metabolomics-based biomarkers. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provides a non-invasive approach for the metabolic profiling of tissues, gametes and embryos, with the key advantage of having a minimal sample preparation procedure.

The Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant is responsible for a major wave of COVID-19, with record case counts reflecting high transmissibility and escape from prior immunity. Defining the time course of Omicron viral proliferation and clearance is crucial to inform isolation protocols aiming to minimize disease spread. Methods. We obtained longitudinal, quantitative RT-qPCR test results using combined anterior nares and oropharyngeal samples (n = 10,324) collected between July 5th, 2021 and January 10th, 2022 from the National Basketball Association's (NBA) occupational health program. We quantified the fraction of tests with PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values <30, chosen as a proxy for potential infectivity and antigen test positivity, on each day after first detection of suspected and confirmed Omicron infections, stratified by individuals detected under frequent testing protocols and those detected due to symptom onset or concern for contact with an infected individual. We quantified the duration of viral proliferation, clearance rate, and peak viral concentration for individuals with acute Omicron and Delta variant SARS-CoV-2 infections. Results. A total of 97 infections were confirmed or suspected to be from the Omicron variant and 107 from the Delta variant. Of 27 Omicron-infected individuals testing positive []1 day after a previous negative or inconclusive test, 52.0% (13/25) were PCR positive with Ct values <30 at day 5, 25.0% (6/24) at day 6, and 13.0% (3/23) on day 7 post detection. Of 70 Omicron-infected individuals detected []2 days after a previous negative or inconclusive test, 39.1% (25/64) were PCR positive with Ct values <30 at day 5, 33.3% (21/63) at day 6, and 22.2% (14/63) on day 7 post detection. Overall, Omicron infections featured a mean duration of 9.87 days (95% CI 8.83-10.9) relative to 10.9 days (95% CI 9.41-12.4) for Delta infections. The peak viral RNA based on Ct values was lower for Omicron infections than for Delta infections (Ct 23.3, 95% CI 22.4-24.3 for Omicron; Ct 20.5, 95% CI 19.2-21.8 for Delta) and the clearance phase was shorter for Omicron infections (5.35 days, 95% CI 4.78-6.00 for Omicron; 6.23 days, 95% CI 5.43-7.17 for Delta), though the rate of clearance was similar (3.13 Ct/day, 95% CI 2.75-3.54 for Omicron; 3.15 Ct/day, 95% CI 2.69-3.64 for Delta). Conclusions. While Omicron infections feature lower peak viral RNA and a shorter clearance phase than Delta infections on average, it is unclear to what extent these differences are attributable to more immunity in this largely vaccinated population or intrinsic characteristics of the Omicron variant. Further, these results suggest that Omicron's infectiousness may not be explained by higher viral load measured in the nose and mouth by RT-PCR. The substantial fraction of individuals with Ct values <30 at days 5 of infection, particularly in those detected due to symptom onset or concern for contact with an infected individual, underscores the heterogeneity of the infectious period, with implications for isolation policies.","output":"Viral dynamics and duration of PCR positivity of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Posterior reversible encephalopathy cases are increasingly being reported in patients affected by COVID-19, but the largest series so far only includes 4 patients We present a series of 6 patients diagnosed with PRES during COVID-19 hospitalized in 5 Centers in Lombardia, Italy 5 out of the 6 patients required intensive care assistence and seizures developed at weaning from assisted ventilation 3 out of 6 patients underwent cerebrospinal fluid analysis which was normal in alla cases, with negative PCR for Sars-CoV-2 genome search PRES occurrence may be less rare than supposed in COVID-19 patients and a high suspicion index is warranted for prompt diagnosis and treatment","output":"Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and COVID-19: A series of 6 cases from Lombardy, Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases has brought attention to the importance of consuming a healthy diet.

A first difference regression model allowed for estimating the unbiased effect of the DFLF on diet quality, measured by the weighted average Nutri-Score (ranging 1 to 5) per serving (primary) and changes in select nutrients and calories. The mean weighted Nutri-Score was 0.4 (12.6%) higher in the DFLF arm (CI: [0.2, 0.6]) relative to the control. The DFLF also decreased the amount of sugar per serving by 0.9 g (CI: [?1.7, ?0.0]) and total sugar per shop by 169.5 g (CI: [?284.5, ?54.5]). The DFLF features significantly improved nutrition quality relative to no labelling, as measured by average Nutri-Score values. These results shed light on the considerable potential of the online shopping environment to improve diet quality through customization and real time feedback.","output":"The Effect of Dynamic Food Labels with Real-Time Feedback on Diet Quality: Results from a Randomized Controlled Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop an inductive coding approach specific to characterizing user-generated social media conversations about transition of use of different tobacco and alternative and emerging tobacco products (ATPs). RESULTS: A total of 40,206 tweets were collected from the Twitter public API stream that were geocoded from 2018 to 2019. Using data mining approaches, these tweets were then filtered for keywords associated with tobacco and ATP use behavior. This resulted in a subset of 5718 tweets, with 657 manually annotated and identified as associated with user-generated conversations about tobacco and ATP use behavior. The 657 tweets were coded into 9 parent codes: inquiry, interaction, observation, opinion, promote, reply, share knowledge, use characteristics, and transition of use behavior. The highest number of observations occurred under transition of use (43.38%, n = 285), followed by current use (39.27%, n = 258), opinions about use (0.07%, n = 46), and product promotion (0.06%, n = 37).

Combining the signal transducer and catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA)-based signal amplification, the target DNA binds with the hairpin DNA to form a new nucleic acid sequence and creates a toehold in the transducer for initiating the recycle amplification reaction of CHA. The catalyzed assembly process produces a large amount of G-rich DNA. In the presence of hemin, the G-rich DNA forms G-quadruplex/hemin complex and mimic horseradish peroxidase activity, which catalyzes a colorimetric reaction. Under optimal conditions, the calibration curve of synthetic target DNA has good linearity from 50 pM to 200 nM with a detection limit of 32 pM. This strategy has been successfully applied to detect S. pneumoniae as low as 156 CFU mL(?1), and shows a good specificity against closely related streptococci and major pathogenic bacteria. In addition, the developed method enables successful visual analysis of S. pneumoniae in clinical samples by the naked eye. Importantly, this method demonstrates excellent assay versatility for sensitively detecting oligonucleotides or aptamer-recognized targets.","output":"DNA transducer-triggered signal switch for visual colorimetric bioanalysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is a concern with the growing use of antimicrobials across countries increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rates. A key area within hospitals is their use for the prevention of surgical site infections (SSI) with concerns with timing of the first dose, which can appreciably impact on effectiveness, as well as duration with extended prophylaxis common among low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This is a concern as extended duration increases utilization rates and AMR as well as adverse events. Consequently, there is a need to document issues of timing and duration of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) among LMICs together with potential ways forward to address current concerns. METHODS: Narrative review of timings and duration of SAP among LMICs combined with publications documenting successful approaches to improve SAP to provide future direction to all key stakeholder groups. RESULTS: There were documented concerns with the timing of the first dose of antibiotics, with appropriate timing as low as 6.7% in Egypt, although as high as 81.9% in Turkey. There was also an extensive duration of SAP, ranging from long duration times in all patients in a study in Nigeria with a mean of 8.7 days and 97% of patients in Egypt to 42.9% of patients in Pakistan and 35% in Turkey. Successful interventions to improve SAP typically involved multiple approaches including education of all key stakeholder groups, monitoring of usage against agreed guidelines,as well as quality targets. Multiple approaches typically improved timing and duration as well as reduced costs. For instance, in one study appropriateness increased from 30.1% to 91.4%, prolonged duration reduced to 5.7% of patients, and mean costs of antibiotics decreased 11-fold. CONCLUSION: There are considerable concerns with the timing and duration of SAP among LMICs. Multiple interventions among LMICs can address this providing future directions.","output":"Key Issues Surrounding Appropriate Antibiotic Use for Prevention of Surgical Site Infections in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Narrative Review and the Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A problem for a circular economy, embedded in its policies, tools, technologies and models, is that it is driven by the interests and needs of producers, rather than customers and users. This opinion paper focuses on an alternative form of governanceagreements, which thanks to their bargaining approach brings actors from across the value chain into the policy process. The purpose of this opinion paper is to uncover and analyse the potential of such agreements for a circular economy. Circular agreements aim at increasing the circulation of materials and are an emerging form of political governance within the EU. These agreements have different names, involve different actors and govern in different ways. However, circular agreements seem to work when other types of regulations fail to establish circulation. These agreements bring actors together and offer a platform for negotiating how advantages and disadvantages can be redistributed between actors in a way that is more suitable for a circular economy. However, circular agreements are dependent on other policy instruments to work and can generate a free-rider problem with uninvolved actors. The agreements may also become too detailed and long term, which leads to problem shifting and lock-ins, respectively.","output":"Circular AgreementsExploring the Role of Agreements and Deals as a Political Tool for a Circular Economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background There are limited antiviral options for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Ivermectin (IVM), a macrocyclic lactone with a wide anti-parasitary spectrum, has shown potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. This study aimed at assessing the antiviral effect of IVM on viral load of respiratory secretions and its relationship with drug concentrations in plasma. Methods Proof-of-concept, pilot, randomized, controlled, outcome-assessor blinded trial to evaluate antiviral activity of high-dose IVM in 45 COVID-19 hospitalized patients randomized in a 2:1 ratio to standard of care plus oral IVM at 06 mg/kg/day for 5 days versus standard of care in 4 hospitals in Argentina. Eligible patients were adults with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection within 5 days of symptoms onset. The primary endpoint was the difference in viral load in respiratory secretions between baseline and day-5, by quantitative RT-PCR. Concentrations of IVM in plasma were measured. Study registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04381884. Findings 45 participants were recruited (30 to IVM and 15 controls) between May 18 and September 9, 2020. There was no difference in viral load reduction between groups but a significant difference was found in patients with higher median plasma IVM levels (72% IQR 59C77) versus untreated controls (42% IQR 31C73) (p = 0004). Mean ivermectin plasma concentration levels correlated with viral decay rate (r: 047, p = 002). Adverse events were similar between groups. No differences in clinical evolution at day-7 and day-30 between groups were observed. Interpretation A concentration dependent antiviral activity of oral high-dose IVM was identified at a dosing regimen that was well tolerated.

Patients and methods In all patients with acute ischaemic stroke of unknown onset randomised in the WAKE-UP (Efficacy and Safety of magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]-based Thrombolysis in Wake-Up Stroke) trial, blood pressure (BP) was measured before randomisation and after initiation of treatment at regular intervals up to 24 hours. Individual BPV was measured by coefficient of variation (CV) of all BP values. Primary outcome measure was favourable outcome defined by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0 or 1 at 90 days after stroke. Results BP measurements were available for 498 of 503 patients randomised (177 women [35.5%], mean age [SD] of 65.2 [11.5] years). Systolic BPV was not associated with the treatment effect of thrombolysis (test for interaction, p = 0.46). The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for favourable outcome with alteplase, adjusted for age, stroke severity and baseline BP on admission, did not show an association across the quintiles of increasing systolic BPV with an aOR 1.89 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-4.70) in the lowest quintile to aOR 1.05 (95% CI, 0.43-2.56) in the highest quintile. Higher mean systolic BP was associated with a smaller treatment effect of thrombolysis with a significant interaction (p = 0.033). The aOR for favourable outcome with alteplase decreased with quintiles of increasing mean systolic BP from aOR 3.16 (95% CI, 1.26-7.93) in the lowest quintile to aOR 0.84 (95% CI, 0.34-2.10) in in the highest quintile.

These factors can be internal (e.g., psychological preparedness, physiological profile of the rider, and the preparedness or fitness of the rider) or external (e.g., the weather or strategy of the team) to the rider, or even completely unpredictable (e.g., crashes or mechanical failure). This variety makes perfectly predicting the outcome of a certain race an impossible task and the sport even more interesting. Nonetheless, before each race, journalists, ex-pro cyclists, websites and cycling fans try to predict the possible top 3, 5, or 10 riders. In this article, we use easily accessible data on road cycling from the past 20 years and the Machine Learning technique Learn-to-Rank (LtR) to predict the top 10 contenders for 1-day road cycling races. We accomplish this by mapping a relevancy weight to the finishing place in the first 10 positions. We assess the performance of this approach on 2018, 2019, and 2021 editions of six spring classic 1-day races. In the end, we compare the output of the framework with a mass fan prediction on the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) metric and the number of correct top 10 guesses. We found that our model, on average, has slightly higher performance on both metrics than the mass fan prediction. We also analyze which variables of our model have the most influence on the prediction of each race. This approach can give interesting insights to fans before a race but can also be helpful to sports coaches to predict how a rider might perform compared to other riders outside of the team.","output":"A Learn-to-Rank Approach for Predicting Road Cycling Race Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Our study investigates how changes in family contexts were associated with child behaviors during Ohio's COVID\\\\19 shutdown of early 2020.

Most of the existing studies are based on large and private annotated datasets that are impractical to obtain from a single institution, especially when radiologists are busy fighting the coronavirus disease. Furthermore, it is hard to compare current COVID-19 CT segmentation methods as they are developed on different datasets, trained in different settings, and evaluated with different metrics. Methods: To promote the development of data-efficient deep learning methods, in this paper, we built three benchmarks for lung and infection segmentation based on 70 annotated COVID-19 cases, which contain current active research areas, e.g., few-shot learning, domain generalization, and knowledge transfer. For a fair comparison among different segmentation methods, we also provide standard training, validation and testing splits, evaluation metrics and, the corresponding code. Results: Based on the state-of-the-art network, we provide more than 40 pre-trained baseline models, which not only serve as out-of-the-box segmentation tools but also save computational time for researchers who are interested in COVID-19 lung and infection segmentation.

Methods Two free webinars were hosted for doctors and medical students in northern India (Punjab state) to create awareness about the role of AI in healthcare and the recent advancements made in various medical specialties. The delegates perceptions about their knowledge and interest in AI were ascertained using the Likert scale (1 = low, 5 = high) in the post-event questionnaire. Using Chi-square and cross-tabulation analysis, associations were examined between knowledge of AI, gender, medical experience, and other variables. Results Out of the total of 621 registrants, 367 filled the post-event questionnaire and were included in the analysis. Although the majority felt that AI will play an important role in delivering healthcare services in the future (74.4%), they did not feel knowledgeable about the applications (79.6%) and limitations of AI (82.8%). A relatively lesser proportion of doctors (51.6%) felt interested to learn more about AI than medical students (69.3%). Furthermore, a lesser proportion of doctors (65.2%) felt that AI will be beneficial for their career as a doctor as compared with medical students (84.4%). The majority of medical students (83.5%) had never attended any webinar/lecture or course on AI in healthcare and felt that they have received minimal advice (80.7%) from their medical school on teaching about AI and its applications.

The lack of understanding of key aspects of pandemics has affected virus transmission.

However, there are still no exemplars in the curriculum that apply CT to real-world problems such as controlling a pandemic or other similar global crises. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing exemplars of CT for modeling the pandemic. We designed exemplars following the three pillars of the framework for CT from the Inclusive Mathematics for Sustainability in a Digital Economy (InMside) project by Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC): algorithmic thinking, computational modeling, and machine learning. For each pillar, we designed a progressive sequence of activities that covers from elementary to high school. In an experimental study with elementary and middle school students from 2 schools of high vulnerability, we found that the computational modeling exemplar can be implemented by teachers and correctly understood by students. We conclude that it is feasible to introduce the exemplars at all grade levels and that this is a powerful example of Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) integration that helps reflect and tackle real-world and challenging public health problems of great impact for students and their families.","output":"Developing Computational Thinking Teaching Strategies to Model Pandemics and Containment Measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is an important cause of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and is classified under idiopathic cause of PAH.

PATIENTS AND METHODS We analyzed the activity of our Unit to evaluate how logistics changes, related to the COVID-19 epidemic, impacted on volumes of radiotherapy (RT) activity and on the number of cases of COVID-19 infections observed in healthcare professionals and patients. RESULTS The total number of first-time visits between March-May 2020 was reduced by 18%, probably due to delays in diagnosis and histological tests as well as the temporary closure of the operating rooms. None of the healthcare professionals and only two patients contracted the infection.

The ROV was applied to identify abiotic gradients and to compare fish assemblages on the steep slopes in a tropical reservoir. The tested hypothesis is that fish are concentrated in the littoral zone due to the better physicochemical and habitat conditions, compared to deep and hypoxic layers. Twelve species were recorded (seven native, five exotic), with all species occurring in the littoral zone, seven species in the transition, and four in the profundal zone. A greater fish abundance and richness was found in the littoral zone corroborating the main hypothesis. The littoral zone was dominated by exotic cichlids (Cichla spp., Coptodon rendalli), while native catfish (Loricariichthys castaneus, Pimelodella lateristriga) occupied deeper areas. The fish distribution seems to be driven by local factors, such as oxygen availability and habitat structure. The preference for the littoral zone by alien cichlids may have led to the extirpation/decrease of native characids and induced catfishes to occupy deep habitats. Underwater drones can be a valuable tool for the simultaneous collection of abiotic/biotic data, especially in deep reservoirs with complex habitats, resulting in advances in the environmental monitoring.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the knowledge, attitude, and practices of medical students in Uganda on the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an online, descriptive cross-sectional study in mid-April 2020, using WhatsApp Messenger. Medical students in 9 of the 10 medical schools in Uganda were approached through convenience sampling. Bloom's cut-off of 80% was used to determine good knowledge (&#8805;12 out of 15), positive attitude (&#8805;20 out of 25), and good practice (&#8805;12 out of 15). RESULTS: The data of 741 first- to fifth-year medical students, consisting of 468 (63%) males with a mean age of 24 (SD 4) years, were analyzed. The majority (n=626, 84%) were pursuing Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees. Overall, 671 (91%) had good knowledge, 550 (74%) had a positive attitude, and 426 (57%) had good practices. Knowledge was associated with the 4th year of study (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.1, 95% CI 1.6-10.3; P<.001). Attitude was associated with the female sex (aOR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-1; P=.04) and TV or radio shows (aOR 1.1, 95% CI 0.6-2.1; P=.01).

Global genomic repair is thought to perform the bulk of repair independently of transcription. TCR is also believed to be mediated exclusively by Mfd-a DNA translocase of a marginal NER phenotype1-3. Here we combined in cellulo cross-linking mass spectrometry with structural, biochemical and genetic approaches to map the interactions within the TCR complex (TCRC) and to determine the actual sequence of events that leads to NER in vivo. We show that RNA polymerase (RNAP) serves as the primary sensor of DNA damage and acts as a platform for the recruitment of NER enzymes. UvrA and UvrD associate with RNAP continuously, forming a surveillance pre-TCRC. In response to DNA damage, pre-TCRC recruits a second UvrD monomer to form a helicase-competent UvrD dimer that promotes backtracking of the TCRC. The weakening of UvrD-RNAP interactions renders cells sensitive to genotoxic stress. TCRC then recruits a second UvrA molecule and UvrB to initiate the repair process. Contrary to the conventional view, we show that TCR accounts for the vast majority of chromosomal repair events; that is, TCR thoroughly dominates over global genomic repair. We also show that TCR is largely independent of Mfd. We propose that Mfd has an indirect role in this process: it participates in removing obstructive RNAPs in front of TCRCs and also in recovering TCRCs from backtracking after repair has been completed.","output":"Crucial role and mechanism of transcription-coupled DNA repair in bacteria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the prevailing pandemic of the coronavirus disease COVID-19, we are experiencing emotional and social isolation, which negatively affects mental and physical health, particularly among the elderly population.

According to our study, COVID-19 infection entailed a substantial change in older peoples behavior. Over 50%, nearly 80%, and more than 25% of the surveyed participants reduced their social, recreational, and professional activities, respectively. The most significant change in seniors behavior due to the fear of COVID-19 infection was observed in patients (1) with cardiac and pulmonary problems, (2) being on multi-drug therapy, (3) vaccinated against influenza, and (4) with several mental difficulties including loneliness, social isolation, and depression. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 10% of participants canceled planned hospitalization due to the fear of COVID-19 infection. This was observed primarily in patients suffering from chronic heart and lung diseases, vaccinated against influenza, exhibiting the reluctance to carry out more complex daily activities, and with a higher level of anxiety, social loneliness, and malnutrition. Thus, these groups of seniors require more attention; hence, we propose telemedicine as a strategy directed to them that provides clinical healthcare and information regarding measurements, control, and protection against SARS-CoV-2 during the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic.

Ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation were evaluated on thorax CT. The presence of a single lobe lesion was considered as limited while multiple lobe lesions were considered as diffuse involvement for both GGO and consolidation. Result: A total 200 patients with COVID-19 were evaluated. 178 of them (89%) were discharged, 17 patients (8.5%) were transferred to the ICU and five patients died (2.5%). The ratios of mortality and transfer to the ICU in patients with diffused GGO were significantly higher compared to patients with limited GGOs. It was observed that troponin &#8805;0.06 g/L, platelet <140 and fibrinogen &#8805;350 mg/dl were independent predictors of the presences of diffused GGOs in thorax CT.

This work aimed to explore the potential of a leaf extract from Harrisonia abyssinica to modulate the neurobehavioral, biochemical and histopathological activities induced experimentally by Al in vivo. Rats subjected to Al treatment displayed a reduction in learning and memory performance in a passive avoidance test accompanied by a decrease in the hippocampal monoamine and glutamate levels in addition to suppression of Bcl2 expression.

In the absence of animal models to test drugs, we need to find molecular explanations for any unforeseen peculiarities in clinical data, especially the recent reports describing an unexpected asthma paradox. Asthma is considered a high medical risk factor for susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection, yet asthma is not on the list of top 10 chronic health problems suffered by people who died from SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Resolving this paradox requires looking beyond the binary model of a viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) attaching to the ACE-2 receptor. A pBlast analysis revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 surface spike protein contains two calcium-dependent fusion domains that were recently discovered SARS-CoV-1. These viral calcium-dependent binding domains can facilitate membrane fusion only after cleavage by the host surface protease TMPRSS2. Importantly, TMPRSS2 also requires calcium for its SRCR (scavenger receptor cysteine-rich) domain and its LDLRA (LDL receptor class A) domain. Thus, the presence of EDTA excipients in nebulized (2)-agonist medicines can disrupt SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection and can explain the asthma paradox. This model validates repurposing EDTA in nebulizer solutions from a passive excipient to an active drug for treating COVID-19 infections. Repurposed EDTA delivery to respiratory tissues at an initial target dose of 2.4 mg per aerosol treatment is readily achievable with standard nebulizer and mechanical ventilator equipment. EDTA warrants further investigation as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 /COVID-19 in consideration of the new calcium requirements for virus infection and the regular presence of EDTA excipients in common asthma medications such as Metaproterenol. Finally, the natural history of Coronavirus diseases and further analysis of the fusion loop homologies between the Betacorona SARS-CoV-2 virus and the less pathogenic Alphacorona HC0V-229E virus suggest how to engineer a hybrid virus suitable for an attenuated alpha-beta SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccine. Thus, replacing SARS-CoV-2 fusion loops (amino acids 816-855) with the less pathogenic HCoV-229E fusion loop (amino acids 923-982) may provide antigenicity of COVID-19, but limit the pathogenicity to the level of HCoV-229E.","output":"Why the lower reported prevalence of asthma in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 validates repurposing EDTA solutions to prevent and manage treat COVID-19 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Uncertain business environment particularly during COVID 19 outbreak forced many enterprises including Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) need to change the business model.

This pandemic has created significant stress on the healthcare system. Most of the resources are being diverted to COVID care, and care of non-COVID patients is compromised. As haematologists dealing with frail immune-compromised patients, challenges we are facing are staff attrition, near-empty blood banks, less intensive care beds, the chance of our patients getting infected with COVID during the hospital stay, fear of donors being asymptomatic COVID carriers to mention a few. In this situation, we have tried to formulate a practical approach for doing bone marrow transplants, which we have been following for the last few months at our centre. Our Transplant Protocol Initially we tried to postpone transplants. But as the COVID situation was becoming a chronic one, we formulated our ways to start transplants. Amidst lockdown, we successfully completed Autografts in myeloma and Lymphoma. We also started Allogeneic transplants including haplo-identical transplant for acute leukemia. In this hour of need, we had to strike a balance in transplant management. We tried to be practical in our decision-making skills at this hour of need. Being students of science, it was time to show practicality in ordering tests, therapy, and transfusions to the patient. Due to lockdown and general panic, the stocks in Blood Banks were at an all-time low. So transfusions and donor arrangements were be dealt judiciously. The hospital was divided into COVID and NON-COVID zones. All patients with fever and respiratory symptoms go directly to the COVID zone and get examined and tested by physicians with proper PPE as per WHO protocol.Even there are no symptoms of COVID like dry cough, fever, and throat pain, the patients entering NON-COVID also will be screened by a general physician at the single point of entry with proper protection and then patient with one attendee was allowed to come to transplant outpatient department. This helped us reduce risk to the medical professional and other patients waiting in a specialty department like ours. We had a detailed discussion about the pros and cons with patient and attendee. We admitted them in a separate block and got tested for COVID19 RTPCR. The patient had HRCT thorax to check for early radiological signs of COVID19. The blood parameters which serve as prognostic markers for COVID were checked alongside to double confirm false negativity of tests.The donor was made to stay as attendee for the patient. We shifted them inside transplant unit and observed for a week to rule out COVID symptoms. Radiological investigations were done before starting procedure. Minimal physical interaction was established and in Myeloma and Lymphoma autograft, we did around 20% dose reduction of conditioning regimen drugs. For allograft, no drug dose modification was done. The threshold for antibiotic stewardship was kept very low and high end antibiotics like Colistin / Fosfomycin were initiated early. We collected single donor platelets and kept stocks ready to avoid exposure to multiple random donors. The blood bank also was very careful in selecting donors after a thorough screening for symptoms of COVID19. Once engrafted, they were discharged early and kept on follow-up mostly by tele-consultation. The personal visits were kept to a minimum of once in four weeks. From first lockdown to date of submission, we completed nine bone marrow transplants at our centre which included three AML haplo-identical transplants. Conclusion Postponing transplant is not feasible in all situations, as few of our refractory diseases will ultimately relapse and transplant becomes the only live saving procedure. As we wait for the situation to better, the normal functioning of hospitals may take some more time.These above are the methods we are following in our MIOT hospital at Chennai, India the city which has got around 100,000 COVID19 cases during submission. Our advice is where ever feasible, we should try to stick to time tested conventional protocols. The above protocols may be useful temporarily till the COVID crisis is over. Reference 1. Willian J.

Adults (18 years) diagnosed with major depressive disorder; capable of reading and understanding English or Bahasa Malaysia; prescribed with at least one antidepressant and owns a smart phone were subsequently randomly assigned (1:1) to receive treatment reminders (intervention) or standard treatment without reminders (control), using a computergenerated randomisation programme. The intervention group received two reminder categories: Outpatient appointment reminders (a day before appointment); and medication reminders (weekly basis). Participants were followed-up over two months. We utilised Montgomery- Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) to measure the severity of depression; and Brief Adherence Rating Scale (BARS) to assess medication adherence. Primary outcomes were outpatient attendance rates and medication adherence assessed at two months. Secondary outcomes included changes in depression severity within each group at two months; comparison of changes in depression severity between both groups; preferences of participants towards treatment reminders, and reasons for non-attendance among participants.

At two months, intervention group has significantly higher outpatient attendance rates (76.8%) than control group (56.4%) (p=0.002), and reported higher medical adherence percentage (mean difference 23.1, [95%CI 0.4, 35.8]; p<0.001). There was also significant difference in the MADRS score change between both groups (mean difference 3.4, [95%CI 0.4, 6.3]; p=0.025). Treatment reminders preferences among participants varied; forgetfulness was the most commonly reported reason (53%) for missing outpatient appointments. CONCLUSION Reminders through mobile messaging applications significantly improved outpatient attendance and medication adherence among patients with depression. Our findings support the use of messaging apps for treatment reminders in psychiatric outpatient settings. However, concerns regarding confidentiality require careful measures to be taken.","output":"Reminder through mobile messaging application improves outpatient attendance and medication adherence among patients with depression: An open-label randomised controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sugarcane is among the most important global crops and a key bioenergy source. Sugarcane production is restricted by limited levels of available soil potassium (K+). The ability of plants to respond to stressors can be regulated by a range of microRNAs (miRNAs). However, there have been few studies regarding the roles of miRNAs in the regulation of sugarcane responses to K+-deficiency. To understand how these non-coding RNAs may influence sugarcane responses to low-K+ stress, we conducted expression profiling of miRNAs in sugarcane roots under low-K+ conditions via high-throughput sequencing. This approach led to the identification of 324 and 42 known and novel miRNAs, respectively, of which 36 were found to be differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) under low-K+ conditions. These results also suggested that miR156-x/z and miR171-x are involved in these responses as potential regulators of lateral root formation and the ethylene signaling pathway, respectively. A total of 705 putative targets of these DEMs were further identified through bioinformatics predictions and degradome analyses, and GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed these target mRNAs to be enriched for catalytic activity, binding functions, metabolic processes, plant hormone signal transduction, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. In summary, these data provide an overview of the roles of miRNAs in the regulation of sugarcane response to low-K+ conditions.","output":"Integrated Analysis of miRNAs Associated With Sugarcane Responses to Low-Potassium Stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Moxibustion, a traditional Chinese medicine technique, involves the use of moxa smoke from Folium Artemisia argyi to treat various disorders, especially superficial infections. However, there is a higher health risk for people exposed to high levels of moxa smoke for extended durations. Here, we report the first ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) fingerprint profiles and pharmacodynamic evaluation of moxa smoke, as well as evaluation of its aqueous solution on a rat model of superficial infection. METHODS: A novel method for moxa smoke fingerprint profiling was developed using UHPLC under characteristic wavelength. Chromatographic peaks were further analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS). 12 sample batches obtained from various Chinese provinces were then analyzed using similarity evaluation, clustering analysis, and principal component analysis. The pharmacodynamics of moxa smoke and moxa aqueous solution were investigated on a rat model of acute skin wound infection. RESULTS: UHPLC fingerprint profiles of 12 batches of moxa smoke were generated at 270 nm wavelength and 21 chromatographic peaks extracted as common peaks. Similarity between the 12 batches ranged from 0.341 to 0.982. Based on cluster analysis, the 12 batches of moxa smoke samples were clustered into five groups. Principal component analysis showed that the cumulative contribution of the three principal components reached 90.17%. Eigenvalues of the first, second, and third principal components were 10.794, 6.504, and 1.638, respectively. The corresponding variance contribution rates were 51.40%, 30.97%, and 7.80%, respectively. Pharmacological analysis found that wound healing was slow in the model group relative to the mupirocin ointment, moxa smoke, and aqueous moxa smoke solution groups. Histological analysis revealed markedly reduced tissue inflammation in rats treated with moxa smoke or its aqueous solution. CONCLUSIONS: Moxa smoke and its aqueous solution significantly promote wound healing upon superficial infection. A novel quality control method for moxa smoke was established and evaluated for the first time. As its main effects are unchanged, the transformation of moxa smoke into aqueous moxa smoke improves safety and is a simple and controllable process.","output":"Chemical Fingerprint Profiles and Pharmacodynamic Investigation for Quality Evaluation of Moxa Smoke by UHPLC in a Rat Model of Superficial Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This is a subanalysis of a previous study which compared the effectiveness of trimetoprim-sulfametoxazole (TMP-SMX) with all other regimens for treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Aim of the current study was to focus on the effectiveness of a strategy based on TMP-SMX as de-escalation from -lactam including regimens. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study including patients who were hospitalized for VAP from 2011 to 2019. Patients were distributed in two groups: NO SWITCH TO TMP-SMX group, including patients who received -lactams for all treatment duration, and SWITCH TO TMP-SMX group, which included patients who switched to TMP-SMX from a -lactam including regimen after microbiology diagnosis. Three clinical outcomes were analyzed: mortality at 30 days from the start of the antibiotic treatment (T30), mortality at the end of treatment (EoT), and acquisition of multidrug-resistant bacteria during hospitalization in intensive care unit. RESULTS: Overall, 70 patients were included in the current study, 32/70 (45.7%) in NO SWITCH TO TMP-SMX group and 38/70 (54.3%) in SWITCH TO TMP-SMX group, 37/70 (52.8%) had been already included in the previous study. No significant differences in clinical outcomes and patients characteristics were found when the two groups were compared. CONCLUSIONS: De-escalation to TMP-SMX for VAP treatment was not associated with higher mortality at EoT and T30 than standard treatment with -lactam.

The primary components of vaping products, vitamin E acetate (VEA) and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), may be responsible for acute lung toxicity. Currently, little information is available on the physiological and biological effects of exposure to these products. We hypothesized that these e-cig vape cartridges and their constituents (VEA and MCT) induce pulmonary toxicity, mediated by oxidative damage and inflammatory responses, leading to acute lung injury. We studied the potential mechanisms of e-cig vape cartridge aerosol induced inflammatory response by evaluating the generation of reactive oxygen species by MCT, VEA, and cartridges and their effects on the inflammatory state of pulmonary epithelium and immune cells both in vitro and in vivo. Cells exposed to these aerosols generated reactive oxygen species, caused cytotoxicity, induced epithelial barrier dysfunction, and elicited an inflammatory response. Using a murine model, the parameters of acute toxicity to aerosol inhalation were assessed. Infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes was accompanied by significant increases in IL-6, eotaxin, and G-CSF in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). In mouse plasma, eicosanoid inflammatory mediators, leukotrienes, were significantly increased. Plasma from e-cig users also showed increased levels of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETEs) and various eicosanoids. Exposure to e-cig vape cartridge aerosols showed the most significant effects and toxicity compared to MCT and VEA. In addition, we determined SARS-CoV-2 related proteins and found no impact associated with aerosol exposures from these tested cartridges. Overall, this study demonstrates acute exposure to specific e-cig vape cartridges induces in vitro cytotoxicity, barrier dysfunction, and inflammation and in vivo mouse exposure induces acute inflammation with elevated proinflammatory markers in the pathogenesis of EVALI.","output":"Pulmonary toxicity and inflammatory response of e-cigarette vape cartridges containing medium-chain triglycerides oil and vitamin E acetate: Implications in the pathogenesis of EVALI"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text]","output":"Network pharmacological approach for elucidating the mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine in treating COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To date, there is no reliable instrument which could be used to assess problematic Internet use (PIU) in Lithuania.

However, in many countries their use for sports has not been mandatory due to the additional strain on breathing. It is important to note that the non-use of facemasks in enclosed spaces significantly increases the risk of infection, since breathing and, consequently, the amount of air exhaled during exercise can increase by up to 5 times its value at rest. On the other hand, the choice of mask type could have a major impact on breathing in different types of sports and it is essential to study the different masks available. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare different ways of breathing during exercise using common face masks in young female athletes. Based on our results, the FFP2 mask causes very considerable changes, making breathing difficult, while the Emotion mask has very little impact on the same parameters. ABSTRACT: The development of new models of face masks makes it necessary to compare their impact on exercise. Therefore, the aim of this work was to compare the cardiopulmonary response to a maximal incremental test, perceived ventilation, exertion, and comfort using FFP2 or Emotion masks in young female athletes. Thirteen healthy sportswomen (22.08  1.75 years) performed a spirometry, and a graded exercise test on a treadmill, with a JAEGER(?) Vyntus CPX gas analyzer using an ergospirometry mask (ErgoMask) or wearing the FFP2 or the Emotion mask below the ErgoMask, randomized on 3 consecutive days. Also, menstrual cycle status was monitored to avoid possible intrasubject alterations. The results showed lower values for the ErgoMask+FFP2, compared to ErgoMask or ErgoMask+Emotion, in forced vital capacity (3.8  0.2, 4.5  0.2 and 4.1  0.1 l, respectively); forced expiratory volume in 1 s (3.3  0.2, 3.7  0.2 and 3.5  0.1 l); ventilation (40.9  1.5, 50.6  1.5 and 46.9  1.2 l/min); breathing frequency (32.7  1.1, 37.4  1.1 and 35.3  1.4 bpm); VE/VO(2) (30.5  0.7, 34.6  0.9 and 33.6  0.7); VE/VCO(2) (32.2  0.6, 36.2  0.9 and 34.4  0.7) and time to exhaustion (492.4  9.7, 521.7  8.6 and 520.1  9.5 s) and higher values in inspiratory time (0.99  0.04, 0.82  0.03 and 0.88  0.03 s).

METHODS: Cohort of 370 hospitalized children (1 to 72 months) with SARI from May 2008 to March 2010 was enrolled in this study. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) specimens were tested by a commercial assay for 18 respiratory viral targets. The viral distribution and its association with clinical character were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Viral pathogen was detected in 350 (94.29%) of children with SARI. Overall, the most popular viruses were: enterovirus/rhinovirus (EV/RV) (54.05%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (51.08%), human bocavirus (BoCA) (33.78%), human parainfluenzaviruse type 3 (PIV3) (15.41%), and adenovirus (ADV) (12.97%). Pandemic H1N1 was the dominant influenza virus (IFV) but was only detected in 20 (5.41%) of children. Moreover, detection rate of RSV and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) among suburb participants were significantly higher than that of urban area (P<0.05). Incidence of VSARI among suburb participants was also significant higher, especially among those of 24 to 59 months group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Piconaviruses (EV/RV) and paramyxoviruses are the most popular viral pathogens among children with SARI in this study. RSV and hMPV significantly increase the risk of SARI, especially in children younger than 24 months.

The essay analyzes the apparatuses of contagion, the crucial importance of language, the devices of alienation favoring the loss of the sense of objectivity during the 1628 plague, and the pandemic of our time. For Manzoni, the recovery of reality in its bare complexity is possible, to a certain extent, by referring to the two fundamental lines of his thought. On the one hand, the philosophical irony with deep roots in Friedrich Schlegel, European Romanticism, and the reaction to Kantian philosophy. Romantic irony triggers the ethics of writing that runs through Manzoni's novel. On the other hand is the religious direction that Manzoni finds expressed in the Gospels, human conscience, and the idea of ?eternal justice?. It emerges in crucial moments of the novel and its appendix, in what Emmanuel Levinas called the ?epiphany of the face? which is considered in intersection with Paul Ricoeur's idea of ?oneself as another?. Manzoni sees all the problems inherent in both reason and religion. In trying to keep them united, he participates in the most advanced Romantic view of religion and politics, what Frederick Beiser has defined as ?one of the most creative and interesting attempts in the history of philosophy to surmount the classical dilemma between humanism and religion.?","output":"Re-reading Manzoni at the time of COVID-19: Contagion, ethics and justice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate whether dyslipidemia affects the mortality and severity of COVID-19, we also aimed to evaluate whether other comorbidities influence the association.

This study's main outcome is a poor composite outcome, comprising of mortality and severe COVID-19. RESULTS: There were 9 studies with 3,663 patients. The prevalence of dyslipidemia in this pooled analysis was 18% (4%-32%). Dyslipidemia was associated with increased composite poor outcome (RR 1.39 [1.02, 1.88], p=0.010; I(2): 56.7%, p=0.018). Subgroup analysis showed that dyslipidemia was associated with severe COVID-19 (RR 1.39 [1.03, 1.87], p=0.008; I(2): 57.4%, p=0.029).

In this patient-controlled prospective pilot study, we compared the CSI measured from the surgical and control hemispheres of patients undergoing CEA surgery to determine whether the parameter is affected by presumed changes in cerebral blood flow. METHODS Fifteen consenting CEA patients entered this institutionally approved study. We connected a separate Cerebral State Monitor to the left and right sides of the patient's head and recorded CSI intraoperatively. We compared the control-side data with the surgical-side data.

Using a welfare-economic monetary approach, costs were estimated for (1) treatment, (2) travelling to and from the hospital in terms of both fuel and time consumed by the patients and (3) society through emissions contributing to climate change. The proportion of patients/year that could be supplied within the same budget, for each individual treatment, was calculated. The cost of the insoles was 825 SEK (PRI) and 1450 SEK (CMI), respectively. The cost, mean value/patient due to the consumption of patients' time at the department, was 754 SEK (PRI) and 1508 SEK (CMI), respectively. Emissions, in terms of CO2 equivalent, were 13.7 (PRI) and 27.4 (CMI), respectively. Using PRI, a total of 928 patients could be provided/year compared with 500 patients if CMI are used. By using PRI, the cost/treatment was reduced by 46%. The cost of treatment dominated and the cost of time consumed by patients were also substantial. The societal cost of contributing to climate change was of low importance. By using PRI, the needs of 86% more patients could be met within the same budget.

We used stratified analysis to answer the question because when race/ethnicity serves as a non-specific proxy for numerous (confounding) factors, these can be (partially) controlled for through stratification [3]. Joint modeling of multiple groups is often used to gain power, but one needs to assume certain coherent distributions across different groups, which is not always true. Additionally, testing the interaction term is to assess association heterogeneity between groups, but it does not directly address whether the treatment is effective in each group.Specifically, we would like to elaborate on the following:1) Our conclusion: \\"the use of ARB was associated with a significant reduction in in-hospital mortality among African American (AA) patients but not non-AA patients\\" was based on results from the stratified analysis. We reported that ARB in-hospital use was associated with reduced mortality in the AA stratum (OR=0.196; 95%CI:0.074-0.516; P=0.001) with statistical significance. On the other hand, the association in the non-AA stratum is not statistically significant (OR=0.687; 95%CI:0.427-1.106; P=0.122). As stated previously, our primary objective is to assess whether ACE-I/ARB use among AA patients is associated with COVID-19 mortality, rather than the difference between AA and non-AA patients. We were also aware that the estimated ORs across different stratum were not comparable as noted in [4-6].2) We performed the joint modeling of AA and non-AA patients as suggested by [6]. Here, ARB in-hospital use was associated with reduced mortality in entire study population (OR=0.560; 95%CI:0.371-0.846; P=0.006). The interaction term added to the model was not significant (95%CI:0.185-1.292; P=0.149). Interpreting interaction terms in logistic regression is complex and a significant interaction term in log-odds may not be significant in difference-in-differences for probability[7]. Furthermore, the assumption of the additive effects and imbalanced sample sizes could impact the inference.We believe these results and the interpretation are appropriate. We acknowledge that there are cases where comparing the interaction term in greater detail would be an important next step for understanding the association between COVID-19 mortality and race/ethnicity.","output":"Concerns about the interpretation of subgroup analysis.

We aimed to measure the impact of COVID-19 and potential changes over time in its impact, on the health and well-being of HCWs in an Australian COVID-19 hospital. METHODS: An online questionnaire assessed current and retrospective physical and mental health; psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale); lifestyle behaviours; and demographics, providing measures of health and wellbeing at three phases of the pandemic. Targeted staff were invited to participate via email and in-person. Additional promotional activities were directed to all staff. Changes in general health, mental health and psychological distress were examined using McNemars Chi-square. Associations between other categorical variables were tested using Chi-Square or non-parametric equivalents as appropriate. Logistic regression explored risk factors for current distress. RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-three eligible HCWs answered all (74 %) or part of the questionnaire. Current self-rated health and mental health were significantly better than during the height of the pandemic, but had not returned to pre-pandemic levels. Psychological distress was significantly more common during the height of the pandemic (34.2 %) than currently (22.4 %), and during the height of the pandemic distress was significantly more common among younger than older HCWs. Females were significantly more likely to be distressed that males currently, but not during the height of the pandemic. High distress during the height of the pandemic was more likely to be maintained by HCWs who were less physically active than usual during the height of the pandemic (OR = 5.5); had low self-rated mental health before the pandemic (OR = 4.8); and who had 10 or more years of professional experience (OR = 3.9). CONCLUSIONS: The adverse effects of the pandemic on HCWs have lessened with the easing of pandemic demands, but health and well-being have not reverted to pre-pandemic levels. This indicates continued exposure to elevated levels of stress and/or a sustained effect of earlier exposure. Initiatives that provide ongoing support beyond the pandemic are needed to ensure that HCWs remain physically and mentally healthy and are able to continue their invaluable work.","output":"Detrimental changes to the health and well-being of healthcare workers in an Australian COVID-19 hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic of Covid-19 has created a paradigm for possibly gaining greater insight in two conditions:Studies since the beginning of this century have supported the view that IGF-1 deficiency in the neonate defines the basis of autism As a result, it appears that interleukin-6 in corona virus-based infections causes reduced defenses because of suppressed IGF-1, especially in older patients This may also portend an increase of autism in the offspring of gravidas currently affected severely by Covid-19","output":"COVID-19 and autism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In several nations, caries in pre-school children remain a significant oral health issue.

Currently, the amount of published applications is far higher than the published scientific studies while the problems of usability remains vulnerable. The goal of this paper was to comprehensively document the phase of development and usability testing of a mobile application for diet and oral health, namely Gigiku Sihat, which was primarily intended to be used by parents and guardians of pre-school children. The mobile application was developed using the System Development Life Cycle principle. Apart from searching for the available oral health application on Android platform, the initial requirement gathering process consisted of situational analysis, concept generation, content development, and features and functional requirement determination. The mobile application design and implementation evolved at each phase before being finalised. Gigiku Sihat was successfully developed in the Bahasa Malaysia. Finalised Gigiku Sihat was installed on mobile devices to determine the usability using translated and validated System Usability Scale questionnaire namely Skala Kebolehgunaan Aplikasi Mudah Alih (SKAMA). The mean score usability with score of 68 and above was deemed to have good usability. This study found that Gigiku Sihat mean (SD) usability score was 77.0 (14.18). The results were promising as they showed that Gigiku Sihat had a good usability. Thus, the development of this mobile application focusing on diet and oral health served as a new source of oral health education and provided a necessary foundation in developing future improved mobile application development for parents in the prevention of early childhood caries.","output":"Development and usability testing of mobile application on diet and oral health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has constrained world governments to impose measures of restraint and social distancing which also involves coastal areas. One of the most affected activities is tourism due to travel restrictions imposed by precautionary measures. This is also reflected in the recreative use of the coastal strip. Consequently, beaches and coastal stretches of small municipalities can potentially become contagious outbreaks of COVID-19 if adequate control and management measures are not promptly implemented. During the 20th century, several factors, both natural and human induced, caused alterations to coastal processes and consequently to the services they were providing. Coastal environments are very vulnerable and sensitive to change. This raises the need for careful assessment prior to any intervention or strategy involving the coastal system. Several literature studies have been focused both in the past and in recent years on examining the main factors affecting coastal vulnerability highlighting critical issues and shortcomings. The present paper, addressing all critical issues from literature review, illustrates a consistent methodology to support coastal management which combines both physical and socio-economic aspects and provides for the quantification of two different coastal vulnerability indices. The approach adopted has led to a distinction of different coastal peculiarities and a mapping of risk levels providing, in addition, the basis for the implementation of strategies risks related to COVID-19. The methodology proposed can be a useful reference in several areas, in demonstrating its effectiveness it has been applied with respect to a coastal area in southern Italy.","output":"Coastal vulnerability analysis to support strategies for tackling COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: An unidentified cluster of pneumonia was identified in Wuhan city of China in the last week of December 2019, named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2). The current study explored the predictors associated with critical illness and mortality based on symptoms at the time of admission and initial physical examination findings in patients with SARS-CoV-2. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 249 records of laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 patients were analyzed. Demographic profile and findings of initial physical examination were collected and analyzed. Bivariate logistic and multivariable stepwise forward regression analysis was used to identify the predictors of critical illness and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 249 records of SARS-COV-2 patients were retrospectively studied, of whom 66 (26.5%) developed a critical illness, and 58 (23.29%) died. The mean age of patients was 45.15 (16.34) years; 171 (68.71%) were men. From 27 potential predictors for developing a critical illness, 15 were reported independent predictors for critical illness, and 13 were for increased risk of mortality. Stepwise forward regression reported dyspnea as a single strongest predictor (OR, 5.800, 95% CI-2.724-12.346; p = 0.001, R2 = 0.272) to develop critical illness. Likewise, the respiratory rate was alone reported as a strong predictor (OR, 1.381, 95% CI- 1.251-1.525; p = 0.000, R2 = 0.329) for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Coronavirus disease is a new challenge to the medical fraternity, leading to significant morbidity and mortality.

BACKGROUND: The Covid\\\\19 pandemic has caused major changes to family life. Using a natural experiment design can potentially adjudicate on former inconclusive findings about the effects of lockdown on parental functioning in vulnerable families. METHOD: Responses from parents in a sample of potentially vulnerable families in Norway were divided into a lockdown group if participating at baseline and during the initial Covid\\\\19 lockdown (n = 820 responses) or into a control group if participating at baseline and before lockdown (n = 1368 responses). Mixed model regression analyses were used to mimic a wait\\\\list design investigating direct lockdown effects on mental health, parenting stress, and three aspects of interparental conflicts, as well as moderation effects. RESULTS: The lockdown group showed significantly higher levels of parenting stress compared with the control group, but no aversive lockdown effect on mental health or destructive conflicts were found. In fact, decreased levels of verbal aggression and child involvement in conflict were found during lockdown among parents living apart. Pre\\\\existing financial problems and conflict levels, age of youngest child, and parent gender did not moderate the lockdown effects. CONCLUSION: The initial lockdown did not seem to adversely affect parental functioning, beyond increased parenting stress.

The data synthesis had two parts: an in-depth review of studies that leveraged machine learning (ML) techniques and a limited review of studies that applied traditional modeling approaches. ML applications from the in-depth review were categorized into use cases related to public health and clinical practice, and narratively synthesized. One hundred eighty-three articles met the inclusion criteria for the in-depth review. Six key use cases were identified: forecasting infectious disease dynamics and effects of interventions;surveillance and outbreak detection;real-time monitoring of adherence to public health recommendations;real-time detection of influenza-like illness;triage and timely diagnosis of infections;and prognosis of illness and response to treatment. Data sources and types of ML that were useful varied by use case. The search identified 1167 articles that reported on traditional modeling approaches, which highlighted additional areas where ML could be leveraged for improving the accuracy of estimations or projections. Important ML-based solutions have been developed in response to pandemics, and particularly for COVID-19 but few were optimized for practical application early in the pandemic.

Although partially effective treatments are now available, MS represents a major target for research into the development of disease-modifying therapies that specifically focus on the neuroimmune pathways of myelin and tissue damage that currently are incompletely understood. Multiple sclerosis is considered to be an example of development of autoimmunity to self-antigens within the CNS through multiple initiating events that include infections and other environmental factors. The direct or indirect induction of immune responses against CNS antigens includes chemotaxis of T cells, B cells, and monocytes, and production of immunoglobulin responses, each of which can act as an effector of myelin damage that occurs in distinct histological patterns. Because a specific cause for MS has not been identified, much MS research has focused on CNS immune responses triggered by unidentified insults that in turn trigger inflammation-mediated cascades of myelin and cellular damage that are likely relevant to other neurodegenerative diseases. This chapter discusses current the epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, animal models, virus models and recent advances in the neuroimmunology of MS from the perspective of the potential for development of newer therapies for MS and other inflammatory CNS diseases.","output":"Multiple Sclerosis and Other Demyelinating Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An increasing number of people are undergoing vaccination for COVID-19 because of the ongoing pandemic.

Therefore, early, and precise diagnosis is critical to control disease progression and management. Compared to the very popular RT-PCR (reverse- transcription polymerase chain reaction) method, chest CT imaging is a more consistent, sensible, and fast approach for identifying and managing infected COVID-19 patients, specifically in the epidemic area. CT images use computational methods to combine 2D X-ray images and transform them into 3D images. One major drawback of CT scans in diagnosing COVID-19 is creating false-negative effects, especially early infection. This article aims to combine novel CT imaging tools and Virtual Reality (VR) technology and generate an automatize system for accurately screening COVID-19 disease and navigating 3D visualizations of medical scenes. The key benefits of this system are a) it offers stereoscopic depth perception, b) give better insights and comprehension into the overall imaging data, c) it allows doctors to visualize the 3D models, manipulate them, study the inside 3D data, and do several kinds of measurements, and finally d) it has the capacity of real-time interactivity and accurately visualizes dynamic 3D volumetric data.

Especially during the last years, they have invested a lot into the digital transformation of their business process. Concerning their retail customers, banks realized very early the great potential abilities to provide value added self-services functions via mobile devices, mainly smartphones to them;thus, they have invested a lot into m-banking apps functionality. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought out different ways for financial transactions and even more mobile users have taken advantage of m-banking app services. Thus, the purpose of this empirical paper is to investigate the determinants that impact individuals on adopting or not m-banking apps. Specifically, it examines two groups of individuals, users (adopters) and non-users (non-adopters) of m-banking apps, and aims to reveal if there are differences and similarities between the factors that impact them on adopting or not this type of m-banking services. To our knowledge, this is the second scientific attempt where these two groups of individuals have been compared on this topic. The paper proposes a comprehensive conceptual model by extending Venkatechs et al.

Time to a formal diagnosis is normally two years diagnostic delays can lead to poorer outcome and long-term complications e.g. shoulder arthritis (odds ratio 19.3). There is a need to improve diagnostic accuracy and prevent the development of long-term complications. Healthcare services are increasingly drawing upon technological solutions to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, particularly within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent Rebuilding of the NHS strategy. A Diagnostic Decision Support System (DDSS) has the potential to reduce time to diagnosis and improve outcomes for patients. The aim of this study was to elicit physiotherapists clinical decision-making processes and develop a concept map for a future DDSS in shoulder instability. Methods: A qualitative study, using modified nominal focus group technique, involving three clinical vignettes, was used to elicit physiotherapists decision-making processes. Participants from across four separate clinical sites were recruited within their capacity as physiotherapists with a specialist interest in paediatric shoulder instability. All focus group sessions were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was conducted according to the stages of Braune and Clarke. Results: Twenty-five physiotherapists, (18F:7M) from four separate clinical sites participated. The themes identified related to ? Variability in diagnostic processes and lack of standardised practice 1. Differences in diagnoses and diagnostic processes 2. Differences in diagnoses and diagnostic processes 3. Diagnostic process occurs over a long period of time 4. Diagnostic test choices influenced by factors beyond objective markers associated with the patient injury 5. Planning for prognosis influenced by factors beyond assessment findings 6. Trust in staff relationships ? General distrust in individuals or modes of medicine used outside of the department ? Unity within the department ? Knowledge and attitudes towards novel technologies for facilitating assessment and clinical decision making and 1. Lack of knowledge and rejection of 3D motion capture. Conclusion(s): No common structured approach towards assessment and diagnosis was identified. Decision-making processes were not explicit, therefore, limiting the ability to develop a DDSS around current practice. Several systematic biases were identified in the assessment of paediatric shoulder instability, most notably regarding gender. Lack of knowledge, perceived usefulness, access, and cost were identified as barriers to adoption of new technology. Impact: Based on the information elicited a conceptual design of a future DDSS has been developed. Implementation of a DDSS may act as a vehicle for establishing wider consensus in practice and alert clinical end users of potential bias in order to mitigate against it. These findings have wider implications for the training and education of physiotherapists regarding assessment and clinical decision-making. Use of more objective measures, derived from technology, and used alongside an appropriate DDSS may reduce bias and the negative effects on patient outcomes. Development of any subsequent DDSS and software will need to address the barriers identified which are likely to limit the use of novel technology in practice. There is a risk that even if additional information and technology was available to clinicians, they would not use it.

France has implemented a strategy to fight this virus which relies essentially on widespread RT-PCR virological testing in order to isolate positive patients. Antigenic tests have recently been made available to help the diagnostics. We have conducted a retrospective study to determine the sensitivity of these antigenic tests, comparing them to the reference RT-PCR method. METHOD: Between December 7, 2020 and January 31, 2021, each patient we received in our laboratories for an RT-PCR test was enrolled. Out of 271,649 patients, 4,881 had been submitted to an antigenic test (TDR) in the preceding 24 hours. Comparing the data resulting from both tests, we established the sensitivity and the specificity of the antigenic tests. For our analysis we included the parameter of symptom and/or the value of Cycles threshold (Ct) in our parameters. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the TDRs compared to all the positive RT-PCR tests is 56%. We further demonstrate the correlation between the symptom duration and the reduction of the nasopharyngeal viral load. Based on this data, we have established that the sensitivity of the TDRs decreases very rapidly after symptom onset, contrary to the estimated viral load in the RT-PCR. Indeed, less the 24 hours after clinical symptom onset, the sensitivity of the TDRs decreases from 74% to 60%. By including the Ct value in our parameters, we have established that, despite a high viral load and clinical symptoms since 7 days or less, the sensitivity of the TDRs is 66%. Although, a high number of asymptomatic patients among carriers of SARS-CoV-2, we have estimated a specificity of 93% for our test. CONCLUSIONS: Performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity of the TDR, as assessed in practice, are inferior to those given by the manufacturer, which raises several questions.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Use of mental healthCrelated outpatient visits, emergency department visits, inpatient care, and oral prescription fills for antipsychotics and mood stabilizers during 4-week intervals. Multivariable logistic regression analyses examined whether the pandemic was associated with differential changes in outpatient care across patient characteristics. RESULTS: The 2019 cohort of 686 214 individuals included 389 245 (53.8%) women, 114 073 (15.8%) Black and 526 301 (72.8%) White individuals, and 477 353 individuals (66.0%) younger than 65 years; the 2020 cohort of 723 045 individuals included 367 140 (53.5%) women, 106 699 (15.6%) Black and 497 885 (72.6%) White individuals, and 442 645 individuals (64.5%) younger than 65 years. Compared with 2019, there were large decreases during the pandemics first month (calendar weeks 12-15) in individuals with outpatient visits (265 169 [36.7%] vs 200 590 [29.2%]; 20.3% decrease), with antipsychotic and mood stabilizer medication prescription fills (216 468 [29.9%] vs 163 796 [23.9%]; 20.3% decrease), with emergency department visits (12 383 [1.7%] vs 8503 [1.2%]; 27.7% decrease), and with hospital admissions (11 564 [1.6%] vs 7912 [1.2%]; 27.9% decrease). By weeks 32 to 35 of 2020, utilization rebounded but remained lower than in 2019, ranging from a relative decrease of 2.5% (outpatient visits) to 12.9% (admissions). During the full pandemic period (weeks 12-39) in 2020, 1 556 403 of 2 743 553 outpatient visits (56.7%) were provided via telemedicine. In multivariable analyses, outpatient visit use during weeks 12 to 25 of 2020 was lower among those with disability (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93-0.96), and during weeks 26 to 39 of 2020, it was lower among Black vs non-Hispanic White individuals (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99) and those with dual Medicaid eligibility (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.98). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, despite greater use of telemedicine, individuals with severe mental illness experienced large disruptions in care early in the pandemic. These narrowed but persisted through September 2020. Disruptions were greater for several disadvantaged populations.","output":"Disruptions in Care for Medicare Beneficiaries With Severe Mental Illness During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extracting spatial-temporal knowledge from data is useful in many applications. It is important that the obtained knowledge is human-interpretable and amenable to formal analysis. In this paper, we propose a method that trains neural networks to learn spatial-temporal properties in the form of weighted graph-based signal temporal logic (w-GSTL) formulas. For learning w-GSTL formulas, we introduce a flexible w-GSTL formula structure in which the users preference can be applied in the inferred w-GSTL formulas. In the proposed framework, each neuron of the neural networks corresponds to a subformula in a flexible w-GSTL formula structure. We initially train a neural network to learn the w-GSTL operators, and then train a second neural network to learn the parameters in a flexible w-GSTL formula structure. We use a COVID-19 dataset and a rain prediction dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework and algorithms. We compare the performance of the proposed framework with three baseline classification methods including K-nearest neighbors, decision trees, support vector machine, and artificial neural networks.

Colchicine, a natural plant product is used to treat and prevent acute gout flares. Some macrolide antibiotics are reported to have fatal drug-drug interactions with colchicine. The displacement interaction between colchicine and azithromycin on binding to BSA was evaluated using spectroscopic techniques, molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies.

Azithromycin didn't bind to BSA neither did it interfere in binding of colchicine. The results from molecular docking studies also led to a similar conclusion that azithromycin didn't interfere in the binding of colchicine to BSA.

The siRNA binding properties of the dendrimers and PEI 25 kDa were simulated, binding and stability were measured in SYBR Gold assays, and hydrodynamic diameters, zeta potentials, and cytotoxicity were quantified. These parameters were compared with cellular uptake of the complexes and their ability to mediate RNAi. Radiolabeled complexes were administered intravenously, and pharmacokinetic profiles and biodistribution of these polyplexes were assessed both invasively and non-invasively. All flexible triazine dendrimers formed thermodynamically more stable complexes than PEI. While PEI and the generation 4 dendrimer interacted more superficially with siRNA, generation 2 and 3 virtually coalesced with siRNA, forming a tightly intertwined structure. These dendriplexes were therefore more efficiently charge-neutralized than PEI complexes, reducing agglomeration. This behavior was confirmed by results of hydrodynamic diameters (72.0 nm-153.5 nm) and zeta potentials (4.9 mV-21.8 mV in 10 mM HEPES) of the dendriplexes in comparison to PEI complexes (312.8 nm-480.0 nm and 13.7 mV-17.4 mV in 10 mM HEPES). All dendrimers, even generation 3 and 4, were less toxic than PEI. All dendriplexes were efficiently endocytosed and showed significant and specific luciferase knockdown in HeLa/Luc cells. Scintillation counting confirmed that the generation 2 triazine complexes showed more than twofold prolonged circulation times as a result of their good thermodynamic stability. Conversely, generation 3 complexes dissociated in vivo, and generation 4 complexes were captured by the reticulo-endothelial system due to their increased surface charge. Molecular modeling proves very valuable for rationalizing experimental parameters based on the dendrimers' structural properties. Non-invasive molecular imaging predicted the in vivo fate of the complexes. Therefore, both techniques effectively promote the rapid development of safe and efficient siRNA formulations that are stable in vivo.","output":"Molecular modeling and in vivo imaging can identify successful flexible triazine dendrimer-based siRNA delivery systems."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People in the Middle East have been affected by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus (MERS Co-V) since 2012.

The Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 attaches to host lung epithelial cells through the cell surface receptor ACE2, a process dependent on host proteases including TMPRSS2. Here, we identify small molecules that reduce surface expression of TMPRSS2 using a library of 2,560 FDA-approved or current clinical trial compounds. We identify homoharringtonine and halofuginone as the most attractive agents, reducing endogenous TMPRSS2 expression at sub-micromolar concentrations. These effects appear to be mediated by a drug-induced alteration in TMPRSS2 protein stability. We further demonstrate that halofuginone modulates TMPRSS2 levels through proteasomal-mediated degradation that involves the E3 ubiquitin ligase component DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor 1 (DCAF1). Finally, cells exposed to homoharringtonine and halofuginone, at concentrations of drug known to be achievable in human plasma, demonstrate marked resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection in both live and pseudoviral in vitro models. Given the safety and pharmacokinetic data already available for the compounds identified in our screen, these results should help expedite the rational design of human clinical trials designed to combat active COVID-19 infection.","output":"A high-throughput screen for TMPRSS2 expression identifies FDA-approved compounds that can limit SARS-CoV-2 entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: To identify novel adenosine receptor (AR) ligands based on the chalcone scaffold, herein the synthesis, characterization and in vitro and in silico evaluation of 33 chalcones (15C36 and 37C41) and structurally related compounds (42C47) are reported.

Experience with influenza shows that infection primes CD8+ T cell memory to peptides presented by common HLA types like HLA-A2, which enhances recovery and diminishes clinical severity upon reinfection. Stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells from COVID-19 convalescent patients with overlapping peptides from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to the clonal expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in vitro, with CD4+ T cells being robust. We identified two HLA-A*02:01-restricted SARS-CoV-2-specfic CD8+ T cell epitopes, A2/S269-277 and A2/Orf1ab3183-3191 Using peptide-HLA tetramer enrichment, direct ex vivo assessment of A2/S269 +CD8+ and A2/Orf1ab3183 +CD8+ populations indicated that A2/S269 +CD8+ T cells were detected at comparable frequencies (a1.3  10-5) in acute and convalescent HLA-A*02:01+ patients. These frequencies were higher than those found in uninfected HLA-A*02:01+ donors (a2.5  10-6), but low when compared to frequencies for influenza-specific (A2/M158) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific (A2/BMLF1280) (a1.38  10-4) populations.

Furthermore, the bias toward na?ve, stem cell memory and central memory A2/S269 +CD8+ T cells rather than effector memory populations suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be compromising CD8+ T cell activation.

Serial intraoral photographs of one patient were taken at 48-hour intervals from the time of surgery until postoperative day 17. RESULTS Intraoral photographs from the days after tonsillectomy revealed a pattern of inflammation and healing that closely paralleled that in human skin and in canine and porcine oral wound models. CONCLUSIONS Edema and pain are greatest immediately after surgery, probably as a result of thermal effects and expression of inflammatory mediators that stimulate pharyngeal nociceptors. Pain gradually decreases over time, with an increase in analog pain measures on postoperative days 3 to 5 corresponding to the maximal wound inflammation documented in experimental models. Epithelial ingrowth beneath a fibrin clot begins shortly after wounding. Separation of the fibrin clot about 7 days after surgery exposes vascular stroma.

The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of orally administered medications (e.g., fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, and teriflunomide), interferon (IFN)-based therapy, and monoclonal antibodies (MABs) (e.g., natalizumab and rituximab) in the management of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in Saudi Arabia using real-world data. This was a retrospective cohort study in which patients with RRMS aged 18 years without any other chronic health conditions with non-missing data for at least 12 months were recruited from the electronic health records of a university-affiliated tertiary care center. Multiple logistic regressions controlling for age, sex, and duration of therapy were conducted to examine the odds of disability progression, clinical relapse, MRI lesions, and composite outcome (e.g., relapse, lesion development on MRI, disability progression). The number of patients who met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis was 146. Most of the patients were female (70.51%) and young (e.g., 35 years of age). There were 40 patients on the orally administered agents (e.g., dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, fingolimod), 66 patients were on IFN-based therapy (e.g., Rebif(?)), and 40 patients were on monoclonal antibodies (e.g., rituximab and natalizumab). Patients on MABs had lower odds of the composite outcome (OR = 0.17 (95% CI: 0.068C0.428)). The use of orally administered agents was dominant (e.g., more effective and less costly), with average annual cost savings of USD ?4336.65 (95% CI: ?5207.89C?3903.32) and 8.11% higher rate of effectiveness (95% CI: ?14.81C18.07) when compared with Rebif(?). With regard to the use of MABs in comparison to Rebif(?), MABs were associated with higher cost but a better rate of effectiveness, with an average additional annual cost of USD 1381.54 (95% CI: 421.31C3621.06) and 43.11% higher rate of effectiveness (95% CI: 30.38C61.15) when compared with Rebif(?). In addition, the use of MABs was associated with higher cost but a better rate of effectiveness, with an average additional annual cost of USD 5717.88 (95% CI: 4970.75C8272.66) and 35% higher rate of effectiveness (95% CI: 10.0C42.50) when compared with orally administered agents. The use of MABs in the management of RRMS among the young patient population has shown to be the most effective therapy in comparison to both IFN-based therapy (e.g., Rebif(?)) and orally administered agents, but with higher cost. Orally administered agents resulted in better outcomes and lower costs in comparison to IFN-based therapy.

Furthermore, adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profiles for screened compounds were predicted in silico. Methods: The crystal structure of Mpro was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank, while the plant bioactive compounds were retrieved from Pubchem. Drug-likeness of the selected compounds and a control drug (hydroxychloroquine) were assessed, and the compounds that satisfied the drug-likeness rule were docked against Mpro. The docked complexes were analyzed using LigPlot and the protein-ligand profiler server. The top five compound hits were subjected to ADMET screening using the ADMETSar server. Results: A total of 17 out of 22 screened compounds passed Lipinski's assessment. Additionally, the most active compounds from the investigated plants exhibited relative inhibitory potentials against Mpro compared with hydroxychloroquine, which alludes to their possible involvement in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease replication process.

Yet, according to a recent priority-setting review, \\"our current understanding of human milk composition and its individual components and their functions fails to fully recognize the importance of the chronobiology and systems biology of human milk in the context of milk synthesis, optimal timing and duration of feeding, and period of lactation\\" (P. Christian et al., Am J Clin Nutr 113:1063-1072, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqab075). We attribute this critical knowledge gap to three major reasons as follows. (i) Studies have typically examined each subsystem of the mother-milk-infant \\"triad\\" in isolation and often focus on a single element or component (e.g., maternal lactation physiology or milk microbiome or milk oligosaccharides or infant microbiome or infant gut physiology). This undermines our ability to develop comprehensive representations of the interactions between these elements and study their response to external perturbations. (ii) Multiomics studies are often cross-sectional, presenting a snapshot of milk composition, largely ignoring the temporal variability during lactation. The lack of temporal resolution precludes the characterization and inference of robust interactions between the dynamic subsystems of the triad. (iii) We lack computational methods to represent and decipher the complex ecosystem of the mother-milk-infant triad and its environment. In this review, we advocate for longitudinal multiomics data collection and demonstrate how incorporating knowledge gleaned from microbial community ecology and computational methods developed for microbiome research can serve as an anchor to advance the study of human milk and its many components as a \\"system within a system.\\"","output":"Using Community Ecology Theory and Computational Microbiome Methods To Study Human Milk as a Biological System."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When the world is rushing to test potential COVID-19 treatments, the limited resources and the overwhelming information demand the fast understanding of the promising drugs.

For this reason, on March 25, preventive isolation was declared mandatory. These measures involved the suspension of economic activities and drastically reduced the number of vehicles on the road. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic on PM2.5 concentrations at 5 monitoring stations and aerosol optical depth values of the Terra/MODIS satellite. We analyzed and compared the weekly and monthly concentrations of PM2.5 before and during the lockdown between the week of January 6 to June 22, 2020, and compared the daily values obtained from the Terra/MODIS satellite for the months of January-June during the years 2018-2020 to elucidate the effects of the lockdown. Similar to other monitored sites in the world, we observed substantial reductions in weekly PM2.5 concentrations, from 41 to 84% (Bogot), from 13 to 66% (Funza), from 17 to 57% (Boyac), from 35 to 86% (Valledupar) and 31 at 60% (Risaralda). Unlike other studies, the aerosol optical depth values increased up to 59% during the months of lockdown compared to previous years and up to 70% of the weekly mean when compared to before the lockdown.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a smartphone application called \\"Taberhythm\\" to investigate eating patterns, physical activity, and subjective feelings of happiness. We aimed to compare lifestyle data before and during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic to objectively assess lifestyle changes during quarantine.

Ultraviolet light based on the excitation of mercury emit light at 254nm and has well established anti-microbial effects but the use hereof in populated areas is hindered by the carcinogenic properties of 254nm light. This is in contrast to the recently developed excimer lamps based on Krypton Chloride. These lamps emit light with a peak intensity at a wavelength of 222nm and have recently been demonstrated to have broad bactericidal and viricidal effects includ-ing efficient inactivation of SARS-CoV2. It is, however, unclear how efficiently 222nm lamps perform in a real-life setting such as a hospital waiting area. In this study we aimed to as-sess the antimicrobial efficacy of filtered 222nm excimer lamps in a real-world setting at an out-patient pulmonological clinic. Methods Filtered KrCl 222nm excimer lamps (UV222 lamps) were installed in a densely populated waiting room at the out-patient waiting area at department of Respiratory Diseases and Allergy at Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. Furniture sufaces were sampled and analyzed for bacterial load in a single arm interventional longitudinal study with and without exposure to filtered 222nm UVC-light. Furthermore, bacterial species were identi-fied using MALDI-ToF mass-spectrometry. Findings The exposure to filtered 222nm UVC-light significantly reduced the number of colony-forming-units, and patches with high desity of bacteria. Pathogenic bacteria such as Staphy-lococcus Aureus and Staphylococcus Epidermidis were detected only in the non-exposed areas suggesting that these species are highly sensitive to inactivation by 222nm UVC-light. Conclusion Filtered 222nm UVC-light is highly anti-microbial in a real-world clinical setting reducing bacterial load and eradicating clinically concerning bacteria species.

Detection rates stratified by sex and age groups were estimated. The study of temporal trends was accomplished using the Seasonal-Trend Decomposition method and temporal modeling of detection rates using linear seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model according to Box and Jenkins method. Trend forecasts were performed for the 2017-2020 period. A total of 3,212 cases of leprosy were identified, the average incidence among men aged between 30 and 59 years old was 201.55/100,000 inhabitants and among women in the same age group was 135.28/100,000 inhabitants. Detection rates in total and by sex presented a downward trend, though rates stratified according to sex and age presented a growing trend among men aged less than 15 years old and among women aged 60 years old or over. The final models selected in the time-series analysis show the forecasts of total detection rates and rates for men and women presented a downward trend for the 2017-2020 period.

Their behavior during lockdown and associated restrictions is unknown, as well as whether it was influenced by coexistent cardiovascular conditions. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in May 2020, in France, nested in ComPaRe, an e-cohort of adults with chronic diseases. A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to 10,859 people; 3701 fully completed questionnaires. The prevalence of self-reported asthma was 7%. Patients were classified in 4 categories: asthma with (n = 106) or without (n = 149) cardiovascular disease and other diseases with (n = 1186) or without (n = 2260) cardiovascular disease. RESULT: Adherence to movement restrictions during the lockdown was very strong: 89% of participants reported a frequency of outings of \\"less than once per week\\" and \\"once or twice per week\\" for errands and no family-related outings during the lockdown. This proportion and frequency of outings were similar whatever the chronic disease (p = 0.122). Most patients (96%) reported a high feeling of security during the lockdown, but 95% felt anxious or depressed, with no difference by disease. As compared with patients with controlled asthma, those with uncontrolled asthma more frequently reported complaints related to deteriorated medical follow-up, waived care, anxiety or depression. CONCLUSIONS: Behaviors during the lockdown in France among the asthma population did not differ from patients with other chronic diseases in this cohort, which strengthens hypotheses for specific disease-related susceptibility to explain the low representation of asthmatics among COVID-19 cases.

Methods: The clinical data of 19 patients receiving lung transplantation operation in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from December 2016 to December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into groups according to whether ECMO support was used, and their clinical data were compared. Results: Among the 19 patients, there were 5 cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 3 cases of bronchiectasis, 4 cases of pneumoconiosis, 4 cases of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, 1 case of connective tissue disease interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, 1 case of Kartagener syndrome, and 1 case of COVID-19 with advanced pulmonary fibrosis. Among the 10 patients in the non-ECMO group, 1 died during the operation, 1 died after abandoning treatment, and 1 was discharged after abandoning treatment. There were 9 patients in the ECMO group, 2 patients received ECMO bridged treatment before surgery, and the remaining 7 patients received ECMO adjuvant treatment after anesthesia. In the ECMO group, 1 patient died, 1 patient was discharged after abandoning treatment, and the rest patients were all improved and discharged after successful weaning of ECMO. The two groups only differed in the way of preoperative respiratory support (P=0.033).

Currently, there are no FDA-licensed vaccines against arenaviruses and the only available antiviral therapy is limited to the use of ribavirin that is partially effective. Arenavirus nucleoprotein (NP) is found associated with the genomic RNA forming the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) that together with the polymerase (L) direct viral replication and transcription. Virion formation requires the recruitment of vRNPs into budding sites, a process in which the arenavirus matrix-like protein (Z) plays a major role. Therefore, proper NP-NP and NP-Z interactions are required for the generation of infectious progeny. In this work we demonstrate the role of the amino acid residue D471 in the self-association of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus nucleoprotein (LCMV-NP). Amino acid substitutions at this position abrogate NP oligomerization, affecting its ability to mediate replication and transcription of a minigenome reporter plasmid. However, its ability to interact with the Z protein, counteract the cellular interferon response and bind to dsRNA analogs was retained. Additionally, we also document the dominant negative effect of D471G mutation on viral infection, suggesting that NP self-association is an excellent target for the development of new antivirals against arenaviruses.","output":"D471G Mutation in LCMV-NP Affects its Ability to Self-associate and Results in a Dominant Negative Effect in Viral RNA Synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective.

From 12 February to 28 July 2020, medical records of 100 children diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to the hospitals of Mazandaran province were collected. Patients' age, gender, clinical symptoms, and signs, in addition to therapeutic management and outcomes, were reported. Results. 57 (57%) boys and 43 girls with the mean age of 104.63  79.14 months were evaluated. 20 patients (20%) were transferred to the PICU (pediatric intensive care unit), and 13 children experienced a severe form of the disease, pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS). The mean duration of hospitalization was 5.3  4.7 days. Fever (81%), respiratory (79%), gastrointestinal (47%), and neurologic complaints (29%) were experienced by the patients in addition to skin rash (14%).

These include mumps, Epstein-Barr, herpes virus 6, parainfluenza, influenza, adeno virus, boca virus and others. Almost all coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) infected patients carry the virus in saliva. Salivary duct epithelium were the early target cells in macaque monkeys infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-COV). Here we present 2 COVID-19 cases with the involvement of salivary glands. Salivary gland involvement has not been reported in COVID-19. METHODS: We followed the COVID 19 clinical findings in a Pennsylvania long term care facility with 190 residents. Thirty tested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive. However, 48 were presumed infected. Eighteen likely cases were not tested due to shortage of swabs. Thirty four employees also tested positive. Two out of 48 patients aged 78 and 88 developed unilateral sialadenitis during the course of the illness. Both were Hispanic females. We studied the Clinical presentations, co-morbidities, lab and imaging results and the outcome. RESULTS: Case 1: Two days after the first confirmed case, a 88 year old Hispanic female developed fever and fatigue and tested COVID-19 positive. Fever lasted 5 days. Twenty days later the patient developed a 5x3 cm tender left parotid mass and hypoxia treated with oxygen via nasal cannula.

During the pandemic, healthcare systems require accurate forecasts for key resources to guide preparation for patient surges. Forecasting the COVID-19 hospital census is among the most important planning decisions to ensure adequate staffing, number of beds, intensive care units, and vital equipment. In the literature, only a few papers have approached this problem from a multivariate time-series approach incorporating leading indicators for the hospital census. In this paper, we propose to use a leading indicator, the local COVID-19 infection incidence, together with the COVID-19 hospital census in a multivariate framework using a Vector Error Correction model (VECM) and aim to forecast the COVID-19 hospital census for the next 7 days. The model is also applied to produce scenario-based 60-day forecasts based on different trajectories of the pandemic. With several hypothesis tests and model diagnostics, we confirm that the two time-series have a cointegration relationship, which serves as an important predictor. Other diagnostics demonstrate the goodness-of-fit of the model. Using timeseries cross-validation, we can estimate the out-of-sample Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The model has a median MAPE of 5.9%, which is lower than the 6.6% median MAPE from a univariate Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model. In the application of scenario-based long-term forecasting, future census exhibits concave trajectories with peaks lagging 2-3 weeks later than the peak infection incidence. Our findings show that the local COVID-19 infection incidence can be successfully incorporated into a VECM with the COVID-19 hospital census to improve upon existing forecast models, and to deliver accurate short-term forecasts and realistic scenario-based long-term trajectories to help healthcare systems leaders in their decision making.","output":"A Multivariate Forecasting Model for the COVID-19 Hospital Census Based on Local Infection Incidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The implications of the menstrual cycle for disease susceptibility, development, and severity of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are largely unknown.

Depletion of noradrenaline and dopamine, or of acetylcholine from the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC), is as devastating as removing the cortex itself, and serotonergic influences are also critical to proper functioning of the orbital and medial PFC. Most neuromodulators have a narrow inverted U dose response, which coordinates arousal state with cognitive state, and contributes to cognitive deficits with fatigue or uncontrollable stress. Studies in monkeys have revealed the molecular signaling mechanisms that govern the generation and modulation of mental representations by the dlPFC, allowing dynamic regulation of network strength, a process that requires tight regulation to prevent toxic actions, e.g., as occurs with advanced age. Brain imaging studies in humans have observed drug and genotype influences on a range of cognitive tasks and on PFC circuit functional connectivity, e.g., showing that catecholamines stabilize representations in a baseline-dependent manner.

The aim of the current study was to explore health professionals perspectives on the factors impacting ARRT utilisation in the care of acutely unwell residential aged care facility residents. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with two Geriatricians, two ARRT Clinical Nurse Consultants, an ED-based Clinical Nurse Specialist, and an Extended Care Paramedic. Interview questions elicited views on key factors regarding care decisions and care transitions for acutely unwell residential aged care facility residents. Thematic analysis was undertaken to identify themes and sub-themes from interviews. RESULTS: Analysis of interviews identified five overarching themes affecting ARRT utilisation in the care of acutely unwell residents: (1) resident care needs; (2) family factors; (3) enabling factors; (4) barriers; and (5) adaptability and responsiveness to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Various factors impact on hospital avoidance program utilisation in the care of acutely unwell older aged care facility residents.

Yet, to date, there is no solution for reliably deploying at the point of need the gold standard diagnostic method, real time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), in a laboratory infrastructure-free manner. In this proof of principle work, we demonstrate direct performance of RT-qPCR on fresh blood using far-red fluorophores to resolve fluorogenic signal inhibition and controlled, rapid freeze/thawing to achieve viral genome extraction in a single reaction chamber assay. The resulting process is entirely free of manual or automated sample pre-processing, requires no microfluidics or magnetic/mechanical sample handling and thus utilizes low cost consumables. This enables a fast, laboratory infrastructure-free, minimal risk and simple standard operating procedure suited to frontline, field use. Developing this novel approach on recombinant bacteriophage and recombinant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; Lentivirus), we demonstrate clinical utility in symptomatic EBOV patient screening using live, infectious Filoviruses and surrogate patient samples. Moreover, we evidence assay co-linearity independent of viral particle structure that may enable viral load quantification through pre-calibration, with no loss of specificity across an 8 log-linear maximum dynamic range. The resulting quantitative rapid identification (QuRapID) molecular diagnostic platform, openly accessible for assay development, meets the requirements of resource-limited countries and provides a fast response solution for mass public health screening against emerging biosecurity threats.","output":"Field-deployable, quantitative, rapid identification of active Ebola virus infection in unprocessed blood"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We used enzyme\\\\linked immunoassay methods to measure the prevalence and the levels of antibody responses to the nucleocapsid (N) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) and four seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoV\\\\OC43, HCoV\\\\HKU1, HCoV 229E, and HCoV\\\\NL63) in a cohort of 115 convalescent plasma donors infected with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 (1C61 days after symptom onset) compared to antibody levels in 114 individuals with no evidence of a recent infection with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2.

Here, we report about fully integrated rectifiers with microtubular soft-contacts, which are based on a molecularly thin organic heterojunction and are able to convert alternating current with a frequency of up to 10 MHz. The unidirectional current behavior of our devices originates mainly from the intrinsically different surfaces of the bottom planar and top microtubular Au electrodes while the excellent high frequency response benefits from the charge accumulation in the phthalocyanine molecular heterojunction, which not only improves the charge injection but also increases the carrier density.","output":"Integrated molecular diode as 10 MHz half-wave rectifier based on an organic nanostructure heterojunction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to verify the presence of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 in the seminal sample of men during the acute phase of COVID\\\\19.

METHODS: We performed retrospective review of hospitalized cases of confirmed influenza infection from October 2010 to April 2017. Patients data were collected from three referral hospitals in different regions of the country. RESULTS: A total 2,002 laboratory confirmed influenza cases were identified. The median age was 3.3 years old (range 0.0C18.9 years) and 1,003 patients were male (54%). Influenza A was diagnosed in 1,357 cases (68%), influenza B in 624 (31%) and both influenza A and B in 21 (1%). Other combined respiratory virus infection was detected in 104 (5.2%) cases. Out of 2,002 cases, IANCs were identified in 167 cases (8.3%); influenza virus A was detected in 116 (69.4%), B in 50 (29.9%) and both A and B in one case (0.6%). Of 167 cases with IANCs, 25 patients (15%) had underlying neurologic diseases. Eleven patients (11/167, 6.5%) had combined respiratory viral infection (Rhinovirus = 5; respiratory syncytial virus = 3; coronavirus = 2; and bocavirus = 1). The most common diagnosis was a simple febrile seizure (112/167, 67.1%), followed by other seizures (26/167, 15.6%), encephalopathy/encephalitis (17/167, 10.2%), meningitis (7/167, 4.2%), meningism (4/167, 2.4%) and acute ataxia (1/167, 0.6%). In two patients with encephalitis/meningitis, one patient had influenza A and the other patient had influenza B detected by PCR in cerebrospinal fluid. Most of the patients were fully recovered (162/167, 97%) and no neurologic complication occurred in patients who had only initial manifestation of simple febrile seizure. Ten patients (10/167, 6.0%) required hospitalization in intensive care unit. Three patients (3/167, 1.8%) died of encephalopathy (n = 1) and combined encephalopathy/myocarditis (n = 2). Pre-existing neurologic disease was a risk factor of IANCs with an odds ratio of 3.94 (95% confidence interval 2.37 to 6.56, P < 0.0001).

METHODS Twelve piglets were divided into 3 groups: (1) TOF model animals (PA band plus pulmonary valvotomy, n = 4), (2) pulmonary insufficiency (PI) animals (pulmonary valvotomy, n = 4), and (3) control animals (n = 4). A nonabsorbable, coated braided polyester tape was used to perform the main pulmonary artery banding. Echocardiography was performed 4 months postoperatively. After each animal was euthanized, PA histological analysis was performed in animals with band internalization. RESULTS Significant postsurgical pulmonary regurgitation and right ventricular enlargement were present in the TOF and PI, compared with control animals, whereas no significant pulmonary stenosis was observed in TOF animals when compared with PI group. Postmortem examination of all TOF animals revealed the constricting band to be intact but partially internalized into the PA lumen, allowing blood flow around the stenosis. Histological sections of the banded PA in the area of internalization showed a significant disorganization of the medial layer, with significant scarring and fibrotic reaction surrounding the outside of the band and the presence of inflammatory cells suggesting a significant inflammatory response during band internalization. CONCLUSIONS Band internalization may occur after PA banding using a nonabsorbable, coated braided polyester tape in a chronic porcine model of repaired TOF.

Drawing upon research on the theory of resilience, this study seeks to identify the factors that influence community resilience and to analyze their causation toward helping to manage the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Seventeen factors from the five dimensions of social capital, economic capital, physical environment, demographic characteristics, and institutional factors are used to construct an index system.

METHODS Tubes with different diameters were configured in a container resembling an AVM with an artificial nidus at its center. Subsequently, the AVM models were filled with Onyx 18, Squid 18, PHIL 25% or saline and inserted into an imaging phantom (n = 10/LEA). Afterwards CT and CBCT scans were acquired. The degree of IAs was graded quantitatively (Hounsfield units in a defined region of interest) and qualitatively (feasibility of defining the nidus)-Onyx vs. Squid vs. PHIL vs. saline, respectively. RESULTS Quantitative density evaluation demonstrated more artifacts for Onyx compared to Squid and PHIL, e.g. 48.15  14.32 HU for Onyx vs. 7.56  1.34 HU for PHIL in CT (p < 0.001) and 41.88  7.22 density units (DU) for Squid vs. 35.22  5.84 DU for PHIL in CBCT (p = 0.044).

However, upon administration many nanoparticles prompt induction of host inflammatory responses due to recognition and uptake by macrophages, eliminating up to 95% of the administered dose. While significant advances in nanoparticle engineering and consequent therapeutic efficacy have been made, it is becoming clear that nanoparticle recognition by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) poses an impassable junction in the current framework of nanoparticle development. Hence, this has negative consequences on the clinical translation of nanotechnology with respect to therapeutic efficacy, systemic toxicity and economic benefit. In order to improve the translation of nanomedicines from bench-to-bedside, there is a requirement to either modify nanomedicines in terms of how they interact with intrinsic processes in the body, or modulate the body to be more accommodating for nanomedicine treatments. Here we provide an overview of the current standard for design elements of nanoparticles, as well as factors to consider when producing nanomedicines that have minimal MPS-nanoparticle interactions; we explore this landscape across the cellular to tissue and organ levels. Further, rather than designing materials to suit the body, a growing research niche involves modulating biological responses to administered nanomaterials. We here discuss how developing strategic methods of MPS 'pre-conditioning' with small molecule or biological drugs, as well as implementing strategic dosing regimens, such as 'decoy' nanoparticles, is essential to increasing nanoparticle therapeutic efficacy.

We examined the characteristics of equivalent black carbon (eBC) mass concentration and its source apportionment using a multiwavelength aethalometer over an urban site (Ahmedabad) in India during the pandemic induced lockdown period of year 2020. For the first time, we estimate the changes in BC, its contribution from fossil (eBC [Formula: see text]) and wood (eBC [Formula: see text]) fuels during lockdown (LD) and unlock (UL) periods in 2020 with respect to 2017 to 2019 (normal period). The eBC mass concentration continuously decreased throughout lockdown periods (LD1 to LD4) due to enforced and stringent restrictions which substantially reduced the anthropogenic emissions. The eBC mass concentration increased gradually during unlock phases (UL1 to UL7) due to the phase wise relaxations after lockdown. During lockdown period eBC mass concentration decreased by 35%, whereas during the unlock period eBC decreased by 30% as compared to normal period. The eBC [Formula: see text] concentrations were higher by 40% during lockdown period than normal period due to significant increase in the biomass burning emissions from the several community kitchens which were operational in the city during the lockdown period. The average contributions of eBC [Formula: see text] and eBC [Formula: see text] to total eBC mass concentrations were 70% and 30% respectively during lockdown (LD1 to LD4) period, whereas these values were 87% and 13% respectively during the normal period. The reductions in BC concentrations were commensurate with the reductions in emissions from transportation and industrial activities. The aerosol radiative forcing reduced significantly due to the reduction in anthropogenic emissions associated with COVID-19 pandemic induced lockdown leading to a cooling of the atmosphere. The findings in the present study on eBC obtained during the unprecedented COVID-19 induced lockdown can provide a comprehensive understanding of the BC sources and current emission control strategies, and thus can serve as baseline anthropogenic emissions scenario for future emission control strategies aimed to improve air quality and climate.","output":"Assessment of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic imposed lockdown and unlock effects on black carbon aerosol, its source apportionment, and aerosol radiative forcing over an urban city in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A large number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recovered patients are suffering from related symptoms.

The aim of this systematic review was to identify the role of telehealth services in preventing, diagnosing, treating, and controlling diseases during COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted through searching five databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Science Direct. Inclusion criteria included studies clearly defining any use of telehealth services in all aspects of health care during COVID-19 outbreak, published from December 31, 2019, written in English language and published in peer reviewed journals. Two reviewers independently assessed search results, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the included studies. Quality assessment was based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) checklist. Narrative synthesis was undertaken to summarize and report the findings. RESULTS: Eight studies met the inclusion out of the 142 search results. Currently, healthcare providers and patients who are self-isolating, telehealth is certainly appropriate in minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. This solution has the potential to prevent any sort of direct physical contact, provide continuous care to the community, and finally reduce morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: The use of telehealth improves the provision of health services. Therefore, telehealth should be an important tool in caring services while keeping patients and health providers safe during COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"The role of telehealth during COVID-19 outbreak: a systematic review based on current evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Sociocultural Adaptation Scale (SCAS) measures the degree of sociocultural competence in new cultural settings, and, despite its popularity, research aiming at evaluating its dimensionality is lacking and has incongruent results.

However, it did not take center stage in the field of epigenetics until 2009, when ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1) was found to oxidize 5-methylcytosine to 5-hmC, thus offering a long-awaited mechanism for active DNA demethylation. Since then, a remarkable body of research has implicated DNA hydroxymethylation in pluripotency, differentiation, neural system development, aging, and pathogenesis of numerous diseases, especially cancer. Here, we focus on DNA hydroxymethylation in smoking-associated carcinogenesis to highlight the diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic potentials of this epigenetic mark. We describe the significance of 5-hmC in DNA demethylation, the importance of substrates and cofactors in TET-mediated DNA hydroxymethylation, the regulation of TETs and related genes (isocitrate dehydrogenases, fumarate hydratase, and succinate dehydrogenase), the cell-type dependency and genomic distribution of 5-hmC, and the functional role of 5-hmC in the epigenetic regulation of transcription.

In laparoscopic hernia surgery, either fixation outside the trapezoid of disaster or no fixation is recommended to avoid postoperative pain. To avoid recurrence are transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) hernia repair, the myopectineal orifice must be covered with mesh during TAPP, but lifting or shrinking of the mesh can lead to recurrence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a novel technique for mesh fixation to prevent the mesh from lifting off. METHODS After the preperitoneal space was created during TAPP, the anatomy of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh or the femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve within the trapezoid of disaster was checked. The mesh was tacked at the trapezoid of disaster without nerve injury, and the mesh was fixed with circumferential tacking. We call this procedure secure tacking against recurrence (STAR). We treated 391 adult patients (478 hernias) with TAPP repair; novel tacking was used in some patients (STAR group, 236 hernias). The results of the STAR group were retrospectively compared with those of patients in whom we did not use this novel tacking (conventional group, 242 hernias). RESULTS There was no postoperative chronic pain in either group. There were no cases of hernia recurrence in the STAR group, but there were four cases of hernia recurrence in the conventional group (0% vs 1.7%, P = 0.047). These four recurrences consisted of indirect hernia and mesh lifting on the lateral side. CONCLUSION The STAR procedure is feasible and safety as a standard procedure for securing the mesh during TAPP.","output":"Feasibility of a novel tacking method of securing mesh in transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair: Secure tacking against recurrence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Science is increasingly intertwined with an array of pressing societal issues, from the coronavirus pandemic response, to environmental concerns, to major national security threats.

While traditional scientific training has not emphasized the skills needed to coherently translate nuanced scientific research to audiences beyond ones inner academic circle, todays scientists (and, prominently, scientists-in-training) are increasingly seeking out ways to engage with such broader audiences and apply their skills to real-world problems. Here, we offer engagement strategies for scientists across levels of scale (e.g., at the individual, lab group, department/university, and cross-institutional levels), highlighting both existing opportunities and areas where improved capacity for science engagement is warranted. We argue that efforts to enhance and harmonize engagement efforts will have multi-faceted benefits, with greater opportunities for science-society dialogues, enhanced equity and inclusivity in such dialogues, and broader professional opportunities for early career scientists.

We aimed to assess the incidence of unintentional weight loss and malnutrition in COVID-19 survivors. METHODS: In this post-hoc analysis of a prospective observational cohort study, we enrolled all adult (age 18 years) patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who had been discharged home from either a medical ward or the Emergency Department of San Raffaele University Hospital, and were re-evaluated after remission at the Outpatient COVID-19 Follow-Up Clinic of the same Institution from April 7, 2020, to May 11, 2020. Demographic, anthropometric, clinical and biochemical parameters upon admission were prospectively collected. At follow-up, anthropometrics, the mini nutritional assessment screening and a visual analogue scale for appetite were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 213 patients were included in the analysis (33% females, median age 59.0 [49.5C67.9] years, 70% overweight/obese upon initial assessment, 73% hospitalised). Sixty-one patients (29% of the total, and 31% of hospitalised patients vs. 21% of patients managed at home, p = 0.14) had lost >5% of initial body weight (median weight loss 6.5 [5.0C9.0] kg, or 8.1 [6.1C10.9]%). Patients who lost weight had greater systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein 62.9 [29.0C129.5] vs.48.7 [16.1C96.3] mg/dL; p = 0.02), impaired renal function (23.7% vs. 8.7% of patients; p = 0.003) and longer disease duration (32 [27C41] vs. 24 [21C30] days; p = 0.047) as compared with those who did not lose weight. At multivariate logistic regression analysis, only disease duration independently predicted weight loss (OR 1.05 [1.01C1.10] p = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 might negatively impact body weight and nutritional status.

The burden of gallbladder disease in Mongolia is significant. Despite the barriers to expanding laparoscopic surgery in Mongolia (lack of physical resources and adequate training opportunities, a difficult political situation, and an austere environment), the Health Sciences University of Mongolia (HSUM) began looking for ways to further the development of laparoscopy for the entire country, including the rural areas where half the population resides. METHODS Combined didactic and practical training courses lasting 2 weeks were developed collaboratively by a private nongovernmental organization and HSUM. The courses were taught at tertiary care centers in the capital city (Ulaanbaatar) and in a smaller, rural city (Erdenet), the regional northern referral center. Demographic data, preoperative diagnosis, ultrasound and operative findings, operative times, length of hospital stay, and intraoperative and postoperative complication rates were compared from 2007-2008 from hospitals in Ulaanbaatar and Erdenet. RESULTS A total of 36 surgeons participated in the training classes, and a total of 410 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed. Ultrasound was used as a diagnostic tool in all cases. There was no significant difference in intraoperative or postoperative complications between hospitals in the capital, where the procedures were performed by skilled laparoscopic surgeons, and in Erdenet, where the training courses first introduced laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Neither were there differences in complication rates between cases during the teaching and nonteaching periods.

METHOD: In silico studies, molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulations were performed to repurpose the therapeutic drugs (n = 17) which were used to treat OLP against COVID-19. In addition, the maximum binding affinities of the key protein spike glycoprotein, main-protease (M(pro)) of coronavirus, and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) in the human body were evaluated with the selected drugs. RESULTS: Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) showed the highest docking values among the drugs selected for repurposing. Among the target proteins, EGCG has shown maximum binding affinity with ACE-2 receptor. Further, according to the molecular dynamic simulation studies, EGCG has shown the least conformational fluctuations with M(pro). CONCLUSION: EGCG can be a potential inhibitor drug which can bind with ACE-2 receptor thus inhibiting the interaction of mainly M(pro) protein and spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2.

Neighborhood-level redlining and lending bias represent state-sponsored systems of segregation, potential drivers of adverse health outcomes. We sought to estimate the effect of redlining and lending bias on breast cancer (BC) mortality and explore differences by race. METHODS Using Georgia Cancer Registry data, we included 4943 non-Hispanic White (NHW) and 3580 non-Hispanic Black (NHB) women with a first primary invasive BC diagnosis in metro-Atlanta (2010-2014). Redlining and lending bias were derived for census tracts using the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act database. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations of redlining, lending bias on BC mortality and estimated race-stratified associations. RESULTS Overall, 20% of NHW and 80% of NHB women lived in redlined census tracts, and 60% of NHW and 26% of NHB women lived in census tracts with pronounced lending bias. Living in redlined census tracts was associated with a nearly 60% increase in BC mortality (HR=1.58, 95%CI=1.37-1.82) while residing in areas with substantial lending bias reduced the hazard of BC mortality (HR=0.86, 95%CI=0.75-0.99). Among NHB women living in redlined census tracts we observed a slight increase in BC mortality (HR=1.13, 95%CI=0.90-1.42); among NHW women the association was more pronounced (HR=1.39, 95%CI=1.09-1.78).

The healthcare capacity (especially the testing resources, vaccination coverage, and hospital capacity) is becoming extremely insufficient as the demand will far exceed the supply. To address this time-critical issue, we need to answer a key question: How can we effectively infer the daily transmission risks in different districts using machine learning methods and thus lay out the corresponding resource prioritization strategies, so as to alleviate the impact of the Omicron outbreaks? METHODS: We propose a computational method for future risk mapping and optimal resource allocation based on the quantitative characterization of spatiotemporal transmission patterns of the Omicron variant. We collect the publicly available data from the official website of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government and the study period in this paper is from December 27, 2021 to July 17, 2022 (including a period for future prediction). First, we construct the spatiotemporal transmission intensity matrices across different districts based on infection case records. With the constructed cross-district transmission matrices, we forecast the future risks of various locations daily by means of the Gaussian process. Finally, we develop a transmission-guided resource prioritization strategy that enables effective control of Omicron outbreaks under limited capacity. RESULTS: We conduct a comprehensive investigation of risk mapping and resource allocation in Hong Kong, China. The maps of the district-level transmission risks clearly demonstrate the irregular and spatiotemporal varying patterns of the risks, making it difficult for the public health authority to foresee the outbreaks and plan the responses accordingly. With the guidance of the inferred transmission risks, the developed prioritization strategy enables the optimal testing resource allocation for integrative case management (including case detection, quarantine, and further treatment), i.e., with the 300,000 testing capacity per day; it could reduce the infection peak by 87.1% compared with the population-based allocation strategy (case number reduces from 20,860 to 2689) and by 24.2% compared with the case-based strategy (case number reduces from 3547 to 2689), significantly alleviating the burden of the healthcare system. CONCLUSIONS: Computationally characterizing spatiotemporal transmission patterns allows for the effective risk mapping and resource prioritization; such adaptive strategies are of critical importance in achieving timely outbreak control under insufficient capacity. The proposed method can help guide public-health responses not only to the Omicron outbreaks but also to the potential future outbreaks caused by other new variants. Moreover, the investigation conducted in Hong Kong, China provides useful suggestions on how to achieve effective disease control with insufficient capacity in other highly populated countries and regions.

The concepts of structural stigma and moral distress are important and interrelated, yet rarely explored or researched in medical education. Structural stigma refers to how discrimination towards certain groups is enacted through policy and practice. Moral distress describes the tension and conflict that health workers experience when they are unable to fulfil their duties due to circumstances outside of their control. In this study, the authors explored how resident physicians perceive moral distress in relation to structural stigma. An improved understanding of such experiences may provide insights into how to prepare future physicians to improve health equity. METHODS: Utilizing constructivist grounded theory methodology, 22 participants from across Canada including 17 resident physicians from diverse specialties and 5 faculty members were recruited for semi-structured interviews from AprilCJune 2020. Data were analyzed using constant comparative analysis. RESULTS: Results describe a distinctive form of moral distress called structural distress, which centers upon the experience of powerlessness leading resident physicians to go above and beyond the call of duty, potentially worsening their psychological well-being. Faculty play a buffering role in mitigating the impact of structural distress by role modeling vulnerability and involving residents in policy decisions.

Published data demonstrate the possibility of severe kidney injury in patients suffering from COVID-19. However, these data are still controversial. METHODS: A total of 1,280 patients with a proven diagnosis of COVID-19 were included in our study. COVID-19 was confirmed in all patients using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test of a nasopharyngeal swab, and based on the typical computed tomography findings. Demographic data, underlying comorbidities, and laboratory blood tests were assessed. We assessed the incidence of AKI and its associated mortality defined by survival status at discharge. RESULTS: Proteinuria was identified with 648 patients (50.6%) with COVID-19. AKI was identified in 371 patients (29.0%). Ten of these patients (2.7%) required dialysis. The risk factors for AKI included age of > 65 years, augmentation of C-reactive protein, ferritin and an increase in values of activated partial thromboplastin time. Overall, 162 of the 1,280 hospitalized patients (12.7%) and 111 of the 371 patients (29.9%) with AKI did not survive. The hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was 3.96 (95% confidence interval, 2.83C5.54) for patients with AKI vs. no AKI. CONCLUSION: AKI was a relatively common finding among patients with COVID-19. The risk factors for AKI in COVID-19 included old age, the inflammatory response, the severity of lung involvement, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

RESULTS: The study established good knowledge, a positive attitude and high acceptability of maternal immunization among pregnant women, non-pregnant women, antenatal staff as well as church and community leaders. Men were the least positive about maternal immunization. Aside from antenatal staff, there was poor knowledge regarding the types of vaccinations administered and the health benefits of immunization across all the study groups. Reasons adduced for poor knowledge about the types of vaccinations include lack of communication on maternal immunization during antenatal sessions or clinic visits and power dynamics that tend to exist between healthcare workers and patients. CONCLUSION: Ensuring that healthcare workers provide useful information on immunization during antenatal visits as well as include men in education sessions regarding the benefit of vaccination may increase patients confidence and immunization uptake.","output":"Knowledge and attitudes towards maternal immunization: perspectives from pregnant and non-pregnant mothers, their partners, mothers, healthcare providers, community and leaders in a selected urban setting in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 outbreak was first time experienced in the Wuhan City of China at the end of December 2019.

Evaluations of the relationship between resilience and coping style among university students are important for developing effective health promotion strategies focused on resilience intervention to benefit students health and well-being. The relationship between psychological resilience and coping styles has usually been examined among adults and patients. Very few studies have investigated the relationship between resilience and coping style in university students. The present study aimed to investigate the associations between psychological resilience, students characteristics (gender, major and grade) and coping styles among undergraduate students. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among undergraduate students in Shandong Province, China. Undergraduate students were randomly selected from 6 universities in 3 cities of the province using a stratified random sampling method. The questionnaire included questions on the participants demographic information, including gender, grade and major, measures of psychological resilience and coping style. Coping style was measured by the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). The Asian Resilience Scale (ARS) was applied to evaluate undergraduates psychological resilience. Multivariable regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between resilience, students characteristics and positive coping styles. RESULTS: A sample of 1743 undergraduates was analysed. The mean psychological resilience score was 70.41. The mean score for positive coping style was 24.72. Multiple regression analysis showed that three factors of psychological resilience, mood control, self-plasticity and coping flexibility, were all significant factors for positive coping styles (regression coefficient = 0.34, 0.35, 0.14, p < 0.01 for the three factors, respectively). Medical students and females had higher scores for positive coping styles than non-medical students and males (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The research revealed that females and medical students are more likely than males and non-medical students to adopt positive coping styles. Higher psychological resilience is associated with a better positive coping style. The findings suggest that psychological education and health promotion programmes that target strengthening psychological resilience among undergraduate students may help foster positive coping styles to benefit their mental health and psychological well-being.","output":"Psychological resilience and positive coping styles among Chinese undergraduate students: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the most controversial areas in discussions of single-payer approaches for the United States, such as \\"Medicare for All,\\" concerns its implications for costs.

PRRSV infection skews macrophage polarization toward an M2 phenotype, followed by T-cells inactivation. CD163, one of the scavenger receptors of M2 macrophages, has been described as a putative receptor for PRRSV. In this study, we examined two types of PRRSV-2-derived recombinant antigens, A1 (g6Ld10T) and A2 (lipo-M5Nt), for their ability to mediate PAM polarization and T helper (Th1) response. A1 and A2 were composed of different combination of ORF5, ORF6, and ORF7 in full or partial length. To enhance the adaptive immunity, they were conjugated with T cells epitopes or lipidated elements, respectively. Our results showed that CD163(+) expression on PAMs significantly decreased after being challenged with A1 but not A2, followed by a significant increase in pro-inflammatory genes (TNF-, IL-6, and IL-12). In addition, next generation sequencing (NGS) data show an increase in T-cell receptor signaling in PAMs challenged with A1. Using a co-culture system, PAMs challenged with A1 can induce Th1 activation by boosting IFN- and IL-12 secretion and TNF- expression. In terms of innate and T-cell-mediated immunity, we conclude that A1 is regarded as a potential vaccine for immunization against PRRSV infection due to its ability to reverse the polarization status of PAMs toward pro-inflammatory phenotypes, which in turn reduces CD163 expression for viral entry and increases immunomodulation for Th1-type response.","output":"Recombinant Antigen of Type 2 Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV-2) Promotes M1 Repolarization of Porcine Alveolar Macrophages and Th1 Type Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is intense interest in antibody immunity to coronaviruses.

Proponents of commercial innovation highlight its role in late-stage clinical trials, regulatory approval, and widespread distribution. Proponents of public innovation point out the role of public institutions in forming the foundational knowledge undergirding downstream innovation. The rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation has brought with it uniquely proactive public involvement to characterize, treat, and prevent this novel health treat. How has this affected the share of research by industry and public institutions, particularly compared to the experience of previous pandemics, Ebola, H1N1 and Zika? METHODS: Using Embase, we categorized all publications for COVID-19, Ebola, H1N1 and Zika as having any author identified as affiliated with industry or not. We placed all disease areas on a common timeline of the number of days since the WHO had declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern with a six-month lookback window. We plotted the number and proportion of publications over time using a smoothing function and plotted a rolling 30-day cumulative sum to illustrate the variability in publication outputs over time. RESULTS: Industry-affiliated articles represented 2% (1,773 articles) of publications over the 14 months observed for COVID-19, 7% (278 articles) over 7.1 years observed for Ebola, 5% (350 articles) over 12.4 years observed for H1N1, and 3% (160 articles) over the 5.7 years observed for Zika. The proportion of industry-affiliated publications built steadily over the time observed, eventually plateauing around 7.5% for Ebola, 5.5% for H1H1, and 3.5% for Zika. In contrast, COVID-19s proportion oscillated from 1.4% to above 2.7% and then declined again to 1.7%. At this point in the pandemic (i.e., 14 months since the PHEIC), the proportion of industry-affiliated articles had been higher for the other three disease areas; for example, the proportion for H1N1 was twice as high. CONCLUSIONS: While the industry-affiliated contribution to the biomedical literature for COVID is extraordinary in its absolute number, its proportional share is unprecedentedly low currently. Nevertheless, the world has witnessed one of the most remarkable mobilizations of the biomedical innovation ecosystem in history.","output":"The private versus public contribution to the biomedical literature during the COVID-19, Ebola, H1N1, and Zika public health emergencies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dates of destiny are always on time ? ?

While vaccine candidates and therapeutics are currently undergoing clinical trials, there is a lack of proven effective treatments or cures for COVID-19. In this study, we have presented a synergistic computational platform, including molecular dynamics simulations and immunoinformatics techniques, to rationally design a multi-epitope vaccine candidate for COVID-19. This platform combines epitopes across Linear B Lymphocytes (LBL), Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) and Helper T Lymphocytes (HTL) derived from both mutant and wild-type spike glycoproteins from SARS-CoV-2 with diverse protein conformations. In addition, this vaccine construct also takes the considerable glycan shield of the spike glycoprotein into account, which protects it from immune response. We have identified a vaccine candidate (a 35.9 kDa protein), named COVCCF, which is composed of 5 LBL, 6 HTL, and 6 CTL epitopes from the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Using multi-dose immune simulations, COVCCF induces elevated levels of immunoglobulin activity (IgM, IgG1, IgG2), and induces strong responses from B lymphocytes, CD4 T-helper lymphocytes, and CD8 T-cytotoxic lymphocytes. COVCCF induces cytokines important to innate immunity, including IFN-, IL4, and IL10. Additionally, COVCCF has ideal pharmacokinetic properties and low immune-related toxicities.

Complying with GMO requirements is complex, varies significantly across EU Member States and is leading to delays to clinical trials with ATMPs. Such delays and varying implementation of the GMO legislation makes the EU less attractive as a region to conduct clinical trials with investigational gene therapies. This is detrimental to EU patients, since their timely access to these transformative potentially curative medicines is delayed. Despite recent initiatives coordinated by the European Commission (EC) to facilitate and reduce discrepancies across the EU regarding the application of the GMO requirements, it remains particularly difficult to conduct multicenter clinical trials with ATMPs containing or consisting of GMOs involving several EU Member States. The recent decision for the EC to temporarily derogate potential coronavirus disease 2019 treatments and vaccines from some provisions of the GMO requirements was made on the basis of a clear recognition of such complexities and resulting delays to clinical development. The Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, and the European Association for Bioindustries call upon the EC, together with national competent authorities, to exempt ATMPs containing or consisting of GMOs from the GMO legislation. Such a simplification will eliminate the delays currently reported to occur when submitting environmental risk assessments and GMO applications to the national competent authorities. An exemption from GMO requirements will make the EU a more attractive region for clinical development of gene therapies and could accelerate European patients' access to these potentially life-saving medicines. Maintaining a system for GMO assessment that is different across countries may also prevent ATMPs from realizing the full benefits of a harmonized clinical trial approval process under the Clinical Trials Regulation. The undersigned organizations to this publication urge the EC to use its right of initiative to put forward a legislative proposal to exempt ATMPs in clinical development from the EU GMO legislation, within the timeframe proposed in the 2020 EU Pharmaceutical Strategy (by 2022). Implementation of a GMO exemption scheme before the end of the transition period for the Clinical Trial Regulation (the end of 2023) is important to avoid new Clinical Trial Application submissions for ATMPs under the Clinical Trial Regulation having to conduct the whole GMO assessment process in parallel. It is considered that ATMPs pose negligible risk to the environment. Such ATMPs include the following: human somatic cells modified ex vivo; recombinant virus-based vectors, including those containing genome editing nucleic acid sequences (which may also be delivered nonvirally); and bacterial vectors. Outside of controlled storage conditions, gene therapies cannot survive for any appreciable length of time. Upon clinical administration, any recombinant gene therapy viral vector particles that do not enter host cells are diluted within the body and if excreted are in such low multiplicity to no longer be viable or considered infectious to persons, animals, or living organisms within the environment. Any nucleic acids released into the environment are rapidly degraded.","output":"Call for More Effective Regulation of Clinical Trials with Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products Consisting of or Containing Genetically Modified Organisms in the European Union"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the normal methods of communication used by physicians and patients, as well as the standard protocols and procedures by which medical clinics operate Pandemic related stresses may have also influenced patients fertility goals and/or their ovarian response We questioned whether these changes resulted in any unanticipated effects in the treatments and outcomes of ART patients Design: Retrospective cohort Materials and Methods: Patients who underwent GnRH-antagonist IVF cycles from January 2020 through June 2020 at NYU Fertility Center, a period in New York City over which the COVID-19 pandemic escalated and life in the city drastically changed as a result of new social distancing measures, were separated by month of treatment and compared with patients from the corresponding month in the prior year (January 2019 through June 2019) Patient age, AMH, days gonadotropin, #oocytes retrieved, #oocytes matured, #fertilized, #blastocysts, and #euploid embryos were compared using Students T-test Results: 1881 patients were compared over the parallel six-month periods Clinic visits were markedly decreased over the months of March and April of 2020, when the pandemic was at its peak in NYC and treatments were suspended as per the ASRM pandemic guidelines There were no differences in age, AMH, #oocytes retrieved, #mature oocytes, or #fertilized between the two years In April of 2020 there were significantly more blastocysts per patient, as compared to April of 2019, however, in May and June of 2020 there were significantly fewer euploid embryos per patient, as compared to May and June of 2019 (see table) [Formula presented] Conclusions: In the months following the end of the COVID-19 treatment suspension, there were no apparent differences in patient characteristics or the quantitative responses to stimulation However, there was a significant qualitative difference as expressed in the number of euploid embryos It remains unclear if or how the pandemic is related to this difference","output":"Covid-19 and Art Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Men who have sex with men (MSM) in China experience elevated risks of mental health issues in comparison to the general population in China, which contribute to vulnerability to HIV/STI risks and can comprise the effectiveness of HIV prevention efforts. A conceptual framework for understanding this mental health disparity is minority stress theory, which posits that experiences of external prejudice events (i.e., distal stressors) and internal stress processes such as internalized homophobia and concealment (i.e., proximal stressors) contribute to sexual minorities elevated risk of psychological distress. To deepen the understanding of mental health among Chinese MSM and explore the potential utility of minority stress theory in this population, this paper synthesizes research evidence regarding prevalent mental health issues as well as how minority stress may be linked to psychological health in Chinese MSM. RECENT FINDINGS: Results indicate that Chinese MSM experience a high prevalence of several mental health issues including depression, anxiety, suicidal behaviors, and alcohol dependence. SUMMARY: This review further reveals minority stress to be an important determinant of psychological distress among Chinese MSM, though evidence is mixed regarding the relationship between proximal minority stress and psychological health. Nonetheless, there is a lack of mental health services and interventions focusing on MSM in China. Culturally relevant, competent, and LGBT-affirmative mental health interventions are needed for Chinese MSM.

However, in addition to radiological images, a definitive diagnosis also requires access to extensive information regarding patient history, including characteristics of comorbidities, and clinical and serological findings. Consequently, the differential diagnosis of COVID-19 and CTD-ILD can yield accurate treatment regimens that differ greatly between the 2 diseases, and also prevent the spread of the outbreak with COVID-19 patients treated under isolation.","output":"Management of Patients with Connective Tissue Disease-associated Interstitial Lung Diseases During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Applying assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) to the conservation of endangered species may be the only way to save them from extinction. However, ART application can raise relevant ethical issues and could benefit from a comprehensive ethical assessment. Unfortunately, there is a lack of attention to the topic in the scientific literature and, to our knowledge, there is no tool for the ethical assessment of ARTs in the context of conservation that has been described. In the present paper, we show the effects of applying a dedicated ethical self-assessment tool, the Ethical Assessment Tool (ETHAS), to ovum pick-up and in vitro fertilization procedures performed within the BioRescue project. The BioRescue project is an international enterprise using ARTs to save the northern white rhinoceros from extinction. The situation of the northern white rhinoceros is particularly critical as there are only two individuals of this subspecies still alive and they are both infertile females. The application of the ETHAS to the procedures contributed to the overall acceptability of the project and improved communication among the projects partners. In turn, the tool itself was also refined through an iterative consultation process between experts (both ethicists and scientists) and stakeholders. ABSTRACT: Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) can make a difference in biodiversity conservation. Their application, however, can create risks and raise ethical issues that need addressing. Unfortunately, there is a lack of attention to the topic in the scientific literature and, to our knowledge, there is no tool for the ethical assessment of ARTs in the context of conservation that has been described. This paper reports the first applications of the Ethical Assessment Tool (ETHAS) to trans-rectal ovum pick-up (OPU) and in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures used in a northern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum cottoni) conservation project. The ETHAS consists of two checklists, the Ethical Evaluation Sheet and the Ethical Risk Assessment, and is specifically customized for each ART procedure. It provides an integrated, multilevel and standardized self-assessment of the procedure under scrutiny, generating an ethical acceptability ranking (totally, partially, not acceptable) and a risk rank (low, medium, high), and, hence, allows for implementing measures to address or manage issues beforehand. The application of the ETHAS to the procedures performed on the northern white rhinoceros was effective in ensuring a high standard of procedures, contributing to the acceptability and improved communication among the projects partners. In turn, the tool itself was also refined through an iterative consultation process between experts and stakeholders.","output":"An Ethical Assessment Tool (ETHAS) to Evaluate the Application of Assisted Reproductive Technologies in Mammals Conservation: The Case of the Northern White Rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum cottoni)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic has forced major changes on healthcare systems Maintaining regular patients' surveillance became a major challenge Telemedicine has been promoted as an economic and effective way for long distance patient care Our aim was to study patients' acceptance and perspectives on telemedicine Methods: Patients scheduled for clinic appointments were offered telemedicine Those who agreed were asked to fill in a questionnaire assessing their satisfaction with the medical consultation Patients' demographic characteristics and answers were collected and reviewed Results: Out of 358 patients approached 71 agreed to use telemedicine Of them, 59 completed the questionnaire and were included in the study All patients' basic demographic data were collected Patients' included in the study mean age was: 43  16 3 years, 35 (59 3%) women Patients who chose not to use telemedicine were significantly older, mean age: 61  15 2 years (p = 0 036), 134 (46 7%) women Most patients included (38;64 4%) had inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) Most patients who chose not to use telemedicine were non-IBD patients (206, 72%) Fifty-one patients (86 4%) assessed their experience as 'good' or 'excellent' Satisfied patients had significantly less time under medical follow-up (3 7 versus 6 1 years, p = 0 028) and tended to be younger (p = non-significant) Women were statistically significantly more satisfied than men (33 versus 18, p = 0 05) Advantages reported were 'time saving' (31 3%), accessibility (26 1%), availability (25%) The main disadvantage was absence of physical examination (70%) Conclusions: Telemedicine gained a high satisfaction rate among patients under regular medical surveillance Most patients stated this that method is convenient, time saving and increases their compliance Patients who agreed to telecare were younger, and tended to be of female gender and experiencing IBD Further studies are needed to characterize specific barriers to telecare usage [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology is the property of Sage Publications Inc and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Telemedicine in clinical gastroenterology practice: what do patients prefer?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A comparison of 17 infectious bronchitis virus strains, using the same test procedure and assay system, demonstrated that stability at an acid pH is a variable characteristic of the avian coronaviruses.","output":"pH stability studies with avian infectious bronchitis virus (coronavirus) strains."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replicates its DNA genome through reverse transcription of a viral RNA pregenome. We report herein that the interferon (IFN) stimulated exoribonuclease gene of 20 KD (ISG20) inhibits HBV replication through degradation of HBV RNA. ISG20 expression was observed at basal level and was highly upregulated upon IFN treatment in hepatocytes, and knock down of ISG20 resulted in elevation of HBV replication and attenuation of IFN-mediated antiviral effect. The sequence element conferring the susceptibility of HBV RNA to ISG20-mediated RNA degradation was mapped at the HBV RNA terminal redundant region containing epsilon () stem-loop. Furthermore, ISG20-induced HBV RNA degradation relies on its ribonuclease activity, as the enzymatic inactive form ISG20(D94G) was unable to promote HBV RNA decay. Interestingly, ISG20(D94G) retained antiviral activity against HBV DNA replication by preventing pgRNA encapsidation, resulting from a consequence of ISG20- interaction. This interaction was further characterized by in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and ISG20 was able to bind HBV  directly in absence of any other cellular proteins, indicating a direct  RNA binding capability of ISG20; however, cofactor(s) may be required for ISG20 to efficiently degrade . In addition, the lower stem portion of  is the major ISG20 binding site, and the removal of 4 base pairs from the bottom portion of  abrogated the sensitivity of HBV RNA to ISG20, suggesting that the specificity of ISG20- interaction relies on both RNA structure and sequence.

The purpose was to explore how well this ideal vaccine could protect a population against common conditions (such as vaccine hesitancy) that might impair vaccine effectiveness. Simulations were done with an SEIRS spreadsheet model that ran two parallel subpopulations: one that accepted vaccination, and another that refused it. The two subpopulations could transmit infections to one another. Success was judged by the rate of new cases in the period from 1-5 years after the introduction of the vaccine. Under good conditions, including a small subpopulation that refused vaccination, rapid distribution of the vaccine, duration of vaccinal immunity longer than 12 months, good retention of interest in getting vaccinated after the first year, strict maintenance of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as masking, and new variants with R0s less than 4.0, the vaccine was able to end the epidemic. With violation of these conditions, the post-vaccine era futures ranged from endemic COVID at a low or medium level to rates of COVID cases worse than anything seen in the US up to late 2021. The most important conditions for keeping case rates low were a fast speed of vaccine distribution, a low percentage of the population that refuses vaccination, a long duration of vaccinal immunity, and continuing maintenance of NPIs after vaccination began. On the other hand, a short duration of vaccinal immunity, abandonment of NPIs, and new variants with a high R0 were powerful barriers to disease control. New variants with high R0s were particularly damaging, producing high case rates except when vaccination speed was unrealistically rapid. A recurring finding was that most disease afflicting the vaccinated population in these simulations originated in the unvaccinated population, and cutting off interaction with the unvaccinated population caused a sharp drop in the case rate of the vaccinated population. In conclusion, multiple common conditions can compromise the effectiveness of even an ideal vaccine.","output":"The Failures of an Ideal COVID-19 Vaccine: A Simulation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Free Open Access Medical Education (FOAMed) is a worldwide social media movement designed to accelerate and democratise the sharing of medical knowledge. This study sought to investigate the content shared through FOAMed during the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Tweets containing the #FOAMed hashtag posted during a 24-hour period in April 2020 were studied. Included tweets were analysed using the Wiig knowledge management cycle framework (building knowledge, holding knowledge, pooling knowledge and using knowledge). RESULTS: 1379 tweets contained the #FOAMed hashtag, of which 265 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Included tweets were posted from 208 distinct users, originated from each world continent and were in five different languages. Three overarching themes were identified: (1) signposting and appraising evidence and guidelines; (2) sharing specialist and technical advice; and (3) personal and social engagement. Among 12 subthemes within these groupings, 11 aligned to one of the four dimensions of the Wiig knowledge management cycle framework, and the other focused on building and managing social networks.

Adopting new technologies such as remote electronic consent (e-Consent) can help overcome them. However, guidelines for e-Consent implementation in ongoing clinical trials are currently lacking. The NeuroSAFE PROOF trial is a randomized clinical trial evaluating the role of frozen section analysis during RARP for prostate cancer. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, recruitment was halted, and a remote e-Consent solution was designed. The aim of this paper is to describe the process of implementation, impact on recruitment rate, and patients experience using e-Consent. METHODS: A substantial amendment of the protocol granted the creation of a remote e-Consent framework based on the REDCap environment, following the structure and content of the already approved paper consent form. Although e-Consent obviated the need for in-person meeting, there was nonetheless counselling sessions performed interactively online. This new pathway offered continuous support to patients through remote consultations. The whole process was judged to be compliant with regulatory requirements before implementation. RESULTS: Before the first recruitment suspension, NeuroSAFE PROOF was recruiting an average of 9 patients per month. After e-Consent implementation, 63 new patients (4/month) have been enrolled despite a second lockdown, none of whom would have been recruited using the old methods given restrictions on face-to-face consultations. Patients have given positive feedback on the use of the platform. Limited troubleshooting has been required after implementation. CONCLUSION: Remote e-Consent-based recruitment was critical for the continuation of the NeuroSAFE PROOF trial during the COVID-19 pandemic. The described pathway complies with ethical and regulatory guidelines for informed consent, while minimizing face-to-face interactions that increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

English language randomized controlled trials reporting the effect of pre, pro or synbiotics on the feeding tolerance of enterally fed critically ill adult patients were included. RESULTS: Overall, 15 papers were selected for review. Among six studies reporting the energy intake, only two studies showed significantly higher energy intake in the prebiotic-receiving groups.

Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms related to AT(1)R-Abs binding and associated signaling cascade (dys-)regulation remains fragmentary. The goal of this study was, therefore, to investigate details of the effects of AT(1)R-Abs on G-protein signaling and subsequent cell proliferation, as well as the putative contribution of the three extracellular receptor loops (ELs) to Abs-AT(1)R signaling. AT(1)R-Abs induced nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) signaling, which reflects G(q/11) and G(i) activation. The impact on cell proliferation was tested in different cell systems, as well as activation-triggered receptor internalization. Blockwise alanine substitutions were designed to potentially investigate the role of ELs in AT(1)R-Abs-mediated effects. First, we demonstrate that Ang II-mediated internalization of AT(1)R is impeded by binding of AT(1)R-Abs. Secondly, exclusive AT(1)R-Abs-induced G(q/11) activation is most significant for NFAT stimulation and mediates cell proliferation. Interestingly, our studies also reveal that ligand-independent, baseline AT(1)R activation of G(i) signaling has, in turn, a negative effect on cell proliferation. Indeed, inhibition of G(i) basal activity potentiates proliferation triggered by AT(1)R-Abs. Finally, although AT(1)R containing EL1 and EL3 blockwise alanine mutations were not expressed on the human embryonic kidney293T (HEK293T) cell surface, we at least confirmed that parts of EL2 are involved in interactions between AT(1)R and Abs.

Infectious diseases caused by contagious respiratory pathogens also pose a great risk to hospitals as has been seen in the current epidemic by a novel coronavirus infection. Such risk occurs in high density patient settings with few or no partitions, since the pathogens are transmitted by aerosols discharged from the patients. Possible interventions against the transmission are needed. Methods We developed a compact, lightweight, and portable hood designed to cover just the top half of a patient sitting or lying in bed, to limit the dissemination of infectious aerosols, constructed out of lightweight pipes, transparent plastic curtains, and a fan-filter-unit (FFU). The containment efficacy of the product was tested using an aerosolized cultured influenza virus tracer and an optimal airflow rate was determined according to the test results. It was tested for use in hospital wards during the 2016-2018 influenza seasons. Results The hood, named as Barrihood?, had dimensions height 172 cm, width 97 cm, length 38 cm, weighed 26 kg, and easily strolled and unfolded from its stored to its fully operational state of length 125 cm within a few minutes by a single operator. Optimal operational airflow-rate of the FFU was 420 L/min for containment of the aerosol particles. Eighty-one uninfected patients remained for 176 cumulative person-days within 1-4 m of influenza-infected patients isolated within the hood, without acquiring influenza infection. Conclusions With the use of the hood, secondary influenza infection cases significantly decreased, compared to previous influenza seasons.

A motif analysis of kinase substrates suggested that MAPK, CK, and CAMK were most likely involved in the adaption processes. Moreover, 16 and 14 aging-regulated proteins were found to undergo phosphorylation modifications under the mild stresses of 15 C and 25 C, respectively, indicating that these proteins might be important for maintaining long-term health. Further lifespan experiments confirmed that the candidate phosphoproteins, e.g., EGL-27 and XNP-1 modulated longevity at 15 C, 20 C, and 25 C, and they showed increased tolerance to thermal and oxidative stresses. In conclusion, our findings offered data that supports understanding of the phosphorylation mechanisms involved in mild early-life stresses in C. elegans.

Challenges exist in patients accessing facial neuromuscular retraining (NMR), a therapy used to strengthen muscle and improve nerve function. Access to therapy could potentially be improved through the use of digital technology. However, there is limited research available on patients' and clinicians' views about the potential benefits of such telerehabilitation based on their lived experiences of treatment pathways. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to gather information about facial palsy treatment pathways in the United Kingdom, barriers to accessing NMR, factors influencing patient adherence, measures used to monitor recovery, and the potential value of emerging wearable digital technology. METHODS: Separate surveys of patients with facial palsy and facial therapy specialists were conducted. Questionnaires explored treatment pathways and views on telerehabilitation, were co-designed with users, and followed a similar format to enable cross-referencing of responses. A follow-up survey of national specialists investigated methods used to monitor recovery in greater detail. Analysis of quantitative data was conducted allowing for data distribution. Open-text responses were analyzed using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 216 patients with facial palsy and 25 specialist therapists completed the national surveys. Significant variations were observed in individual treatment pathways. Patients reported an average of 3.27 (SD 1.60) different treatments provided by various specialists, but multidisciplinary team reviews were rare. For patients diagnosed most recently, there was evidence of more rapid initial prescribing of corticosteroids (prednisolone) and earlier referral for NMR therapy. Barriers to NMR referral included difficulties accessing funding, shortage of specialist therapists, and limited awareness of NMR among general practitioners. Patients traveled long distances to reach an NMR specialist center; 9% (8/93) of adults reported traveling &#8805;115 miles. The thematic content analysis demonstrates positive attitudes to the introduction of digital technology, with similar incentives and barriers identified by both patients and clinicians. The follow-up survey of 28 specialists uncovered variations in the measures currently used to monitor recovery and no agreed definitions of a clinically significant change for any of these. The main barriers to NMR adherence identified by patients and therapists could all be addressed by using suitable real-time digital technology. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings provide valuable information on facial palsy treatment pathways and views on the future introduction of digital technology. Possible ways in which emerging sensor-based digital technology can improve rehabilitation and provide more rigorous evidence on effectiveness are described. It is suggested that one legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic will be lower organizational barriers to this introduction of digital technology to assist NMR delivery, especially if cost-effectiveness can be demonstrated.","output":"Raising the Digital Profile of Facial Palsy: National Surveys of Patients' and Clinicians' Experiences of Changing UK Treatment Pathways and Views on the Future Role of Digital Technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the accessibility of psychotherapy for particularly vulnerable patients during the period of confinement in the French-speaking part of Switzerland We had to adapt our usual therapeutic programs We illustrate this approach in an outpatient program of dialectical behavioral therapy for patients with borderline personality disorder Each week the individual therapies took place by videoconference or phone The skills training group was held individually by videoconference or phone and was supported by an online skills training program Patients filled out their diary cards online Intersession contact with the therapist remained available as usual and we could organize team consultation The aim of this study is to describe how a sample of our patients experienced the period of confinement Method: We compared the experiences of seven patients suffering from borderline personality disorder during two periods: eight weeks prior to confinement, and during the eight weeks of confinement We analyzed their daily diary cards (n = 426) and their weekly frequency of problem behaviors (n = 69) We performed multilevel analyses to take into account the hierarchical structure of the data and the autocorrelation of observations Results: The seven patients were predominantly female (85 7 %) and had an average age of 35 1 (11 5) years Measurements prior to the start of the pandemic indicated on average severe depression (Beck Depression Inventory, m = 30 9 (10 0)) and marked hopelessness (Beck Hopelessness Scale, m = 15 0 (5 0)) Analysis of the daily diary cards indicated that the confinement period significantly predicted a decrease in feelings of shame or guilt, fear and tension At the same time, however, there was an increase in distress Weekly monitoring of problem behaviors showed a decrease in binge-eating behaviors and a trend towards a decrease in alcohol consumption during confinement Conclusions: Despite the small number of patients included, two types of repeated measurements indicated convergent results, with some improvements during confinement: a decrease of the feelings of fear, shame or guilt, and tension, and a decrease of the frequency of binge-eating behaviors The decreased pace of daily social and professional life may explain these improvements The diminution of the above-mentioned feelings as triggers for addictive and compulsive behaviors may also account for the improvements regarding binge-eating However, they also experienced an increased distress that may reflect the loneliness experienced during this period The pre-pandemic development of computerized tools that were already familiar to patients greatly facilitated the necessary adaptations to maintain an intensive therapeutic setting during the confinement This may partly explain why these patients were able to adjust the challenges of this period Publisher: Abstract available from the publisher fre","output":"[Adaptations of an outpatient Dialectical Behavioral Therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic and consequences of the confinement on patients with borderline personality disorder]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction et but de ltude Aprs ltat de crise sanitaire dclare en France en mars 2020 dans le contexte de lpidmie de coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), le service de radiothrapie du centre Eugne-Marquis a repens et modifi son organisation.

The objective of this study is to describe the relationship between the new type of coronavirus infection and delirium. Systematic research (Cochrane Library and PubMed) was carried out (only upper time limit: April 2020). Publications found through this indexed search were reviewed and manually screened to identify relevant studies. Search terms used included \\"COVID-19, Delirium, Dementia, Intensive Care Unit\\". We manually added articles identified through other sources (i.e., key journals). Older people are at the greatest risk from COVID-19. If infected, they may present delirium. Moreover, it is not exclusive to older people. Delirium is not inevitable; rather, it is preventable. Delirium prevention programs are even more crucial in the era of COVID-19 and cannot be allowed to wither despite the challenges of integrating delirium prevention with COVID-19 care. An acute change in condition, behaviour, or mental status should prompt a delirium screen. As regards the treatment, it is advisable to use non-pharmacological interventions first where possible.

But, the techniques and algorithms are cumbersome and time-consuming. So, aiming at the problems of low efficiency, long running time, missing image detail information, and poor image fusion, the image fusion algorithm at pixel level based on edge detection is proposed. The improved ROEWA (Ratio of Exponentially Weighted Averages) operator is used to detect the edge of the image. The variable precision fitting algorithm and edge curvature change are used to extract the feature line of the image edge and edge angle point of the feature to improve the stability of image fusion. According to the information and characteristics of the high-frequency region and low-frequency region, different image fusion rules are set. To cope with the high-frequency area, the local energy weighted fusion approach based on edge information is utilized. The low-frequency region is processed by merging the region energy with the weighting factor, and the fusion results of the high findings demonstrate that the image fusion technique presented in this work increases the resolution by 1.23 and 1.01, respectively, when compared to the two standard approaches. When compared to the two standard approaches, the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the lack of image information. The sharpness and information entropy of the fused image are higher than the experimental comparison method, and the running time is shorter and has better robustness.","output":"Image Fusion Algorithm at Pixel Level Based on Edge Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A case-control study was conducted to examine the relationship between severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the time-dependent precautionary behaviors taken during an outbreak of SARS in Hanoi French Hospital (HFH), Vietnam.

But while religious challenges to COVID-19 lockdown orders have thrown free exercise partisanship into sharp relief, the trend of increased partisanship in free exercise jurisprudence actually pre-dates the onset of the pandemic.This Article makes several contributions. One is empirical: it offers an original dataset that tracks every free exercise case from the last five years (picking up where previous surveys of free exercise cases left off). One is historical: it tells the story of how free exercise became politically controversial. Another is doctrinal: it reveals the deep ambiguity at the heart of free exercise doctrine, which this Article argues has enabled the rise in free exercise partisanship.

The current report aims to present a rare case of false-positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in a COVID-19 patient. CASE REPORT: A 32-year-old female complaining from thyroid problems referred for thyroid operation. She had mild symptoms of COVID-19. Her preoperative laboratory findings were normal, except for HIV screening test which was repetitively positive. RNA PCR was performed to confirm the diagnosis of HIV, it revealed a negative result. The patient underwent thyroidectomy as planned and was given the required supportive treatment to recover from COVID-19. Two-month follow up revealed that she was negative for COVID-19 on PCR testing, and HIV immunoassay test was no longer positive. DISCUSSION: Due to structural similarities between the spike protein chains of SARS-CoV-2 and some other viruses such as dengue, Zika, and other closely related coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), the protein can potentially interfere with the immunoassay tests. Although HIV immunoassay tests have high sensitivity and specificity, false-positive results have been reported, such as in the case of Epstein Barr virus, Influenza vaccination, and the Australian COVID-19 vaccination. CONCLUSION: Similarity between HIV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins can lead to antibody cross-reactivities, yielding false-positive results on immunoassay screening tests.","output":"False-positive HIV in a patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection; a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When we forget that prevention is better than cure, primary care becomes an easy scapegoat, even though the pandemic has reinforced its importance in improving baseline population health, reducing health inequalities, delivering a vaccination strategy, and keeping people out of hospital BMJ 2021;373: n1240 10 1136/bmj n1240 33985994 7 Lopez Bernal J Andrews N Gower C Effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines on covid-19 related symptoms, hospital admissions, and mortality in older adults in England: test negative case-control study Public health impact of delaying second dose of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 covid-19 vaccine: simulation agent based modeling study","output":"Covid-19: Why prioritising prevention matters in a pandemic of cures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We aim to systematically review the clinical characteristics of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19).

Natural and artificial melanin-based nanoparticles (MNP), including polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA NP), excel for their extraordinary combination of additional optical, electronic, chemical, photophysical, and photochemical properties. Thanks to these features, melanin plays an important multifunctional role in the design of new platforms for nanomedicine where this material works not only as a mechanical support or scaffold, but as an active component for imaging, even multimodal, and simple or synergistic therapy. The number of examples of bio-applications of MNP increased dramatically in the last decade. Here, we review the most recent ones, focusing on the multiplicity of functions that melanin performs in theranostics platforms with increasing complexity. For the sake of clarity, we start analyzing briefly the main properties of melanin and its derivative as well as main natural sources and synthetic methods, moving to imaging application from mono-modal (fluorescence, photoacoustic, and magnetic resonance) to multi-modal, and then to mono-therapy (drug delivery, anti-oxidant, photothermal, and photodynamic), and finally to theranostics and synergistic therapies, including gene- and immuno- in combination to photothermal and photodynamic. Nanomedicine aims not only at the treatment of diseases, but also to their prevention, and melanin in nature performs a protective action, in the form of nanopigment, against UV-Vis radiations and oxidants. With these functions being at the border between nanomedicine and cosmetics nanotechnology, recently examples of applications of artificial MNP in cosmetics are increasing, paving the road to the birth of the new science of nanocosmetics.

RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) are key sensors of viral RNA species in the host cell cytoplasm. Activation of RLRs in response to viral RNA triggers an antiviral defense program through the production of hundreds of antiviral effector proteins including cytokines, chemokines, and host restriction factors that directly interfere with distinct steps in the virus life cycle. To avoid premature or abnormal antiviral and proinflammatory responses, which could have harmful consequences for the host, the signaling activities of RLRs and their common adaptor molecule, MAVS, are delicately controlled by cell-intrinsic regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, viruses have evolved multiple strategies to modulate RLR-MAVS signal transduction to escape from immune surveillance. Here, we summarize recent progress in our understanding of the regulation of RLR signaling through host factors and viral antagonistic proteins.","output":"Regulation of RIG-I-like receptor signaling by host and viral proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: This study aims to answer the following questions in patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA) who underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA): are patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) affected by the location of the maximum severity of pain?; are PROMs affected by the presence of non-groin pain?; are PROMs affected by the severity of pain?; and are PROMs affected by the number of pain locations? METHODS: We reviewed 336 hips (305 patients) treated with THA for hip OA from December 2016 to November 2019 using pain location/severity questionnaires, modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), Hip Outcome Score (HOS), international Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-12) score, and radiological analysis. Descriptive statistics, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and Spearman partial correlation coefficients were used. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in iHOT-12 scores between groups experiencing the most severe pain in the groin and the trochanter (p = 0.039). Additionally, more favourable mHHS scores were related to the presence of preoperative pain in trochanter (p = 0.049), lower back (p = 0.056), lateral thigh (p = 0.034), and posterior thigh (p = 0.005). Finally, the maximum severity of preoperative pain and number of pain locations had no significant relationship with PROMs (maximum severity: HHS: p = 0.928, HOS: p = 0.163, iHOT-12 p = 0.233; number of pain locations: HHS: p = 0.211; HOS: p = 0.801; iHOT-12: p = 0.112). CONCLUSION: Although there was a significant difference in iHOT-12 scores between patients with the most severe pain in the groin or trochanter, and the presence of pain in the trochanter, lower back, lateral thigh, or posterior thigh was related to higher mHHS scores, the majority of preoperative pain characteristics did not have a significant impact on outcomes. Therefore, a broad array of patients with hip OA might expect similar, favourable outcomes from THA notwithstanding preoperative pain characteristics.

RECENT FINDINGS: Corticosteroids have been prescribed with the objective to attenuate the marked and persistent activation of the immune system. However, some causes of community-acquired pneumonia, namely viral, are associated with unexpected low levels of cytokines and depressed cellular immunity. As a result, several recent randomized controlled trials and large prospective observational studies repeatedly showed that corticosteroids had no impact on survival, and in some types of pneumonia like influenza, its use was associated with potential harmful effects like invasive aspergillosis. Apart from this, adverse effects, namely hyperglycemia, superinfections and increased length-of-stay, were frequent findings in the corticosteroid-treated patients. SUMMARY: According to the current evidence, corticosteroids are recommended in Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-infected patients and recommendations are against its use in influenza. In all other forms of severe community-acquired pneumonia, with the exclusion of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, the strength of the evidence does not support the safe and widespread use of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy. Further studies are needed to identify subgroups of severe community-acquired pneumonia that can benefit or not from corticosteroids.","output":"When should we use corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Experts have prioritized research on women veterans' mental health and the delivery of gender-sensitive care.

We aim to report the distribution of cases, prevalence, and clinical, radiological, and laboratory signs and outcomes of COVID-19 in paediatric patients. Moreover, we intend to evaluate neonatal clinical outcomes. Hence, our age range of interest is 0 to 19 years. METHODS A systematic literature review was conducted using the Medline database to identify papers published between 1 December 2019 and 9 April 2020 on COVID-19. RESULTS The search identified 27 relevant scientific papers and letters. The review showed that the prevalence of COVID-19 in the paediatric population accounts for a small percentage of patients, whose clinical signs and symptoms are often milder than those of adults. Despite better prognosis and low mortality in children, the disease can progress to severe pneumonia in some cases, especially in the presence of co-morbidities. Children are likely to become a hidden source of infection because of their atypical presentation, and they may play a role in community transmission, leading to unfavourable outcomes. There is little evidence about intrauterine vertical transmission. As no vaccine or specific antiviral is currently available, management plans include supportive treatment. CONCLUSION As compared with that in adults, the presentation of COVID-19 in children is mild and has a better prognosis. Sufficient evidence regarding the probability of intrauterine vertical transmission could not be found, and further studies need to be conducted to establish this relationship.","output":"Clinical manifestations and outcomes of COVID-19 in the paediatric population: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a host-adapted human pathogen that causes sexually transmitted gonorrhea and remains to be a serious global public health challenge, especially in low- and middle-income regions.

In the current study, we firstly report a novel approach, loop-mediated isothermal amplification linked with a polymer nanoparticleCbased biosensor (LAMP-PNB), that was used for identifying N. gonorrhoeae in clinical samples. The results showed that the LAMP primers based on the orf1 gene were valid for development of the N. gonorrhoeae-LAMP-PNB assay. The detection system with optimal conditions could be performed at a fixed temperature of 64C for 40 min. The whole process, including genomic DNA preparation (approximately 10 min), LAMP reaction (40 min), and PNB reporting (approximately 2 min), could be accomplished within 60 min. The limit of detection (LoD) of the N. gonorrhoeae-LAMP-PNB assay was 50 copies per test. The specificity of the current assay was 100%, and no cross-reactions to nonCN. gonorrhoeae isolates were observed. These results confirmed that the N. gonorrhoeae-LAMP-PNB technique is a reliable, specific, sensitive, rapid, low-cost, and easy-to-use method for detecting gonococci isolates.

The reshaping of service delivery continues to impact patient management and the experience of the radiography workforce should be evaluated to determine how effective service delivery can be maintained in the ongoing and post-pandemic world. Methods A mixed methods approach was adopted. Questionnaires, designed using Qualtrics (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) online survey software, were used to survey radiographers throughout Northern Ireland (NI). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with radiography service managers in the NHS and private sector in NI. All interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed and coded independently by 2 researchers. Results A total of 106 Radiographers completed the online survey i.e. 82 Diagnostic and 24 Therapeutic. Variations were reported regarding staff concern for contracting COVID-19 and passing it on. Clinical workload was reported to fluctuate during the early period of the pandemic, however, both diagnostic and therapeutic radiographers reported workloads which were higher than normal at the time of the data collection. Nine service managers participated in the interviews plus two band 8 superintendent radiographers. Staff faced many challenges whilst delivering services due to COVID-19. The two most frequently cited challenges included issues related to (i) Implementation of PPE and (ii) Changes to work practices. Conclusion A pre-prepared pandemic plan should be established and stress tested for the future.

This study investigated persistence of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine effectiveness against infection and disease in Qatar, where the Beta and Delta variants have dominated incidence and PCR testing is done at a mass scale. METHODS: A matched test-negative, case-control study design was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection and against any severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 disease, between January 1, 2021 to August 15, 2021. RESULTS: Estimated BNT162b2 effectiveness against any infection, asymptomatic or symptomatic, was negligible for the first two weeks after the first dose, increased to 36.5% (95% CI: 33.1-39.8) in the third week after the first dose, and reached its peak at 72.1% (95% CI: 70.9-73.2) in the first five weeks after the second dose. Effectiveness declined gradually thereafter, with the decline accelerating []15 weeks after the second dose, reaching diminished levels of protection by the 20th week. Effectiveness against symptomatic infection was higher than against asymptomatic infection, but still waned in the same fashion.

The quality assessment tool QUADAS-2 was used to stratify studies according to their risk of bias, and exclusion criteria included not providing the information deemed relevant for such a stratification, such as not indicating if the patients were symptomatic or asymptomatic, or identifying the source of the specimen for the reference standard, RT-PCR (eg, nasal, oropharyngeal, etc). Sensitivity values were then extracted, and random effects meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 641 search results, 37 studies (n = 9610 patients) were included in the analysis. The mean sensitivity of RT-PCR for COVID-19 reported by the biased studies was 70% (n = 5409/7 studies; 95% confidence interval [CI], 43-97; I = 99.1%), compared with 78% by unbiased studies (n = 534/4 studies; 95% CI, 69-87, I = 89.9%).

Here, we show that NHP is biosynthesized in several other plant species in response to microbial attack, generally together with its direct metabolic precursor pipecolic acid and the phenolic immune signal salicylic acid. For example, NHP accumulates locally in inoculated leaves and systemically in distant leaves of cucumber in response to Pseudomonas syringae attack, in Pseudomonas-challenged tobacco and soybean leaves, in tomato inoculated with the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, in leaves of the monocot Brachypodium distachyon infected with bacterial (Xanthomonas translucens) and fungal (Magnaporthe oryzae) pathogens, and in M. oryzae-inoculated barley. Notably, resistance assays indicate that NHP acts as a potent inducer of acquired resistance to bacterial and fungal infection in distinct monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species. Pronounced systemic accumulation of NHP in leaf phloem sap of locally inoculated cucumber supports a function for NHP as a phloem-mobile immune signal.

Compared with non-drinkers of alcohol (GMT=123), alcohol drinkers consuming <1 go/day (GMT=114; RoM=0.93 [95%CI: 0.88-0.98]), 1-1.9 go/day (GMT=105; RoM=0.85 [95%CI: 0.79-0.93]), and []2 go/day (GMT=101; RoM=0.82 [95%CI: 0.72-0.94]) had significantly lower antibody titers (P for trend<0.01). Spline analysis showed a large reduction of antibody until around 1 go/day of alcohol consumption, and then they gradually decreased.

Uninsured and Medicaid patients present with advanced stage disease and have worse outcomes compared with similar privately insured patients. Safety net hospitals are a major care provider to this vulnerable population. Few studies have evaluated outcomes for safety net hospitals compared with private institutions in colorectal cancer. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to compare demographics, screening rates, presentation stage, and survival rates between a safety net hospital and a tertiary care center. DESIGN Comparative review of patients at 2 institutions in the same metropolitan area were conducted. SETTINGS The study included colorectal cancer care delivered either at 1 safety net hospital or 1 private tertiary care center in the same city from 2010 to 2016. PATIENTS A total of 350 patients with colorectal cancer from each hospital were evaluated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Overall survival across hospital systems was measured. RESULTS The safety net hospital had significantly more uninsured and Medicaid patients (46% vs 13%; p < 0.001) and a significantly lower median household income than the tertiary care center ($39,299 vs $49,741; p < 0.0001). At initial presentation, a similar percentage of patients at each hospital presented with stage IV disease (26% vs 20%; p = 0.06). For those undergoing resection, final pathologic stage distribution was similar across groups (p = 0.10). After a comparable median follow-up period (26.6 mo for safety net hospital vs 29.2 mo for tertiary care center), log-rank test for overall survival favored the safety net hospital (p = 0.05); disease-free survival was similar between hospitals (p = 0.40). LIMITATIONS This was a retrospective review, reporting from medical charts. CONCLUSIONS Our results support the value of safety net hospitals for providing quality colorectal cancer care, with survival and recurrence outcomes equivalent or improved compared with a local tertiary care center. Because safety net hospitals can provide equivalent outcomes despite socioeconomic inequalities and financial constraints, emphasis should be focused on ensuring that adequate funding for these institutions continues.

Behavioral theories of depression and alcohol self-medication theories suggest that greater social/environmental constraints and increased psychological distress during COVID-19 could result in increases in depression and drinking to cope with negative affect. The current study had two goals: (1) to examine self-reported changes in alcohol use and related outcomes after the introduction of COVID-19 social distancing requirements, and; (2) to test hypothesized mediation models to explain individual differences in self-reported changes in depression and alcohol use during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Participants (n = 833) were U.S. residents recruited for participation in a single online survey. The cross-sectional survey included questions assessing environmental reward, depression, COVID-19-related distress, drinking motives, and alcohol use outcomes. Outcomes were assessed via retrospective self-report for two timeframes in the single survey: the 30 days prior to state-mandated social distancing (pre-social-distancing), and the 30 days after the start of state-mandated social distancing (post-social-distancing). Results: Depression severity, coping motives, and some indices of alcohol consumption (e.g., frequency of binge drinking, and frequency of solitary drinking) were significantly greater post-social-distancing relative to pre-social-distancing. Conversely, environmental reward and other drinking motives (social, enhancement, and conformity) were significantly lower post-social distancing compared to pre-social-distancing. Behavioral economic indices (alcohol demand) were variable with regard to change. Mediation analyses suggested a significant indirect effect of reduced environmental reward with drinking quantity/frequency via increased depressive symptoms and coping motives, and a significant indirect effect of COVID-related distress with alcohol quantity/frequency via coping motives for drinking. Discussion: Results provide early cross-sectional evidence regarding the relation of environmental reward, depression, and COVID-19-related psychological distress with alcohol consumption and coping motives during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results are largely consistent with predictions from behavioral theories of depression and alcohol self-medication frameworks.

METHODS: A nationally representative cross\\\\sectional telephone survey was conducted via a random multistage selection process in October 2019 in Greece. The survey was designed to obtain information about whether vaccination should be mandated or not among adults 18 years of age or older. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to estimate the association between individuals' sociodemographic, contextual and clinical characteristics, utilization, satisfaction, and trust in the healthcare system and providers and their preference over mandatory vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 901 participants fully completed the survey (response rate 90%\\\\901/1001). About 85% of the respondents supported mandatory vaccination. Individuals who used preventive services more often compared to those who never or rarely used such, those who reported increased trust in official healthcare authorities' guidelines and recommendations compared to those who reported no trust and those who had underage children living in the household were significantly more likely to support mandatory vaccination. No differences were observed for sociodemographic factors and mandatory vaccination support. CONCLUSION: This survey revealed that most Greek citizens support mandatory vaccination, which was critically affected by the utilization of preventive services and trust in healthcare authorities. Our results suggest that healthcare policy interventions should promote mandatory vaccination through multi\\\\level initiatives to improve healthcare providers' and the general public's understanding of the value of vaccination.","output":"Should vaccination be mandated?

However, there is a lack of research on geographic modeling of COVID-19 as well as identification of contributory factors affecting the COVID-19 in the context of developing countries. To fulfill the gap, this study aimed to identify the potential factors affecting the COVID-19 incidence rates at the district-level in Bangladesh using spatial regression model (SRM). Therefore, data related to 32 demographic, economic, weather, built environment, health, and facilities related factors were collected and analyzed to explain the spatial variability of this disease incidence. Three global (Ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial lag model (SLM) and spatial error model (SEM)) and one local (geographically weighted regression (GWR)) SRMs were developed in this study. The results of the models showed that four factors significantly affected the COVID-19 incidence rates in Bangladesh. Those four factors are urban population percentage, monthly consumption, number of health workers, and distance from the capital. Among the four developed models, the GWR model performed the best in explaining the variation of COVID-19 incidence rates across Bangladesh with a R square value of 78.6%.

As a cost-effective and powerful method, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) plays an important role in numerically solving environmental fluid mechanics. Besides, with the development of computer science, an increasing number of researchers start to analyze pathogen transmission by using CFD methods. Inspired by the impact of COVID-19, this review summarizes research works of pathogen transmission based on CFD methods with different models and algorithms. Defining the pathogen as the particle or gaseous in CFD simulation is a common method and epidemic models are used in some investigations to rise the authenticity of calculation. Although it is not so difficult to describe the physical characteristics of pathogens, how to describe the biological characteristics of it is still a big challenge in the CFD simulation. A series of investigations which analyzed pathogen transmission in different environments (hospital, teaching building, etc) demonstrated the effect of airflow on pathogen transmission and emphasized the importance of reasonable ventilation. Finally, this review presented three advanced methods: LBM method, Porous Media method, and Web-based forecasting method. Although CFD methods mentioned in this review may not alleviate the current pandemic situation, it helps researchers realize the transmission mechanisms of pathogens like viruses and bacteria and provides guidelines for reducing infection risk in epidemic or pandemic situations.","output":"The role of computational fluid dynamics tools on investigation of pathogen transmission: Prevention and control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reports on how those working in post-secondary education and training in Singapore perceive the professional effects of a transition to online learning, teaching and assessment (LTA) as a consequence of the COVID-19 global pandemic.

There are currently no data regarding aerosol generation during this procedure. Given the ongoing debate regarding the potential for aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, we aimed to quantify and characterize aerosol generation during peak flow testing. METHODS: Five healthy volunteers performed peak flow maneuvers in a particle-free laboratory space. Two devices continuously sampled the ambient air during the procedure. One device can detect ultrafine particles 0.02-1 m in diameter, while the second device can detect particles 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10 m in diameter. Five different peak flow meters were compared to ambient baseline during masked and unmasked tidal breathing. RESULTS: Ultrafine particles (0.02-1 m) were generated during peak flow measurement. There was no significant difference in ultrafine particle mean concentration between peak flow meters (P = .23): Respironics (1.25  0.47 particles/mL), Philips (3.06  1.22), Clement Clarke (3.55  1.22 particles/mL), Respironics Low Range (3.50  1.52 particles/mL), and Monaghan (3.78  1.31 particles/mL). Ultrafine particle mean concentration with peak flow testing was significantly higher than masked (0.22  0.29 particles/mL) and unmasked tidal breathing (0.15  0.18 particles/mL, P = .01), but the ultrafine particle concentrations were small compared to ambient particle concentrations in a pulmonary function testing room (89.9  8.95 particles/mL). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, aerosol generation was present during peak flow testing, but concentrations were small compared to the background particle concentration in the ambient clinical environment. Surgical masks and eye protection are likely sufficient infection control measures during peak expiratory flow testing in asymptomatic patients with well controlled respiratory symptoms, but COVID-19 testing remains prudent in patients with acute respiratory symptoms prior to evaluation and peak expiratory flow assessment while the community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 cases remains high.","output":"Aerosol Generation During Peak Flow Testing: Clinical Implications for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"State space models, including compartmental models, are used to model physical, biological and social phenomena in a broad range of scientific fields. A common way of representing the underlying processes in these models is as a system of stochastic processes which can be simulated forwards in time. Inference of model parameters based on observed time-series data can then be performed using sequential Monte Carlo techniques. However, using these methods for routine inference problems can be made difficult due to various engineering considerations: allowing model design to change in response to new data and ideas, writing model code which is highly performant, and incorporating all of this with up-to-date statistical techniques. Here, we describe a suite of packages in the R programming language designed to streamline the design and deployment of state space models, targeted at infectious disease modellers but suitable for other domains. Users describe their model in a familiar domain-specific language, which is converted into parallelised C++ code. A fast, parallel, reproducible random number generator is then used to run large numbers of model simulations in an efficient manner. We also provide standard inference and prediction routines, though the model simulator can be used directly if these do not meet the users needs.

Currently available tools to predict post-operative risk are suboptimally calibrated and do not account for surgery type. Our objective was to use population-level data to derive and internally validate novel cirrhosis surgical risk models. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Veterans Outcomes and Costs Associated with Liver Disease (VOCAL) cohort, which contains granular data on patients with cirrhosis from 128 United States medical centers, merged with the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) to identify surgical procedures. We categorized surgeries as abdominal wall, vascular, abdominal, cardiac, chest, or orthopedic, and used multivariable logistic regression to model 30, 90, and 180-day post-operative mortality (VOCAL-Penn models). We compared model discrimination and calibration of VOCAL-Penn to the Mayo risk score (MRS), MELD, MELD-Na, and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) scores. RESULTS We identified 4,712 surgical procedures in 3,785 patients with cirrhosis. The novel VOCAL-Penn models were derived and internally validated with excellent discrimination (30-day post-operative mortality C-statistic=0.859, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.809-0.909). Predictors included age, pre-operative albumin, platelet count, bilirubin, surgery category, emergency indication, fatty liver disease, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, and obesity. Model performance was superior to MELD, MELD-Na, CTP, and MRS at all timepoints (e.g. 30-day post-operative mortality C-statistic for MRS=0.766, 95% CI 0.676-0.855) in terms of discrimination and calibration. CONCLUSION The VOCAL-Penn models substantially improve post-operative mortality predictions in patients with cirrhosis. These models may be applied in practice to improve pre-operative risk stratification and optimize patient selection for surgical procedures (www.vocalpennscore.com).","output":"Novel Risk Prediction Models for Post-Operative Mortality in Patients with Cirrhosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Weathered petroleum-contaminated soil (WPCS) with a high proportion of heavy hydrocarbons is difficult to remediate. Our previous research demonstrated that Fe2O3-assisted pyrolysis was a cost-effective technology for the remediation of WPCS. However, the pyrolysis behaviors, products, and mechanisms of the WPCS with Fe2O3 are still unclear. In this study, a combination of Thermogravimetric-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) and pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) techniques were used to explore these pyrolysis characteristics. The thermal desorption/degradation of light and heavy hydrocarbons in the WPCS mainly occurred at 200-400 C and 400-550 C, respectively. The activation energy of thermal reaction of heavy hydrocarbons was decreased in the presence of Fe2O3 during the WPCS pyrolysis processes. In the process, the released inorganic gaseous products were mainly H2O and CO2, while the released organic gaseous compounds were primarily cycloalkanes, alkanes, acids/esters, alcohols, and aldehydes. Compared with the WPCS pyrolysis without Fe2O3, the yields of gaseous products released during the WPCS pyrolysis with Fe2O3 were reduced significantly, and some gaseous products were even not detected. This phenomenon was contributed by the following two reasons: 1) heavy hydrocarbons in the WPCS were more easily transformed into coke in the presence of Fe2O3 during pyrolysis; 2) some released gaseous products were reacted with Fe2O3 and fixed on the soil particles. Therefore, the WPCS pyrolysis with Fe2O3 can effectively reduce the burden of tail gas treatment. Criado method analysis results suggested that the reaction mechanism of heavy hydrocarbons during the WPCS pyrolysis with Fe2O3 was rendered as the synergic effects of diffusion, order-based, and random nucleation and growth reactions.","output":"Systematic study on dynamic pyrolysis behaviors, products, and mechanisms of weathered petroleum-contaminated soil with Fe2O3"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus COVID-19 appears to strike some people more intensely than others.

A safe and efficacious SARS-CoV-2 specific vaccine is critical for prevention and mortality reduction. Moreover, we cannot overstate the importance of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in testing of novel treatments. The pervasive stumbling block, however, is the low representation of minority groups.

During this time, many of these young people were forced to return to their family homes and restrict their social relations. This new situation often exposed them to forms of violence from which there was no escape, with negative consequences for their psychosocial health. The study evaluates the correlations between perceived social support, burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness and the people with whom LGBTQ+ youth lived during confinement. A descriptive and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and bivariate correlations is used to examine the responses of 394 LGBTQ+ youth, between 17 and 21 years of age, residing in Spain. Overall, the study finds that gender is key when explaining the differences between the experiences of LGBTQ+ youth, with women and non-binary individuals experiencing a greater perception of stigma in the places where they lived during the lockdown. Moreover, trans men and women and non-binary individuals reported receiving less support and a greater feeling of burdensomeness then the other participants.

METHODS We performed 2,982 RFA treatments on 1,170 primary HCC patients and analyzed a collected database. RESULTS Final computed tomography images showed complete tumor ablation in 2,964 (99.4%) of 2,982 treatments performed for the 1,170 primary HCC patients. With a median follow-up of 38.2 months, 5- and 10-year survival rates were 60.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 56.7-63.9%) and 27.3% (95% CI: 21.5-34.7%), respectively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age, antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), Child-Pugh class, tumor size, tumor number, serum des--carboxy-prothrombin (DCP) level, and serum lectin-reactive -fetoprotein level (AFP-L3) were significantly related to survival. Five- and 10-year local tumor progression rates were both 3.2% (95% CI: 2.1-4.3%). Serum DCP level alone was significantly related to local tumor progression. Five- and 10-year distant recurrence rates were 74.8% (95% CI: 71.8-77.8%) and 80.8% (95% CI: 77.4-84.3%), respectively.

Furthermore, flatfoot leads to a variety of musculoskeletal symptoms in the lower extremity, such as knee or hip pain. The standard conservative treatment for flatfoot deformity is exercise therapy or treatment with foot orthoses. Foot orthoses are prescribed for various foot complaints. However, the evidence for the provision of foot orthoses is inconsistent. The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize the evidence of foot orthoses for adults with flatfoot. METHODS A computerized search was conducted in August 2021, using the databases PubMed, Scopus, Pedro, Cochrane Library, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Intervention studies of any design investigating the effects of foot orthoses were included, apart from case studies. Two independent reviewers assessed all search results to identify eligible studies and to assess their methodological quality. RESULTS A total of 110 studies were identified through the database search. 12 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. These studies investigated prefabricated and custom-made foot orthoses, evaluating stance and plantar pressure during gait. The sample sizes of the identified studies ranged from 8 to 80. In most of the studies, the methodological quality was low and a lack of information was frequently detected. CONCLUSION There is a lack of evidence on the effect of foot orthoses for flatfoot in adults. This review illustrates the importance of conducting randomized controlled trials and the comprehensive development of guidelines for the prescription of foot orthoses.

If linked electronically and scanned systematically, the information provided by these technologies could be mined to uncover new epidemiological patterns and associations much faster than traditional public health approaches. The benefits of earlier outbreak detection are significant, but implementation could be opposed in the absence of a social licence or if ethical and legal concerns are not addressed. METHODS: A three-phase mixed-method Delphi survey with Australian policy-makers, health practitioners and lawyers (n = 44) was conducted to explore areas of consensus and disagreement over (1) key policy and practical issues raised by the introduction of novel communicable disease surveillance programmes; and (2) the most significant and likely risks from using social media content and WGS technologies in epidemiological research and outbreak investigations. RESULTS: Panellists agreed that the integration of social media monitoring and WGS technologies into communicable disease surveillance systems raised significant issues, including impacts on personal privacy, medicolegal risks and the potential for unintended consequences. Notably, their concerns focused on how these technologies should be used, rather than how the data was collected. Panellists held that social media users should expect their posts to be monitored in the interests of public health, but using those platforms to contact identified individuals was controversial. The conditions of appropriate use of pathogen WGS in epidemiological research and investigations was also contentious. Key differences amongst participants included the necessity for consent before testing and data-linkage, thresholds for action, and the legal and ethical importance of harms to individuals and commercial entities. The erosion of public trust was seen as the most significant risk from the systematic use of these technologies. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing communicable disease surveillance with social-media monitoring and pathogen WGS may cause controversy. The challenge is to determine and then codify how these technologies should be used such that the balance between individual risk and community benefit is widely accepted. Participants agreed that clear guidelines for appropriate use that address legal and ethical concerns need to be developed in consultation with relevant experts and the broader Australian public.

The support of a polycaprolactone helix formed by 3D melt extrusion was coated with dopamine in order to adsorb nerve growth factor-loaded microspheres. The complex analysis of the influence of process factors on the coverage efficiency of polycaprolactone helix by nerve grow factor-loaded microspheres was analyzed.

It was demonstrated by chemical and physical tests that the chitosan/polycaprolactone conduit meets the requirements imposed on peripheral nerve implants, particularly mimicking mechanical properties of surrounding soft tissue. Moreover, the conduit may support regrowing nerves for a prolonged period, as its structure and integrity persist upon incubation in lysozyme-contained PBS solution up to 28 days at body temperature. In vitro cytocompatibility toward mHippoE-18 embryonic hippocampal cells of the chitosan/polycaprolactone conduit was proven. Most importantly, the developed conduits stimulate axonal growth and support monocyte activation, the latter is advantageous especially at early stages of nerve regeneration.

METHODS: From April 4 to July 3, 2020, in a single university hospital in Denmark, all parturient women and their partners were invited to participate in the study, along with their newborns. Participating women and partners had a pharyngeal swab and a blood sample taken at admission; immediately after delivery, a blood sample was drawn from the umbilical cord. The swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction, and the blood samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Full medical history and obstetric and neonatal information were available. RESULTS: A total of 1,313 parturient women (72.5.% of all women admitted for delivery at the hospital in the study period), 1,188 partners, and 1,206 newborns participated in the study. The adjusted serologic prevalence was 2.6% in women and 3.5% in partners. Seventeen newborns had SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, and none had immunoglobulin M antibodies. No associations between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and obstetric or neonatal complications were found (eg, preterm birth, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, Apgar score, low birth weight, umbilical arterial pH, need for continuous positive airway pressure, or neonatal admission), but statistical power to detect such differences was low.

METHODS A single-center surveillance study included all patients with diabetes admitted to Children's Hospital, Ain Shams University, in Egypt between May to August 2020. Data were collected to evaluate patients' clinical and laboratory characteristics as well as their outcomes. RESULTS Thirty-six patients were admitted during the study period. The mean age was 8.4  3.8 years. Patients presented late to the emergency department with a mean delay of 3.05  1.19 days from onset of symptoms. 34/36 patients presented in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), 50% presenting in severe DKA.

To explore the relationship between the methylation pattern of Oct4 gene exon 1 and embryonic development, in this work, five different tissues (heart, liver, lung, cerebrum and cerebellum) from three germ layers were chosen from low age (50C60 d) and advanced age (60C70 d) of fetal cattle and the differences between tissues or ages were analyzed, respectively. The result showed that the DNA methylation level of Oct4 gene exon 1 was significant different (P<0.01) between any two of three germ layers in low age (<60 d), but kept steady of advanced age (P>0.05) (>60 d), suggesting that 60-d post coital was an important boundary for embryonic development. In addition, in ectoderm (cerebrum and cerebellum), there was no significant methylation difference of Oct4 gene exon 1 between low age and advanced age (P>0.05), but the result of endoderm (liver and lung) and mesoderm (heart) were on the contrary (P<0.01), which indicated the development of ectoderm was earlier than endoderm and mesoderm. The methylation differences from the 3rd, 5th and 9th CpG-dinucleotide loci of Oct4 gene exon 1 were significantly different between each two of three germ layers (P<0.05), indicating that these three loci may have important influence on bovine embryonic development.

This work firstly identified the DNA methylation profile of bovine Oct4 gene exon 1 and its association with germ layers development in fetus and adult of cattle. Moreover, the work also provided epigenetic information for further studying bovine embryonic development and cellular reprogramming.","output":"Methylation profile of bovine Oct4 gene coding region in relation to three germ layers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an emerging porcine coronavirus that causes a tremendous economic burden on the swine industry. The assessment of PEDV-neutralizing antibody levels provides a valuable tool to assess and predict herd immunity. We evaluated the performance of a PEDV imaging cytometry-based high-throughput neutralization test (HTNT) and compared the HTNT to a fluorescent focus neutralization (FFN) assay using serum samples from pigs of known PEDV infection status (n = 159). Estimates of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for HTNT and FFN assays derived from receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses showed that both PEDV FFN and HTNT provided excellent diagnostic performance. However, in the laboratory, imaging cytometry provided an objective and semi-automated approach that removed human subjectivity from the testing process and reduced the read-time of a 96-well plate to < 4 min. In addition, imaging cytometry facilitated the rapid collection and long-term storage of test images and data for further evaluation or client consultation. For PEDV and other pathogens, imaging cytometry could provide distinct advantages over classic virus neutralization or FFN assays for the detection and quantitation of neutralizing antibody.","output":"Detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus-neutralizing antibody using high-throughput imaging cytometry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Open science (OS) is of paramount importance for the improvement of science worldwide and across research fields. Recent years have witnessed a transition toward open and transparent scientific practices, but there is still a long way to go. Early career researchers (ECRs) are of crucial relevance in the process of steering toward the standardization of OS practices, as they will become the future decision makers of the institutional change that necessarily accompanies this transition. Thus, it is imperative to gain insight into where ECRs stand on OS practices. Under this premise, the Open Science group of the Max Planck PhDnet designed and conducted an online survey to assess the stance toward OS practices of doctoral candidates from the Max Planck Society. As one of the leading scientific institutions for basic research worldwide, the Max Planck Society provides a considerable population of researchers from multiple scientific fields, englobed into three sections: biomedical sciences, chemistry, physics and technology, and human and social sciences. From an approximate total population of 5,100 doctoral candidates affiliated with the Max Planck Society, the survey collected responses from 568 doctoral candidates. The survey assessed self-reported knowledge, attitudes, and implementation of different OS practices, namely, open access publications, open data, preregistrations, registered reports, and replication studies. ECRs seemed to hold a generally positive view toward these different practices and to be interested in learning more about them. Furthermore, we found that ECRs knowledge and positive attitudes predicted the extent to which they implemented these OS practices, although levels of implementation were rather low in the past. We observed differences and similarities between scientific sections. We discuss these differences in terms of need and feasibility to apply these OS practices in specific scientific fields, but additionally in relation to the incentive systems that shape scientific communities. Lastly, we discuss the implications that these results can have for the training and career advancement of ECRs, and ultimately, for the consolidation of OS practices.","output":"Where Do Early Career Researchers Stand on Open Science Practices?

Intracellular ATP depletion leads to the development of necrosis and apoptosis. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of LPA receptor-mediated signaling on the regulation of cancer cell functions associated with ATP reduction. Long-term ethidium bromide (EtBr) treated (MG63-EtBr) cells were established from osteosarcoma MG-63 cells. The intracellular ATP levels of MG63-EtBr cells were significantly lower than that of MG-63 cells. LPAR2, LPAR3, LPAR4 and LPAR6 gene expressions were elevated in MG63-EtBr cells. The cell motile and invasive activities of MG63-EtBr cells were markedly higher than those of MG-63 cells. The cell motile activity of MG-63 cells was increased by LPA4 and LPA6 knockdowns. In cell survival assay, cells were treated with cisplatin (CDDP) every 24 h for 3 days. The cell survival to CDDP of MG63-EtBr cells was lower than that of MG-63 cells. LPA2 knockdown decreased the cell survival to CDDP of MG-63 cells. The cell survival to CDDP of MG-63 cells was inhibited by (2 S)-OMPT (LPA3 agonist). Moreover, the cell survival to CDDP of MG-63 cells was enhanced by LPA4 and LPA6 knockdowns. These results indicate that LPA signaling via LPA receptors is involved in the regulation of cellular functions associated with ATP reduction in MG-63 cells treated with EtBr.","output":"Effects of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling via LPA receptors on cellular functions associated with ATP reduction in osteosarcoma cells treated with ethidium bromide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has become a global pandemic Based on symptoms, COVID-19 cases can be classified as symptomatic or asymptomatic However, there is limited information about the differences between COVID-19 patients with and without pneumonia Our study aimed to further discuss the spectrum and clinical characteristics of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients with and without pneumonia","output":"Spectrum and Clinical Characteristics of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) With and Without Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The trade-off between economic development and environmental protection has always been a significant and tough issue for local governments. Studies found that some local governments took temporary measures to control air pollution and created political blue sky in certain periods. We collected daily air quality index (AQI) data and individual pollutant concentration data of four cities in China which have hosted major international events in 2019. The air quality of the cities taken temporary measures to control air pollution had an obvious improvement during the events. Furthermore, the improvement mainly occurred in pollution indicators, such as PM(2.5) and PM(10), which are more valued and sensitive to the public. The sustainability analysis demonstrates that the air quality deteriorated again after the event, indicating that political blue sky comes at the cost of retaliatory pollution.","output":"Political blue sky in fog and haze governance: evidence from the local major international events in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report 2 unusual cases of partial bowel obstruction resulting from adherence to a barbed suture presenting 3 to 4 weeks after robotic-assisted sacrocolpopexy for uterovaginal prolapse.

Three to four weeks after surgery, both patients presented with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and were found to have small bowel obstructions requiring a return to the operating room. Upon surgical exploration, a loop of small bowel was found to be adhered to a segment of the barbed suture at the sacral promontory, which had been used to close the peritoneum over the mesh.

In this study, data from UK Biobank participants who were tested for COVID\\\\19 infection (16 March to 7 September 2020) were used to explore the link between shift work and COVID\\\\19 infection. Using the baseline occupational information, participants were categorised as non\\\\shift workers, day shift workers, mixed shift workers and night shift workers. Multivariable regression models were used to assess the association between shift work and COVID\\\\19 infection. Among the 18,221 participants (9.4% positive cases), 11.2% were health workers, and 16.4% were involved in shift\\\\work\\\\based jobs. Ethnic minorities (18%) and people in night\\\\shift\\\\based jobs (18.1%) had a significantly higher prevalence of COVID\\\\19 infection than others. Adjusted logistics regression model suggest that, compared with their counterparts, people employed in a night\\\\shift\\\\based job were 1.85\\\\fold (95% CI: 1.42C2.41) more likely to have COVID\\\\19 infection. Sensitivity analysis focusing on people working in a non\\\\healthcare setting suggests that people in shift\\\\work\\\\based jobs had 1.81\\\\fold (95% CI: 1.04%C3.18%) higher odds of COVID\\\\19 infection than their counterparts.
