Lipoic acid (LA) plays a role as a cofactor in eukaryotes, most Bacteria, and some Archea. Research of recent years has increasingly pointed to the therapeutic properties of exogenously supplemented LA. The present study was conducted on 40 strains of M. hominis cultured with the following LA concentrations: 1,200 g/ml, 120 g/ml, and 12 g/ml. The bacterial colonies of each strain were counted and expressed as the number of colony-forming units/ml (CFU). The number of CFU in M. hominis strains obtained in the presence of LA was compared with the number of CFU in the strains grown in the media without LA. The obtained results indicated that the presence of LA in the medium did not affect the growth of M. hominis. The investigation of the influence of LA on the growth and survival of microbial cells not only allows for obtaining an answer to the question of whether LA has antimicrobial activity and, therefore, can be used as a drug supporting the treatment of patients infected with a given pathogenic microorganism. Such studies are also crucial for a better understanding of LA metabolism in the microbial cells, which is also important for the search for new antimicrobial drugs. This research is, therefore, an introduction to such further studies.","output":"Lipoic Acid Does Not Affect The Growth of Mycoplasma hominis Cells In Vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Patients with COVID-19 are thought to be at higher risk of cardiometabolic and pulmonary complications, but quantification of that risk is limited. We aimed to describe the overall burden of these complications in survivors of severe COVID-19. Methods Working on behalf of NHS England we used data from the OpenSAFELY platform linking primary care records to death certificate and hospital data. We constructed two cohorts: a COVID-19 cohort consisting of patients discharged following hospitalisation with COVID-19, and a comparison population of patients discharged following hospitalisation with pneumonia in 2019. Outcomes included DVT, PE, ischaemic stroke, MI, heart failure, AKI and new type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Outcome rates from hospital discharge were measured in each cohort, stratified by patient demographics and 30-day period. We fitted Cox regression models to estimate crude and age/sex adjusted hazard ratios comparing outcome rates between the two cohorts. Results Amongst the population of 31,569 patients discharged following hospitalisation with COVID-19, the highest rates were observed for heart failure (199.3; 95% CI: 191.8 - 207.1) and AKI (154.5; 95% CI: 147.9 - 161.4). Rates of DVT, heart failure, ischaemic stroke, MI, PE and diabetes were high over the four months post discharge, especially in the first month. Patterns were broadly similar to those seen in patients discharged with pneumonia but somewhat higher in the COVID-19 population for stroke (adj-HR 1.78; 95% CI: 1.53 - 2.08), PE (adj-HR 1.38; 95% CI: 1.21 - 1.58), MI (adj-HR 1.46; 95% CI: 1.20 - 1.76), AKI (adj-HR 1.27; 95% CI: 1.19 - 1.36) and T2DM (adj-HR 1.28; 95% CI: 1.08 - 1.50). Conclusions In this descriptive study of survivors of severe COVID-19, rates of the measured outcomes are at least as high, though in some cases slightly higher, than in patients discharged after hospitalisation with pneumonia. Further work is needed to identify what characteristics of COVID-19 patients put them at highest risk of adverse events.","output":"Rates of serious clinical outcomes in survivors of hospitalisation with COVID-19: a descriptive cohort study within the OpenSAFELY platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer in UK. Symptomatic patients are referred via an urgent pathway and although most are investigated with colonoscopy <4% are diagnosed with cancer. There is therefore a need for a suitable triage tool to prioritise investigations. This study retrospectively examined performance of various triage tools in patients awaiting investigation on the urgent lower gastrointestinal cancer pathway DESIGN: All patients over 40 years of age on the urgent pathway awaiting investigation for suspected CRC on 1 May were included. After 6 months, outcomes were evaluated and the performance of the faecal immunochemical test (FIT), faecal haemoglobin concentration, age and sex test (FAST) and the artificial intelligence algorithm ColonFlag were examined. RESULTS: 532 completed investigations and received a diagnosis; 15 had CRC. 388 had a valid FIT result, of whom 11 had CRC; FAST Score 4.5 had sensitivity of 72.7%, specificity of 80.6% and would have failed to detect three tumours. Faecal haemoglobin (f-Hb) at cut-off of 10 g/g and ColonFlag had equal sensitivity of 81.82%, ColonFlag had greater specificity 73.47%, compared with 64.99%. Both tests would have failed to detect two tumours but not in the same patients; when used in combination, sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 49.4%. When ColonFlag was applied to the cohort of 532, an additional four tumours would have been detected in patients without a valid FIT.

This approach provides intravoxel distributions of correlations of water mobilities in orthogonal directions, revealing sub-voxel diffusion components. Here we use it to investigate water diffusivities along axial and radial orientations within spinal cord specimens with confirmed, tract-specific axonal injury. First, we show using transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry that tract-specific axonal beading occurs following Wallerian degeneration in the cortico-spinal tract as direct sequelae to closed head injury. We demonstrate that although some voxel-averaged diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics are sensitive to this axonal injury, they are non-specific, i.e., they do not reveal an underlying biophysical mechanism of injury. Then we employ 2D diffusion correlation imaging (DCI) to improve discrimination of different water microenvironments by measuring and mapping the joint water mobility distributions perpendicular and parallel to the spinal cord axis. We determine six distinct diffusion spectral components that differ according to their microscopic anisotropy and mobility. We show that at the injury site a highly anisotropic diffusion component completely disappears and instead becomes more isotropic. Based on these findings, an injury-specific MR image of the spinal cord was generated, and a radiological-pathological correlation with histological silver staining % area was performed. The resulting strong and significant correlation (r = 0.70, p < 0.0001) indicates the high specificity with which DCI detects injury-induced tissue alterations. We predict that the ability to selectively image microstructural changes following axonal injury in the spinal cord can be useful in clinical and research applications by enabling specific detection and increased sensitivity to injury-induced microstructural alterations. These results also encourage us to translate DCI to higher spatial dimensions to enable assessment of traumatic axonal injury, and possibly other diseases and disorders in the brain.","output":"Direct and specific assessment of axonal injury and spinal cord microenvironments using diffusion correlation imaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gamification, defined as the use of game elements in non game situations, is a widely used method to foster learner engagement and motivation.

However, there is no study yet that analyse the effect of combining several profiles. In this paper, we study the usage data from 258 students who used a gamified learning environment as a part of their mathematics class. By simulating different adaptation techniques, we show that the learner model chosen to tailor gamification has significant effects on learners motivation and engaged behaviours depending on the profile(s) used in this context. We also show that tailoring to initial motivation to learn mathematics can improve intrinsic motivation. Finally, we show that tailoring to both player type and motivation profiles can improve intrinsic motivation, and decrease amotivation, compared to a single adaptation only based on learner motivation.

Cancers at these sites can differ anatomically and histologically and might have different causal factors, such as tobacco use, alcohol use, and infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) (1). Incidence of combined oral cavity and pharyngeal cancers declined during the 1980s but began to increase around 1999 (2,3). Because tobacco use has declined in the United States, accompanied by a decrease in incidence of many tobacco-related cancers, researchers have suggested that the increase in oral cavity and pharynx cancers might be attributed to anatomic sites with specific cell types in which HPV DNA is often found (4,5). U.S. Cancer Statistics? data were analyzed to examine trends in incidence of cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx by anatomic site, sex, race/ethnicity, and age group.

Conceptually, the score can serve as a proxy for a patient's need for care coordination across doctors. Such a measure may be valuable to researchers studying care coordination practices for complex patients. In contrast with previous comorbidity scores, which focus primarily on mortality and utilization, this comorbidity score approximates the complexity of a patient's the interaction with the health care system. METHODS: We use 2015 inpatient claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to model the relationship between a patient's diagnoses and physician specialty usage. We estimate usage of specialist doctors by using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Poisson model. The Specialty Intensity Score is then constructed using this predicted specialty usage. To validate our score, we test its power to predict the occurrence of patient safety incidents and compare that with the predictive power of the Charlson comorbidity index. RESULTS: Our model uses 127 of the 279 International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD\\\\10\\\\CM) diagnosis subchapters to predict specialty usage, thus creating the Specialty Intensity Score. This score has significantly greater power in predicting patient safety complications than the widely used Charlson comorbidity index. CONCLUSION: The Specialty Intensity Score developed in this article can be used by health services researchers and administrators to approximate a patient's need for care coordination across multiple specialist doctors.

The mean difference of 0.115 corresponds with 42 extra days in best imaginable health status in favour of the iCBT group over the course of 1 year. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for iCBT versus ODF was 18 865 per QALY saved. The cost-effectiveness plane indicated that iCBT is a cheaper and more effective intervention in 24.5% of the cases, and in 75% a costlier and more effective intervention than ODF. Only in about 0.5% of the cases, there was an indication of a costlier, but less effective intervention compared with ODF. CONCLUSIONS: The ICER of 18 865 was lower than the cost-effectiveness threshold range of 23 400C35 100 as proposed by the NICE guidelines, suggesting that the iCBT treatment of depressive symptoms in patients with CVD is cost-effective.

Even though conventional antiviral agents are beneficial in eliminating viral infections, they may lead to side effects or physiological toxicity. Silver nanoparticles and nanocomposites have been demonstrated to possess inhibitory properties against several pathogenic microbes, including archaea, bacteria, fungi, algae, and viruses. Its pronounced antimicrobial activity against various microbe-mediated diseases potentiates its use in combating viral infections. Notably, the appropriated selection of the synthesis method to fabricate silver nanoparticles is a major factor for consideration as it directly impacts antiviral efficacy, level of toxicity, scalability, and environmental sustainability. Thus, this article presents and discusses various synthesis approaches to produce silver nanoparticles and nanocomposites, providing technological insights into selecting approaches to generate antiviral silver-based nanoparticles. The antiviral mechanism of various formulations of silver nanoparticles and the evaluation of its propensity to combat specific viral infections as a potential antiviral agent are also discussed.

It also plays a critical role in viral infections such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, efficient removal of excessive cytokines is essential for treatment. We previously reported a novel protein modification tool called the QTY code, through which hydrophobic amino acids Leu, Ile, Val and Phe are replaced by Gln (Q), Thr (T) and Tyr (Y). Thus, the functional detergent-free equivalents of membrane proteins can be designed. Here, we report the application of the QTY code on six variants of cytokine receptors, including interleukin receptors IL4R and IL10R, chemokine receptors CCR9 and CXCR2, as well as interferon receptors IFNR1 and IFNR1. QTY-variant cytokine receptors exhibit physiological properties similar to those of native receptors without the presence of hydrophobic segments. The receptors were fused to the Fc region of immunoglobulin G (IgG) protein to form an antibody-like structure. These QTY code-designed Fc-fusion receptors were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The resulting water-soluble fusion receptors bind to their respective ligands with K (d) values affinity similar to isolated native receptors.

Methods Sera of n=69 SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals 21+/-1 days after vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) were tested using the following quantitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays: Roche S total antibody, DiaSorin trimeric spike IgG, DiaSorin S1/S2 IgG, Abbott II IgG, and Serion/Virion IgG. Test agreement was assessed by Passing-Bablok regression. Results were further compared to the percent inhibition calculated from a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) by correlation and ROC (receiver-operating-characteristics) analysis. Results Individual values were distributed over several orders of magnitude for all assays evaluated. Although the assays were in good overall agreement (rho=0.80-0.94), Passing-Bablok regression revealed systematic and proportional differences, which could not be eliminated by converting the results to BAU/mL as suggested by the manufacturers. 7 (10%) individuals had a negative sVNT results (i.e. <30% inhibition).

The research was conducted on a sample of 1108 respondents with the use of CAWI technique collected in an online survey carried out in FebruaryCAugust 2020. To analyze the obtained results, cluster analysis, linear regression model and duplication method were used to verify the substitute channels for purchasing organic goods. The pandemic has intensified the health value of consumers when making decisions about choosing food products. Consumers are sensitive shoppers who read the content of the labels and pay attention to the ingredients of the products they buy. The price is also of significant importance for consumers;however, it is less important than, for example, the expiration date of the purchased product. With the use of PCA analysis, it was possible to identify 18 factors that could be divided into three segments: marketing, practical and sensory. The proposed factors, according to the respondents, had an effect on the purchase of organic products by Polish consumers. Regarding the preferred purchasing channels, the Internet is becoming more and more important. Almost one-quarter of the respondents confirmed that they bought organic products via the above-mentioned distribution channel. Nearly 17% of the surveyed consumers considered the Internet to be an alternative way of doing their shopping.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact on infant mortality due to a decrease in the prevalence of breastfeeding during 2020 due to the physical isolation against the SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic in Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the population attributable risk approach taking into account the prevalence of breastfeeding and its potential decrease associated with the measures of physical isolation and the relative risk (RR) of the association between exclusive breastfeeding and the occurrence of acute infection consequences in the growth (weight for height) of children under the age of five through a mathematical modeling program. RESULTS: We found an increase of 11.39% in the number of cases of growth arrest in the age group of 6 to 11 months with a 50% decrease in breastfeeding prevalence, as well as an increase in the number of diarrhea cases in children between 1 and 5 months of age from 5% (5.67%) on, and an increased number of deaths in children under 5 years (9.04%) with a 50% decrease in the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding.

It is questionable whether such a functionalised tool can also provide what has been called the salience of the pleasures of free-play for children.

This study was designed to investigate the influences of clinical variables and mechanical ventilation settings on the outcomes for severe ARDS patients receiving ECMO. METHODS: We reviewed severe ARDS patients who received ECMO due to refractory hypoxemia from May 2006 to October 2015. Serial mechanical ventilator settings before and after ECMO and factors associated with survival were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 158 severe ARDS patients received ECMO were finally analyzed. Overall intensive care unit (ICU) mortality was 55.1%. After ECMO initiation, tidal volume, peak inspiratory pressure and dynamic driving pressure were decreased, while positive end-expiratory pressure levels were relative maintained. After ECMO initiation, nonsurvivors had significantly higher dynamic driving pressure until day 7 than survivors. Cox proportional hazards regression model revealed that immunocompromised [hazard ratio 1.957; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.216C3.147; p = 0.006], Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (hazard ratio 1.039; 95% CI 1.005C1.073; p = 0.023), ARDS duration before ECMO (hazard ratio 1.002; 95% CI 1.000C1.003; p = 0.029) and mean dynamic driving pressure from day 1 to 3 on ECMO (hazard ratio 1.070; 95% CI 1.026C1.116; p = 0.002) were independently associated with ICU mortality.

An urgent worldwide threat is posed by the introduction and spread of novel infectious diseases. The reasons for emerging infectious diseases are numerous and complex. Among the most significant explanations for these emerging diseases are changes in environment and ecology caused by natural phenomena such as droughts, hurricanes, and floods; and human-made phenomena such as agricultural development, urbanization, and denuding of forests. Worldwide conflict, including wars, ethnic cleansing, and genocide, have led to displacement of large populations into overcrowded settlements where safe water is not available and sanitation is poor. For example, unsanitary conditions led to a huge increase in the rat population in post-war Kosovo, resulting in a tularemia outbreak with 327 confirmed cases in 8 months. Regional conflict leads to breakdown in infection control, inadequate surveillance, impeded access to populations, and spread of infectious diseases through movement of refugees and aid workers. Increased precipitation, a result of climate change, leads to more agricultural run-off, allowing pathogens to enter drinking water systems. In developing countries where poverty and inadequate infrastructure are the norm, public health monitoring systems must be supported and improved so that new or more severe risks to health can be identified and curtailed.

Utilizing complementary approaches, validated by flow cytometric analysis of human and murine macrophage subsets and conditional genetic loss and gain of function, we uncover a unique maladaptive role for myeloid AXL during IRI in the heart. Cross signaling between AXL and TLR4 in cardiac macrophages directed a switch to glycolytic metabolism and secretion of proinflammatory IL-1, leading to increased intramyocardial inflammation, adverse ventricular remodeling, and impaired contractile function. AXL interestingly functioned independently of cardioprotective MerTK to reduce the efficacy of cardiac repair, but like MerTK, was proteolytically cleaved. Administration of a selective small molecule AXL inhibitor alone improved cardiac healing, which was further enhanced in combination with blockade of MerTK cleavage.

The goal of the current study was to assess the association of COVID-19 clinical courses controlled by patients adaptive immune responses without progression to severe disease with patients Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genetics, AB0 blood group antigens, and the presence or absence of near-loss-of-function delta 32 deletion mutant of the CCC chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5). PATIENT AND METHODS: An exploratory observational study including 157 adult COVID-19 convalescent patients was performed with a median follow-up of 250 days. The impact of different HLA genotypes, AB0 blood group antigens, and the CCR5 mutant CD195 were investigated for their role in the clinical course of COVID-19. In addition, this study addressed levels of severity and morbidity of COVID-19. The association of the immunogenetic background parameters were further related to patients humoral antiviral immune response patterns by longitudinal observation. RESULTS: Univariate HLA analyses identified putatively protective HLA alleles (HLA class II DRB1*01:01 and HLA class I B*35:01, with a trend for DRB1*03:01). They were associated with reduced durations of disease instead decreased (rather than increased) total anti-S IgG levels. They had a higher virus neutralizing capacity compared to non-carriers. Conversely, analyses also identified HLA alleles (HLA class II DQB1*03:02 und HLA class I B*15:01) not associated with such benefit in the patient cohort of this study. Hierarchical testing by Cox regression analyses confirmed the significance of the protective effect of the HLA alleles identified (when assessed in composite) in terms of disease duration, whereas AB0 blood group antigen heterozygosity was found to be significantly associated with disease severity (rather than duration) in our cohort. A suggestive association of a heterozygous CCR5 delta 32 mutation status with prolonged disease duration was implied by univariate analyses but could not be confirmed by hierarchical multivariate testing. CONCLUSION: The current study shows that the presence of HLA class II DRB1*01:01 and HLA class I B*35:01 is of even stronger association with reduced disease duration in mild and moderate COVID-19 than age or any other potential risk factor assessed. Prospective studies in larger patient populations also including novel SARS-CoV-2 variants will be required to assess the impact of HLA genetics on the capacity of mounting protective vaccination responses in the future.

We present a stochastic model of the sensor time response, which takes into account the coupling of adsorptionCdesorption and MT processes. It is used for the analysis of response kinetics and ultimate noise performance of protein biosensors. We show that slow MT not only decelerates the response kinetics, but also increases the noise and decreases the sensors maximal achievable signal-to-noise ratio, thus degrading the ultimate sensor performance, including the minimal detectable/quantifiable analyte concentration. The results illustrate the significance of the presented model for the correct interpretation of measurement data, for the estimation of sensors noise performance metrics important for reliable analyte detection/quantification, as well as for sensor optimization in terms of the lower detection/quantification limit. They are also incentives for the further investigation of the MT influence in nanoscale sensors, as a possible cause of false-negative results in analyte detection experiments.","output":"Stochastic Time Response and Ultimate Noise Performance of Adsorption-Based Microfluidic Biosensors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is one of the greatest challenges of our lifetime. Quite appropriately, the pandemic has been declared a non-traditional security (NTS) threat in many countries in Europe and Asia. Beyond its detrimental effect on public health, COVID-19 is testing the international resolve to cooperate and represents a particularly tricky challenge to regionalism. Due to the nature of pandemics, regional pandemic management is imperative. However, the two most successful regional organisations, the European Union (EU) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), have not been able to match the resolve of their individual member states, and there is a substantial gap between timely and robust national pandemic management and inadequacy at the regional level. This is a paradox that merits further investigation. To what extent and why diverged early national and early regional responses to COVID-19? This article identifies a causal relationship between robust national pandemic management as a result of early securitisation and ensuing paralysis on regional level, a process which I call the 'selffulfilling prophecy of realism'-a vicious cycle of national self-help responses paralysing regional cooperation. This article contributes early to the impact of COVID-19 on regionalism by analysing EU and ASEAN pandemic management efforts, investigating what has hindered or facilitated successful regional cooperation and identifying room for meaningful interregionalism.","output":"ASEAN and the EU amidst COVID-19: overcoming the self-fulfilling prophecy of realism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pose a major threat to public health Despite intense research efforts on how, when and where these new diseases appear, they are still a source of considerable uncertainty An outbreak of a new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS - CoV - 2), appeared in late December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province in China and caused an atypical pneumonia called coronavirus 2019 (COVID - 19) On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially declared that Covid-19 is a pandemic As of April 15, 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the appearance of the first case on March 09, 2020 We have studied in this paper the dynamics of the spread of the pandemic in Burkina Faso as well as the cures when a good policy of awareness is put in place by the government We use an agent-based approach In this paper we are interested in the dynamics of propagation of the pandemic in Burkina Faso as well as the cures when a good awareness policy is implemented by the government We use an agent-based approach Awareness is simulated by the dissemination of information in a contact network The results obtained show that the structure of contact networks has an influence on the information diffusion As part of Covid-19, simulations show that awareness-raising contributes enormously to stopping the chain of contamination and death ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"An Agent-Based Study of the Impact of Sensitization on the Spread of Covid 19 in Burkina Faso"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The telemedicine industry has rapidly grown during the COVID-19 pandemic, and telemedicine has become a common form of care. The present study looks at the online conversation regarding telemedicine at the beginning of the pandemic and one year later. The Technology Acceptance Model is utilized to explain the findings. METHODS: Brandwatch and NUVI software captured social mentions on Twitter regarding telemedicine during the beginning of the pandemic (March 15, 2020CApril 20, 2020) and one year later (March 12, 2021CApril 19, 2021). SAS text-mining software analyzed the social mentions and organized them into ten unique topics for each time period. The research team analyzed the topics and organized them into themes. A network analysis was also performed to examine structure and influence within the network. RESULTS: In MarchCApril 2020, the themes focused on the use of telehealth in general, telehealth for mental health applications, and Medicare covering telehealth services. In MarchCApril 2021, the themes focused on news events regarding telehealth and the rise in prominence of telehealth services. The network analysis shows a shift in the distribution of telehealth information among influential accounts and reveals that the network became more connected, with a change in the control of information spread. CONCLUSIONS: Technology Acceptance Model explains the social acceptance and spread of telemedicine. The transition in the conversation about telemedicine suggests a pattern of greater system use consistent with the Technology Acceptance Model.

METHODS: In June 2020, an ERAS protocol designed to promote same-day discharge was initiated that included pre-operative hydration, a urinary anesthetic, non-narcotic analgesia, perineal ice, a bowel regimen, enrollment of the family to assist with care, and communication regarding planned same-day discharge. We compared demographic, operative, hospital stay, complications, and cost data in patients undergoing pelvic organ prolapse or incontinence surgery over 4 sequential months pre (PRE; N = 82) and post (POST; N = 91) ERAS implementation using univariate statistics. RESULTS: There were no differences in demographics, operative details, or complications (p > 0.05). There were no significant differences in overall revenues or expenses (p > 0.05), but bed unit cost was significantly lower in the POST group ($210 vs $533, p < 0.0001). There was a trend toward an increased operating margin in POST patients ($4,554 vs $2,151, p = 0.1163). Significantly more POST surgeries were performed in an ambulatory setting (73.6% vs 48.8%, p = 0.0008) and resulted in same-day discharge (80.2% vs 50.0%, p = 0.0003). There were no differences in the rates of emergency room or unexpected clinic visits (p > 0.05). Prescribed post-operative opiate dose was significantly reduced in POST patients (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing female pelvic reconstructive surgery, an ERAS protocol facilitated transfer of procedures to an ambulatory surgical site and permitted same-day discharge without increasing complications, clinic visits, or emergency room visits.

Recent research on the role of mobile devices and social media apps in citizen participation has focused on more visible forms of civic?political events, such as protests and voting, and tended to neglect the effects of mobile communication performed during banal travel and quotidian activities. This article offers an alternative reading of the relevance of mobile social media (MSM) in contemporary public lives by examining how they open up new temporalities and spatialities for counter-public engagement in the contexts of mundane urban mobility. The findings demonstrate various moblogging practices that entail modalities of counter-public engagement that traverse the personal, proto-political, and communal, and reveal how local residents used these modalities to articulate alternative public agendas, connect acts of consumer activism, and perform communal belonging vis--vis inbound shopping tourism amid their daily routines and modest journeys. Focusing on mobile socialities enabled by smartphones and networking apps, this article explicates how contemporary moblogging can, on the one hand, extend people's capacity to engage in citizen talk and connective action, while on the other hand, allow them to flexibly connect and contribute personal photobiographies and narratives to counter-public communities. By unpacking the novel pathways to citizen participation, it offers insights into new ways in which everyday mobile communication can be transformed into public involvement, albeit often in agonistic and emotional forms, and the role of MSM in this process.","output":"Mundane citizenship on the move: A counter-public response to inbound shopping tourism via mobile social media applications use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we assess the effective inhibition of a series of thiazolidine derivatives (1a-1q) were adopting structure-based drug design.

The obtained reconstructed region from the second component undergoes a statistical-based prediction model to generate its more enhanced version in the third component. The remaining homogeneous regions are bicubic interpolated and reflect the required high-resolution image.

This learning and teaching environment is associated with reduced student engagement, a crucial prerequisite of student satisfaction, retention and success. This paper presents a case study that explored student engagement in the synchronous virtual learning environment, during the mandatory move to exclusive online learning in Australian higher education in April to June 2020. Three university instructors used the Teaching and Learning Circles Model to observe a series of their peers' synchronous virtual classrooms, from which they reflected on ways to enhance their own practice. The findings demonstrate how student engagement in these classrooms can be strengthened across the four constructs of Kahu and Nelsons (2018) engagement conceptual framework: belonging;emotional response;wellbeing and self-efficacy. The case study also reveals limitations of the synchronous virtual environment as a means of supporting student engagement in the online learning and teaching environment, and proposes ways to address them. Against emerging reports of increased mental health issues among isolated university students during the current pandemic, the case study's recommendations to improve student wellbeing and belonging are particularly salient.

Despite their efficacy in clinical trials, data on mRNA vaccine-induced immune responses are mostly limited to serological analyses. Here, we interrogated antibody and antigen-specific memory B cells over time in 33 SARS-CoV-2 na?ve and 11 SARS-CoV-2 recovered subjects. SARS-CoV-2 na?ve individuals required both vaccine doses for optimal increases in antibodies, particularly for neutralizing titers against the B.1.351 variant. Memory B cells specific for full-length spike protein and the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) were also efficiently primed by mRNA vaccination and detectable in all SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects after the second vaccine dose, though the memory B cell response declined slightly with age. In SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals, antibody and memory B cell responses were significantly boosted after the first vaccine dose; however, there was no increase in circulating antibodies, neutralizing titers, or antigen-specific memory B cells after the second dose. This robust boosting after the first vaccine dose strongly correlated with levels of pre-existing memory B cells in recovered individuals, identifying a key role for memory B cells in mounting recall responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Together, our data demonstrated robust serological and cellular priming by mRNA vaccines and revealed distinct responses based on prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, whereby COVID-19 recovered subjects may only require a single vaccine dose to achieve peak antibody and memory B cell responses. These findings also highlight the utility of defining cellular responses in addition to serologies and may inform SARS-CoV-2 vaccine distribution in a resource-limited setting.","output":"Distinct antibody and memory B cell responses in SARS-CoV-2 na?ve and recovered individuals following mRNA vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a rapidly evolving pandemic worldwide with at least 68 million COVID-19-positive cases and a mortality rate of about 2.2%, as of 10 December 2020. About 20% of COVID-19 patients exhibit moderate to severe symptoms. Severe COVID-19 manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with elevated plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1? (IL-1?), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10/IP10), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1&#945;), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), with low levels of interferon type I (IFN-I) in the early stage and elevated levels of IFN-I during the advanced stage of COVID-19. Most of the severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients have had preexisting comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory diseases. These conditions are known to perturb the levels of cytokines, chemokines, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an essential receptor involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells. ACE2 downregulation during SARS-CoV-2 infection activates the angiotensin II/angiotensin receptor (AT1R)-mediated hypercytokinemia and hyperinflammatory syndrome. However, several SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including open reading frame 3b (ORF3b), ORF6, ORF7, ORF8, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, can inhibit IFN type I and II (IFN-I and -II) production. Thus, hyperinflammation, in combination with the lack of IFN responses against SARS-CoV-2 early on during infection, makes the patients succumb rapidly to COVID-19. Therefore, therapeutic approaches involving anti-cytokine/anti-cytokine-signaling and IFN therapy would favor the disease prognosis in COVID-19.

By using such data from Greater Sydney, Australia, this study explored the impact of suburban road networks on two COVID-19-related outcomes measures. The first measure is COVID-19 vulnerability, which gives a low score to a more vulnerable suburb. A suburb is more vulnerable if it has the first COVID-19 case earlier and vice versa. The second measure is COVID-19 severity, which is proportionate to the number of COVID-19-positive cases for a suburb. To analyze the suburban road network, we considered four centrality measures (degree, closeness, betweenness and eigenvector) and coreCperiphery structure. We found that the degree centrality measure of the suburban road network was a strong and statistically significant predictor for both COVID-19 vulnerability and severity. Closeness centrality and eigenvector centrality were also statistically significant predictors for COVID-19 vulnerability and severity, respectively.

Therefore, this manuscript aims to identify and describe the scientific literature addressing COVID-19 from a dental research perspective, in terms of the manuscript origin, research domain, study type, and level of evidence (LoE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were retrieved from Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. A descriptive analysis of bibliographic data, collaboration network, and keyword co-occurrence analysis were performed. Articles were further classified according to the field of interest, main research question, type of study, and LoE. RESULTS: The present study identified 296 dental scientific COVID-19 original papers, published in 89 journals, and co-authored by 1331 individuals affiliated with 429 institutions from 53 countries. Although 81.4% were single-country papers, extensive collaboration among the institutions of single countries (Italian, British, and Brazilian institutions) was observed. The main research areas were as follows: the potential use of saliva and other oral fluids as promising samples for COVID-19 testing, dental education, and guidelines for the prevention of COVID-19 transmission in dental practice. The majority of articles were narrative reviews, cross-sectional studies, and short communications. The overall LoE in the analyzed dental literature was low, with only two systematic reviews with the highest LoE I.

All peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients from our center previously followed monthly in face-to-face visits were monitored by telephone call appointments since then. In this study, we aimed to investigate and compare the hospitalization rates before and during the telehealth assistance. METHOD: Patients aged 18 years and older in March 2020 were included. We analysed total hospitalization rate and PD-related hospitalization rate (infectious, mechanical dysfunction and hypervolemia) 6-month before (first phase) and 6-month after (second phase) telehealth implementation. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients were included (male: 45%; age: 56.9  16.2 years old; PD vintage: 15 (7C26) months; automated PD: 97%; diabetes: 45%). There were 15 hospital admissions in 13 patients (2 patients were admitted twice) during the first phase, resulting in an incident rate (IR)=23 per 1000 patients-month. In the second phase, the numbers increased to 34 admissions (3 due to covid-19) in 30 patients (1 patient admitted twice and another four times), IR=56 per 1000 patients-month. The total hospitalization incident rate ratio (IRR) was 2.43 (CI 95% 1.32 C 4.48). The total PD-related hospitalization increased from 4 (3 hypervolemia, 1 mechanical) to 20 (12 infectious, 3 mechanical; 5 hypervolemia) episodes during telehealth assistance, representing 26% to 59% of total hospitalizations. IRR for PD-related hospitalization was 5.5 (CI 95% 1.8 C 16.4). CONCLUSION: After telehealth implementation, the risk of hospitalization raised significantly, mainly due to PD-relates causes that increased 5.5 times. Potential causes of this finding are lack of proper training for distance monitoring to patients and health care workers, life habits and routine of care modifications and social isolation.

The purpose of this study is to characterize the CT findings of 30 children from mainland China who had laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Although recent American College of Radiology recommendations assert that CT should not be used as a screening or diagnostic tool for patients with suspected COVID-19, radiologists should be familiar with the imaging appearance of this disease to identify its presence in patients undergoing CT for other reasons. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We retrospectively reviewed the CT findings and clinical symptoms of 30 pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were seen at six centers in China from January 23, 2020, to February 8, 2020. Patient age ranged from 10 months to 18 years. Patients older than 18 years of age or those without chest CT examinations were excluded. Two cardiothoracic radiologists and a cardiothoracic imaging fellow characterized and scored the extent of lung involvement. Cohen kappa coefficient was used to calculate interobserver agreement between the readers. RESULTS. Among children, CT findings were often negative (77%). Positive CT findings seen in children included ground-glass opacities with a peripheral lung distribution, a crazy paving pattern, and the halo and reverse halo signs. There was a correlation between increasing age and increasing severity of findings, consistent with reported symptomatology in children. Eleven of 30 patients (37%) underwent follow-up chest CT, with 10 of 11 examinations (91%) showing no change, raising questions about the utility of CT in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 in children. CONCLUSION. The present study describes the chest CT findings encountered in children with COVID-19 and questions the utility of CT in the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients.","output":"CT Features of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in 30 Pediatric Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is ravaging the world.

Cholecystectomy lends itself well to a SILS approach. As these procedures have become more widely adapted, it is important to determine the approximate learning curve to decrease two surgical endpoints: (1) time to completion of the procedure; and (2) decreased incidence of conversion. METHODS We prospectively reviewed our series of 50 cholecystectomies done using the SILS approach between May 2008 to September 2008. All cases were performed by two advanced laparoscopic surgeons at a single institution. Data was collected immediately after the case and entered into an Excel database. Cases were performed by insufflating the abdomen with a Veress needle through the umbilicus followed by placement of 5-mm ports at the umbilicus. RESULTS Patient ages ranged between 21 and 82 years with a median age of 45 years. Body mass index (BMI) range was 21 to 42 kg/m with a mean of 30 kg/m. Average length of time for cases was 1 hour 9 minutes with a range between 55 minutes and 120 minutes. The average length of time for the first 25 cases was 80 minutes. When compared with cases 26 to 50 the average length of time was 60 minutes (P<0.05). The conversion rate to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy was 10%. Conversion was accomplished through the addition of a 5-mm port elsewhere on the abdominal cavity. After the tenth case, the incidence of conversion went down to zero. When conversions were further stratified, they occurred within each individual surgeon's first ten cases. CONCLUSIONS The learning curve for successful consistent completion of SILS cholecystectomy cases appears to be after 25 cases. In addition, conversion rates drop dramatically after the first ten cases.","output":"Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy learning curve experience seen in a single institution."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"2020 is definitely a year that will be remembered in history.

Invariably, studies of adaptive divergence in urban areas examine a single or fewoften correlatedtraits at a time from populations residing only at the most extreme urban and nonurban habitats, and do not control for environment-of-origin (e.g., maternal provisioning) effects. Thus, whether urbanization is driving divergence in many traits simultaneously in a manner that varies with the degree of local urbanization remains unclear. To examine whether urbanization drives clinal multivariate trait divergence, we generated seed families of white clover (Trifolium repens) collected from 27 populations along an urbanization gradient in Toronto, Canada, and used them to measure multiple phenotypic traits in a common garden. Our results show that families whose parents were collected from the most urban populations grew larger, had larger flower petals, experienced delayed germination and flowering, had thinner stolons, had reduced cyanogenesis, and were more attractive to pollinators. Each of these traits together exhibited genetically-based changes that varied with the degree of urbanization of the source population. Field observations indicate that the pollinator community exhibits almost complete turnover between urban and nonurban sites, which potentially explains some of the observed divergence in reproductive traits.

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and lockdown resulted in an interruption in physical follow-up. In this situation, tele-follow-up may be helpful. We report the feasibility and usefulness of a telephonic follow-up in patients with TBM. METHODS: Patients with TBM managed by us from January 2017 to March 2020 were included from the TBM registry. Their presenting symptoms, and clinical and investigation findings were noted. We contacted these patients telephonically and their clinical status was obtained using a questionnaire. Based on the telephonic information, outcomes were categorized as death, poor or good. Patients with the new medical problems were advised as to relevant investigations and the reports were obtained through WhatsApp for prescribing treatment. RESULTS: The telephone numbers of 103 of 144 (71.5%) patients were viable. Twenty-seven (26.2%) patients died, 15 (19.7%) had a poor outcome and 61 (80.2%) had a good outcome. Twenty-five (32.9%) patients had new medical problems: 18 TBM related and 7 TBM unrelated. The medical problems of 23 patients could be managed telephonically and only 3 (4%) patients needed a physical visit. Sixty-five (85.5%) patients happily answered the questionnaire and willing responders needed a treatment modification more frequently than the reluctant responders (p=0.008). Patients on active antitubercular treatment needed treatment modification more frequently (80% vs 21.3%).

METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic test strategies (RIDT, DIA, NAAT, clinical judgement, batch polymerase chain reaction) preceding treatment; no diagnostic testing and treating everyone; and not treating anyone. We modeled high-risk 65-year old patients from a health payer perspective and accrued outcomes over a patient's lifetime. We reported health outcomes, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), healthcare costs, and net health benefit (NHB) to measure cost-effectiveness per cohort of 100,000 patients. RESULTS: Treating everyone with no prior testing was the most cost-effective strategy, at a cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000/QALY, in over 85% of simulations. This strategy yielded the highest NHB of 15.0344 QALYs, but inappropriately treats all patients without influenza. Of the novel rapid diagnostics, NAAT resulted in the highest NHB (15.0277 QALYs), and the least number of deaths (1,571 per 100,000). Sensitivity analyses determined that results were most impacted by the pretest probability of ILI being influenza, diagnostic test sensitivity, and treatment effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our model, treating high-risk patients presenting to hospital with influenza-like illness, without performing a novel rapid diagnostic test, resulted in the highest NHB and was most cost-effective. However, consideration of whether treatment is appropriate in the absence of diagnostic confirmation should be taken into account for decision-making by clinicians and policymakers.","output":"Point-of-care diagnostic tests for influenza in the emergency department: A cost-effectiveness analysis in a high-risk population from a Canadian perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monitoring the mutation and evolution of the virus is important for tracing its ongoing transmission and facilitating effective vaccine development A total of 342 complete genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed in this study Compared to the reference genome reported in December 2019, 465 mutations were found, among which, 347 occurred in only 1 sequence, while 26 occurred in more than 5 sequences For these 26 further identified as SNPs, 14 were closely linked and were grouped into 5 profiles Phylogenetic analysis revealed the sequences formed 2 major groups Most of the sequences in late period (March and April) constituted the Cluster II, while the sequences before March in this study and the reported S/L and A/B/C types in previous studies were all in Cluster I The distributions of some mutations were specific geographically or temporally, the potential effect of which on the transmission and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 deserves further evaluation and monitoring Two mutations were found in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) but outside the receptor-binding motif (RBM), indicating that mutations may only have marginal biological effects but merit further attention The observed novel sequence divergence is of great significance to the study of the transmission, pathogenicity, and development of an effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2","output":"Analysis of Continuous Mutation and Evolution on Circulating SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To fight coronavirus disease 2019, non-pharmaceutical interventions were adopted all over the world.

Specifically, we encode user posts using two levels of attention mechanisms applied at the tweet-level and word-level, calculate each tweet and words importance, and capture semantic sequence features from the user timelines (posts). Our hierarchical attention model is developed in such a way that it can capture patterns that leads to explainable results. Our experiments show that MDHAN outperforms several popular and robust baseline methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining deep learning with multi-aspect features. We also show that our model helps improve predictive performance when detecting depression in users who are posting messages publicly on social media.

This work seeks to estimate the prevalence of cannabinoid abuse among Egyptian university students and explore the associated risk factors. A cross-sectional study was carried out over 3 months (1st of JulyC1st of October 2020) and included 2380 students. Participants were subjected to a pre-designed self-administered questionnaire that included demographic data, Addiction Severity Index, and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. Among the participating students, 4.9% of them reported cannabinoid abuse and 41% reported smoking cigarettes. The most used substances were hashish (96.5%), Strox (41.3%), Bhang (34.4%), voodoo (34.4%), and Tramadol (31.1%). Gender and social status were also significantly related to rates of substances abuse; most illicit drug users were males (93.1%), and the majority was of low (41.3%) or moderate (50.8%) socioeconomic status.

In medical schools, the COVID-19 pandemic required a complete switch to e-learning without any direct patient contact despite early reports showing that medical students preferred face-to-face teaching in clinical setting. We designed close to real-life patient e-learning modules to transmit competency-based learning contents to medical students and evaluated their responses about their experience. METHODS: Weekly e-learning cases covering a 10-week leading symptom-based curriculum were designed by a team of medical students and physicians. The internal medicine curriculum (HeiCuMed) at the Heidelberg University Medical School is a mandatory part of clinical medical education in the 6(th) or 7(th) semester. Case-design was based on routine patient encounters and covered different clinical settings: preclinical emergency medicine, in-patient and out-patient care and follow-up. Individual cases were evaluated online immediately after finishing the respective case. The whole module was assessed at the end of the semester. Free-text answers were analyzed with MaxQDa following Mayring\`s principles of qualitative content analyses. RESULTS: N = 198 students (57.6% female, 42.4% male) participated and 1252 individual case evaluations (between 49.5% and 82.5% per case) and 51 end-of-term evaluations (25.8% of students) were collected.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in study population. Number of undetected cases. RESULTS: 1538 students and 507 teachers were initially enrolled, and 1334 students and 445 teachers completed both study visits.

Since January 2020, Taiwan has introduced both NPIs but their effectiveness on non-COVID-19 respiratory viruses (NCRVs) remain underexplored. Methods This retrospective observational study examined electronic records at a tertiary hospital in northern Taiwan from pre-COVID (JanuaryCDecember 2019) to post-COVID period (JanuaryCMay 2020). Patients with respiratory syndromes were tested for both enveloped (e.g. influenza virus and seasonal coronavirus) and non-enveloped RVs (e.g. enterovirus and rhinovirus) using multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. Monthly positivity rates of NCRVs among adult and pediatric patients were analyzed with comparison between pre- and post-COVID periods. Results A total of 9693 patients underwent 12127 multiplex RT-PCR tests. The average positivity rate of NCRVs reduced by 11.2% (25.6% to 14.4%) after nationwide PHIs. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the most commonly identified enveloped and non-enveloped viruses were influenza virus and enterovirus/rhinovirus, respectively. Observed reduction in NCRV incidence was predominantly contributed by enveloped NCRVs including influenza viruses. We did not observe epidemiological impacts of NPIs on non-enveloped viruses but an increasing trend in enterovirus/rhinovirus test positivity rate among pediatric patients. Our data were validated using Taiwans national notification database. Conclusions Our frontline investigation suggests that the current NPIs in Taiwan might not effectively control the transmission of non-enveloped respiratory viruses, despite their protective effects against influenza and seasonal coronavirus.

The oral absorption of Chios Mastic gum (an insoluble polymer of poly-?-myrcene is among the most abundant contents) is poor due to its low water-solubility. We report in this study, two different Chios mastic gum extracts, the acidic mastic gum extract-AMGE-and the neutral one-NMGE, both prepared after removal of the contained polymer in order to ameliorate solubility and enhance in vivo activity. Liposomes are presented as a promising delivery system due to their physicochemical and biophysical properties to increase stability and absorption efficiency of the mastic gum extracts within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The aim of this study was to evaluate the stability in GI simulated conditions together with cytotoxic and antimicrobial activity of the two extracts (AMGE and NMGE) after encapsulation in a well characterized liposome formulation. Liposomes-AMGE complex showed an improved stability behavior in GI simulated conditions. Both assayed extracts showed significant dose dependent inhibition against the growth of liver cancer HepG2 cells and an interesting antimicrobial activity against several microorganisms. Conclusively, encapsulation could be evaluated as a beneficial procedure for further applications of mastic resin.","output":"Study of Stability, Cytotoxic and Antimicrobial Activity of Chios Mastic Gum Fractions (Neutral, Acidic) after Encapsulation in Liposomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article documents the reconstructed domestic masculinity of a retired Chinese man during the COVID-19 quarantine period in China.

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has likely impacted autism diagnostic services. This study investigated professionals' experiences of, and thoughts about: (1) how autism diagnostic assessments were conducted before the pandemic; (2) adaptations to service provision because of the pandemic; and (3) challenges, risks, advantages and opportunities associated with autism assessments conducted via online platforms (telehealth). METHOD: Fifty-two professionals, based in different autism diagnostic services and working with children, adolescents and/or adults, completed an online cross-sectional survey in August and September 2020. This comprised demographic questions (about professionals' roles and experiences), and closed and open questions about service provision and telehealth autism assessments. RESULTS: There was substantial variation in how autism assessments were conducted prior to and during the pandemic; for example, in relation to the number of professionals involved in the assessment and types of structured, semi-structured and unstructured measures used to conduct this. Fifty-two percent of participants (n = 27) reported some service disruption (e.g., full closure, substantial reduction in provision, and/or pausing of in person appointments). Waiting times for assessment had become longer for 58% of services (n = 30), due to pandemic-related disruption. Six themes emerged from thematic analysis of open responses: (1) the autism diagnostic pathway, pre-pandemic; (2) initial impact of the pandemic on service delivery; (3) conducting autism assessments during the pandemic; (4) working remotely; (5) improving service design and delivery; and (6) post-diagnostic support. Views about the accessibility, validity, and reliability of conducting telehealth autism assessments were polarized. Some participants considered this efficient, flexible, and adequate; others viewed this as unethical and inappropriate. What constitutes good practice in telehealth autism assessments remains unclear, but there is a general openness to using this method (potentially in a hybrid telehealthin person model), provided rigor and standardization are enhanced. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has potentially compounded existing bottlenecks to the autism diagnostic pathway. Future research should seek to improve timeliness, standardization, accessibility and robustness of this pathway, and the validity and reliability of telehealth autism assessments.","output":"Autism Diagnostic Assessments With Children, Adolescents, and Adults Prior to and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Survey of Professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the influence of COVID-19 on China's agricultural economy and the Chinese government's emergency measures to ease the economic impacts of viral spread can offer urgently-needed lessons while this virus continues to spread across the globe.

METHODS: We used healthcare data for the population of the southernmost region in Sweden (1.4 million inhabitants). We did an interrupted time-series analysis to estimate changes in rates and trends of joint replacements (JR), arthroscopies, and fracture surgeries for knee or hip in AprilCDecember 2020 compared to pre-COVID-19 levels adjusting for seasonal variations. RESULTS: We found a drop of 54% (95% CI 42%; 68%) and 42% (95% CI 32%; 52%), respectively, in the rate of JRs and arthroscopies in April 2020 when compared to the counterfactual scenario. This was followed by an increase that brought the rates of JRs and arthroscopies back to their predicted levels also during the beginning of the second wave (NovemberCDecember 2020). Acute fracture surgeries were largely unaffected, i.e. did not show any decrease as observed for the other surgeries. CONCLUSIONS: In southern Sweden, we observed a marked decrease in elective knee and hip surgeries following the first wave of Covid-19.

All tested individuals were judged in advance by public health centers for the necessity of undergoing the test with possible contact history and/or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. In this study, to identify the predictors of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity for more efficient and evidenced selection of suspected individuals, we enrolled 3,540 consecutive individuals, tested in the first 7 months of the testing program, with data regarding to the history of close contact with COVID-19 patients, including those involved in cluster outbreaks. This cohort included 284 foreign students (257 males and 27 females) from a vocational school involved in the largest cluster outbreak in the area. Close contact history was present in 952 (26.9%) of the participants. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results showed that 164 participants (4.6%) were positive and 3,376 participants (95.4%) were negative for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene (N2). In the univariate and multivariate analyses, history of close contact with COVID-19 patients, higher age, cough symptoms, and non-native ethnicity were predictors for SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. However, the significance of age and foreign nationality disappeared or declined upon excluding the foreign students from the aforementioned largest cluster outbreak.

In our country, the data about coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) among healthcare professionals are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence in healthcare professionals, to evaluate the risks they encountered during work, and to examine their relationships with antibody positivity. A total of 572 healthcare professionals serving in various units of our hospital participated in our study and the presence of anti-nucleocapsid IgG was investigated by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (SARS-CoV-2 IgG test, Abbott Laboratories Diagnostics, USA) method in serum samples collected between May 18, 2020 and June 30, 2020.

Even though some microorganisms represent no threat to healthy people, hospitals harbor different levels of immunocompetent individuals, namely patients receiving immunosuppressors, with previous infections, or those with extremes of age (young children and elderly), requiring the implementation of effective control measures. Public spaces have also been found an important source of infectious disease outbreaks due to poor or none infection control measures applied. In both places, surfaces play a major role on microorganisms propagation, yet they are very often neglected, with very few guidelines about efficient cleaning measures and microbiological assessment available. To overcome surface contamination problems, new strategies are being designed to limit the microorganisms ability to survive over surfaces and materials. Surface modification and/or functionalization to prevent contamination is a hot-topic of research and several different approaches have been developed lately. Surfaces with anti-adhesive properties, with incorporated antimicrobial substances or modified with biological active metals are some of the strategies recently proposed. This review intends to summarize the problems associated with contaminated surfaces and their importance on infection spreading, and to present some of the strategies developed to prevent this public health problem, namely some already being commercialized.","output":"Self-disinfecting surfaces and infection control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Studies have reported the worsening of psychiatric symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies have evaluated the impact on the access to mental health services during COVID-19. Our aim was to analyze temporal trends and prediction of appointments held in Brazil's public health system, to compare the observed and expected number of mental healthcare appointments during the COVID-19 pandemics. METHODS: An ecological time-series study was performed, analyzing mental health appointments before and during the pandemic (from 2016 and 2020) from the Brazilian governmental database. The structural break in the data series was assessed using the Chow test, with the break considered in March 2020. Bayesian structural time-series models were used to estimate current average appointments and the predicted expectation if there was no pandemic. FINDINGS: Compared to the expected, between March and August 2020 about 28% less outpatient appointments in mental health were observed, totaling 471,448 individuals with suspended assistance. Group appointments and psychiatric hospitalizations were also severely impacted by the pandemic (decreased of 68% and 33%, respectively). On the other hand, mental health emergency consultations and home care increased during this period (36% and 52%, respectively). INTERPRETATION: Our findings demonstrate a dramatic change in mental health assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic, which corroborates a recent WHO survey. This phenomenon can aggravate the mental health crisis and generate a parallel pandemic that may last for a longer time than the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of Science databases to identify any reported cases of maternal, fetal or neonatal mortality associated with COVID-19 infection. The references of relevant studies were also hand-searched. RESULTS: Of 2815 studies screened, 10 studies reporting 37 maternal and 12 perinatal mortality cases (7 fetal demise and 5 neonatal death) were finally eligible for inclusion to this review. All maternal deaths were seen in women with previous co-morbidities, of which the most common were obesity, diabetes, asthma and advanced maternal age. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severity of pneumonia were considered as the leading causes of all maternal mortalities, except for one case who died of thromboembolism during postpartum period. Fetal and neonatal mortalities were suggested to be a result of the severity of maternal infection or the prematurity, respectively. Interestingly, there was no evidence of vertical transmission or positive COVID-19 test result among expired neonates. CONCLUSION: Current available evidence suggested that maternal mortality mostly happened among women with previous co-morbidities and neonatal mortality seems to be a result of prematurity rather than infection.

Similar results were obtained for other human coronaviruses. Conversely, in the SARS-CoV-2 population, epitopes for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were not more variable than non-epitope positions.

We have isolated and characterized revertants of ts24, a member of the A complementation group of Sindbis HR mutants, that we had demonstrated previously to have a temperature-sensitive defect in the regulation of minus-strand synthesis. These revertants of ts24 replicated efficiently at 40 but nevertheless retained the temperature sensitive defect in the regulation of minus-strand synthesis: they continued to synthesize minus strands late in the replication cycle at 40 but not at 30 and in the presence or absence of protein synthesis. Although failure to regulate the synthesis of minus strands resulted in continuous minus-strand synthesis and in the accumulation of minus strands, the rate of plus-strand synthesis was not increased concertedly. Minus strands synthesized after the rate of plus-strand synthesis had become constant were demonstrated to be utilized as templates for 26 S mRNA synthesis. Thus, the change from an increasing to a constant rate of plus-strand synthesis during the alphavirus replication cycle cannot be governed solely by the number of minus strands that accumulate in infected cells. We present a model for the preferential utilization of minus strands as a mechanism for the cessation of minus-strand synthesis that occurs normally during alphavirus replication.","output":"The effect of loss of regulation of minus-strand RNA synthesis on sindbis virus replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) for studying regulation of gene transcription requires an internal template-loading control or a housekeeping gene to guarantee the validity of the data collection, analysis, and interpretation.

Typhimurium) causes gastroenteritis and diarrhea in humans and food-producing animals. The type III secretion system (T3SS) has been known to be a potent virulence mechanism by injecting effector proteins into the cytosol of host cells. S. Typhimurium encodes two T3SSs by Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2. Previous studies showed that T3SS shared a potent virulence mechanism and molecular structure among several gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, T3SS has been identified as an attractive target in the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of bacterial infections. Several studies reported that small-molecule compounds are able to inhibit functions of bacterial T3SSs. A small molecule, C24H17ClN4O2S, has been shown the ability to inhibit the activity of Yersinia pestis T3SS ATPase, YscN, resulting to block the secretion of effector proteins. In this study, we studied the effects and mechanism for SPI-1 T3SS inhibition of this compound in S. Typhimurium. RESULTS We demonstrated that this compound prohibited the secretion of effector proteins from Salmonella via SPI-1 T3SS at 100 M. As the result, bacterial invasion ability into epithelial cell cultures was reduced. In contrast with previous study, the C24H17ClN4O2S molecule did not inactivate the activity of SPI-1 T3SS ATPase, InvC, in Salmonella. However, we studied the global cellular effects of S. Typhimurium after being treated with this compound using a quantitative proteomic technique. These proteomic results showed that the main SPI-1 transcription regulator, InvF, and two effector proteins, SipA and SipC, were reduced in bacterial cells treated with the compound. CONCLUSIONS It may explain that action of the small-molecule compound, C24H17ClN4O2S, for blocking the secretion of SPI-1 T3SS in Salmonella is through inhibition of SPI-1 regulator, InvF, expression. Further studies are necessary to identify specific mechanisms for inhibition between this small-compound and InvF SPI-1 regulator protein.","output":"A small molecule, C24H17ClN4O2S, inhibits the function of the type III secretion system in Salmonella Typhimurium."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivos A pandemia causada pelo COVID-19 tem sido um desafio para diferentes servi?os incluindo o banco de sangue (BS), impactando negativamente e for?ando, governos e agncias regulatrias a desenvolverem protocolos para garantir a seguran?a do doador e estratgias para suprir a necessidade de hemocomponentes.

The primary organ targeted by the virus is the pulmonary system, leading to interstitial pneumonia and subsequent oxygen dependency and morbidity. Computed tomography (CT) has been used by various centers as an imaging modality for the assessment of severity of lung involvement in individuals. Two popular systems of scoring lung involvement on CT are CT semiquantitative score (SQ) and CT severity score (CT-SS), both of which assess extent of pulmonary involvement by interstitial pneumonia and are partly based upon subjective evaluation. Our cross-sectional observational study aims to assess the interobserver reliability of these scores, as well as to assess the statistical correlation between the respective CT scores to severity of clinical outcome. Results: Both the SQ and CT-SS scores showed an excellent interobserver reliability (ICC 0.91 and 0.93, respectively, p &lt; 0.05). The CT-SS was marginally more sensitive (99.2%) in detecting severe COVID pneumonia than SQ (86.5%). The positive predictive value of SQ (98.3%) is more than CT-SS (78%) for detecting severe disease. The similarity of interobserver reliability obtained for both scores reiterates the respective cutoff CT scores proposed by the above systems, as 18 for SQ and 19.5 for CT-SS. Conclusion: Both the SQ and CT-SS scores display excellent interobserver reliability. The CT-SS was more sensitive in detecting severe COVID pneumonia and may thus be preferred over the SQ as an initial radiological tool in predicting severity of infection.","output":"Assessment of interobserver reliability and predictive values of CT semiquantitative and severity scores in COVID lung disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged every aspect of ones life, especially in the education setting.

It also (3) tested the significant difference of the mean assessment of the module when grouped according to profile so that the educators will know how to contextualize the gamified module for its possible improvement. Notwithstanding, the concluded integration of the aspects of the module in terms of the format, content, and gamified features were all highly received positively by the 279 purposive-conveniently sampled respondents who participated from a local college in Laguna and a state university in Manila from the College of Education. The format, content, and gamified features of the module were all with high regards, however, with some notable remarks including the module cover, color, and template, insufficiency of the illustrative examples, and the improvement of progress tracker, badges, incentive system, and the game-based activities related to the lessons. Also, there is no statistical difference in the perceived use of the gamified module in many areas implied that there is a consistent presentation of the three areas whether in the different institution, age brackets, sex orientation, year levels, degree program, and course taken except those of the format since education courses were oriented to instructional materials standards gave them the ability to assess it more comprehensively.

Lower overall positivity was observed in the SARI vs ILI surveillance and influenza prevalence was higher in outpatients (45.0% vs 6.7%), while RSV exhibited the reverse (4.8% vs 23.8%). Respiratory infections in general were more common in children than in adults (54.4% vs 29.5%), although children were significantly less affected by influenza (11.5% vs 22.7%). None of the respiratory viruses displayed a clear seasonal pattern, and viral interference was observed between RSV and influenza. CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive information presented for Suriname, including first data on non\\\\influenza respiratory viruses, displayed distinct differences between the viruses, in seasonality, within age groups and between SARI/ILI, accentuating the need, especially for tropical LMIC countries to continue ongoing surveillance and accumulate local data.","output":"Epidemiology of respiratory viruses in patients with severe acute respiratory infections and influenza\\\\like illness in Suriname"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the evolution of US mortgage credit supply during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the mortgage market experienced a historic boom in 2020, we show there was also a large and sustained increase in intermediation markups that limited the pass-through of low rates to borrowers. Markups typically rise during periods of peak demand, but this historical relationship explains only part of the large increase during the pandemic. We present evidence that pandemic-related labor market frictions and operational bottlenecks contributed to unusually inelastic credit supply, and that technology-based lenders, likely less constrained by these frictions, gained market share. Rising forbearance and default risk did not significantly affect rates on plain vanilla conforming mortgages, but it did lead to higher spreads on mortgages without government guarantees and loans to the riskiest borrowers. Mortgage-backed securities purchases by the Federal Reserve also supported the flow of credit in the conforming segment.","output":"How Resilient Is Mortgage Credit Supply?

Further gains in equity and timeliness have proven even more challenging. The challenge: With the emergence of \\"service-oriented\\" systems, complexity science, the challenges of climate change, the growth of social media and the internet and the new reality of COVID-19, the original domains proposed by the IOM invite reflection on their relevance and possibility for improvement. The possible solution: In this paper we propose a revised model of quality that is built on never-ending learning and includes new domains, such as Ecology and Transparency, which reflect the changing worldview of healthcare. We also introduce the concept of person- or \\"kin-centred care\\" to emphasise the shared humanity of people involved in the interdependent work. This is a more expansive view of what \\"person-centredness\\" began. The delivery of health and healthcare requires people working in differing roles, with explicit attention to the lived realities of the people in the roles of professional and patient.

METHODS: Patients less than 1 month of age were randomized to receive either reconstituted fresh whole blood (n = 31) or standard blood component therapy (n = 33) to prime the bypass circuit and for transfusion during the 24 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass. Primary outcome was chest tube drainage; secondary outcomes included transfusion needs, inotrope score, ventilation time, and hospital length of stay. RESULTS: Patients who received reconstituted fresh whole blood had significantly less postoperative chest tube volume loss per kilogram of body weight (7.7 mL/kg vs 11.8 mL/kg; P = .03). Standard blood component therapy was associated with higher inotropic score (6.6 vs 3.3; P = .002), longer ventilation times (164 hours vs 119 hours; P = .04), as well as longer hospital stays (18 days vs 12 days; P = .006) than patients receiving reconstituted fresh whole blood.

However, no drug has been approved to treat COVID-19. Furthermore, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on this viral spike protein, as well as several other important parts of this virus, have recently undergone mutations, resulting in new virus variants. While no treatment is currently available, a naturally derived molecule with known antiviral properties could be used as a potential treatment. Bromelain is an enzyme found in the fruit and stem of pineapples. This substance has been shown to have a broad antiviral activity. In this article, we analyse the ability of bromelain to counteract various variants of the SARS-CoV-2 by targeting bromelain binding on the side of this viral interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation approaches. We have succeeded in making three-dimensional configurations of various RBD variants using protein modelling. Bromelain exhibited good binding affinity toward various variants of RBDs and binds right at the binding site between RBDs and hACE2. This result is also presented in the modelling between Bromelain, RBD, and hACE2. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study revealed significant stability of the bromelain and RBD proteins separately up to 100 ns with an RMSD value of 2 ?. Furthermore, despite increases in RMSD and changes in Rog values of complexes, which are likely due to some destabilized interactions between bromelain and RBD proteins, two proteins in each complex remained bonded, and the site where the two proteins bind remained unchanged. This finding indicated that bromelain could have an inhibitory effect on different SARS-CoV-2 variants, paving the way for a new SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor drug.

From 27 March to 4 April, 2020, we prospectively collected saliva samples and a standard nasopharyngeal and throat swab in persons seeking care at an acute respiratory infection clinic in a university hospital during the outbreak of COVID-19. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed, and the results of the two specimens were compared. Results. Two-hundred pairs of the samples were collected. Sixty-nine (34.5%) patients were male, and the median (interquartile) age was 36 (28-48) years. Using nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR as the reference standard, the prevalence of COVID-19 diagnosed by nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR was 9.5%. The sensitivity and specificity of the saliva sample RT-PCR were 84.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 79.2%-89.3%], and 98.9% (95% CI 97.5-100.3%), respectively.

From the Nextstrain global database, we identified prevalent mutations of S-RBD of SARS-CoV-2 from December 2019 to April 2021. Pre- and post-vaccination time series forecasting models were developed based on the prediction of neutralizing antibody affinity scores for S-RBD of the variants. RESULTS: the proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant in North America is growing rapidly, but the rate will reduce due to high affinity (~90%) to the neutralizing antibody once herd immunity is reached. Currently, the rates of isolation of B. 1.351, B.1.617, and P.1 variants are slowly increasing in North America. Herd immunity is able to relatively control these variants due to their low affinity (~70%) to the neutralizing antibody. The S-RBD of B.1.617 has a 110% increased affinity score to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) in comparison to the wild-type structure, making it highly infectious. CONCLUSION: The newly emerged B.1.351, B.1.617, and P.1 variants escape from vaccine-induced neutralizing immunity and continue circulating in North America in post- herd immunity era.

This study examines how news of presence of COVID-19 in Thailand, as well as varying levels of government restriction on movement, affected human mobility in a rural Thai population along the border with Myanmar. METHODS: This study makes use of mobility data collected using a smartphone app. Between November 2019 and June 2020, four major events concerning information dissemination or government intervention give rise to five time intervals of analysis. Radius of gyration is used to analyze movement in each interval, and movement during government-imposed curfew. Human mobility network visualization is used to identify changes in travel patterns between main geographic locations of activity. Cross-border mobility analysis highlights potential for intervillage and intercountry disease transmission. RESULTS: Inter-village and cross-border movement was common in the pre-COVID-19 period. Radius of gyration and cross-border trips decreased following news of the first imported cases. During the government lockdown period, radius of gyration was reduced by more than 90% and cross-border movement was mostly limited to short-distance trips. Human mobility was nearly back to normal after relaxation of the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into the impact of the government lockdown policy on an area with extremely low socio-economic status, poor healthcare resources, and highly active cross-border movement. The lockdown had a great impact on reducing individual mobility, including cross-border movement.

METHODS: We analyzed transcriptome-weighted codon and codon pair usage based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-seq data from 6427 solid tumor samples and 632 normal tissue samples. This dataset represents 32 cancer types affecting 11 distinct tissues. Our analysis focused on tissues that give rise to multiple solid tumor types and cancer types that are present in multiple tissues. RESULTS: We identified distinct patterns of synonymous codon usage changes for different cancer types affecting the same tissue. For example, a substantial increase in GGT-glycine was observed in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), and mixed invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma (IDLC) of the breast. Change in synonymous codon preference favoring GGT correlated with change in synonymous codon preference against GGC in IDC and IDLC, but not in ILC. Furthermore, we examined the codon usage changes between paired healthy/tumor tissue from the same patient. Using clinical data from TCGA, we conducted a survival analysis of patients based on the degree of change between healthy and tumor-specific codon usage, revealing an association between larger changes and increased mortality. We have also created a database that contains cancer-specific codon and codon pair usage data for cancer types derived from TCGA, which represents a comprehensive tool for codon-usage-oriented cancer research. CONCLUSIONS: Based on data from TCGA, we have highlighted tumor type-specific signatures of codon and codon pair usage. Paired data revealed variable changes to codon usage patterns, which must be considered when designing personalized cancer treatments. The associated database, CancerCoCoPUTs, represents a comprehensive resource for codon and codon pair usage in cancer and is available at https://dnahive.fda.gov/review/cancercocoputs/. These findings are important to understand the relationship between tRNA supply and codon demand in cancer states and could help guide the development of new cancer therapeutics.

We aimed to formulate an applicable epidemiological model to accurately predict and forecast the impact of local outbreaks of COVID-19 to guide the local healthcare demand and capacity, policy-making and public health decisions. METHODS: The model utilized the aggregated daily COVID-19 situation reports (including counts of daily admissions, discharges and bed occupancy) from the local National Health Service (NHS) hospitals and COVID-19-related weekly deaths in hospitals and other settings in Sussex (population 1.7 million), Southeast England. These data sets corresponded to the first wave of COVID-19 infections from 24 March to 15 June 2020. A novel epidemiological predictive and forecasting model was then derived based on the local/regional surveillance data. Through a rigorous inverse parameter inference approach, the model parameters were estimated by fitting the model to the data in an optimal sense and then subsequent validation. RESULTS: The inferred parameters were physically reasonable and matched up to the widely used parameter values derived from the national data sets by Biggerstaff M, Cowling BJ, Cucunub ZM et al. (Early insights from statistical and mathematical modeling of key epidemiologic parameters of COVID-19, Emerging infectious diseases. 2020;26(11)). We validate the predictive power of our model by using a subset of the available data and comparing the model predictions for the next 10, 20 and 30 days. The model exhibits a high accuracy in the prediction, even when using only as few as 20 data points for the fitting. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that by using local/regional data, our predictive and forecasting model can be utilized to guide the local healthcare demand and capacity, policy-making and public health decisions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the local population. Understanding how future COVID-19 spikes/waves could possibly affect the regional populations empowers us to ensure the timely commissioning and organization of services. The flexibility of timings in the model, in combination with other early-warning systems, produces a time frame for these services to prepare and isolate capacity for likely and potential demand within regional hospitals. The model also allows local authorities to plan potential mortuary capacity and understand the burden on crematoria and burial services. The model algorithms have been integrated into a web-based multi-institutional toolkit, which can be used by NHS hospitals, local authorities and public health departments in other regions of the UK and elsewhere. The parameters, which are locally informed, form the basis of predicting and forecasting exercises accounting for different scenarios and impacts of COVID-19 transmission.","output":"Predicting and forecasting the impact of local outbreaks of COVID-19: use of SEIR-D quantitative epidemiological modelling for healthcare demand and capacity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: In the face of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, people with dementia and their carers are contending with serious challenges to their health and wellbeing, due to risk of severe illness, limiting of social contact and disruption to usual activities. Many forms of support for people with dementia and their carers, including singing groups, have moved online using videoconferencing. Previous research has demonstrated the benefits of group singing, which include cognitive stimulation, meaningful activity and peer support. However, although we know which aspects of the singing group experience participants find helpful, we do not know how this experience translates into an online videoconferencing format, and this is a very new field with little existing research. This article reviews the literature pertinent to online singing interventions and uses the findings to develop some suggestions for running an online singing group. STUDY DESIGN: SCOPING REVIEW. METHODS: Systematic literature searches were conducted in EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Owing to the paucity of existing research, searches were also conducted in Google Scholar. The scope of the review covered five related areas: online music making and music therapy, telemedicine and telecare, everyday technology for people with dementia, digital arts and dementia, and use of technology for social interaction and leisure. Our analysis aimed to integrate the results to inform the implementation of online singing groups for people with dementia. RESULTS: Scoping of evidence from discrete fields of enquiry and different disciplinary traditions can inform the delivery of online singing in dementia. This literature also yields useful insights into the role of the carer and how best to support participants to use technology. Barriers and facilitators to online singing were found to relate both to the technology and to the individual participant. CONCLUSION: Lockdown restrictions have led to much innovation, and this is likely to lead to changes in practice even after normal life resumes. The suggestions in this article will be helpful primarily for practitioners moving into online work and researchers investigating this novel area. They may also be useful to commissioners and policymakers because they reflect current knowledge about best practice.","output":"Online singing groups for people with dementia: scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with severe mental illnesses (SMI) were at high risk of infection during Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

The data was collected using questionnaires assessing sociodemographic, clinical characteristics, knowledge and health beliefs. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with mammogram uptake. The prevalence of screening mammograms was 46.0%. About 45.5% of women with high breast cancer risk had never undergone a mammogram. Older participants, aged 50 to 74 (OR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.05, 6.29, p-value = 0.039) and those who received a physicians recommendation (OR = 7.61, 95% CI: 3.81, 15.20, p-value < 0.001) were more likely to undergo screening mammography. Significant health beliefs associated with mammogram uptake were perceived barriers (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67, 0.97, p-value = 0.019) and cues to action (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.59, p-value = 0.012).

MethodsWe analyzed samples from 168 Japanese healthcare workers who had completed two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. We analyzed immunoglobulin G (IgG) index values against spike protein (SP) using automated chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay system AIA-CL and analyzed the background factors affecting antibody titer.

Lack of health insurance coverage and inadequate coverage are important reasons for high out-of-pocket health expenditures. There are many Public Health Insurance Programs offered by the Government that cover the cost of hospitalization for the people below poverty line (BPL), but their coverage is still not complete. The objective of this research is to examine the effect of Public Health Insurance Programs for the Poor on hospitalizations and inpatient Out-of-Pocket costs. METHODS Data from the recent national survey by the National Sample Survey Organization, Social Consumption in Health 2014 are used. Propensity score matching was used to identify comparable non-enrolled individuals for individuals enrolled in health insurance programs. Binary logistic regression model, Tobit model, and a Two-part model were used to study the effects of enrolment under Public Health Insurance Programs for the Poor on the incidence of hospitalizations, length of hospitalization, and Out-of- Pocket payments for inpatient care. RESULTS There were 64,270 BPL people in the sample. Individuals enrolled in health insurance for the poor have 1.21 higher odds of incidence of hospitalization compared to matched poor individuals without the health insurance coverage. Enrollment under the poor people health insurance program did not have any effect on length of hospitalization and inpatient Out-of-Pocket health expenditures. Logistic regression model showed that chronic illness, household size, and age of the individual had significant effects on hospitalization incidence. Tobit model results showed that individuals who had chronic illnesses and belonging to other backward social group had significant effects on hospital length of stay. Tobit model showed that days of hospital stay, education and age of patient, using a private hospital for treatment, admission in a paying ward, and having some specific comorbidities had significant positive effect on out-of-pocket costs. CONCLUSIONS Enrolment in the public health insurance programs for the poor increased the utilization of inpatient health care. Health insurance coverage should be expanded to cover outpatient services to discourage overutilization of inpatient services. To reduce out-of-pocket costs, insurance needs to cover all family members rather than restricting coverage to a specific maximum defined.","output":"Effect of health insurance program for the poor on out-of-pocket inpatient care cost in India: evidence from a nationally representative cross-sectional survey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancerous tumours contain a rare subset of cells with stem-like properties that are termed cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are defined by their ability to divide both symmetrically and asymmetrically, to initiate new tumour growth and to tolerate the foreign niches required for metastatic dissemination. Accumulating evidence suggests that tumours arise from cells with stem-like properties, the generation of CSCs is therefore likely to be an initiatory event in carcinogenesis. Furthermore, CSCs in established tumours exist in a dynamic and plastic state, with non-stem tumour cells thought to be capable of de-differentiation to CSCs. The regulation of the CSC state both during tumour initiation and within established tumours is a desirable therapeutic target and is mediated by epigenetic factors. In this review we will explore the epigenetic parallels between induced pluripotency and the generation of CSCs, and discuss how the epigenetic regulation of CSCs opens up novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

This scoping review focused on answering key questions about the focus, quality and generalisability of the quantitative evidence on the determinants of adherence to social distancing measures in research during the first wave of COVID-19. METHODS This scoping review is pre-registered with Open Science Framework, and the protocol has been published. Literature searches were conducted using online databases and grey literature sources. Screening, data extraction and quality appraisal was conducted by members of the research team, with discrepancies resolved by consensus discussion. Quality appraisal was conducted using the Cochrane's ROBINS-I tool, the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist. The potential determinants of adherence to social distancing measures examined in the included studies were coded to domains and constructs of the Theoretical Domains Framework. RESULTS The review included 84 studies. The majority of included studies were conducted in Western Europe and the USA. Many lacked theoretical input, were at risk for bias, and few were experimental in design. The most commonly coded domains of the TDF in the included studies were 'Environmental Context and Resources' (388 codes across 76 studies), 'Beliefs about Consequences' (34 codes across 21 studies), 'Emotion' (28 codes across 12 studies), and 'Social Influences' (26 codes across 16 studies). The least frequently coded TDF domains included 'Optimism' (not coded), 'Intentions' (coded once), 'Goals' (2 codes across 2 studies), 'Reinforcement' (3 codes across 2 studies), and 'Behavioural Regulation' (3 codes across 3 studies). CONCLUSIONS Examining the focus of the included studies identified few studies using experimental designs to test methods of increasing adherence to social distancing measures and a lack of studies on potentially important determinants of adherence such as reinforcement, goal setting and self-monitoring.

Our initial analysis revealed that 18.3% of patients who met screening criteria had an appropriately ordered LDCT scan, with an 8.7% completion rate. The aim of this study was to improve lung ca screening compliance following the USPSTF guidelines among residents from the University of Connecticut Internal Medicine (IM) residency program at a Clinic in Hartford, Connecticut. Methods: Care provided to patients by an IM resident at the Gengras Clinic were included. After initial data was gathered, we implemented an intervention to improve screening compliance between October 2019 and March 2020, when SARS-CoV-2 pandemic occurred and routine services were interrupted. USPSTF screening guidelines were emailed monthly to residents and attendings;they were reminded of the importance of lung ca screening;updating the pack-year smoking history;as well as instructions on correctly ordering LDCT and documenting shared decision making, which is needed for insurance approval. In-person reminders also occurred at the clinic. Results: Post-intervention, 601 charts were reviewed. 168/601 (27%) patients met screening criteria. 433 patients were excluded due to unclear packyear, did not meet screening criteria, were deceased or last seen at the clinic prior to the intervention. 63/168 (37.5%) met the criteria and had an appropriately ordered LDCT;51/168 (30.35%) had a completed LDCT in chart. The remaining 12/168 (7.14%) with an appropriately ordered LDCT, had it scheduled at the time of data collection or it had been cancelled for unclear reasons. 20 patients' LDCT was ordered by their pulmonologist. 94 (62.5%) who met screening criteria did not have a LDCT ordered. 11 patients with a smoking history, who did not meet screening criteria had a LDCT ordered because of clinical suspicion for cancer. Lastly, 4/168 (2.4%) had a diagnosis of personal history of lung ca. Conclusions: After our educational intervention, patients who qualified had an increase of LDCT being ordered (37.5% from 18.3%) and completed (30.3% from 8.7%). This is, to our knowledge, the first study of its kind. We identified areas of improvement that were key to achieving higher screening rates: educating all residents and attendings on lung ca screening guidelines;educating patients on the importance of undergoing screening tests;creating a best practice advisory in the electronic medical record system that reminds provider to input pack-year smoking history and if the criteria for screening is met, a pop-up prompting the provider to order LDCT;obtaining insurance approval;and lastly, stressing the importance on screening and overall outcomes.","output":"Post-intervention lung cancer screening compliance among internal medicine resident physicians at a primary care clinic in Hartford, Connecticut"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since December 2019 the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been burdening all health systems worldwide.

Body plethysmography, lung diffusion capacity (DLco), blood gas analysis (ABG), 6-min walk test (6MWT), echocardiography, and laboratory tests were performed. Quality of life (QoL), depression, and anxiety were assessed using validated questionnaires. RESULTS: 33 patients with severe disease were included. Patients were discharged without prophylactic anticoagulation. At follow-up there were no thromboembolic complications in any patient. 11 patients (33%) had dyspnea, 11 (33%) had cough, and 15 (45%) suffered from symptoms of fatigue. Pulmonary function tests including ABG did not reveal any limitations (TLC: median=94% of predicted {IQR:85-105}; VC: 93% {78-101}; FEV1: 95% {72-103}; FEV1/FVC 79% {76-85}; PaO2: 72 mmHg {67-79}; PaCO2: 38 mmHg {35-38}), except for slightly reduced DLco (77% {69-95}). There were no echocardiographic impairments. 6MWT distance was reduced in most patients without oxygen desaturation. According to standardized questionnaires, patients suffered from reduced QoL, mainly due to decreased mobility (SGRQ activity score: 54 {19-78}). There were no indicators for depression or anxiety (PHQ-9: 7 {4-11}, GAD-7: 4 {1-9}, respectively).

A few reports from the literature suggest that Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVSTs) may be a direct complication of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical and radiological presentation of COVID-19 positive patients diagnosed with CVST. METHODS: This was a multicenter, cross-sectional, retrospective study of patients diagnosed with CVST and COVID-19 reviewed from March 1, 2020 to November 8, 2020. We evaluated their clinical presentations, risk factors, clinical management, and outcome. We reviewed all published cases of CVST in patients with COVID-19 infection from January 1, 2020 to November 13, 2020. RESULTS: There were 8 patients diagnosed with CVST and COVID-19 during the study period at 7 out of 31 participating centers. Patients in our case series were mostly female (7/8, 87.5%). Most patients presented with non-specific symptoms such as headache (50%), fever (50%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (75%). Several patients presented with focal neurologic deficits (2/8, 25%) or decreased consciousness (2/8, 25%). D-dimer and inflammatory biomarkers were significantly elevated relative to reference ranges in patients with available laboratory data. The superior sagittal and transverse sinuses were the most common sites for acute CVST formation (6/8, 75%). Median time to onset of focal neurologic deficit from initial COVID-19 diagnosis was 3 days (interquartile range 0.75-3 days). Median time from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to CVST radiologic diagnosis was 11 days (interquartile range 6-16.75 days). Mortality was low in this cohort (1/8 or 12.5%).

A molecular assay for accurate and rapid detection of RV and SARS-CoV-2 is crucial to manage these infections. Here, we compared the analytical performance and clinical reliability of Allplex? SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV (SC2FabR;Seegene Inc., Seoul, South Korea) kit with those of four commercially available RV detection kits. Upon testing five target viral strains (SARS-CoV-2, FluA, FluB, RSV A, and RSV B), the analytical performance of SC2FabR was similar to that of the other kits, with no significant difference (p  0.78) in z-scores. The efficiency of SC2FabR (E-value, 81C104%) enabled reliable SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal RV detection in 888 nasopharyngeal swab specimens processed using a fully automated nucleic acid extraction platform. BlandCAltman analyses revealed an agreement value of 95.4% (SD  1.96) for the kits, indicating statistically similar results for all five. In conclusion, SC2FabR is a rapid and accurate diagnostic tool for both SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal RV detection, allowing for high-throughput RV analysis with efficiency comparable to that of commercially available kits.

Despite many advances in our understanding of these diseases, the direct mechanism through which tau contributes to neurodegeneration remains poorly understood. Previously, our laboratory implicated the histone demethylase LSD1 in tau-induced neurodegeneration by showing that LSD1 localizes to pathological tau aggregates in Alzheimer's disease cases, and that it is continuously required for the survival of hippocampal and cortical neurons in mice. Here, we utilize the P301S tauopathy mouse model to demonstrate that pathological tau can exclude LSD1 from the nucleus in neurons. In addition, we show that reducing LSD1 in these mice is sufficient to highly exacerbate tau-mediated neurodegeneration and tau-induced gene expression changes. Finally, we find that overexpressing LSD1 in the hippocampus of tauopathy mice, even after pathology has formed, is sufficient to significantly delay neurodegeneration and counteract tau-induced expression changes. These results suggest that inhibiting LSD1 via sequestration contributes to tau-mediated neurodegeneration.

An important feature of syndecan-1 related to its role in pathologies is that it can be shed from the surface of cells as an intact ectodomain composed of the extracellular core protein and attached heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains. Shed syndecan-1 remains functional and impacts cell behavior both locally and distally from its cell of origin. Shedding of syndecan-1 is initiated by a variety of stimuli and accomplished predominantly by the action of matrix metalloproteinases. The accessibility of these proteases to the core protein of syndecan-1 is enhanced, and shedding facilitated, when the heparan sulfate chains of syndecan-1 have been shortened by the enzymatic activity of heparanase. Interestingly, heparanase also enhances shedding by upregulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinases. Recent studies have revealed that heparanase-induced syndecan-1 shedding contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of cancer and viral infection, as well as other septic and non-septic inflammatory states.

First, admission serum ionized calcium (iCa) and total calcium (tCa) levels were analyzed as continuous variables using restricted cubic spline Cox regression models to evaluate the possible nonlinear relationship between serum calcium and mortality. Second, patients with CS were assigned to four groups according to the quartiles (Q1-Q4) of serum iCa and tCa levels, respectively.

The activation of proliferation by 10 g/mL PTX was also supported by the increase of cMyc-MAX heterodimer and -catenin-TCF1 complex in double IP-HPLC. 10 g/mL PTX enhanced FAS-mediated apoptosis but diminished p53-mediated apoptosis, and downregulated many angiogenesis proteins (angiogenin, VEGF-A, and FLT4), but upregulated HIF1, VEGFR2, and CMG2 reactively. Whereas, 300 g/mL PTX consistently decreased proliferation, epigenetic modification, RAS and NFkB signaling, neuromuscular and osteoblastic differentiation, but increased apoptosis, ER stress, and fibrosis compared to 10 g/mL PTX. These data suggest PTX has different biological effect on RWA 264.7 cells depending on the concentration of 10 g/mL and 300 g/mL PTX. The low dose 10 g/mL PTX enhanced RAS/NFkB signaling, proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation, particularly, it stimulated neuromuscular and osteoblastic differentiation, innate immunity, and cell-mediated immunity, but attenuated ER stress, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and chronic inflammation, while the high dose 300 g/mL PTX was found to alleviate the 10 g/mL PTX-induced biological effects, resulted in the suppression of RAS/NFkB signaling, proliferation, neuromuscular and osteoblastic differentiation, and inflammation.","output":"Pentoxifylline-induced protein expression change in RAW 264.7 cells as determined by immunoprecipitation-based high performance liquid chromatography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the real estate markets enter a period of uncertainty associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, it is useful to consider how the valuation discipline coped with previous times of uncertainty.

It makes explicit what is implicit in the standard valuation formula V = I  R and quantifies the effect of changes over time of I (net operating income) and R (overall capitalization rate). The Delta Valuation Model is a useful tool for quantifying changing market conditions in the absence of adequate local-market sales data. When local-market sales data do exist, they can also serve as a test of reasonableness. Such data provide a way to separate and account for the influence of macroeconomic forces and microeconomic (or local) sources.

To prepare for the second wave, it is vital to anticipate caseload demand, and thus, the number of required hospital beds for admitted cases and plan interventions through scenario analysis. In the present study, we analyzed the first wave data by age group so that the age-specific number of hospital admissions could be projected for the second wave. Because the age-specific patterns of the epidemic were different between urban and other areas, we analyzed datasets from two distinct cities: Osaka, where the cases were dominated by young adults, and Hokkaido, where the older adults accounted for the majority of hospitalized cases. By estimating the exponential growth rates of cases by age group and assuming probable reductions in those rates under interventions, we obtained projected epidemic curves of cases in addition to hospital admissions. We demonstrated that the longer our interventions were delayed, the higher the peak of hospital admissions. Although the approach relies on a simplistic model, the proposed framework can guide local government to secure the essential number of hospital beds for COVID-19 cases and formulate action plans.","output":"Hospital Caseload Demand in the Presence of Interventions during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Modeling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Selama masa pandemi COVID-19 pemerintah menghimbau masyarakat untuk melakukan social distancing dalam aktivitas sosialnya atau menjaga jarak selama aktivitas sosialnya.

To date, the effects of chronic VA excess (VAE) on spermatogenesis remains unclear. OBJECTIVE This study aims to investigate the long-term excessive intake of VA effects on spermatogenesis in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS Dams were initially fed a control diet (4 IU/g) or a VAE diet (250 IU/g), 4 weeks prior to matting and during pregnancy. Dams and their male pups continued this diet regimen until the offspring reached 12 weeks of age. At 12 weeks of age, epididymis caudal spermatozoa and testes were collected. For histological analysis, sections were stained with periodic acid-Schiff-hematoxylin, and quantitative PCR was used to detect changes in gene expression in the testes of the VAE mice. Sperm motility and morphology were evaluated to detect the endpoint of VAE toxicity. RESULTS Body weights were not significantly different between the control and VAE groups. Testicular cross-sections from the control and VAE mice contained a normal array of germ cells, and the daily sperm production was similar between the two groups. However, the percentage of seminiferous tubules in stages VII and VIII was significantly lower in the VAE mice than in the control. In addition, significant changes in the expression of genes involved in retinoid metabolism, spermatogenesis, and spermiogenesis were detected in the testes of the VAE mice. Consistently, sperm motility and head morphology were significantly impaired in the VAE mice. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that long-term dietary intake of VAE were able to influence both pre- and post-meiotic spermatogenesis.

Here, we monitored the SARS-CoV-2 specific immune response in convalescent coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients up to 15 months after symptoms onset. MethodsThe levels of anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain antibodies and neutralizing activities were tested in a total of 188 samples from 136 convalescent patients who experience mild to critical COVID-19. Specific memory B and T cell responses were measured in 76 peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from 54 patients. Twenty-three vaccinated individuals were included for comparison. FindingsFollowing a peak at day 15-28 post-infection, the IgG antibody response and plasma neutralizing titers gradually decreased over time but stabilized after 6 months. Plasma neutralizing activity against G614 was still detected in 87% of the patients at 6-15 months. Compared to G614, the median neutralizing titers against Beta, Gamma and Delta variants in plasma collected at early (15-103 days) and late (9-15 month) convalescence were 16- and 8-fold lower, respectively. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B and T cells reached a peak at 3-6 months and persisted in the majority of patients up to 15 months although a significant decrease in specific T cells was observed between 6 and 15 months. ConclusionThe data suggest that antiviral specific immunity especially memory B cells in COVID-19 convalescent patients is long-lasting, but some variants of concern, including the fast-spreading Delta variant, may at least partially escape the neutralizing activity of plasma antibodies.

METHODS: We sampled shared-bicycle handles and saddles from five selected locations in a metropolis (Chengdu, China, n = 98) and used surrounding air deposition samples as controls (n = 12). Full-length ITS sequencing and multiple bioinformatic analyses were utilized to reveal fungal community structures and differences. RESULTS: Aspergillus was dominant on both the handles and saddles of shared bicycles, and Alternaria and Cladosporium were the most abundant families in the air samples. Significant differences in fungal community structures were found among the three groups. The handle samples contained higher abundances of Aureobasidium melanogenum and Filobasidium magnum than the saddle and air samples. The saddle samples had a higher abundance of Cladosporium tenuissimum than the other two sample types (P < 005). A higher abundance of fungal animal pathogens on shared-bicycle surfaces than in air by FUNGuild (P < 005). Moreover, the co-occurrence network of fungi on handles was more stable than that on saddles. CONCLUSION: There were more potential pathogens, including Aspergillus pseudoglaucus, Aureobasidium melanogenum, Kazachstania pintolopesii, Filobasidium magnum, Candida tropicalis, and Malassezia globose were found on shared bicycles than in air, suggesting that hands should not contact mucous membrane after cycling, especially in susceptible individuals, and hygiene management of shared bicycles should be given more attention by relevant organizations worldwide.

Orthologs of these proteins are widely present in fungi, but to which extent one protein can be replaced by its ortholog is less well understood. Here, interspecies complementation was carried out to evaluate the functional homology of Ste5 and associated kinases in Kluyveromyces lactis, K. marxianus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These three species occupy important positions in the evolution of hemiascomycetes. Results indicated that Ste5 and associated kinases in K. lactis and K. marxianus could be functionally replaced by their orthologs to different extents. However, the extent of sequence identity, either between full-length proteins or between domains, did not necessarily indicate the extent of functional replaceability. For example, Ste5, the most unconserved protein in sequence, achieved the highest average functional replaceability. Notably, swapping Ste5 between K. lactis and K. marxianus significantly promoted mating in both species and the weakened interaction between the Ste5 and Ste7 might contribute to this phenotype. Consistently, chimeric Ste5 displaying a higher affinity for Ste7 decreased the mating efficiency, while chimeric Ste5 displaying a lower affinity for Ste7 improved the mating efficiency. Furthermore, the length of a negatively charged segment in the Ste7-binding domain of Ste5 was negatively correlated with the mating efficiency in K. lactis and K. marxianus. Extending the length of the segment in KlSte5 improved its interaction with Ste7 and that might contribute to the reduced mating efficiency. Our study suggested a novel role of Ste5-Ste7 interaction in the negative regulation of the pheromone pathway.

Here, the objective was to document the potency of various booster vaccine formulations in macaques previously vaccinated with mRNA or protein subunit vaccine candidates. We show that one booster dose of AS03-adjuvanted CoV2 preS dTM, D614 (parental) or B.1.351 (Beta), in monovalent or bivalent (D614 + B.1.351) formulations, significantly boosted pre-existing neutralizing antibodies and elicited high and stable cross-neutralizing antibodies covering the four known SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta) and, unexpectedly, SARS-CoV-1, in primed macaques. Interestingly, the non-adjuvanted CoV2 preS dTM B.1.351 vaccine formulation also significantly boosted and broadened the neutralizing antibody responses.

However, within virus orders and families, strong conservation of gene order is observed. The factors that constrain or promote gene-order diversity are largely unknown, although the regulation of gene expression is one important constraint for viruses. Here we investigate why gene order is conserved for a positive-strand RNA virus encoding a single polyprotein in the context of its authentic multicellular host. Initially, we identified the most plausible trajectory by which alternative gene orders could evolve. Subsequently, we studied the accessibility of key steps along this evolutionary trajectory by constructing two virus intermediates: (1) duplication of a gene followed by (2) loss of the ancestral gene. We identified five barriers to the evolution of alternative gene orders. First, the number of viable positions for reordering is limited. Second, the within-host fitness of viruses with gene duplications is low compared to the wild-type virus. Third, after duplication, the ancestral gene copy is always maintained and never the duplicated one. Fourth, viruses with an alternative gene order have even lower fitness than viruses with gene duplications. Fifth, after more than half a year of evolution in isolation, viruses with an alternative gene order are still vastly inferior to the wild-type virus. Our results show that all steps along plausible evolutionary trajectories to alternative gene orders are highly unlikely. Hence, the inaccessibility of these trajectories probably contributes to the conservation of gene order in present-day viruses.","output":"Multiple Barriers to the Evolution of Alternative Gene Orders in a Positive-Strand RNA Virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Deaf community consists of a diverse group of individuals with varied languages (i.e. American Sign Language, English, etc.), community affiliations (i.e. Deaf culture, general community, etc.), and sociocultural norms (Anderson et al., 2018).

Significant disparities exist in access to and utilization of behavioral health services among Deaf individuals due to limited access to health information, fear and mistrust in healthcare settings, cultural and linguistic oppression, fear of stigmatization within the Deaf community, communication barriers, and a lack of culturally appropriate services (Barnett et al., 2011;Fellinger et al., 2012).

Data were analysed using generalised estimating equations. Monthly HFSS snacks portion intake increased from pre-pandemic levels (48.3) in May-June (57.6, p<0.001), decreased in August-September (43.7, p<0.001), before increasing back to pre-pandemic levels in November-December (49.2, p<0.001). 48.5% self-reported increased (25.9 [95% confidence interval: 24.1, 27.8]) and 47.7% self-reported decreased (24.1 [22.4,26.0]) monthly HFSS snacks portion intakes in November-December compared with pre-pandemic levels.

Within less than a year after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, vaccines had received emergency approvals and vaccination campaigns were initiated. AREAS COVERED: We discuss the several factors that led to the unprecedented, accelerated development and approval of COVID-19 vaccines, which includes optimization of processes by regulatory authorities, redesign of sequential development processes, learnings from previous pandemics, and prior development of novel vaccine platforms. EXPERT OPINION: Despite unanticipated and complex challenges presented by real-time vaccine development in the context of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent ever-changing landscape of public health measures and recommendations, important milestones were reached within extraordinarily short periods and, following roll-out to billions worldwide, the approved vaccines have proven to be well tolerated and effective. Whilst this is an exceptional feat and an example of what can be achieved with collaboration and innovation, there are lessons that can still be learned, including the need for further harmonization between regulatory authorities, modes to react to the pandemics ever-evolving challenges, and ensuring equitable vaccine access among low-income countries.","output":"Clinical development and approval of COVID-19 vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Question: What is the median time to clearance of SARS-CoV-2 among cancer patients according to currently used criteria?

The presence of a polybasic furin-cleavage site (FCS) in spike, and evolution towards an optimised FCS by dominant variants of concern (VOCs), are linked to enhanced infectivity and transmission. Guanylate binding proteins (GBP) are interferon-inducible restriction factors that target furin-mediated processing of viral envelope proteins and limit infectivity. Here we investigated whether GBPs restrict SARS-CoV-2 infection, and whether VOCs have evolved spikes that escape restriction. We show that GBP2 and 5 interfere with cleavage of the spike proteins of Wuhan-Hu-1, Alpha, Delta and Omicron, consistent with furin inhibition by GBPs. However, while GBP2/5 restrict Wuhan-Hu-1 infectivity, Alpha and Delta escape restriction. GBP exposure in producer cells influences viral entry route into target cells, with a shift towards endosomal entry. We therefore investigated whether GBP-targeting of spike alters sensitivity to endosomal restriction factors, IFITMs. We find IFITM1, but not IFITM 2 or 3, inhibit infection of naturally-permissive epithelial cells by early-lineage SARS-CoV-2, as well as Alpha and Delta, however GBPs did not sensitise to IFITM restriction. Strikingly, we find Omicron is unique amongst VOCs, being sensitive to restriction by GBP2/5, and also IFITM1, 2 and 3. We conclude evolution of Alpha and Delta spikes have conferred resistance to GBP restriction, but this is not solely due to acquisition of an enhanced FCS. Notably, Omicron, which has evolved under different selective pressures, has selected for changes in spike that not only mediate antibody escape, and shift in cell tropism and entry, but also impact the sensitivity of Omicron to innate immunity, potentially contributing to altered pathogenesis.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike evolution influences GBP and IFITM sensitivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the rise of COVID-19, the sustainability of air transport is a major challenge, as there is limited space in aircraft cabins, resulting in a higher risk of virus transmission In order to detect possible chains of infection, technology-supported apps are used for social distancing These COVID-19 applications are based on the display of the received signal strength for distance estimation, which is strongly influenced by the spreading environment due to the signal multipath reception Therefore, we evaluate the applicability of technology-based social distancing methods in an aircraft cabin environment using a radio propagation simulation based on a three-dimensional aircraft model We demonstrate the susceptibility to errors of the conventional COVID-19 distance estimation, which can lead to large errors in the determination of distances and to the impracticability of traditional tracing approaches during passenger boarding/deboarding In the context of the future connected cabin, a robust distance measurement must be implemented to ensure safe travel Finally, our results can be transferred to similar fields of application, e g , trains or public transport ? 2020 by the authors Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland","output":"Evaluation of technology-supported distance measuring to ensure safe aircraft boarding during covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The acoustic melt stream velocity field, total force, and trajectory of fluorescent particles in the plasticizing chamber were analyzed using finite element simulation to investigate the acoustic streaming and mixing characteristics in ultrasonic plasticization micro-injection molding (UPMIM).

DESIGN: A 19-question international, cross-sectional survey on thrombolytic use in pulmonary embolism was developed, validated, and administered. A multivariable logistic regression was conducted to determine factors predictive of utilization of thrombolytics in the setting of cardiac arrest secondary to pulmonary embolism. SETTING: International survey study. SUBJECTS: Physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and other healthcare professionals who were members of the Society of Critical Care Medicine. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thrombolytic users were compared with nonusers. Respondents (n = 272) predominately were physicians (62.1%) or pharmacists (30.5%) practicing in an academic medical center (54.8%) or community teaching setting (24.6%). Thrombolytic users (n = 177; 66.8%) were compared with nonusers (n = 88; 33.2%) Thrombolytic users were more likely to work in pulmonary/critical care (80.2% thrombolytic use vs 59.8%; p < 0.01) and emergency medicine (6.8% vs 3.5%; p < 0.01). Users were more likely to have an institutional guideline or policy in place pertaining to the use of thrombolytics in cardiac arrest (27.8% vs 13.6%; p < 0.01) or have a pulmonary embolism response team (38.6% vs 19.3%; p < 0.01).

DESIGN A national cross-sectional self-report survey. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. STUDY SAMPLE Sixty-two Australia-based hearing healthcare clinicians, with experience working in an adult rehabilitation setting. RESULTS Clinicians appeared to positively view the provision of group audiological rehabilitation services, yet were limited in their ability to deliver these services due to organisational barriers. Although some organisational barriers were non-modifiable by the clinician (such as group AR services not prioritised within their workplace, a lack of support from colleagues/managers, lack of resources, and a lack of funding for the delivery of group AR services), others were within the clinicians' ability to change (such as habit formation for recommending these services during clinical appointments). Participants expressed a desire for resources to assist them in delivering group AR, including downloadable lesson plans and information sheets for clients, clinician training videos and client educational videos. Clinicians called for increased diversity in program offerings, specifically relating to the emotional, relational and social impacts of hearing loss. CONCLUSIONS These results provide a framework for the development of interventional studies to increase the utilisation of group audiological rehabilitation services.","output":"Barriers and facilitators to delivery of group audiological rehabilitation programs: a survey based on the COM-B model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in early 2020 has brought with itself major morbidity and mortality. It has increased hospital occupancy, heralded economic turmoil, and the rapid transmission and community spread have added to the burden of the virus. Most of the patients are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute hypoxic respiratory failure often secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Based on the limited data available, there have been different opinions about the respiratory mechanics of the ARDS caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our article provides an insight into COVID-19 pathophysiology and how it differs from typical ARDS. Based on these differences, our article explains the different approach to ventilation in COVID-19 ARDS compared to typical ARDS. We critically analyze the role of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and proning in the ICU patients. Through the limited data and clinical experience are available, we believe that early proning in COVID-19 patients improves oxygenation and optimal PEEP should be titrated based on individual lung compliance.","output":"Role of proning and positive end-expiratory pressure in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modeling the behavior of zoonotic pandemic threats is a key component of their control. Many emerging zoonoses, such as SARS, Nipah, and Hendra, mutated from their wild type while circulating in an intermediate host population, usually a domestic species, to become more transmissible among humans, and this transmission route will only become more likely as agriculture and trade intensifies around the world. Passage through an intermediate host enables many otherwise rare diseases to become better adapted to humans, and so understanding this process with accurate mathematical models is necessary to prevent epidemics of emerging zoonoses, guide policy interventions in public health, and predict the behavior of an epidemic. In this paper, we account for a zoonotic disease mutating in an intermediate host by introducing a new mathematical model for disease transmission among three species. We present a model of these disease dynamics, including the equilibria of the system and the basic reproductive number of the pathogen, finding that in the presence of biologically realistic interspecies transmission parameters, a zoonotic disease with the capacity to mutate in an intermediate host population can establish itself in humans even if its R(0) in humans is less than 1. This result and model can be used to predict the behavior of any zoonosis with an intermediate host and assist efforts to protect public health.","output":"Mathematically modeling spillovers of an emerging infectious zoonosis with an intermediate host"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Outpatient psychotherapeutic care (private practice) in Austria is regulated financially through the cost subsidy regulation and health insurance funded psychotherapy hours. The present study examines the proportion of self-financed and health insurance funded psychotherapy units between the years 2017C2020, considering the socio-economic-/disease- and treatment related status of patients. A sample of 6387 inpatients with a mental illness was surveyed during inpatient treatment. The majority (70%) of inpatients had suffered from a mental illness for more than two years and had previously received inpatient (46%) or outpatient (82%) psychotherapeutic treatment. Of the patients with prior outpatient psychotherapeutic treatment, 45% received a health insurance funded psychotherapy. Of the patients who self-financed psychotherapy, the majority of patients (72%) paid up to  100 for psychotherapeutic treatmentwith 70% of patients who were unable to work prior inpatient treatment and 39% of patients whose monthly income is less than  1000. The study data also show that the number of patients who have been able to use health insurance funded psychotherapy has not increased since 2017. The present study illustrates that the use of outpatient psychotherapy and health insurance funded psychotherapy amongst patients with chronic mental illnesses remained unchanged in the last four years, despite the increase in the health insurance subsidy in 2018 and any increases in health insurance funded psychotherapy hours. Given the limited health insurance funded psychotherapy hours, a transparent system for the allocation of health insurance funded psychotherapy hours is required to enable the use of outpatient psychotherapy for all patients with chronic mental illnesses.","output":"Psychotherapeutische Versorgung in ?sterreich: Kassenfinanzierte Psychotherapie fr Menschen mit chronisch psychischen Erkrankungen im Jahresvergleich 2017 bis 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug delivery systems involving polymer therapeutics enhance drug potency by improved solubility and specificity and may assist in circumventing chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer (PC).

From March until late April, the number of cases increased exponentially. The delivery of anti-cancer therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic was extremely challenging. In order to balance the benefits of continuing anti-cancer therapy with the associated increased hospital visits, combined with the risk of COVID-19 infection, we undertook a series of system changes in the delivery of cancer care. METHODS: Patients who attended our dayward over a 4-month period were included. Data were obtained from patient and chemotherapy prescribing records. Patients were screened for symptoms of COVID-19 at two separate timepoints: prior to their visit via telephone, and using a symptom questionnaire on arrival at the hospital. If patients displayed COVID-19 symptoms, they were isolated and a viral swab arranged. RESULTS: A total of 456 patients attended from January 1st to April 30th. The numbers of visits from January to April were 601, 586, 575, and 607, respectively. During this period, there were 2369 patient visits to the dayward and 1953 (82%) intravenous regimens administered. Of the 416 visits that did not lead to treatment, 114 (27%) were scheduled non-treatment review visits, 194 (47%) treatments were held due to disease-related illness, and 108 (26%) treatments were held due to treatment-related complications. Screening measurements were implemented on March 18th due to rising COVID-19 prevalence in the general population. Overall, 53 treatments were held due to the screening process: 19 patients (36%) elicited COVID-19 symptoms via telephone screening; 34 patients (64%) were symptomatic in our pre-assessment area and referred for swabs, of which 4 were positive. Those with a negative swab were rescheduled for chemotherapy the following week.

Published results are inconclusive, possibly due to differences in participant comorbidities and sociodemographic backgrounds. Since ACEI and ARB are frequently used anti-hypertension medications, we aim to determine whether the use of ACEI and ARB is associated with the occurrence and severity of COVID-19 in a large study of US Veterans with hypertension. METHODS: Data were collected from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) National Corporate Data Warehouse (VA-COVID-19 Shared Data Resource) between February 28, 2020 and August 18, 2020. Using data from 228,722 Veterans with a history of hypertension who received COVID-19 testing at the VA, we investigated whether the use of ACEI or ARB over the two years prior to the index date was associated with increased odds of (1) a positive COVID-19 test, and (2) a severe outcome (hospitalization, mortality, and use of intensive care unit (ICU) and/or mechanical ventilation) among COVID-19-positive patients. We used logistic regression with and without propensity score weighting (PSW) to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the association between ACEI/ARB use and a positive COVID-19 test result. The association between medication use and COVID-19 outcome severity was examined using multinomial logistic regression comparing participants who were not hospitalized to participants who were hospitalized, were admitted to the ICU, used a mechanical ventilator, or died. All models were adjusted for relevant covariates, including demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity), selected comorbidities, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). RESULTS: The use of ACEI significantly decreased the odds of a positive COVID-19 test among Veterans with hypertension (OR = 0.917, (0.887, 0.948) and OR = 0.926, (0.894, 0.958) with PSW). The use of ACEI, but not of ARB, was also associated with significantly increased odds of using mechanical ventilators (OR = 1.265, (1.010, 1.584) and OR = 1.210, (1.053, 1.39) with PSW) among all COVID-19 inpatients compared to outpatients. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of Veterans with hypertension, ACEI was significantly associated with decreased odds of testing positive for COVID-19. With the exception of the association of ACEI with a small non-clinically-important increase in the odds of using mechanical ventilators, neither ACEI nor ARB was found to be associated with clinical severity or mortality among COVID-19-positive Veterans. The results of this study need further corroboration and validation in other cohort samples outside the VA.","output":"The association of COVID-19 occurrence and severity with the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor blockers in patients with hypertension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe COVID-19 infection results in bilateral interstitial pneumonia, often leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis in survivors. Most patients with severe COVID-19 infections who died had developed ARDS. Currently, ARDS is treated with supportive measures, but regenerative medicine approaches including extracellular vesicle (EV)-based therapies have shown promise. Herein, we aimed to analyse whether EV-based therapies could be effective in treating severe pulmonary conditions that affect COVID-19 patients and to understand their relevance for an eventual therapeutic application to human patients. Using a defined search strategy, we conducted a systematic review of the literature and found 39 articles (2014C2020) that reported effects of EVs, mainly derived from stem cells, in lung injury models (one large animal study, none in human). EV treatment resulted in: (1) attenuation of inflammation (reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil infiltration, M2 macrophage polarization); (2) regeneration of alveolar epithelium (decreased apoptosis and stimulation of surfactant production); (3) repair of microvascular permeability (increased endothelial cell junction proteins); (4) prevention of fibrosis (reduced fibrin production). These effects were mediated by the release of EV cargo and identified factors including miRs-126, ?30b-3p, ?145, ?27a-3p, syndecan-1, hepatocyte growth factor and angiopoietin-1. This review indicates that EV-based therapies hold great potential for COVID-19 related lung injuries as they target multiple pathways and enhance tissue regeneration. However, before translating EV therapies into human clinical trials, efforts should be directed at developing good manufacturing practice solutions for EVs and testing optimal dosage and administration route in large animal models.","output":"Systematic review of extracellular vesicle-based treatments for lung injury: are EVs a potential therapy for COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND It is important to foster active participation in online graduate nursing courses through creative teaching strategies, such as virtual synchronous debates.

AIM: To analyse the mortality of older care home residents in Wales during COVID-19 lockdown and compare this across the population of Wales and the previous 4-years. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We used anonymised electronic health records and administrative data from the secure anonymised information linkage databank to create a cross-sectional cohort study. We anonymously linked data for Welsh residents to mortality data up to the 14th June 2020. METHODS: We calculated survival curves and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of mortality. We adjusted hazard ratios for age, gender, social economic status and prior health conditions. RESULTS: Survival curves show an increased proportion of deaths between 23rd March and 14th June 2020 in care homes for older people, with an adjusted HR of 172 (155, 190) compared to 2016.

This is achieved through increased community-based management supplemented by utilisation of alternative care pathways. This study aimed to undertake a national comparison of CEM services currently in operation. METHOD A data collection tool was distributed to CEM services by the Pre-Hospital trainee Operated Research Network in October 2020 which aimed to establish current practice among services in the UK and Ireland. It focused on six key sections: service aims; staffing and training; job tasking and patient selection; funding and vehicles used; equipment and medication; data collection, governance and research activity. RESULTS Seven services responded from across England, Wales and Ireland. Similarities were found with the aims of each service, staffing structures and operational times. There were large differences in equipment carried, categories of patient targeted and with governance and research activity. CONCLUSION While some national variations in services are explained by funding and geographical location, this review process revealed several differences in practice under the umbrella term of CEM.

We investigate the extent to which self-compassion accounted for the association between psychological well-being (depression, anxiety) and death anxiety in breast cancer survivors. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was applied. Participants were recruited from three departments of oncology in Zanjan, Iran. Data were collected from 210 breast cancer patients. Participants completed self-report measures. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship among the study variables. Bootstrapping analyses were used to test the significance of indirect effects. RESULTS: Correlational analyses revealed that depression and anxiety were significantly and positively related to death anxiety (r = 0.77, p < 0.01; r = 0.85, p < 0.01, respectively) and negatively to self-compassion (r = ? 0.48, p < 0.01; r = ? 0.53, p < 0.01, respectively).

Although the origin(s) of these viruses are still unknown and their occurrences in nature are mysterious, some general patterns of their pathogenesis and epidemics are noticeable. Both viruses utilize the same receptorangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)for invading human bodies. Both epidemics occurred in cold dry winter seasons celebrated with major holidays, and started in regions where dietary consumption of wildlife is a fashion. Thus, if bats were the natural hosts of SARS-CoVs, cold temperature and low humidity in these times might provide conducive environmental conditions for prolonged viral survival in these regions concentrated with bats. The widespread existence of these bat-carried or -released viruses might have an easier time in breaking through human defenses when harsh winter makes human bodies more vulnerable. Once succeeding in making some initial human infections, spreading of the disease was made convenient with increased social gathering and holiday travel. These natural and social factors influenced the general progression and trajectory of the SARS epidemiology. However, some unique factors might also contribute to the origination of SARS in Wuhan.

The purpose of this survey study is to investigate audiology services during COVID-19 pandemic to understand the current audiology service situations in Korea and to improve audiology services. Methods: A total of 120 participants (60 audiologists and 60 clients visiting audiologists) were surveyed in this study using online or face-to-face methods. The participants answered 24~25 questions including current status of audiology service, communication difficulties with wearing masks, and the provision of tele-audiology services during COVID-19. Results: The results showed that both audiologists and clients with hearing loss still preferred face-to-face audiology services in COVID-19 situation in spite of 56% of visiting schedule delay and cancellation. The primary audiology services they considered in COVID-19 were hearing aid fitting and maintenance & repair services. Wearing masks has led communication difficulties in both audiologists and clients with hearing loss due to speech level reduction, frequency filtering of sounds, and insufficient visual cues during the conversation. Only 30% of audiologists have provided tele-audiology services, and 4.4% of clients received tele-audiology services during COVID-19.

(Verbenaceae) is a widely spread plant that was traditionally used in Brazil, India, Kenya, Thailand, Mexico, Nigeria, Australia and Southeast Asia for treating several ailments including rheumatism and leprosy. Despite its historical role in relieving respiratory diseases, limited studies progressed to the plants probable inhibition to respiratory viruses especially after the striking spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory activity of different L. camara cultivars to SARS-CoV-2, that was not previously inspected, and clarify their mechanisms of action in the metabolomics viewpoint, and to determine the biomarkers that are related to such activity using UPLC-MS/MS coupled to in vitro-studies and chemometric analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chemical profiling of different cultivars was accomplished via UPLC-MS/MS. Principle component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures (OPLS) models were built using SIMCA? (multivariate data analysis software). Cytotoxicity and COVID-19 inhibitory activity testing were done followed by TaqMan Real-time RT-PCR (Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) assay that aimed to study extracts' effects on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and E-genes expression levels. Detected biomarkers from OPLS analysis were docked into potential targets pockets to investigate their possible interaction patterns using Schrodinger? suite. RESULTS: UPLC-MS/MS analysis of different cultivars yielded 47 metabolites, most of them are triterpenoids and flavonoids. PCA plots revealed that inter-cultivar factor has no pronounced effect on the chemical profiles of extracts except for L. camara, cultivar Drap d'or flowers and leaves extracts as well as for L. camara cv Chelsea gem leaves extract. Among the tested extracts, flowers and leaves extracts of L. camara cv Chelsea gem, flowers extracts of L. camara cv Spreading sunset and L. camara cv Drap d'or showed the highest selectivity indices scoring 12.3, 10.1, 8.6 and 7.8, respectively, indicating their relative high safety and efficacy. Leaves and flowers extracts of L. camara cv Chelsea gem, flowers extracts of L. camara cv Spreading sunset and L. camara cv Drap d'or were the most promising inhibitors to viral plaques exhibiting IC(50) values of 3.18, 3.67, 4.18 and 5.01 g/mL, respectively. This was incremented by OPLS analysis that related their promising COVID-19 inhibitory activities to the presence of twelve biomarkers. Inhibiting the expression of RdRp gene is the major mechanism behind the antiviral activity of most extracts at almost all concentration levels. Molecular docking of the active biomarkers against RdRp revealed that isoverbascoside, luteolin-7,4\`-O-diglucoside, camarolic acid and lantoic acid exhibited higher docking scores of ?11.378, ?10.64, ?6.72 and ?6.07 Kcal/mol, respectively, when compared to remdesivir (?5.75 Kcal/mol), thus these four compounds can serve as promising anti-COVID-19 candidates. CONCLUSION: Flowers and leaves extracts of four L. camara cultivars were recognized as rich sources of phytoconstituents possessing anti-COVID-19 activity. Combination of UPLC-MS/MS and chemometrics is a promising approach to detect chemical composition differences among the cultivars and correlate them to COVID-19 inhibitory activities allowing to pinpoint possible biomarkers. Further in-vitro and in-vivo studies are required to verify their activity.","output":"Chemical profiling and unraveling of anti-COVID-19 biomarkers of red sage (Lantana camara L.) cultivars using UPLC-MS/MS coupled to chemometric analysis, in vitro study and molecular docking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent global pandemics are generating serious problems in the elderly population and those who suffer from previous ailments When a person is infected, he / she is usually isolated from the rest of persons in his / her room to avoid transmitting the virus In most cases, especially those who live in nursing homes, often remain in bed with difficulties in moving So, their monitoring and control of evolution is sometimes difficult To solve this problem, this paper presents a non-invasive wireless mobile system to monitor elderly people in nursing homes The system is composed by an electronic device with several sensors to monitor vital signs such temperature, cough, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation and, difficulty breathing of patients and an Android application to manage the medical data Additionally, the system uses a local server to store the data and provide it to the nurses and physicians Both the application and the process of collecting data have been tested together to check the correct generation of alerts and patients' labelling of degree of urgency","output":"Non-invasive Wireless Mobile System for COVID-19 Monitoring in Nursing Homes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients who survived hospitalisation for COVID\\\\19 experienced varying durations of illness but the factors associated with prompt recovery are unknown.

METHODS: This was a retrospective study from March\\\\August 2020 of hospitalised adults with COVID\\\\19 which were grouped based on time to recovery: short (3 days), intermediate (4\\\\10 days) and prolonged (>10 days). Recovery was defined as resolution of fever, tachypnea, hypotension, extubation and return of mental status at baseline. Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate factors associated with prompt recovery. RESULTS: Among 508 patients hospitalised for COVID\\\\19, 401 (79%) survived. Of those, prompt recovery (within 3 days) was achieved in 43% (174/401), whereas 23% (92/401) recovered after a prolonged period of >10 days. Overall, median age was 64 years with 73% admitted from home and 25% from a skilled nursing facility.

The morbidity, mortality, and economic costs of these pandemics have been staggering. We desperately need a more targeted, cost-efficient, and sustainable strategy to detect and mitigate future zoonotic respiratory virus threats. Evidence suggests that the transition from an animal virus to a human pathogen is incremental and requires a considerable number of spillover events and considerable time before a pandemic variant emerges. This evolutionary view argues for the refocusing of public health resources on novel respiratory virus surveillance at humanCanimal interfaces in geographical hotspots for emerging infectious diseases. Where humanCanimal interface surveillance is not possible, a secondary high-yield, cost-efficient strategy is to conduct novel respiratory virus surveillance among pneumonia patients in these same hotspots. When novel pathogens are discovered, they must be quickly assessed for their human risk and, if indicated, mitigation strategies initiated. In this review, we discuss the most common respiratory virus threats, current efforts at early emerging pathogen detection, and propose and defend new molecular pathogen discovery strategies with the goal of preempting future pandemics.","output":"Mitigating Future Respiratory Virus Pandemics: New Threats and Approaches to Consider"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Information on the use of change management models to guide electronic medical records (EMR) implementation is limited.

Results Thirty-one relevant studies were found and included in the review. Six main themes were identified: impact of the pandemic on physical and mental health; COVID-19 concerns; access to healthcare; impact on daily and social activities; impact on physical activity; and impact on caregivers. Levels of perceived risk of COVID-19 differed across studies, but the majority of participants had adopted preventive measures such as staying at home and reducing social contacts. Participants in many studies reported a discontinuation of regular healthcare appointments and physiotherapy as well as concerns about being able to obtain medication. Loss of daily activities and social support were noted by many participants. There was mixed evidence on the impact of the pandemic on physical exercise, with some studies finding no change in physical activity and others reporting a reduction; generally, participants with reduced physical activity had poorer mental health and greater worsening of symptoms. Caregivers of people with Parkinsons were more likely to be negatively affected by the pandemic if they cared for people with complex needs such as additional mental health problems.

Since the objectivity of self-reported PA is limited in several ways, we used modern accelerometers in this study to assess the PA levels of male and female adolescents during the pandemic-related lockdown. Moreover, the association of PA with mental health of the adolescents were analyzed. A total of 136 students (76 girls, mean age of 16.28  0.97 years) from various schools in Iran wore the accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X-BT) for seven consecutive days. Mental health was measured through the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 of Lovibond and Lovibond (1995). Descriptive statistics and independent t-tests were used to analyze the PA levels of male and female students, and linear regressions were computed to examine whether PA predicts mental health status. On average, the daily time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was 18.47 min, which is clearly below the WHO guideline of at least 60 min of MVPA per day. Only 4% of adolescents showed MVPA for more than 30 min per day. Male students were significantly more active than their female peers (p = 0.015).

Not only does our model outperform other competing models, but it also supports counterfactual analysis to simulate the impact of future policies in a local setting, which is unique among existing approaches. DISCUSSION Mortality and hospitalization rates are significantly impacted by local quarantine and reopening policies. Existing models do not directly account for the effect of these policies on infection, hospitalization, and death rates in an explicit and explainable manner.

In 394 cases of suspected pneumonia, 265 (67%) had radiographs consistent with pneumonia; 34/265 had proof of bacterial etiology. Of the cases, 86.5% had received pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. In suspected pneumonia, positive chest radiography was significantly associated with increasing C-reactive protein (CRP) values, higher age, and SpO2 92% in multivariate logistic regression, OR 1.06 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.09), OR 1.09 (95% CI 1.00 to1.18), and OR 2.71 (95% CI 1.42 to 5.18), respectively. In proven pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia was significantly differentiated from viral/atypical pneumonia by increasing CRP values and SpO2 >92% in multivariate logistic regression, OR 1.09 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.14) and OR 0.23 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.82), respectively.

METHODS We conducted a systematic review of experimental studies using ketamine for the treatment of bipolar depression. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register for relevant studies published since database inception. We synthesized evidence regarding efficacy (improvement in depression rating scores) and tolerability (adverse events, dissociation, dropouts) across studies. FINDINGS We identified six studies, with 135 participants (53% female, 44.7 years, SD 11.7 years). All studies used 0.5 mg/kg of add-on intravenous racemic ketamine, with the number of doses ranging from one to six; all participants continued a mood-stabilizing agent. The overall proportion achieving a response (defined as those having a reduction in their baseline depression severity of at least 50%) was 61% for those receiving ketamine and 5% for those receiving a placebo. The overall response rates varied from 52% to 80% across studies. Ketamine was reasonably well-tolerated; however, two participants (one receiving ketamine and one receiving placebo) developed manic symptoms. Some participants developed significant dissociative symptoms at the 40-minute mark following ketamine infusion in two trials.

If such a strain emerges, and is not controlled at source [2,3], a pandemic is likely to result. Health policy in most countries will then be focused on reducing morbidity and mortality. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We estimate the expected reduction in primary attack rates for different household-based interventions using a mathematical model of influenza transmission within and between households. We show that, for lower transmissibility strains [2,4], the combination of household-based quarantine, isolation of cases outside the household, and targeted prophylactic use of anti-virals will be highly effective and likely feasible across a range of plausible transmission scenarios. For example, for a basic reproductive number (the average number of people infected by a typically infectious individual in an otherwise susceptible population) of 1.8, assuming only 50% compliance, this combination could reduce the infection (symptomatic) attack rate from 74% (49%) to 40% (27%), requiring peak quarantine and isolation levels of 6.2% and 0.8% of the population, respectively, and an overall anti-viral stockpile of 3.9 doses per member of the population. Although contact tracing may be additionally effective, the resources required make it impractical in most scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: National influenza pandemic preparedness plans currently focus on reducing the impact associated with a constant attack rate, rather than on reducing transmission. Our findings suggest that the additional benefits and resource requirements of household-based interventions in reducing average levels of transmission should also be considered, even when expected levels of compliance are only moderate.","output":"Reducing the Impact of the Next Influenza Pandemic Using Household-Based Public Health Interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivo Analisar o comportamento da tendncia na utilizao de testes rpidos da sfilis, na rede de ateno bsica em sade das capitais brasileiras, no perodo de 2019 a 2020.

Although neither air temperature nor humidity can be independently correlated with virus viability, a strong relationship between SARS-CoV-2 virulence and the specific enthalpy of moist air appears to exist, as confirmed by extensive data analysis. Given this framework, the present study involves a detailed investigation based on the first 20C30 days of the epidemic before public health interventions in 30 selected Italian provinces with rather different climates, here assumed as being representative of what happened in the country from North to South, of the relationship between COVID-19 distributions and the climatic conditions recorded at each site before the pandemic outbreak. Accordingly, a correlating equation between the incidence rate at the early stage of the epidemic and the foregoing average specific enthalpy of atmospheric air was developed, and an enthalpy-based seasonal virulence risk scale was proposed to predict the potential danger of COVID-19 outbreak due to the persistence of weather conditions favorable to SARS-CoV-2 viability. As an early detection tool, an unambiguous risk chart expressed in terms of coupled temperatures and relative humidity (RH) values was provided, showing that safer conditions occur in the case of higher RHs at the highest temperatures, and of lower RHs at the lowest temperatures.

METHODS: KIR and HLA-I genotyping and NK cell (NKc) receptors immunophenotyping in 201 symptomatic patients and 210 non-infected controls. RESULTS: NKcs with a distinctive immunophenotype, suggestive of recent activation (KIR2DS4 low CD16 low CD226 low CD56 high TIGIT high NKG2A high), expanded in patients with severe COVID-19. This was associated with a higher frequency of the functional A-telomeric activating KIR2DS4 in severe than mild/moderate patients and controls (83.7%, 55.7% and 36.2%, p&lt;7.7x10 -9). In mild/moderate patients HLA-B*15:01 was associated with higher frequencies of activating B-telomeric KIR3DS1 compared to patients with other HLA-B*15 subtypes and non-infected controls (90.9%, 42.9% and 47.3%, p&lt;0.002, Pc=0.022). This strongly suggests that HLA-B*15:01 specifically presenting SARS-CoV-2 peptides could form a neo-ligand interacting with KIR3DS1.

The current study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety and depression among United States medical students during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional, survey-based study collected demographic data as well as the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess anxiety and depression symptoms, respectively. The survey was administered from April 13, 2020 to April 28, 2020 amidst the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 1,428 students from 40 US medical schools completed the survey. From those surveyed, 30.6% and 24.3% of respondents screened positive for anxiety and depression, respectively. Median GAD-7 scores were higher among females (7.0 vs 5.0, P < .00001), pre-clinical students (7.0 vs 6.0, P < .00004), and those with a friend or relative diagnosed with Covid-19 (7.0 vs 6.0, P=.001).

Anxiety disorder was higher in rural farmers than in urban residents and lower in farmers who had medium or low income compared to high income farmers. The anxiety of farmers engaged in animal and vegetable production was significantly higher than those in mixed production, and anxiety in farmers engaged in crops production was lower than that of mixed producers. Anxiety levels were higher in livestock farmers and farmers who owned trucks.

The experiments of wound healing, immunofluorescence staining, Western blot, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining were performed to measure the inhibitory effect of the miR-214 inhibitor systematically released from the complexes against MG63, U2OS cells and xenograft tumors. Results: The systematic mechanistic elucidation of the efficient delivery of the miR-214 inhibitor by GO-PEI indicated that the inhibition of cellular miR-214 caused a decrease in osteosarcoma cell invasion and migration and an increase in apoptosis by targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). The synergistic combination of the GO-PEI-miR-214 inhibitor and CDDP chemotherapy showed significant cell death. In a xenograft mouse model, the GO-PEI-miR-214 inhibitor significantly inhibited tumor volume growth. Conclusion: This study indicates the potential of functionalized GO-PEI as a vehicle for miRNA inhibitor delivery to treat osteosarcoma with low toxicity and miR-214 can be a good target for osteosarcoma therapy.","output":"Efficient miRNA Inhibitor with GO-PEI Nanosheets for Osteosarcoma Suppression by Targeting PTEN"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic of 2019 to 2020 has resulted in multiple hospitalizations, deaths, and economic hardships worldwide.

The symptoms of a COVID-19 infection are usually mild in the healthy population below the age of 65; however, the measures laid down to prevent the spread of the virus apply typically to the whole population. Hence, those who have a low risk of severe symptoms face a social dilemma in cooperating and complying with the safety measures: Cooperating in preventing the spread of the disease is good for society but comes with individual costs. These costs provide an incentive not to cooperate with the safety measures. In this paper we analyze via structural equation modelling a sample of young adults (N = 510) who were surveyed right after the end of the first lockdown period in Switzerland. We investigate why and to what extent they cooperated in preventing the epidemic by following the recommendation to stay at home as much as possible. We hypothesize that those respondents who perceive themselves to be personally at risk, or who have relatives belonging to the risk group, complied more often with the safety measures as compared to those without severe risks. Cooperating should also be linked to individuals' pro-social orientation. Furthermore, we hypothesize that those who believe that the virus is dangerous for society or who have a personal interest in protection show higher support for the general safety measures. Our empirical results show that compliance with the coronavirus social distancing measures was generally very high during the first lockdown. Although young adults perceived themselves to be at low personal risk, they still believed that the virus is dangerous for society. Those who had a personal interest in staying at home because they had relatives belonging to the risk group complied more often with the safety measures. Overall, the results suggest that the support of the preventive measures is the most important promoter of cooperation to prevent the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Coronavirus risk perception and compliance with social distancing measures in a sample of young adults: Evidence from Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic is the biggest threat in living memory to the human race. In December 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus, officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), was first isolated from three patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases from Wuhan, China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We did a retrospective observational cohort study in the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at a tertiary teaching hospital in Mumbai. In this observational study, the study sample size was governed by the disease prevalence. COVID positive pregnant cases admitted under care of department of OBGY from 22nd April to 31st May were analyzed. RESULTS: Out of the 1245 obstetric admissions in the study duration, 148 were diagnosed as COVID positive (~12%). 9 patients had COVID related symptoms on admission. We noted only 76% of the pregnancies reached term, 17% of the patients who delivered were preterm deliveries. Cesarean section rate in COVID positive patients was 30%, compared to 38% in nonCCOVID patients in the study duration. Neonatal Outcome: 10 babies required NICU admission.

Standard treatment in these patients is to preserve the anal sphincter with restoration of intestinal function by mechanical colorectal anastomosis or coloanal anastomosis, and to maintain genitourinary function by preservation of hypogastric nerves. METHODS In order to emphasize the importance of this surgical technique in the Fourth Surgical Clinic of the CF Clinical Hospital Cluj-Napoca, we conducted a prospective observational interventional study over a 3-year period (2013-2016) in 165 patients hospitalized for rectal and rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma in various disease stages, who underwent Dixon surgery using the two techniques of manual and mechanical end-to-end anastomosis. For mechanical anastomosis, we used Covidien and Panther circular staplers. The patients were assigned to two groups, group A in which Dixon surgery with manual end-to-end anastomosis was performed (116 patients), and group B in which Dixon surgery with mechanical end-to-end anastomosis was carried out (49 patients). RESULTS Mechanical anastomosis allowed to restore intestinal continuity following low anterior resection in 21 patients with lower rectal adenocarcinoma compared to 2 patients in whom intestinal continuity was restored by manual anastomosis, with a statistically significant difference (p<0.000001). The double-row mechanical suture technique is associated with a reduced duration of surgery (121.67 minutes for Dixon surgery with mechanical anastomosis, compared to 165.931 minutes for Dixon surgery with manual anastomosis, p<0.0001). CONCLUSION The use of circular transanal staplers facilitates end-to-end anastomosis by double-row mechanical suture, allowing to perform low anterior resection in situations when the restoration of intestinal continuity by manual anastomosis is technically not possible, with the aim to preserve the anal sphincter, to restore intestinal function and maintain genitourinary function through preservation of hypogastric nerves.","output":"Mechanical suture in rectal cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A series of six novel imidazole anchored azo-imidazole derivatives (L1-L6) have been prepared by the simple condensation reaction of azo-coupled ortho-vaniline precursor with amino functionalised imidazole derivative and the synthesized derivatives (L1-L6) have been characterized by different analytical and spectroscopic techniques.

In this study, we characterised the importance of the immunodominant CSP-derived epitope, SYIPSAEKI, of Plasmodium berghei in both sporozoite- and vaccine-induced protection in murine infection models. In BALB/c mice, where SYIPSAEKI is efficiently presented in the context of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecule H-2-Kd, we established that epitope-specific CD8+ T cell responses contribute to parasite killing following sporozoite immunisation. Yet, sterile protection was achieved in the absence of this epitope substantiating the concept that other antigens can be sufficient for parasite-induced protective immunity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SYIPSAEKI-specific CD8+ T cell responses elicited by viral-vectored CSP-expressing vaccines effectively targeted parasites in hepatocytes. The resulting sterile protection strictly relied on the expression of SYIPSAEKI. In C57BL/6 mice, which are unable to present the immunodominant epitope, CSP-based vaccines did not confer complete protection, despite the induction of high levels of CSP-specific antibodies.

We show that methods based on the molecular clock tend to place the root in the B clade, while methods based on outgroup rooting tend to place the root in the A clade. The results from the two approaches are statistically incompatible, possibly as a consequence of deviations from a molecular clock or excess back-mutations.

There is limited data describing pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) preparedness and their health worker protections. AIM: To describe the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) preparedness efforts among a set of PICUs within a simulation-based network nationwide. METHODS: A cross-sectional multi-center national survey of PICU medical director(s) from childrens hospitals across the United States. The questionnaire was developed and reviewed by physicians with expertise in pediatric critical care, disaster readiness, human factors, and survey development. Thirty-five childrens hospitals were identified for recruitment through a long-established national research network. The questions focused on six themes: (1) PICU and medical director demographics; (2) Pediatric patient flow during the pandemic; (3) Changes to the staffing models related to the pandemic; (4) Use of personal protective equipment (PPE); (5) Changes in clinical practice and innovations; and (6) Current modalities of training including simulation. RESULTS: We report on survey responses from 22 of 35 PICUs (63%). The majority of PICUs were located within childrens hospitals (87%). All PICUs cared for pediatric patients with COVID-19 at the time of the survey. The majority of PICUs (83.4%) witnessed decreases in non-COVID-19 patients, 43% had COVID-19 dedicated units, and 74.6% pivoted to accept adult COVID-19 patients. All PICUs implemented changes to their staffing models with the most common changes being changes in COVID-19 patient room assignment in 50% of surveyed PICUs and introducing remote patient monitoring in 36% of the PICU units. Ninety-five percent of PICUs conducted training for donning and doffing of enhanced PPE. Even 6 months into the pandemic, one-third of PICUs across the United States reported shortages in PPE. The most common training formats for PPE were hands-on training (73%) and video-based content (82%). The most common concerns related to COVID-19 practice were changes in clinical protocols and guidelines (50%). The majority of PICUs implemented significant changes in their airway management (82%) and cardiac arrest management protocols in COVID-19 patients (68%). Simulation-based training was the most commonly utilized training modality (82%), whereas team training (73%) and team dynamics (77%) were the most common training objectives.

Methods: On April 20 (th), 2020, we search MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science and MedXriv. We used terms related to COVID-19, smell and taste disorders. We selected case series, cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies. We included studies with COVID-19 patients describing their symptoms; studies that compared smell and taste disorders between COVID-19 patients and otherwise healthy subjects; and studies comparing smell and taste disorders between COVID-19 severe and mild/moderate cases. Because of methodological heterogeneity and the limited number of results, a qualitative synthesis is presented. Results: From 31 reports, we selected six (n=2,757). Six studies reported the proportion of smell and taste disorders among COVID-19 patients. Two reports studied whether smell and taste disorders were independently associated with COVID-19 diagnosis. No reports studied the association with impaired outcomes among COVID-19 patients. The frequency of anosmia ranged between 22%-68%. The definition of taste disorders varied greatly, with dysgeusia present in 33% and ageusia in 20%. People who reported loss of smell and taste had six-fold higher odds of being COVID-19 positive; similarly, anosmia and ageusia were associated with 10-fold higher odds of COVID-19 diagnosis. Conclusions: The frequency of smell and taste disorders is as high as other symptoms, thus, at least anosmia for which the definition was more consistent, could be included in lists of COVID-19 symptoms. Although there is promising evidence, it is premature to conclude that smell and taste disorders are strongly associated with COVID-19 diagnosis.

We incorporated location-specific physical distancing measures (e.g. school closure or at work) and capture their effect on transmission dynamics. All methods have been implemented in an online application based on R Shiny and applied to COVID-19 with age-specific susceptibility and infectiousness. Using our online tool with the available social contact data, we illustrate that physical distancing could have a considerable impact on reducing transmission for COVID-19. The effect itself depends on assumptions made about disease-specific characteristics and the choice of intervention(s).","output":"SOCRATES: an online tool leveraging a social contact data sharing initiative to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION & AIM: Despite increasing interest in community-based advance care planning interventions, few studies investigate the societal impact of such initiatives. The D?Bra cards, a Swedish adaptation of the GoWish cards, were first used for advance care planning conversations in a participatory action research project and later, due to popular demand, made available for purchase by the general public. We explore how the D?Bra cards were disseminated and used publicly, to understand their impact in the community. METHODS: We used Ripple Effects Mapping to follow three dissemination ripples, based on interviews with 20 participants, analyzed with directed content analysis. FINDINGS: Key factors influencing dissemination of the D?Bra cards included champions with a mandate within their context or organization, policy documents including use of the cards, media coverage, and presentations of the cards in various settings. The D?Bra cards were adapted for use individually and in groups in different private, professional, and organizational settings. Perceived benefits of the cards included acting as an icebreaker in initiating end-of-life conversations and having preformulated statements to reflect upon. Other positive experiences included discussions on different interpretations of card statements, thus opening new perspectives regarding end-of-life. The D?Bra cards functioned both as means to raise end-of-life issues in different contexts, and as an end in themselves, for example, by facilitating advance care planning conversations for those with serious disease. Impact also included personal development and strengthening of private and professional relationships, with potential to affect end-of-life care. CONCLUSION: The broad dissemination of the D?Bra cards influenced capacity-building in dealing with end-of-life issues in communities, as the topic of dying and death was brought to agendas in new contexts.","output":"Dissemination, use, and impact of a community-based, conversational advance care planning intervention: ripple effects of the Swedish D?Bra cards"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Biden administration is sheepishly waving a checkered flag on the pandemic.

Intellectual input from various aspects is needed to fight against COVID-19, including understanding of the publics emotion and behaviour and their antecedents from the psychological perspectives. Drawing upon the cognitive appraisal theory, this study examined three cognitive appraisals (i.e., perceived severity, perceived controllability, and knowledge of COVID-19) and their associations with a wide range of emotional and behavioural outcomes among the Chinese public. METHODS: Participants were 4607 citizens (age range: 17C90 years, Mage = 23.71 years) from 31 provinces in China and they took part in a cross-sectional survey online. RESULTS: The results showed that the publics emotional and behavioural reactions were slightly affected by the outbreak of COVID-19. Moreover, the public had limited participation in the events regarding COVID-19 but actively engaged in precautionary behaviour. In addition, results of structural equation model with latent variables revealed that the three appraisals were differentially related to the outcome variables (i.e., negative emotion, positive emotion, sleep problems, aggression, substance use, mobile phone use, social participation, and precautionary behaviour). CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the utility of cognitive appraisal, as a core process of coping stress, in explaining the publics emotion and behaviour in the encounter of public health concern. Practically, the findings facilitate the government and practitioners to design and deliver targeted intervention programs to the public.","output":"Chinese publics knowledge, perceived severity, and perceived controllability of COVID-19 and their associations with emotional and behavioural reactions, social participation, and precautionary behaviour: a national survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contact tracing is conducted with the primary purpose of interrupting transmission from individuals who are likely to be infectious to others. Secondary analyses of data on the numbers of close contacts of confirmed cases could also provide an early signal of increases in contact patterns that might precede larger than expected case numbers; evaluate the impact of government interventions on the number of contacts of confirmed cases; or provide information on contact rates between age cohorts for the purpose of epidemiological modelling. We analysed data from 140,204 contacts of 39861 cases in Ireland from 1st May to 1st December 2020. Only \\"close\\" contacts were included in the analysis. A close contact was defined as any individual who had had > 15 minutes face-to-face (<2 m) contact with a case; any household contact; or any individual sharing a closed space for longer than 2 hours, in any setting. The number of contacts per case was overdispersed, the mean varied considerably over time, and was temporally associated with government interventions. Negative binomial regression models highlighted greater numbers of contacts within specific population demographics, after correcting for temporal associations. Separate segmented regression models of the number of cases over time and the average number of contacts per case indicated that a breakpoint indicating a rapid decrease in the number of contacts per case in October 2020 preceded a breakpoint indicating a reduction in the number of cases by 11 days. These data were collected for a specific purpose and therefore any inferences must be made with caution. The data are representative of contact rates of cases, and not of the overall population. However, the data may be a more accurate indicator of the likely degree of onward transmission than might be the case if a random sample of the population were taken. Furthermore, since we analysed only the number of close contacts, the total number of contacts per case would have been higher. Nevertheless, this analysis provides useful information for monitoring the impact of government interventions on number of contacts; for helping pre-empt increases or decreases in case numbers, and for triangulating assumptions regarding the contact mixing rates between different age cohorts for epidemiological modelling.","output":"Numbers of close contacts of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and their association with government intervention strategies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the development and evaluation of safety and immunogenicity of a whole virion inactivated (WVI) SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBV152), adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide gel (Algel), or TLR7/8 agonist chemisorbed Algel.

Design The ability of anti-MV-A iNOS monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to rescue challenged mice was assessed using three different mouse models of sepsis. Setting The vivarium of a research laboratory Subjects Balb/c mice Interventions: Mice were challenged with an LD80 dose of either lipopolysaccharide (LPS / endotoxin), TNF, or MV-A iNOS and then treated at various times after the challenge with saline as control or with an anti-MV-A iNOS mAb as a potential immunotherapeutic to treat sepsis. Measurement and Main Results Each group of mice was checked daily for survivors, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed. Five different murine anti-MV-A iNOS mAbs from our panel of 24 murine anti-MV-A iNOS mAbs (1) were found to rescue some of the challenged mice. All five murine mAbs were used to genetically engineer humanized anti-MV-A iNOS mAbs by inserting the murine complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) into a human IgG1,kappa scaffold and expressing the humanized mAbs in CHO cells. Three humanized anti-MV-A iNOS mAbs were effective at rescuing mice from sepsis in three different animal models of sepsis. The effectiveness of the treatment was both time and dose dependent. Humanized anti-MV-A iNOS rHJ mAb could rescue up to 80% of the challenged animal if administered early and at a high dose. Conclusions Our conclusions are MV-A iNOS is a novel therapeutic target to treat sepsis; anti-MV-A iNOS mAbs can mitigate the harmful effects of MV-A iNOS; the neutralizing mAbs efficacy is both time and dose dependent; and a specifically targeted immunotherapeutic for MV-A iNOS could potentially save tens-of-thousands of lives annually and could result in improved antibiotic stewardship.","output":"Circulating Microvesicle-Associated Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase Is a Novel Therapeutic Target to Treat Sepsis: Current Status and Future Considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is inadequate screening for SARS-COV-2 during pregnancy.

Subsequently, we evaluated the frequency of recurrent pleural effusions requiring reintervention. METHODS Data from 622 consecutive patients undergoing VATS lobectomy from January 2009 to December 2011 were registered prospectively in an institutional database. Data included age, gender, lobe(s) resected, bleeding and duration of surgery. Follow-up was 30 days from discharge. All complications requiring pleurocentesis or reinsertion of a chest tube, and all readmissions were registered. Twenty-three patients were excluded due to missing data, in-hospital mortality and loss to follow-up, leaving 599 for final analysis. Our primary outcome was the number of patients requiring reintervention due to recurrent pleural effusion. Secondary outcomes included time of chest tube removal and time to discharge. The incidence of recurrent pleural effusions requiring reintervention was compared between three groups according to the postoperative day (POD) of chest tube removal (Day 0-1, 2-3 and 4, respectively) using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS Pleural effusion after chest tube removal required reintervention in 17 patients (2.8%). Of these, 7 needed readmission. Median time from surgery to chest tube removal was 2 days, and median time from surgery to discharge was 4 days. No statistically significant association was found between the incidence of reinterventions due to recurrent pleural effusion and the POD of chest tube removal (P=0.50). The median time from chest tube removal to discharge was 1 day in all groups. Of the patients who needed reintervention, none had complications regarding this, except one who developed pneumothorax after pleurocentesis. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that chest tube removal after VATS lobectomy is safe despite volumes of serous fluid production up to 500 ml/day.

METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, demographic and clinical details of the patients were obtained during ICU admission. SpO(2) and respiratory rate (RR) on room air were determined within the first 6 h of hospital admission. As all measurements were obtained on room air, we calculated the simplified respiratory rate?oxygenation (ROX) index by dividing the SpO(2) by the RR. Based on the use of any assistance of mechanical ventilator (invasive or noninvasive), patients were divided into mechanical ventilation (MV) group and oxygen therapy group. The accuracy of the SpO(2), CT score, and ROX index to predict the need to MV were determined using the Area under receiver operating curve (AUC). RESULTS: We included 72 critically ill patients who tested COVID-19-positive.

The etiopathogenesis of PR is still unknown, but is frequently associated with episodes of upper respiratory tract infections. It is likely that a new viral trigger of pityriasis rosea is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). PATIENT CONCERNS: We present the case of a female patient in whom the diagnosis of pityriasis rosea led to the investigation and diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient presented to the Department of Dermatology for a 3aweek duration of an extremely pruritic erythematous-squamous lesion, initially on the trunk and upper limbs, with extension to the lower limbs in the last week and the lesion respected the cephalic extremity, palms, and soles. One week before the rash, respiratory tract infection symptomatology was observed by the patient. At home, she underwent systemic treatment with antihistamines and topical medication with dermatocorticosteroids. The evolution was unfavorable, with the spread of the lesions and the accentuation of the pruritus. DIAGNOSES: Considering the actual epidemiological context, we performed a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay from nasal and pharyngeal swabs for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to investigate the PR etiology. The patient had a positive RT-PCR result, and was confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment was initiated with systemic corticosteroid therapy - hydrocortisone hemisuccinate 200amg/day for 7adays, and loratadine 10amg 2 times a day. Also, topical medication with dermatocorticosteroids and emollients was associated. OUTCOME: Under the treatment that was initiated a partial remission of the lesions after 7adays was observed. LESSONS: Our reported case adds to the other findings regarding the association of PR with SARS-CoV-2 infection, in the context of the pandemic, suggesting the need to test patients with PR skin lesions for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Pityriasis rosea Gibert triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper is devoted to the program Generation which is a self-containing console application for classification of linear codes.

Documented waterborne disease outbreaks are primarily the result of technological failures or failure to treat the water (Craun et al. 2006). Current federal regulations require that all surface waters used for a drinking water supply be treated to reduce the level of pathogens so as to reduce the risk of infection to 1:10,000 per year (Regli et al. 1991). To achieve this goal, water treatment must, at a minimum, reduce infectious viruses by 99.99% and protozoan parasites by 99.9% (Regli et al. 2003). If Cryptosporidium concentrations exceed a certain level in the source water, additional reductions are required. This degree of treatment is usually achieved by a combination of physical processes (coagulation, sedimentation, and filtration) and disinfection (chlorination, ozonation). Filtration is essential for the removal of protozoan parasites due to their resistance to chlorination and ozonation at doses normally used in drinking water treatment (Barbeau et al. 2000; Korich et al. 1990; Rennecker et al. 1999).

OBJECTIVE: To describe lung US imaging findings and aeration score of 34 children with COVID-19. METHODS: This study included 0-16-year-old patients with confirmed COVID-19, who were admitted between April 19 and June 18, 2020 in two hospitals in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Lung US was performed as part of the routine evaluation by a skilled Pediatric Emergency physician. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and severity classifications were done according to an available clinical definition. The lung US findings were described for each lung field and a validated ultrasound lung aeration score was calculated. Data obtained was correlated with clinical information and other imaging modalities available for each case. RESULTS: Thirty-four confirmed COVID-19 patients had a lung US performed during this period. Eighteen (18/34) had abnormalities on the lung US, but eight of them (8/18) had a normal chest radiograph. Ultrasound lung aeration score medians for severe/critical, moderate, and mild disease were 17.5 (2-30), 4 (range 0-14), 0 (range 0-15), respectively (p = 0.001). Twelve patients (12/34) also had a chest computed tomography (CT) performed; both the findings and topography of lung compromise on the CT were consistent with the information obtained by lung US.

This raises concerns about how to achieve a shared decision-making process that prepares patients to make an informed decision about their choices about prenatal genetic screening and testing options, calling for a reconsideration of how healthcare providers approach the first prenatal visit. METHODS We conducted interviews with 40 pregnant women to identify components of decision-making regarding prenatal genetic screens and tests at this visit. Analysis was approached using grounded theory. RESULTS Participants brought distinct notions of risk to the visit, including skewed perceptions of baseline risk for a fetal genetic condition and the implications of screening and testing. Participants were very concerned about financial considerations associated with these options, ranking out-of-pocket costs on par with medical considerations. Participants noted diverging priorities at the first visit from those of their healthcare provider, leading to barriers to shared decision-making regarding screening and testing during this visit.

It is a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarct, and atrial fibrillation). It has also been shown that chronic obesity in people may be a cause for the development of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), whose components include cellular hypertrophy, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and increased extracellular collagen deposition. Several animal models with induced obesity, via the administration of a high-fat diet, also developed increased heart fibrosis as a result of extracellular collagen accumulation. Excessive collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the course of obesity may increase the stiffness of the myocardium and thereby deteriorate the heart diastolic function and facilitate the occurrence of HFpEF. In this review, we include a rationale for that process, including a discussion about possible putative factors (such as increased renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activity, sympathetic overdrive, hemodynamic alterations, hypoadiponectinemia, hyperleptinemia, and concomitant heart diseases).

The aim of this retrospective study is to estimate the impact that remdesivir -the first drug for COVID-19 approved in EU- would have had in the first wave. Methods: This study estimated the impact on the Spanish National Health System (SNHS) capacity (bed occupancy), and the number of deaths that could have been prevented, based on two scenarios: a real-life scenario (without remdesivir), and an alternative scenario (with remdesivir). It considered the clinical results of the ACTT-1 trial in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia, who required supplemental oxygen. The occupancy rates in general wards and ICUs were estimated in both scenarios. Results: Remdesivir would have avoided the admission of 2,587 patients (43.75%) in the ICUs. It would have also increased the SNHS capacity in 5,656 general wards beds and 1,700 ICU beds, showing an increase in the number of beds available of 17.53% (95% CI: 3.98% - 24.42%), and 23.98% (95% CI: 21.33% - 28.22%), respectively, at the peak of the occupancy rates. Furthermore, remdesivir would have avoided 7,639 deaths due to COVID-19, which implies a 27.51% reduction (95% CI: 14.25% - 34.07%).

Frailty is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes in surgical patients. Our objective is to systematically review the association of frailty with postoperative mortality and other adverse outcomes in adult patients who have undergone nonemergency cancer surgery. METHODS After registration (CRD42020171163), we systematically reviewed PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases to identify all studies reporting an association between a preoperative frailty measurement and a relevant outcome (primary: all-cause mortality in-hospital or within 30 days of surgery; secondary outcomes: postoperative complications, length of stay, discharge disposition, mortality between 30 days and 1 year, postoperative function, and delirium). All stages of the review were completed in duplicate. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic Studies (QUIPS) tool. Metaanalysis was used to pool effect estimates using random-effects models. RESULTS A total of 2877 studies were identified, and 71 were included. Frailty was significantly associated with mortality within 30 days (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.77-5.15), adverse discharge disposition (adjusted OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.52-3.02), postoperative complications (adjusted OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.64-3.49), longer-term mortality (unadjusted OR 4.32, 95% CI 2.15-8.67), and length of stay (mean difference 2.30, 95% CI 1.10-3.50).

Two other patients died due to surgical complications unrelated to COVID-19 (n=2/94, 2.1% mortality) (p&lt;0.01). Hospital stay was longer in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection than in those without (38.4 versushttps://doi.org/10.3 days, respectively, p&lt;0.01). Of the 99 patients who received surgical care during the pandemic, 94 were safely discharged (95%). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that elective colorectal surgical procedures may be safely performed during the pandemic; however, preoperative testing should be performed to reduce in-hospital infection rates, since the mortality rate due to SARS-CoV-2 in this setting is particularly high.","output":"Is it Safe to Perform Elective Colorectal Surgical Procedures during the COVID-19 Pandemic?

The mechanisms by which human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) counteracts the IFN pathway are only partially defined. We show that miR-US33as-5p encoded by HCMV is expressed in both lytic and latent infection. By analysis with RNA hybrid and screening with luciferase reporter assays, we identified IFNAR1 as a target of hcmv-miR-US33as-5p, which was further verified by examining the expression of two IFNAR1 mutants and the binding of IFNAR1 to miR-US33as-5p/miR-US33as-5p-M1/miR-US33as-5p-M2. We found that after the transfection of miR-US33as-5p mimics into different cell lines, the phosphorylation of downstream proteins and ISG expression were downregulated. Immunofluorescence showed that the miR-US33as-5p mimics also inhibited STAT1 translocation into the nucleus. Furthermore, we constructed HCMV with mutant miR-US33as-5p and determined that the mutation did not affect HCMV replication. We found that MRC-5/human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells infected with miRNA HCMV exhibited higher IFNAR1 and ISG expression and a reduced viral load in the presence of exogenous IFN than cells infected with WT HCMV did, confirming that the knockout of miR-US33as-5p impaired viral resistance to IFN. Finally, we tested the effect of miRNA HCMV on THP-1 and d-THP-1 cells, common in vitro models of latent infection and reactivation, respectively. Again, we found that cells infected with miRNA HCMV showed a reduced viral load in the presence of IFN than the control cells did, confirming that miR-US33as-5p also affects IFN resistance during both latency and reactivation.

However, clinical criteria specifically to define COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory syndrome (cHIS) have not been established. We aimed to develop and validate diagnostic criteria for cHIS in a cohort of inpatients with COVID-19. Methods: We searched for clinical research articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and Aug 20, 2020, on features and diagnostic criteria for secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, macrophage activation syndrome, macrophage activation-like syndrome of sepsis, cytokine release syndrome, and COVID-19. We compared published clinical data for COVID-19 with clinical features of other hyperinflammatory or cytokine storm syndromes. Based on a framework of conserved clinical characteristics, we developed a six-criterion additive scale for cHIS: fever, macrophage activation (hyperferritinaemia), haematological dysfunction (neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio), hepatic injury (lactate dehydrogenase or asparate aminotransferase), coagulopathy (D-dimer), and cytokinaemia (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, or triglycerides). We then validated the association of the cHIS scale with in-hospital mortality and need for mechanical ventilation in consecutive patients in the Intermountain Prospective Observational COVID-19 (IPOC) registry who were admitted to hospital with PCR-confirmed COVID-19. We used a multistate model to estimate the temporal implications of cHIS. Findings: We included 299 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between March 13 and May 5, 2020, in analyses. Unadjusted discrimination of the maximum daily cHIS score was 081 (95% CI 074-088) for in-hospital mortality and 092 (088-096) for mechanical ventilation; these results remained significant in multivariable analysis (odds ratio 16 [95% CI 12-21], p=00020, for mortality and 43 [30-60], p<00001, for mechanical ventilation). 161 (54%) of 299 patients met two or more cHIS criteria during their hospital admission; these patients had higher risk of mortality than patients with a score of less than 2 (24 [15%] of 138 vs one [1%] of 161) and for mechanical ventilation (73 [45%] vs three [2%]). In the multistate model, using daily cHIS score as a time-dependent variable, the cHIS hazard ratio for worsening from low to moderate oxygen requirement was 14 (95% CI 12-16), from moderate oxygen to high-flow oxygen 22 (11-44), and to mechanical ventilation 40 (19-82). Interpretation: We proposed and validated criteria for hyperinflammation in COVID-19. This hyperinflammatory state, cHIS, is commonly associated with progression to mechanical ventilation and death.

The values in the ROC curves with the best balance of sensitivity/specificity for afamin and vitamin E were 0.424 mg/l (70.6% sensitivity, 44.3% specificity) and 3.150 g/ml (76.5% sensitivity, 58.2% specificity), respectively. A positive moderate statistically significant correlation was found between afamin and CRP levels (r = .264, p = .009). Higher afamin and lower vitamin E levels may support the elevated oxidative stress in the etiopathogenesis of COVID-19 and the relationship with composite adverse perinatal outcomes.","output":"Evaluation of maternal serum afamin and vitamin E levels in pregnant women with COVID-19 and its association with composite adverse perinatal outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the influence of smoking on the oral cells genotoxicity before and after at-home bleaching using 22% carbamide peroxide (CP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective observational analytics cohort study which evaluated nonsmokers (NS; n = 24) and smokers (S; n = 16) patients. At-home bleaching was performed using 22% CP gel in individual trays for 1 h per day for 14 days in both groups. Scrapped cells from marginal gums were collected before the bleaching treatment (D0-baseline) and 1 day (D1), 15 days (D15), and 1 month (D30) after its finishing. Cells were stained with Giemsa 10%, and the micronucleus (MN) and metanuclear alterations (MA) were counted by a trained operator in 1000 cells per patient. The collections and data analysis occurred blindly. Data was analyzed by KruskalCWallis, Dunn, and MannCWhitney test ( = 0.05). RESULTS: MN frequency was not influenced by smoking or bleaching. An increase of MA was observed between D0 and D30 for both groups (p < 0.001); however, no statistical difference was found between NS and S (p > 0.05) in the evaluation times. CONCLUSION: Smoking associated with 22% carbamide peroxide gel for at-home bleaching does not show genotoxic potential analyzed by the MN counts. However, a significant increase of MA was found for smokers and nonsmokers. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Despite of the increase in MA, smoking associated with 22% CP peroxide at-home bleaching showed no important genotoxic potential (MN) for oral cells. Therefore, at-home bleaching treatment is safe for nonsmokers and smokers even with a high carbamide peroxide concentration of 22%.","output":"Influence of smoking on oral cells genotoxicity after at-home bleaching using 22% carbamide peroxide: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The double-mean-reverting model, introduced by Gatheral [(2008).

However, the calibration of this model may be slow because there is no closed-form solution formula for European options. In this paper, we use a rescaled version of the model developed by Huh et al.

We demonstrate that a faster calibration result of the double-mean revering model is available and yet the practical implied volatility surface of SPX options can be produced. In particular, not only the usual convex behavior of the implied volatility surface but also the unusual concave down behavior as shown in the COVID-19 market can be captured by our formula. ?

One result could be a general reduction in routine vaccination activities. In Tuscany (Central Italy), paediatricians (in agreement with the regional health service) administer and register paediatric vaccinations of their patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on paediatric vaccinations administered by Tuscan paediatricians, as a proxy of adherence to vaccinations during this epidemic period. Methods: Four hundred members of the Tuscany section of the Italian Federation of Paediatricians (FIMP) were invited to participate in a semi-structured online survey. Results: During the COVID-19 pandemic, almost all (98.2%) of the 223 respondents reported a general decline in outpatient paediatric visits; 65.8% reported a more than 60% reduction (144 answers) in comparison with the situation before the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 208 paediatricians (93.3%) continued to vaccinate in the period considered: 66/208 (31.7%) reported a reduction in parents' compliance with mandatory vaccination (hexavalent and MMRV vaccines), and 88/208 (42.3%) reported a reduction in compliance with non-mandatory vaccinations. Almost all paediatricians declared having taken preventive actions to counter the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Discussion and conclusions: Although the majority of Tuscan paediatricians continued to vaccinate during the lock-down, some parents decided to postpone their children's scheduled vaccinations, mainly owing to fears concerning the safety of access to health services. When Italian immunization coverage data on the first months of 2020 become available, it will be possible to assess the real impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric vaccinations. It is crucial to continue vaccinating against preventable infectious diseases in order to avoid other possible epidemic outbreaks. The pandemic must not be seen as an obstacle to compliance with the vaccination schedule, but rather as an excellent opportunity to underline the importance of all recommended vaccinations.","output":"Paediatric activities and adherence to vaccinations during the COVID-19 epidemic period in Tuscany, Italy: a survey of paediatricians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the abrupt outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the public health system of most of the worlds nations has been tested However, it is the concern of governments and other responsible entities to provide the correct statistics and figures to take any practicable necessary steps such as allocation of the requisite quarantine operations, calculation of the needed number of places in hospitals, determination of the extent of personal security, and determining the degree of isolation of infectious people, among others Where the statistical literature supposes that a model governs every real phenomenon, once we know the model, we can evaluate the dilemma Therefore, in this article, we compare the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics of two neighboring Arabic countries, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, to provide a framework to arrange appropriate quarantine activities A new generalized family of distributions is developed to provide the best description of COVID-19 daily cases and data on daily deaths in Egypt and Saudi Arabia Some of the mathematical properties of the proposed family are studied","output":"Modeling the COVID-19 Pandemic Dynamics in Egypt and Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, clinical manifestations as well as chest CT lesions are variable. Lung scintigraphy allows to assess and compare the regional distribution of ventilation and perfusion throughout the lungs. Our main objective was to describe ventilation and perfusion injury by type of chest CT lesions of COVID-19 infection using V/Q SPECT/CT imaging. PATIENTS AND METHODS We explored a national registry including V/Q SPECT/CT performed during a proven acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chest CT findings of COVID-19 disease were classified in 3 elementary lesions: ground-glass opacities, crazy-paving (CP), and consolidation. For each type of chest CT lesions, a semiquantitative evaluation of ventilation and perfusion was visually performed using a 5-point scale score (0 = normal to 4 = absent function). RESULTS V/Q SPECT/CT was performed in 145 patients recruited in 9 nuclear medicine departments. Parenchymal lesions were visible in 126 patients (86.9%). Ground-glass opacities were visible in 33 patients (22.8%) and were responsible for minimal perfusion impairment (perfusion score [mean  SD], 0.9  0.6) and moderate ventilation impairment (ventilation score, 1.7  1); CP was visible in 43 patients (29.7%) and caused moderate perfusion impairment (2.1  1.1) and moderate-to-severe ventilation impairment (2.5  1.1); consolidation was visible in 89 patients (61.4%) and was associated with moderate perfusion impairment (2.1  1) and severe ventilation impairment (3.0  0.9).

Environmental effects on the immune system may influence human susceptibility to respiratory infections as well as the severity of infectious diseases, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, the efficacy of vaccines to respiratory diseases may be impacted by environmental exposures through immune perturbations. Given the quick pace of research about COVID-19 and associated risk factors, it is critical to identify and curate the streams of evidence quickly and effectively. OBJECTIVE: We developed this systematic evidence map protocol to identify and organize existing human and animal literature on high-priority environmental chemical classes (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, pesticides, phthalates, quaternary ammonium compounds, and air pollutants) and their potential to influence three key outcomes: (1) susceptibility to respiratory infection, including SARS-CoV-2 (2) severity of the resultant disease progression, and (3) impact on vaccine efficacy. The result of this project will be an online, interactive database which will show what evidence is currently available between involuntary exposures to select environmental chemicals and immune health effects, data gaps that require further research, and data rich areas that may support further analysis. SEARCH AND STUDY ELIGIBILITY: We will search PubMed for epidemiological or toxicological literature on select toxicants from each of the chemical classes and each of the three outcomes listed above. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS OF METHODS: For each study, two independent reviewers will conduct title and abstract screening as well as full text review for data extraction of study characteristics.

No data have been so far reported on the prognostic impact of RASI in patients suffering from ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) during COVID-19 pandemic, which was the aim of the present study. METHODS: STEMI patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) and enrolled in the ISACS-STEMI COVID-19 registry were included in the present sub-analysis and divided according to RASI therapy at admission. RESULTS: Our population is represented by 6095 patients, of whom 3654 admitted in 2019 and 2441 in 2020. No difference in the prevalence of SARSCoV2 infection was observed according to RASI therapy at admission (2.5% vs 2.1%, p = 0.5), which was associated with a significantly lower mortality (adjusted OR [95% CI]=0.68 [0.51C0.90], P = 0.006), confirmed in the analysis restricted to 2020 (adjusted OR [95% CI]=0.5[0.33C0.74], P = 0.001). Among the 5388 patients in whom data on in-hospital medication were available, in-hospital RASI therapy was associated with a significantly lower mortality (2.1% vs 16.7%, OR [95% CI]=0.11 [0.084C0.14], p < 0.0001), confirmed after adjustment in both periods.

A systems view of host response to infections provides opportunities for discovering sensitive and robust molecular diagnostics. METHODS: We combine blood transcriptomes from six independent datasets (n = 756) with a knowledge-based human protein-protein interaction network, identifies subnetworks capturing host response to each infection class, and derives common response cores separately for viral and bacterial infections. We subject the subnetworks to a series of computational filters to identify a parsimonious gene panel and a standalone diagnostic score that can be applied to individual samples. We rigorously validate the panel and the diagnostic score in a wide range of publicly available datasets and in a newly developed Bangalore-Viral Bacterial (BL-VB) cohort. FINDING: We discover a 10-gene blood-based biomarker panel (Panel-VB) that demonstrates high predictive performance to distinguish viral from bacterial infections, with a weighted mean AUROC of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96-0.99) in eleven independent datasets (n = 898). We devise a new stand-alone patient-wise score (VB10) based on the panel, which shows high diagnostic accuracy with a weighted mean AUROC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.91-0.98) in 2996 patient samples from 56 public datasets from 19 different countries. Further, we evaluate VB10 in a newly generated South Indian (BL-VB, n = 56) cohort and find 97% accuracy in the confirmed cases of viral and bacterial infections. We find that VB10 is (a) capable of accurately identifying the infection class in culture-negative indeterminate cases, (b) reflects recovery status, and (c) is applicable across different age groups, covering a wide spectrum of acute bacterial and viral infections, including uncharacterized pathogens. We tested our VB10 score on publicly available COVID-19 data and find that our score detected viral infection in patient samples.

Here we deduce from a generic mathematical model how effectiveness of tracing relates to various aspects of time, such as the course of individual infectivity, the (variability in) time between infection and symptom-based detection, and delays in the tracing process. In addition, the possibility of iteratively tracing of yet asymptomatic infecteds is considered. With these insights we explain why contact tracing was and will be effective for control of smallpox and SARS, only partially effective for foot-and-mouth disease, and likely not effective for influenza. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We investigate contact tracing in a model of an emerging epidemic that is flexible enough to use for most infections. We consider isolation of symptomatic infecteds as the basic scenario, and express effectiveness as the proportion of contacts that need to be traced for a reproduction ratio smaller than 1. We obtain general results for special cases, which are interpreted with respect to the likely success of tracing for influenza, smallpox, SARS, and foot-and-mouth disease epidemics. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that (1) there is no general predictive formula for the proportion to be traced as there is for the proportion to be vaccinated; (2) variability in time to detection is favourable for effective tracing; (3) tracing effectiveness need not be sensitive to the duration of the latent period and tracing delays; (4) iterative tracing primarily improves effectiveness when single-step tracing is on the brink of being effective.","output":"The Effectiveness of Contact Tracing in Emerging Epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Methods developed to analyze spread of the 1980C1990 AIDS syndemic within the New York Metropolitan Region (NYMR) are updated and applied to the rate of COVID-19 deaths in the early months of the pandemic, and to premature mortality, across that conurbation For COVID deaths, 21 of the 24 NYMR counties are strongly linked through diffusion mechanisms well indexed by standard journey-to-work statistics, as modulated by local poverty rates While the Bronx leads the COVID death rate, three highly affluent countiesHunterdon, New Jersey;Putnam, New York;and Manhattanare less well-integrated into the overall spread process at this early stage These areas, however, must ultimately be drawn into the system of the other 21 counties over the next few years There is, after all, no effective mechanism to impede the ultimate spread of the infection: concentration is not containment, but the central mechanism for the emergence of pathogens across both local and national urban structures Comparison of the COVID death pattern with that of general premature mortality shows a striking inverse commuting pattern, but similar dependence on poverty For both afflictions, the Bronx, focus of planned shrinkage polices of the 1970s, is singularly marked by death ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"Prosperos New Castles: COVID Infection and Premature Mortality in the NY Metro Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has had an inevitable impact on the daily life of people in 2020.

Here, we further characterise the cellular immunogenicity profile of this vaccine candidate using a whole\\\\blood secretion assay in parallel to intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) of cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). METHODS: A randomly allocated subset of 90 healthy, SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2\\\\seronegative adults aged  18 years who had received (random allocation) one or two separate injections (on study day [D]1 and D22) of saline placebo or CoV2\\\\PreS\\\\dTM formulated with AS03 or AF03 were included. Cytokine secretion was assessed using a TruCulture(?) whole\\\\blood stimulation system in combination with multiplex bead array, and intracellular cytokine profiles were evaluated on thawed PBMCs following ex vivo stimulation with recombinant S protein at pre\\\\vaccination (D1), post\\\\dose 1 (D22) and post\\\\dose 2 (D36). RESULTS: Both methods detected similar vaccine\\\\induced responses after the first and second doses. We observed a Th1 bias (Th1/Th2 ratio > 1.0) for most treatment groups when analysed in whole blood, mainly characterised by increased IFN\\\\, IL\\\\2 and TNF\\\\ secretion. Among participants aged  50 years, the Th1/Th2 ratio was higher for those who received vaccine candidate with AS03 versus AF03 adjuvant. ICS revealed that this higher Th1/Th2 ratio resulted from higher levels of IFN\\\\ expression and that the vaccine induced polyfunctional CD4(+) T cells.

Although FDG-PET is not indicated for the initial diagnosis of breast cancer, focally increased glucose metabolism within breast tissue represents a high likelihood for a neoplastic process and requires further evaluation. Focally increased glucose metabolism is not unique to breast cancer. Other malignancies such as lymphoma, metastases from solid tumors as well as inflammatory changes also may demonstrate increased glucose metabolism either within the breast or at other sites throughout the body. Importantly, benign breast disease may also exhibit increased glucose metabolism, limiting the specificity of FDG-PET. Breast cancer has a wide range of metabolic activity attributed to tumor heterogeneity and breast cancer subtype. Intracellular signaling pathways regulating tumor glucose utilization contribute to these pitfalls of PET/CT in breast cancer. The evaluation of axillary lymph nodes by FDG-PET is less accurate than sentinel lymph node procedure, however is very accurate in identifying level II and III axillary lymph node metastases or retropectoral metastases. It is important to note that non-malignant inflammation in lymph nodes are often detected by modern PET/CT technology. Therefore, particular consideration should be given to recent vaccinations, particularly to COVID-19, which can commonly result in increased metabolic activity of axillary nodes. Whole body FDG-PET for staging of breast cancer requires specific attention to physiologic variants of FDG distribution and a careful comparison with co-registered anatomical imaging. The most important pitfalls are related to inflammatory changes including sarcoidosis, sarcoid like reactions, and other granulomatous diseases as well as secondary neoplastic processes.","output":"PET/CT Variants and Pitfalls in Breast Cancers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brain computer interfaces systems are controlled by users through neurophysiological input for a variety of applications including communication, environmental control, motor rehabilitation, and cognitive training. Although individuals with severe speech and physical impairment are the primary users of this technology, BCIs have emerged as a potential tool for broader populations, especially with regards to delivering cognitive training or interventions with neurofeedback. The goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using a BCI system with neurofeedback as an intervention for people with mild Alzheimer's disease. The study focused on visual attention and language since ad is often associated with functional impairments in language and reading. The study enrolled five adults with mild ad in a nine to thirteen week BCI EEG based neurofeedback intervention to improve attention and reading skills. Two participants completed intervention entirely. The remaining three participants could not complete the intervention phase because of restrictions related to covid. Pre and post assessment measures were used to assess reliability of outcome measures and generalization of treatment to functional reading, processing speed, attention, and working memory skills. Participants demonstrated steady improvement in most cognitive measures across experimental phases, although there was not a significant effect of NFB on most measures of attention. One subject demonstrated significantly significant improvement in letter cancellation during NFB. All participants with mild AD learned to operate a BCI system with training. Results have broad implications for the design and use of bci systems for participants with cognitive impairment.

It is critical to complete this activity with high precision at the regional and national levels to facilitate speedy decision-making. Tea is a big cash crop that contributes significantly to economic development, with a market of USD 200 billion in 2020 that is expected to reach over USD 318 billion by 2025. As a developing country, Bangladesh can be a greater part of this industry and increase its exports through its tea yield and production with favorable climatic features and land quality. Regrettably, the tea yield in Bangladesh has not increased significantly since 2008 like many other countries, despite having suitable climatic and land conditions, which is why quantifying the yield is imperative. This study developed a novel spatiotemporal hybrid DRSCRF model with a dragonfly optimization (DR) algorithm and support vector regression (S) as a feature selection approach. This study used satellite-derived hydro-meteorological variables between 1981 and 2020 from twenty stations across Bangladesh to address the spatiotemporal dependency of the predictor variables for the tea yield (Y). The results illustrated that the proposed DRSCRF hybrid model improved tea yield forecasting over other standalone machine learning approaches, with the least relative error value (11%). This study indicates that integrating the random forest model with the dragonfly algorithm and SVR-based feature selection improves prediction performance. This hybrid approach can help combat food risk and management for other countries.","output":"Spatiotemporal Hybrid Random Forest Model for Tea Yield Prediction Using Satellite-Derived Variables"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article presents discussion on environmental degradation.

Diet has been identified as an environmental determinant of mental health. In this regard, it has been suggested that the consumption of palatable foods represents a strategy to mitigate negative emotions, such as anxiety. This study aimed to evaluate the association between symptoms of anxiety and/or anhedonia to food consumption patterns during the period of COVID-19 quarantine in Chile. We conducted a cross-sectional study with non-randomized sampling via an online survey. A total of 1725 responses were collected. Each person self-answered the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale for anhedonia, the Food Intake Questionnaire, and questions regarding type and duration of lockdown, as well as body weight and food serving variation. Significant correlations were observed between fried food consumption and self-reported body weight. The subjects who consumed fried food three times a week, had higher weight (63.5%) (&#967;2 = 48.5 and p < 0.001). Those who ate one and two or more pastries on a week had 1.41 and 1.49, respectively higher odds of reporting increased body weight.

Theoretically, it can overcome many limitations of laparoscopic rectal surgery in the narrow pelvis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between January 2010 and January 2011, the patients who underwent robotic rectal resection for cancer were retrospectively evaluated in terms of demographics, operative data, complications, the duration of hospital stay, and histopathological data. RESULTS Thirty consecutive patients made up of 13 female and 17 male patients underwent robotic rectal resection. Sphincter-saving mesorectal excision was performed in 27 patients. Of these, there were 19 total and 8 partial mesorectal excisions. The mean operative time was 270 min (175-480 min). The median postoperative hospital stay was 4 days (4-20 days). No operation was converted. The complication rate was 13.3%. One patient died due to colonic necrosis caused by Drummond artery deficiency (3.3%). The median number of harvested lymph nodes was 15 (3-38), and the distal resection margin was 4 cm (2-8). Histopathological evaluation revealed that the mesorectum resection was complete in all patients.

Cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy provides real-time regional oxygen saturation (CrSO2) that may be a marker of adverse MRI findings and neurodevelopmental outcomes. AIM The aim of this study was to examine the value of CrSO2 monitoring in infants with HIE undergoing TH. STUDY DESIGN AND SUBJECTS In this prospective study, CrSO2 was continuously recorded in 21 infants with HIE admitted for TH. OUTCOME MEASURES Brain MRI signal abnormalities at 2weeks were scored in individual brain region and classified as none/mild, moderate and severe. 13 infants completed Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) testing at 18-24months. RESULTS Between 24 and 36h of life, there was a significant increase in odds of having moderate-severe brain MRI abnormalities with higher absolute CrSO2 values. Per 10% increase in absolute CrSO2, the odds ratio for moderate-severe brain MRI abnormalities was greatest at 30h (OR 3.78; confidence intervals (CI): 1.23-11.6, p=0.011). CrSO2 increased more rapidly in infants with greater injury seen on MRI (0.20/h for MRI scores 0/1, by 0.48/h for MRI score 2, and by 0.68/h for MRI score 3, p=0.05). At 30h, absolute CrSO2 correlated significantly with abnormal MRI findings in basal ganglia (92% vs. 78%, p=0.001), white matter (88% vs. 76%, p=0.01), posterior limb of internal capsule (92% vs. 78%, p=0.001), and brain stem (94% vs. 80%, p=0.03) but not with cortical injury (86% vs. 80%, p=0.17). Higher CrSO2 beyond 24h correlated with greater odds of worse BSID scores. CONCLUSIONS Increasing CrSO2 is associated with moderate-severe brain injury as assessed by MRI. Higher absolute CrSO2 values during TH correlates with subcortical injury on MRI and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants with HIE undergoing TH. CrSO2 can inform providers seeking early identification of patients at risk of worse injury who may benefit from further intervention.","output":"Cerebral regional oxygen saturation trends in infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Myocardial injury is a severe complication of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and inflammation has been suggested as a potential cause of myocardial injury. However, the correlation of myocardial injury with inflammation in COVID-19 patients has not been revealed so far. Method: This retrospective single-center cohort study enrolled 64 critically ill patients with COVID-19. Patients were categorized into two groups by the presence of myocardial injury on admission. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed in this study. Result: Of these patients, the mean age was 64.8  12.2 years old, and 34 (53.1%) were diagnosed with myocardial injury. Compared with non-myocardial injury patients, myocardial injury patients were older (67.8  10.3 vs. 61.3  13.3 years; P = 0.033), had more cardiovascular (CV) risk factors such as smoking (16 [47.06%] vs. 7 [23.33%]; P = 0.048) and were more likely to develop CV comorbidities (13 [38.2%] vs. 2 [6.7%]; P = 0.003). Scores on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (median [interquartile range (IQR)] 19.0 [13.25C25.0] vs. 13.0 [9.25-18.75]; P = 0.005) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment systems (7.0 [5.0C10.0] vs. 4.5 [3.0C6.0]; P < 0.001) were significantly higher in the myocardial injury group. In addition, patients with myocardial injury had higher mortality than those without myocardial injury (29 [85.29%] vs. 18 [60.00%]; P = 0.022). Cox regression suggested that myocardial injury was an independent risk factor for high mortality during the time from admission to death (hazard ratio [HR], 2.06 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10C3.83]; P = 0.023). Plasma levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin (IL)-1, interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) exceeded the normal limits, and levels of hs-CRP, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF- were statistically higher in the myocardial injury group than in the non-myocardial injury group. Multiple-variate logistic regression showed that plasma levels of hs-CRP (odds ratio [OR] 6.23, [95% CI, 1.93C20.12], P = 0.002), IL-6 (OR 13.63, [95% CI, 3.33C55.71]; P < 0.001) and TNF- (OR 19.95, [95% CI, 4.93C80.78]; P < 0.001) were positively correlated with the incidence of myocardial injury.

Here, we determined the expression of MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4), in lung tissues of smokers without airflow limitation and COPD patients in comparison to nonsmoking individuals (never-smokers). METHODS: DPP4 expression was measured in lung tissue of lung resection specimens of never-smokers, smokers without airflow limitation, COPD GOLD stage II patients and in lung explants of end-stage COPD patients. Both control subjects and COPD patients were well phenotyped and age-matched. The mRNA expression was determined using qRT-PCR and protein expression was quantified using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In smokers and subjects with COPD, both DPP4 mRNA and protein expression were significantly higher compared to never-smokers. Additionally, we found that both DPP4 mRNA and protein expression were inversely correlated with lung function and diffusing capacity parameters. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that DPP4 is upregulated in the lungs of smokers and COPD patients, which could partially explain why these individuals are more susceptible to MERS-CoV infection.

Although it can reveal the specimen's size and shape information, the chemical composition is inaccessible in interferometric measurements. Infrared spectroscopic imaging provides chemical specificity based on inherent chemical bond vibrations of specimens but lacks the ability to image and resolve individual nanoparticles due to long infrared wavelengths. Here, we describe a bond-selective interferometric scattering microscope where the mid-infrared induced photothermal signal is detected by a visible beam in a wide-field common-path interferometry configuration. A thin film layered substrate is utilized to reduce the reflected light and provide a reference field for the interferometric detection of the weakly scattered field. A pulsed mid-IR laser is employed to modulate the interferometric signal. Subsequent demodulation via a virtual lock-in camera offers simultaneous chemical information about tens of micro- or nano-particles. The chemical contrast arises from a minute change in the particle's scattered field in consequence of the vibrational absorption at the target molecule.

METHODS: In 2020, we conducted three internet-based randomized clinical trials and offered serologic testing via self-collected DBS as a voluntary sub-study. COVID-19 diagnosis was based on CDC case definition with epidemiological link to cases. A minority reported PCR testing at an outside facility. We tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin via Antibody Detection by Agglutination-PCR (ADAP) and compared with ELISA. RESULTS: Of 2727 participants in the primary studies, 60% (1648/2727) consented for serology testing; 56% (931/1648) returned a usable DBS sample. Of those asymptomatic, 5% (33/707) had positive ADAP serology. Of participants with a positive PCR, 67% (36/54) had positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. None of those who were PCR-positive and asymptomatic were seropositive (0/7). Of 77 specimens tested for concordance via ELISA, 83% (64/77) were concordant. Challenges of completing a remote testing program during a pandemic included sourcing and assembling collection kits, delivery and return of the kits, and troubleshooting testing.

While diabetes is known to aggravate COVID-19 severity, it is not known whether nondiabetic patients with metabolic dysfunction are also more prone to more severe disease. The association of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) with COVID-19 severity in nondiabetic patients was investigated here. METHODS: The study cohort comprised 65 patients with (i.e. cases) and 65 patients without MAFLD (i.e. controls). Each case was randomly matched with one control by sex (1:1) and age (5 years). The association between the presence of MAFLD (as exposure) and COVID-19 severity (as the outcome) was assessed by binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In nondiabetic patients with COVID-19, the presence of MAFLD was associated with a four-fold increased risk of severe COVID-19; the risk increased with increasing numbers of metabolic risk factors. The association with COVID-19 severity persisted after adjusting for age, sex, and coexisting morbid conditions.

METHODS Medical records and imaging studies of cats with TVCS were retrospectively reviewed. Outcome was acquired from patient records and from owners or referring veterinary surgeons via a telephone questionnaire. For each case, breed-, age- and sex-matched controls were identified with CT imaging of the thoracic vertebral column. For each cat, vertebral canal height was determined at three levels for each thoracic vertebra. Vertebral canal heights were compared between control cats of different breeds and between affected and control cats of the same breed. RESULTS Nine TVCS cases were included. British Shorthairs and male neutered cats were over-represented (P <0.05). Median age at presentation was 9 years. All cats were presented for a chronic, progressive, painful, ambulatory, T3-L3 myelopathy. Five cats were treated conservatively, three surgically and one was euthanased. Two cats treated surgically demonstrated improvement of clinical signs and one demonstrated initial improvement followed by deterioration. Of the conservatively treated cats, three deteriorated and two improved. Compared with controls, affected cats had a lower vertebral canal height at multiple thoracic vertebral levels, being most prominent for British Shorthairs and domestic shorthairs (P <0.05). Unaffected British Shorthairs had a lower thoracic vertebral canal height at multiple levels than control domestic shorthairs (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE TVCS should be considered a differential diagnosis in middle-aged to older cats presenting with a chronic, progressive, painful, T3-L3 myelopathy.

To contain the public health threat, almost all countries enforced a variety of measures, including lockdowns, to minimize face-to-face human interactions between the infected and the susceptible. While these vigilant measures save lives, they also generate a substantial negative economic shock that immediately halts demand and significantly disrupts supply, global production value chain and trade.

The identification of novel drugs and efficient therapies against these infectious viruses is need of the hour. The eruption of COVID-19 is caused by a novel acute respiratory syndrome virus SARS-CoV-2 which has taken the whole world by storm as it has transformed into a global pandemic. This lethal syndrome is a global health threat to general public which has already affected millions of people. Despite the development of some potential vaccines and repurposed drugs by some Pharma companies, this health emergency needs more attention due to the less efficacy of these vaccines coupled with the emergence of novel and resistant strains of SARS-CoV-2. Due to enormous structural diversity and biological applications, natural products are considered as a wonderful source of drugs for such diseases. Natural product based drugs constitute a substantial proportion of the pharmaceutical market particularly in the therapeutic areas of infectious diseases and oncology. The naturally occurring bioactive antiviral phytochemicals including alkaloids, flavonoids and peptides have been subjected to virtual screening against COVID-19. Since there is no specific medicine available for the treatment of Covid-19, designing new drugs using in silico methods plays an all important role to find that magic bullet which can target this lethal virus. The in silico method is not only quick but economical also when compared to the other conventional methods which are hit and trial methods. Based on this in silico approach, various natural products have been recently identified which might have a potential to inhibit COVID-19 outbreak. These natural products have been shown by these docking studies to interact with the spike protein of the novel coronavirus. This spike protein has been shown to bind to a transmembrane protein called Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), this protein acts as a receptor for the viral spike protein.

METHODS: A cohort of 494 non-COVID-19 subjects living in 21 EU countries were interviewed by an anonymous questionnaire exploring anthropometric and lifestyle changes during 1-month lockdown. A subgroup of 41 overweight/obese Italian subjects with previously diagnosed nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) joined the study following a 12-month follow-up period promoting weight loss by healthy lifestyle. RESULTS: During the lockdown, body weight increased in 55% of subjects (average 2.4  0.9 kg). Weight change increased with age, but not baseline body mass index. Subjects living in Italy had greater weight gain than those living in other European Countries. Weight gain during the lockdown was highest in subjects reporting no physical activity, and low adherence to Mediterranean diet. In the NAFLD group, weight gain occurred in 70% of cases. Subjects reporting weight loss during lockdown had decreased fatty liver score at 3 months before the lockdown, as compared with 1 year before. CONCLUSIONS: Strict measures of social containment-even short-term-pave the way to the increased risk of metabolic abnormalities in the medium-long term.

Moreover, smoking can cause illnesses and promote other types of substance abuse. Therefore, it was deemed essential to adapt the Young Adults Cigarette Dependence (YACD) Scale to develop and validate the Adolescent Cigarette Dependence Scale (ACDS) in Lebanese adolescents and evaluate whether cumulative cigarette smoking is associated with nicotine dependence and symptoms of dependence. A cross-sectional study was carried out between August and September 2020, during the partial sanitary lockdown imposed by the government to limit COVID-19, coinciding with the summer holidays for most Lebanese. The total sample consisted of 564 community-dwelling adolescents aged 13 to 18. A factor analysis was performed using a varimax rotation. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measurement of sampling adequacy and Bartletts sphericity test were appropriate. The factors retained corresponded to Eigenvalues > 1. Cronbachs alpha value represented the internal consistency of the scale. The Hooked on Nicotine Checklist (HONC) was used to screen for dependence symptoms. All items of the YACD were extracted, except for items 4 (smoking to concentrate at work) and 18 (smoking as a habit), which yielded a three-factor solution (factor 1 = smoking patterns; factor 2 = positive and negative reinforcements; factor 3 = smoking cessation) with Eigenvalues > 1 (variance explained = 56.18%; KMO = 0.784; Bartletts sphericity test p < 0.001; (Cronbach) = 0.875). The newly generated scale was termed Adolescent Cigarette Dependence Scale (ACDS) and consisted of 19 items. Higher ACDS scores (higher cigarette dependence) were significantly associated with higher HONC scores (higher symptoms of dependence) (rho = 0.647; p < 0.001). Having deceased (B = 8.54) or divorced (B = 4.26) parents and higher cumulative cigarette smoking (B = 0.29) were significantly associated with higher ACDS scores. Higher cumulative cigarette smoking (B = 0.05) was significantly associated with higher HONC scores due to cigarettes. This study could validate a new tool to evaluate nicotine dependence among Lebanese adolescents, the Adolescent Cigarette Dependence Scale (ACDS).

This study aimed to analyze the frequency of the requirement of inappropriately sized uncuffed ETT insertion, air leakage after the ETT was replaced with one of a larger size, and factors associated with air leakage after ETT replacement. METHODS: Patients under 2 years of age who underwent oral surgery under general anesthesia with uncuffed ETTs between December 2013 and May 2015 were enrolled. The ETT size was selected at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologists. A leak test was performed after intubation. The ETT was replaced when considered necessary. Data regarding the leak pressure (PLeak) and inspiratory and expiratory tidal volumes were extracted from anesthesia records. We considered a PLeak of 10 < PLeak  30 cmH2O to be appropriate. The frequencies of the requirement of inappropriately sized ETTs, absence of leakage after ETT replacement, ETT size difference, and leak rate were calculated. A logistic regression was performed, with PLeak, leak rate, and size difference included as explanatory variables and presence of leakage after replacement as the outcome variable. RESULTS: Out of the 156 patients enrolled, 109 underwent ETT replacement, with the requirement of inappropriately sized ETTs being observed in 25 patients (23%).

METHODS: We conducted active surveillance for ambulatory care visits for acute respiratory illness (ARI) among members of Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA). Enrolled patients provided respiratory swab specimens which were tested for 12 respiratory viruses using RT-PCR. We estimated the cumulative incidence of infection due to each virus overall and by age group. RESULTS: The KPWA population under surveillance included 202,562 individuals, of whom 2,767 (1.4%) were enrolled in the study. Influenza A(H3N2) was the most commonly detected virus, with an overall incidence 21 medically attended illnesses per 1,000 population; the next most common viruses were influenza A(H1N1) (18 per 1,000), coronaviruses (13 per 1,000), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 13 per 1,000), and rhinovirus (9 per 1,000).

Shorter regimens using rifapentine can support increased availability and scale-up. Mortality is high in people with HIV-associated TB, and timely initiation of ART is critical. Programs should provide decentralized and integrated TB and HIV care in settings with high burden of both diseases to improve access to services that diagnose TB and HIV as early as possible. The new prevention and diagnosis tools recently recommended by WHO offer an immense opportunity to advance our fight against HIV-associated TB. They should be made widely available and scaled up rapidly supported by adequate funding with robust monitoring of the uptake to advance global TB elimination.","output":"HIV-associated tuberculosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is growing appreciation of the wide range of clinical presentations seen in pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Symptoms and tests in most cases lead to a correct diagnosis; however, error may be around the corner. CASE REPORT: A 60 years old patient was referred with weight loss, fatigue and mild fever for 3 weeks as he was working in a COVID-19 ward. After a positive swab and chest CT scan, he was admitted in the hospital and treated as mild COVID-19 patient. A CT scan performed after the patient was discharged revealed a renal lesion misidentified as a tumor then clarified to be an abscess which retrospectively appears to be the main cause of his symptoms.

However, there are limited studies on how care work and its costs are experienced by early-career Filipino public school teachers in low-resource contexts. Hence, the purpose of this study is to examine teachers stories of caring for burdened students using an integrative and critical narrative inquiry based on Clandinins narrative framework and Decenteceos cultural story-model of Pagdadala(i.e. burden-bearing). Methods: Field texts were collected through in-depth interviews with ten (10) female teacher advisers over two months. Participants came from eight (8) different public schools catering to students from low-resource communities in Marikina City, Navotas City and Quezon City. Results: Findings showed four narrative pathways ofpagdadalaof caring that teachers lived and told across the caring landscape: shared, overextended, asserted, and curtailed. These non-linear pathways reflect how teachers experience of care work is shaped by the overlapping sphere of influence of homes, schools and communities in student care. Conclusions: Complimenting literature on care work in education using Clandinins narrative inquiry framework that integrated DecenteceosPagdadalamodel, this study has offered a storied map of co-burden-bearing that was shaped by the social, spatial and temporal contexts in low-resource urban public schools.

In this review, we first evaluate recent debates over the field's current state and future directions. Our takeaway is that efforts to settle on a single, generic version of what constitutes risk communication will be less productive than an open\\\\minded exploration of the multiple forms that comprise today's vibrant interdisciplinary field. We then review a selection of prominent cognitive, cultural, and social risk communication scholarship appearing in the published literature since 2010. Studies on trust in risk communication messengers continued to figure prominently, while new research directions emerged on the opportunities and critical challenges of enhancing transparency and using social media. Research on message attributes explored how conceptual insights particularly relating to framing, affective and emotional responses, and uncertainty might be operationalized to improve message effectiveness. Studies consistently demonstrated the importance of evaluation and how varying single attributes alone is unlikely to achieve desired results. Research on risk communication audiences advanced on risk perception and multiway engagement with notable interest in personal factors such as gender, race, age, and political orientation.

Several therapies are currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the development of new drugs and the repositioning of existing drugs can only be achieved after the identification of potential therapeutic targets within structures, as this strategy provides the most precise solution for developing treatments for sudden epidemic infectious diseases. SUMMARY: In the current investigation, crystal and cryo-electron microscopy structures encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome were systematically examined for the identification of potential drug targets. These structures include nonstructural proteins (Nsp-9; Nsp-12; and Nsp-15), nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and the main protease (Mpro). Key Message: The structural information reveals the presence of many potential alternative therapeutic targets, primarily involved in interaction between N protein and Nsp3, forming replication-transcription complexes (RTCs) which might be a potential drug target for effective control of current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. RTCs consist of 16 nonstructural proteins (Nsp1-16) that play the most essential role in the synthesis of viral RNA. Targeting the physical linkage between the envelope and single-stranded positive RNA, a process facilitated by matrix proteins may provide a good alternative strategy. Our current study provides useful information for the development of new lead compounds against SARS-CoV-2 infections.","output":"Structures of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-Binding Proteins and Therapeutic Targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic shook the whole world with its brutality, and the spread has been still rising on a daily basis, causing many nations to suffer seriously.

Several disinfectants were previously recommended for SARS-CoV-2 decontamination including alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, and sodium hypochlorite with some limitations. Potassium peroxymonosulfate (MPS) is a broadspectrum disinfectants and acts on bacterial and viral protein capsids by oxidation. It is widely used as multipurpose virucidal disinfection in livestock industry. However, there is no direct evidence shows MPS is effective against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. DESIGN AND METHOD: : SARS-CoV-2 virus positive samples from Thai patients in vital transport medium were treated with MPS at different dilutions (1:100, 1:200, 1:400) with various contact times (1, 5, 10 minutes).Sodium hypochlorite was included as a reference disinfectant against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Subsequently, viral genomic RNA samples were then extracted and performed SARS-CoV-2 Real-time, PCR by targeting viral ORF1ab and N genes to detected SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA integrity. RESULTS: : Using triplicate experiments, the results indicated that all 3 MPS dilutions (1:100/1:200/1:400) statistically reduced the SARS-CoV-2 genome integrity resulting in reduction of SARS-CoV-2 detection by 93.7%, 88.7%, and 83.2%, respectively based on the ORF1ab gene compared to negative control. Sodium hypochlorite (1%) induced > 99.9% loss in the SARS-CoV-2 detection. Similar results were observed by the N gene amplification.

The current study aimed to evaluate the hypothesis that its outcome might be improved by using the laparoscopy. The outcome of treatment in terms of complications, mortality and hospital stay with relevant to laparoscopy was analyzed. PATIENTS AND METHODS This prospective descriptive study was carried on the period of 3 years from July 2009 till July 2012. All patients with acute abdominal pain that was clinically diagnosed as having perforated peptic ulcer were included. Excluded from this study were those patients with concomitant bleeding from the ulcer and evidence of gastric outlet obstructions. Also excluded were those with evidence of large perforation more than 10 mm and patients with symptoms of more than 36 h durations for fear of septic shock. RESULTS Forty seven patients were studied out of a total 53 PPU patients; they were 41 males and 6 females with the male to female ratio of 6.8:1. Their age ranged from 19 to 55 years with the mean age of 39.5  8.6 years. Forty five patients were successfully treated by laparoscopy while only 2 cases that were early presented with signs of hypovolumic shock were converted into laparotomy due to severe bleeding. The mean hospital stay was 75  12.6 h. Post operative complications included death of one patient in the postoperative period at the Intensive care unit (ICU) plus post operative fever in the 2 patients who underwent laparotomy and it was amenable to treatment.

Due to the full acceptance of the above control practices, frequent hospital contact visits are being discouraged. However, there are people whose physiological vital needs still require routine monitoring for improved healthy living. Interestingly, with the recent technological advancements in the areas of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, smart home automation, and healthcare systems, contact-based hospital visits are now regarded as non-obligatory. To this end, a remote smart home healthcare support system (ShHeS) is proposed for monitoring patients health status and receiving doctors prescriptions while staying at home. Besides this, doctors can also carry out the diagnosis of ailments using the data collected remotely from the patient. An android based mobile application that interfaces with a web-based application is implemented for efficient patients-doctors dual real-time communication. Sensors are incorporated in the system for automatic capturing of physiological health parameters of patients. Also, a hyperspace analogue to context (HAC) was incorporated into the current monitoring framework for service discovery and context change in the home environment towards accurate readings of the physiological parameters and improved system performance. With the proposed system, patients can be remotely monitored from their homes, and can also live a more comfortable life through the use of some features of smart home automation devices on their phones. Therefore, one main significant contribution of this study is that patients in self-isolation or self-quarantine can use the new platform to send daily health symptoms and challenges to doctors via their mobile phones.

METHODS: This data-driven study was based on the Brazilian Ministry of Health Database (SIVEP-Gripe) regarding notified cases of hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the period from February 26th to August 10th, 2020. Demographic data, clinical symptoms, comorbidities and other additional information of patients were analyzed. RESULTS: The hospitalization rate was higher for male gender (56.56%) and for older age patients of both sexes. Overall, the lethality rate was quite high (41.28%) among hospitalized patients, especially those over 60 years of age. Most prevalent symptoms were cough, dyspnoea, fever, low oxygen saturation and respiratory distress. Cardiac disease, diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, neurological disease, and pneumopathy were the most prevalent comorbidities. A high prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with cardiac disease (65.7%) and diabetes (53.55%) and with a high lethality rate of around 50% was observed.

METHODS: Using data from a large, multi-site cross-sectional survey, this research work models mental well-being and reports on the performance of various machine learning algorithms, such as generalized linear models, k-nearest neighbor, na?ve-Bayes, neural networks, random forest, recursive partitioning, bagging, and boosting. Prediction models were evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, error rate, kappa, sensitivity, specificity, Area Under the recursive operating characteristic Curve (AUC), and Gini Index. RESULTS: Random forest and adaptive boosting algorithms achieved the highest accuracy of identifying negative mental well-being traits. The top five most salient features associated with predicting poor mental well-being include body mass index, number of sports activities per week, grade point average (GPA), sedentary hours, and age. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the reported results, several specific recommendations and suggested future work are discussed. These findings may be useful to provide cost-effective support and modernize mental well-being assessment and monitoring at the individual and university level.","output":"Prediction Modeling of Mental Well-Being Using Health Behavior Data of College Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article considers the clinical and policy implications of initial results of the follow-up of England's Mental Health of Children and Young People (MHCYP) survey.

LOCAL PROBLEM: At the beginning of the statewide COVID-19 surge, a tertiary teaching hospital in the upper Midwest experienced a sharp increase in patients needing intensive care. To relieve the resulting staffing shortage, it implemented a pilot program to bring general care nurses into its 21-bed mixed specialty intensive care unit to free intensive care unit nurses to help staff the hospital's COVID-designated units. METHODS: Using a team nursing model, the intensive care unit recruited, oriented, and incorporated 13 general care nurses within 4 days. Education and resources were developed to distinguish team nurses from intensive care unit nurses, introduce them to the intensive care unit environment, outline expectations, communicate between team nursing pairs, and guide charge nurses in making staffing decisions and assignments. Staff feedback identified additional resources, barriers, and successes. An adaptive process was used to improve and update tools and resources on the basis of staff needs. RESULTS: The pilot program ran for 6 weeks. Positive outcomes included a reduced need for float nurses and self-perceived reduction in nursing workload. The principal barrier was charge nurses' challenges involving staffing-to-workload balance based on the existing staffing model. This model identified productivity of a general care nurse and an intensive care unit nurse as equivalent, despite differences in their skill sets.

Amid the ongoing pandemic, health care workers have struggled to keep up with new information about the disease, while also coping with the anxiety associated with caring for affected patients. It has also been a continual challenge for nurse leaders to provide adequate support for staff members and keep them informed about frequently changing practices and protocols. In this article, nursing leaders at an academic medical center in Boston reflect on the initial COVID-19 patient surge, which occurred from March to June 2020, and identify key actions taken to provide clinical and emotional support to frontline staff who cared for these patients. Lessons learned in this period provide insight into the management of redeployed staff, use of emotional support and debriefing, and relationship between access to information and staff morale. The knowledge gained through these initial experiences has been a vital resource as health care workers continue to face challenges associated with the ongoing pandemic.

Epidemiological studies indicate beneficial effects of certain dietary regimes on mental health, including mood disorders and dementia. However, randomised-controlled trials (the gold-standard of evidence-based medicine) on calorie restriction diets and the ketogenic diet have yet to show clinically convincing effects in neuropsychiatric disorders. This review will examine the quality of studies and evidence base for the ketogenic and calorie restriction diets in common neuropsychiatric conditions, collating findings from preclinical experiments, case reports or small clinical studies, and randomised controlled clinical trials. The major cellular mechanisms that mediate the effects of these dietary interventions on brain health include neuroinflammation, neuroprotection, and neuromodulation. We will discuss the studies that have investigated the roles of these pathways and their interactions. Popularity of the ketogenic and calorie restriction diets has grown both in the public domain and in psychiatry research, allowing for informed review of the efficacy, the limitations, and the side effects of these diets in specific patient populations. In this review we will summarise the clinical evidence for these diets in neuropsychiatry and make suggestions to improve clinical translation of future research studies.","output":"Does Neuroinflammation Underlie the Cognitive Changes Observed With Dietary Interventions?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To compare facility-level influenza vaccination rates in long-term care (LTC) homes from four countries and to identify factors associated with influenza vaccination among residents.

PARTICIPANTS: LTC home residents assessed with interRAI assessment system instruments as part of routine practice in New Brunswick (n=7006) and New Zealand (n=34 518), and national pilot studies in Switzerland (n=2760) and the Netherlands (n=1508). End-of-life residents were excluded from all country cohorts. OUTCOMES: Influenza vaccination within the past year. RESULTS: Influenza vaccination rates among LTC home residents were highest in New Brunswick (84.9%) and lowest in Switzerland (63.5%). For all jurisdictions where facility-level data were available, substantial interfacility variance was observed. There was approximately a fourfold difference in the coefficient of variation for facility-level vaccination rates with the highest in Switzerland at 37.8 and lowest in New Brunswick at 9.7. Resident-level factors associated with vaccine receipt included older age, severe cognitive impairment, medical instability, health conditions affecting a greater number of organ systems and social engagement. Residents who displayed aggressive behaviours and smoke tobacco were less likely to be vaccinated. CONCLUSION: There are opportunities to increase influenza vaccine uptake at both overall country and individual facility levels.

To combat this situation, numerous strategies are being thought for either creating its antidote, vaccine, or agents that can prevent its infection. For enabling research on these strategies, several target proteins are identified where, Spike (S) protein is of great potential. S-protein interacts with human angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2) for entering the cell. S-protein is a large protein and a portion of it designated as a receptor-binding domain (RBD) is the key region that interacts with ACE2, following to which the viral membrane fuses with the alveolar membrane to enter the human cell. The hypothesis is to identify molecules from the pool of anticancer phytochemicals as a lead possessing the ability to interact and mask the amino acids of RBD, making them unavailable to form associations with ACE2. Such a molecule is termed as 'fusion inhibitor'. We hypothesized to identify fusion inhibitors from the NPACT library of anticancer phytochemicals. For this, all the molecules from the NPACT were screened using molecular docking, the five top hits (Theaflavin, Ginkgetin, Ursolic acid, Silymarin and Spirosolane) were analyzed for essential Pharmacophore features and their ADMET profiles were studied following to which the best two hits were further analyzed for their interaction with RBD using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation.

NPIs require public interest to be successful. In the United States, there is a lack of published research on the factors that influence public interest in COVID-19. Using Google Trends, we examined the US level of public interest in COVID-19 and how it correlated to testing and with other countries. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine how public interest in COVID-19 in the United States changed over time and the key factors that drove this change, such as testing. US public interest in COVID-19 was compared to that in countries that have been more successful in their containment and mitigation strategies. METHODS: In this retrospective study, Google Trends was used to analyze the volume of internet searches within the United States relating to COVID-19, focusing on dates between December 31, 2019, and March 24, 2020. The volume of internet searches related to COVID-19 was compared to that in other countries. RESULTS: Throughout January and February 2020, there was limited search interest in COVID-19 within the United States. Interest declined for the first 21 days of February. A similar decline was seen in geographical regions that were later found to be experiencing undetected community transmission in February. Between March 9 and March 12, 2020, there was a rapid rise in search interest. This rise in search interest was positively correlated with the rise of positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 (6.3, 95% CI -2.9 to 9.7; P<.001). Within the United States, it took 52 days for search interest to rise substantially after the first positive case; in countries with more successful outbreak control, search interest rose in less than 15 days. CONCLUSIONS: Containment and mitigation strategies require public interest to be successful. The initial level of COVID-19 public interest in the United States was limited and even decreased during a time when containment and mitigation strategies were being established. A lack of public interest in COVID-19 existed in the United States when containment and mitigation policies were in place. Based on our analysis, it is clear that US policy makers need to develop novel methods of communicating COVID-19 public health initiatives.","output":"Fluctuation of Public Interest in COVID-19 in the United States: Retrospective Analysis of Google Trends Search Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Age-related changes in sensory functioning impact the activities of daily living and interact with cognitive decline. Given the interactions between sensory and cognitive functioning, combining multisensory integration (MI) assessment with the neuropsychological assessment of older adults seems promising. This review aims to examine the characteristics and utility of MI tasks in functional and cognitive assessment of older adults, with or without neurocognitive impairment.Areas covered: A literature search was conducted following the quality assessment of narrative review criteria. Results focused on tasks of detection, discrimination, sensory illusion, temporal judgment, and sensory conflict. Studies were not consensual regarding the enhancement of MI with age, but most studies showed that older adults had an expanded time window of integration. In older adults with mild cognitive impairment or major neurocognitive disorder it was a mediating role of the magnitude of visual-somatosensory integration between neurocognitive impairment and spatial aspects of gait.Expert opinion: Recently, some concerns have been raised about how to maximize the ecological validity of the neuropsychological assessment. Since most of our activities of daily living are multisensory and older adults benefit from multisensory information, MI assessment has the potential to improve the ecological validity of the neuropsychological assessment.","output":"Narrative review of the multisensory integration tasks used with older adults: inclusion of multisensory integration tasks into neuropsychological assessment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19-infected patients require an intact immune system to suppress viral replication and prevent complications. However, the complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection that led to death were linked to the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines known as cytokine storm syndrome. This article reported the various checkpoints targeted to manage the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm. The literature search was carried out using PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. Journal articles that discussed SARS-CoV-2 infection and cytokine storm were retrieved and appraised. Specific checkpoints identified in managing SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine storm include a decrease in the level of Nod-Like Receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome where drugs such as quercetin and anakinra were effective. Janus kinase-2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (JAK2/STAT1) signaling pathways were blocked by medicines such as tocilizumab, baricitinib, and quercetin. In addition, inhibition of interleukin (IL)-6 with dexamethasone, tocilizumab, and sarilumab effectively treats cytokine storm and significantly reduces mortality caused by COVID-19. Blockade of IL-1 with drugs such as canakinumab and anakinra, and inhibition of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) with zanubrutinib and ibrutinib was also beneficial. These agents' overall mechanisms of action involve a decrease in circulating proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines and or blockade of their receptors. Consequently, the actions of these drugs significantly improve respiration and raise lymphocyte count and PaO2/FiO2 ratio.

The factors that contribute to the limited adoption of DHT, particularly in cardiovascular settings, are unclear. The objective of this review was to determine the barriers and facilitators of DHT uptake from the perspective of patients, clinicians, and researchers. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases for studies published from inception to May 2020 that reported barriers and/or facilitators of DHT adoption in cardiovascular care. We extracted data on study design, setting, cardiovascular condition, and type of DHT. We conducted a thematic analysis to identify barriers and facilitators of DHT uptake. The search identified 3075 unique studies, of which 29 studies met eligibility criteria. Studies employed: qualitative methods (n = 13), which included interviews and focus groups; quantitative methods (n = 5), which included surveys; or a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods (n = 11). Twenty-five studies reported patient-level barriers, most common of which were difficult-to-use technology (n=7) and a poor internet connection (n=7). Six studies reported clinician-level barriers, which included increased workload (n=4) and a lack of integration with electronic medical records (n=3).Twenty-four studies reported patient-level facilitators, which included improved communication with clinicians (n=10) and personalized technology (n=6). Four studies reported clinician-level facilitators, which included approval and organizational support from cardiology departments and/or hospitals (n=3) and technologies that improved efficiency (n=3). No studies reported researcher-level barriers or facilitators. In summary, internet access, user-friendliness, organizational support, workflow efficiency, and data integration were reported as important factors in the uptake of DHT by patients and clinicians.

After adjusting for clinical demographics and comorbidities, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: The most common presenting symptoms of COVID-19 in patients that were admitted to the hospital were cough (38.4%), shortness of breath (37.5%), and fever (34.3%), followed by GI symptoms in 25.9% of patients. The most common GI symptom was diarrhea (12.8%) followed by nausea or vomiting (10.5%), decreased appetite (9.3%), and abdominal pain (3.8%).

The oral cavity alone is home to hundreds of different bacteria. In this study, we examined the metabolic activity of oral bacteria from healthy males during commercial heliox saturation diving. We focused on environmentally induced changes that might affect the divers' health and fitness. Methods: We performed pathway abundance analysis using PICRUSt2, a bioinformatics software package that uses marker gene data to compute the metabolic activity of microbial communities. The analysis is based on 16S rRNA metagenomic data generated from the oral microbiota of 23 male divers before, during, and after 4weeks of commercial heliox saturation diving. Environmentally induced changes in bacterial metabolism were computed from differences in predicted pathway abundances at baseline before, versus during, and immediately after saturation diving. Results and Conclusion: The analysis predicted transient changes that were primarily associated with the survival and growth of bacteria in oxygenated environments. There was a relative increase in the abundance of aerobic metabolic pathways and a concomitant decrease in anaerobic metabolic pathways, primarily comprising of energy metabolism, oxidative stress responses, and adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis. Adenosylcobalamin is a bioactive form of vitamin B12 (vitB12), and a reduction in vitB12 biosynthesis may hypothetically affect the divers' physiology. While host effects of oral bacterial vitamin metabolism are uncertain, this is a finding that concurs with the existing recommendations for vitB12 supplements as part of the divers' diet, whether to boost antioxidant defenses in bacteria or their host or to improve oxygen transport during saturation diving.","output":"Functional Profiling Reveals Altered Metabolic Activity in Divers' Oral Microbiota During Commercial Heliox Saturation Diving"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Several recent studies have stated that glycyrrhizin and licorice extract are present in most traditional Chinese medicine formulas used against SARS-CoV-2 in China Significant data are showing that glycyrrhizin and licorice extract have multiple beneficial activities in combating most features of SARS-CoV-2 Purpose The aim of current review was to highlight recent progresses in research that showed the evidence of the potential use of glycyrrhizin and licorice extract against COVID-19 Methodology We have reviewed the information published from 1979 to October 2020 These studies demonstrated the effects , use and safety of glycyrrhizin and icorice extract against viral infections,bacterial infections, inflammatory disorders of lung ( in vitro and in vivo) These studies were collated through online electronic databases research (Academic libraries as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Egyptian Knowledge Bank) Results Pooled effect size of articles provides information about the rationale for using glycyrrhizin and licorice extract to treat COVID-19 Fifty studies demonstrate antiviral activity of glycyrrhizin and licorice extract The most frequent mechanism of the antiviral activity is due to disrupting viral uptake into the host cells and disrupting the interaction between receptor- binding domain (RBD) of SARS-COV2 and ACE2 in recent articles Fifty studies indicate that glycyrrhizin and licorice extract have significant antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects Twenty five studies provide evidence for the protective effect of glycyrrhizin and licorice extract against inflammation-induced acute lung injury and cardiovascular disorders Conclusion The current study showed several evidence regarding the beneficial effects of glycyrrhizin and licorice extract in combating COVID-19 More randomized clinical trials are needed to obtain a precise conclusion","output":"The potential of glycyrrhizin and licorice extract in combating COVID-19 and associated conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Nowadays, it is clear for the whole world that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic had substantial consequences on various sectors including social, economic and education.

Limitations to these applications still exist due in part to the need for more robust structural support, organization, and electromechanical function of engineered cardiac tissues. It is well accepted that heterotypic cellular interactions impact the phenotype of cardiomyocytes. The current study evaluates the functional effects of coculturing adult human cardiac fibroblasts (hCFs) in 3D engineered tissues on excitation and contraction with the goal of recapitulating healthy, nonarrhythmogenic myocardium in vitro. A small population (5% of total cell number) of hCFs in tissues improves tissue formation, material properties, and contractile function. However, two perturbations to the hCF population create disease-like phenotypes in engineered cardiac tissues. First, increasing the percentage of hCFs to 15% resulted in tissues with increased ectopic activity and spontaneous excitation rate. Second, hCFs undergo myofibroblast activation in traditional two-dimensional culture, and this altered phenotype ablated the functional benefits of hCFs when incorporated into engineered cardiac tissues. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that human cardiac fibroblast number and activation state modulate electromechanical function of hiPSC-cardiomyocytes and that a low percentage of quiescent hCFs are a valuable cell source to advance a healthy electromechanical response of engineered cardiac tissue for regenerative medicine applications.","output":"Human Cardiac Fibroblast Number and Activation State Modulate Electromechanical Function of hiPSC-Cardiomyocytes in Engineered Myocardium."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We establish an existence theory for an elliptic boundary value problem in image analysis known as edge-enhancing diffusion (EED) inpainting.

We evaluated whether modifiable lifestyle factors including educational attainment, smoking, and body mass index are causal risk factors for ischemic stroke and its subtypes and hemorrhagic stroke. METHODS: We performed 2-sample and multivariable Mendelian randomization to assess the causal effect of 12 lifestyle factors on risk of stroke and whether these effects are independent. RESULTS: Genetically predicted years of education was inversely associated with ischemic, large artery, and small vessel stroke, and intracerebral hemorrhage. Genetically predicted smoking, body mass index, and waist-hip ratio were associated with ischemic and large artery stroke. The effects of education, body mass index, and smoking on ischemic stroke were independent. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypothesis that reduced education and increased smoking and obesity increase risk of ischemic, large artery, and small vessel stroke, suggesting that lifestyle modifications addressing these risk factors will reduce stroke risk.","output":"Modifiable Lifestyle Factors and Risk of Stroke: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Patients recovering from an episode in an intensive care unit (ICU) frequently experience medication errors on transition to the hospital ward. Structured handover recommendations often underestimate the challenges and complexity of ICU patient transitions. For adult ICU patients transitioning to a hospital ward, it is currently unclear what interventions reduce the risks of medication errors.The aims were to examine the impact of medication-related interventions on medication and patient outcomes on transition from adult ICU settings and identify barriers and facilitators to implementation. METHODS The systematic review protocol was preregistered on PROSPERO. Six electronic databases were searched until October 2020 for controlled and uncontrolled study designs that reported medication-related (ie, de-prescribing; medication errors) or patient-related outcomes (ie, mortality; length of stay). Risk of bias (RoB) assessment used V.2.0 and ROBINS-I Cochrane tools. Where feasible, random-effects meta-analysis was used for pooling the OR across studies. The quality of evidence was assessed by Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations. RESULTS Seventeen studies were eligible, 15 (88%) were uncontrolled before-after studies. The intervention components included education of staff (n=8 studies), medication review (n=7), guidelines (n=6), electronic transfer/handover tool or letter (n=4) and medicines reconciliation (n=4). Overall, pooled analysis of all interventions reduced risk of inappropriate medication continuation at ICU discharge (OR=0.45 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.63), I2=55%, n=9) and hospital discharge (OR=0.39 (95% CI 0.2 to 0.76), I2=75%, n=9). Multicomponent interventions, based on education of staff and guidelines, demonstrated no significant difference in inappropriate medication continuation at the ICU discharge point (OR 0.5 (95% CI 0.22 to 1.11), I2=62%, n=4), but were very effective in increasing de-prescribing outcomes on hospital discharge (OR 0.26 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.55), I2=67%, n=6)). Facilitators to intervention delivery included ICU clinical pharmacist availability and participation in multiprofessional ward rounds, while barriers included increased workload associated with the discharge intervention process. CONCLUSIONS Multicomponent interventions based on education of staff and guidelines were effective at achieving almost four times more de-prescribing of inappropriate medication by the time of patient hospital discharge. Based on the findings, practice and policy recommendations are made and guidance is provided on the need for, and design of theory informed interventions in this area, including the requirement for process and economic evaluations.","output":"Medication-related interventions to improve medication safety and patient outcomes on transition from adult intensive care settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide and poses a severe health risk. While most patients present mild symptoms, descending pneumonia can lead to severe respiratory insufficiency. Up to 50% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea or nausea, intriguingly associating with prolonged symptoms and increased severity. Thus, models to understand and validate drug efficiency in COVID-19 patients are of urgent need. METHODS: Human intestinal organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSC-HIOs) have led, due to their complexity in mimicking human intestinal architecture, to an unprecedented number of successful disease models including gastrointestinal infections. Here, we employed PSC-HIOs to dissect SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and its inhibition by remdesivir, one of the leading drugs investigated for treatment of COVID-19. RESULTS: Immunostaining for viral entry receptor ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein priming protease TMPRSS2 showed broad expression in the gastrointestinal tract with highest levels in the intestine, the latter faithfully recapitulated by PSC-HIOs. Organoids could be readily infected with SARS-CoV-2 followed by viral spread across entire PSC-HIOs, subsequently leading to organoid deterioration. However, SARS-CoV-2 spared goblet cells lacking ACE2 expression. Importantly, we challenged PSC-HIOs for drug testing capacity. Specifically, remdesivir effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection dose-dependently at low micromolar concentration and rescued PSC-HIO morphology. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, PSC-HIOs are a valuable tool to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and to identify and validate drugs especially with potential action in the gut.","output":"Drug Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Replication in Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Intestinal Organoids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has disturbed the victims' economic conditions and posed a significant threat to economies worldwide and their respective financial markets.

However, due to the low viral load specimens and the limitations of RT-PCR, significant numbers of false negative reports are inevitable, which results in failure to timely diagnose, cut off transmission, and assess discharge criteria. To improve this situation, an optimized droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which showed that the limit of detection of ddPCR is significantly lower than that of RT-PCR. We further explored the feasibility of ddPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 77 patients, and compared with RT-PCR in terms of the diagnostic accuracy based on the results of follow-up survey. 26 patients of COVID-19 with negative RT-PCR reports were reported as positive by ddPCR.

We aimed to comprehensively quantify the association between mental and neurological disorders, both pre-existing and subsequent, and the risk of susceptibility, severity and mortality of COVID-19. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane library databases for studies published from the inception up to January 16, 2021 and updated at July 7, 2021. Observational studies including cohort and case-control, cross-sectional studies and case series that reported risk estimates of the association between mental or neurological disorders and COVID-19 susceptibility, illness severity and mortality were included. Two researchers independently extracted data and conducted the quality assessment. Based on I(2) heterogeneity, we used a random effects model to calculate pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Subgroup analyses and meta-regression analysis were also performed. This study was registered on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD 42021230832). FINDING: A total of 149 studies (227,351,954 participants, 89,235,737 COVID-19 patients) were included in this analysis, in which 27 reported morbidity (132,727,798), 56 reported illness severity (83,097,968) and 115 reported mortality (88,878,662). Overall, mental and neurological disorders were associated with a significant high risk of infection (pre-existing mental: OR 167, 95% CI 112-249; and pre-existing neurological: 205, 158-267), illness severity (mental: pre-existing, 140, 125-157; sequelae, 485, 253-932; neurological: pre-existing, 143, 109-188; sequelae, 217, 145-324), and mortality (mental: pre-existing, 147, 126-172; neurological: pre-existing, 208, 161-269; sequelae, 203, 166-249) from COVID-19. Subgroup analysis revealed that association with illness severity was stronger among younger COVID-19 patients, and those with subsequent mental disorders, living in low- and middle-income regions. Younger patients with mental and neurological disorders were associated with higher mortality than elders. For type-specific mental disorders, susceptibility to contracting COVID-19 was associated with pre-existing mood disorders, anxiety, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); illness severity was associated with both pre-existing and subsequent mood disorders as well as sleep disturbance; and mortality was associated with pre-existing schizophrenia. For neurological disorders, susceptibility was associated with pre-existing dementia; both severity and mortality were associated with subsequent delirium and altered mental status; besides, mortality was associated with pre-existing and subsequent dementia and multiple specific neurological diseases. Heterogeneities were substantial across studies in most analysis. INTERPRETATION: The findings show an important role of mental and neurological disorders in the context of COVID-19 and provide clues and directions for identifying and protecting vulnerable populations in the pandemic. Early detection and intervention for neurological and mental disorders are urgently needed to control morbidity and mortality induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there was substantial heterogeneity among the included studies, and the results should be interpreted with caution. More studies are needed to explore long-term mental and neurological sequela, as well as the underlying brain mechanisms for the sake of elucidating the causal pathways for these associations.

Sarawak, the largest state in Malaysia has consistently recorded the highest cervical cancer rate in the country where nearly half of its population still live in the rural areas and is at increased risk of the disease due to inequitable access to healthcare. The countrywide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic had halted the accessibility to cervical cancer screening programme. The aim of the study is to determine the feasibility of providing primary HPV DNA test using the selfsampling method to the hard-to-reach population in the interior of Sarawak during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a cross-sectional study where women aged between 20-80 years were recruited via convenient sampling from villages in Long Banga, Sarawak over a five-day outreach programme. Cervicovaginal selfsamples were obtained and screened for the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus DNA (HR-HPV) using the careHPVTM Test. A self-administered questionnaire was also administered to determine the sociodemographic and perception towards the self-sampling method. RESULTS The 55 women recruited consist of ethnic backgrounds of Penan (58.18%), Kenyah (25.45%), Iban (5.45%), Saban (3.64%), Kelabit (3.64%), Malay (1.82%) and Chinese (1.82%). The prevalence of HR-HPV was 1.85% (n=1/55). Nearly 80% of the women were unemployed, and more than half have had attended primary education. Nine (16.4%) have heard about HPV, and seven (13%) knew HPV infection could cause cervical cancer. Three of them had HPV vaccination, and only one (1.85%) knew the brand of the HPV vaccine. Although 40% preferred self-sampling over clinician-collection, only ten (18.2%) women have completed the self-collection perception questionnaire.

Secondary cytoreductive surgery (SCS) is commonly offered at recurrence, although any benefit this has on survival is not fully determined. This review evaluates the impact of SCS, including residual disease, on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in recurrent LGSC. METHODS A comprehensive search of Medline ALL, Embase Classic + Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Web of Science was conducted to obtain studies evaluating optimal or complete SCS versus suboptimal SCS and the amount of residual disease in recurrent LGSC. Meta-analysis was performed and PFS and OS outcomes were calculated. RESULTS 1Of 5296 studies screened, 350 progressed to full-text review, with 9 ultimately selected for inclusion in the systematic review. Two studies met criteria for meta-analysis of PFS and of OS. The presence of visible residual disease at the conclusion of SCS negatively impacted PFS (HR = 3.51, 95% CI = 1.72-7.14), whereas SCS with no residual disease significantly improved OS (HR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.23-0.7) in patients with recurrent LGSC. Diffuse and extensive disease distribution was inversely linked to survival. In addition, SCS as an initial treatment for recurrent LGSC was associated with superior survival in comparison to chemotherapy. A short platinum-free interval was not associated with worse survival in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS Complete SCS, and to a lesser extent optimal SCS, are associated with improved PFS and OS in patients with recurrent LGSC. SCS may be a better initial treatment strategy than systemic chemotherapy for recurrent disease. Patients with recurrent LGSC should be evaluated for the role of SCS based on disease distribution and functional status, irrespective of the platinum-free interval.

DESIGN Retrospective observational study SETTING Son Llatzer University Hospital in Palma de Mallorca (Spain) PARTICIPANTS Among a cohort of 52 hospitalized patients as of 31 March 2020, 48 with complete demographic information and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive test, were analyzed. Data were collected between March 15th, 2020, and March 31th 2020, inclusive of these dates. MAIN OUTCOMES Clinical, vital signs and routine laboratory outcomes at the time of hospitalization, including symptoms reported prior to hospitalization. Demographics and baseline comorbidities were also collected. Mortality was reported at the end of the study. RESULTS 48 patients (27 non-ICU and 21 ICU) resident in Mallorca, Spain (mean age, 66 years, [range, 33-88 years]; 67% males) with positive SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed. There were no differences in age or sex among groups (p >.05). Initial symptoms included fever (100%), coughing (85%), dyspnea (76%), diarrhea (42%) and asthenia (21%). The majority of patients in this case series were hospitalized because of low SpO2 (SpO2 below 90%) and presentation of bilateral pneumonia (94%) at triage. ICU patients had a higher prevalence of dyspnea compared to non-ICU patients (95% vs 61%, p = .022). Acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) was presented in 100% of the ICU-patients. All the patients included in the study required oxygen therapy. ICU-patients had lymphopenia as well as hypoalbuminemia. Inflammatory markers such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin were significantly higher in ICU patients compared to non-ICU (p < .001).Lower albumin levels were associated with poor prognosis measured as longer hospital length (r= -0.472, p <.001) and mortality (r= -0.424, p=.003). Interestingly we also found, that MCV was lower among of those patients who died (p=.0002). As of April 28, 2020, 10 patients (8 ICU and 2 non-ICU) had died (21% mortality) and while 100% of the non-ICU patients had been discharged, 33% of ICU patients still remained hospitalized (5 in ICU and 2 had been transferred to ward). CONCLUSION Critically ill patients with COVID-19 present lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia as well high levels of inflammation. Lower levels of albumin were associated with poorer outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Albumin might be of importance because of its association with disease severity in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Low albumin levels are associated with poorer outcomes in a case series of COVID-19 patients in Spain: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the development of newer meshes and approaches to hernia repair, it is currently difficult to evaluate their performances while considering the patients' perspective.

Studies have shown that serum and plasma miRNAs have the potential to be promising biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the diagnostic and prognostic performance of exosomal miRNAs in thyroid cancer. Our study analysis included 12 articles. We found that specific exosomal miRNAs found in blood provide high diagnostic value with high sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, certain panels of exosomal microRNAs showed remarkable diagnostic value. The best discriminative ability to differentiate between cancer and non-cancer individuals were for miR-146b-5p + miR-223-5p + miR-182-5p. The novel and non-invasive use of miRNAs to diagnose TC can significantly improve patient outcomes by preventing the burden of unnecessary surgery and providing prognosis information on thyroid cancer. ABSTRACT: Circulatory tumor-derived exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in cancer development/progression. We aimed to assess the diagnostic/prognostic value of circulating exosomal miRNA in thyroid cancer (TC). A search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct up to 22 May 2021 was performed. The true/false positive (TP/FP) and true/false negative (TN/FN) rates were extracted from each eligible study to obtain the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative likelihood ratios (PLR/NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). The meta-analysis included 12 articles consisting of 1164 Asian patients and 540 controls. All miRNAs were quantified using qRT-PCR assays. The pooled sensitivity was 82% (95%CI = 77C86%), pooled specificity was 76% (95%CI = 71C80%), and pooled DOR was 13.6 (95%CI = 8.8C21.8). The best biomarkers with high sensitivity were miR-16-2-3p (94%), miR-223-5p (91%), miR-130a-3p (90%), and miR182-5p (94%). Similarly, they showed high specificity, in addition to miR-34c-5p. Six panels of two to four exosomal miRNAs showed higher diagnostic values with an area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.906 to 0.981. The best discriminative ability to differentiate between cancer and non-cancer individuals was observed for miR-146b-5p + miR-223-5p + miR-182-5p (AUC = 0.981, sensitivity = 93.8% (84.9C98.3), specificity = 92.9% (76.5C99.1)).

Its adult form (Taenia) lodges in the small intestine of canids and can infect several intermediate hosts. Sheep are the main species affected by the disease, having nervous symptoms as one of its manifestations. This study aimed to describe the changes observed in computed tomography, as well as the clinical findings of a case of Cenurosis in a sheep on the western border of Rio Grande do Sul. Case: A ram was referred to the Centro Universitrio da Regi?o da Campanha (URCAMP) with neurological signs. Clinical, hematological, radiographic, tomographic and necroscopic evaluation of the animal was performed. There were no significant hematological and radiographic changes. During the neurological examination, corneal opacity was found in the right eyeball, associated with a visual deficit in the same eye. Also, when stimulated to move, it was possible to observe ataxia with ambulation to the left side, with right lateral displacement of the head. The tomography showed a hypodense area of approximately 3 cm at the base of the brain, in the region of the thalamus and third ventricle. Macroscopically, a translucent spherical cyst with approximately 4 cm in diameter was observed, containing the protoescolex/scolices of Taenia multiceps in the same region. Discussion: Computed tomography identified the presence of an apparently circular volume of approximately 4 cm in diameter, causing ventricular dilatation. This evidence of ventricular dilation corroborates aspects described in the literature, which found bilateral dilation of the ventricles by compression promoted by a cyst in the 4th ventricle. As the location of the cyst was located at the base of the brain, in the region of the third ventricle, it would be difficult to perform the surgery in the treatment of this case. Signs of ataxia, walking movements, decreased reflexes, nystagmus, unilateral blindness and lateral decubitus are commonly observed. Reports described that the main neurological alterations observed in 20 sheep with cenurosis were postural deficit, locomotion alteration, visual deficit and behavioral alterations, with more than 50% of the animals showing at least one of these signs. The main neurological signs observed in the case described were changes in gait, with walking, blindness, lateral head deviation and ataxia. These signs guide the clinical diagnosis of cenurosis. At necropsy, a spherical translucent cyst with approximately 4 cm in diameter was observed, containing the protoescolex/scolices of Taenia multiceps, which extended dorsally from the third ventricle to the base of the thalamus, laterally displaced to the right side. Rostrocaudal the lesion extended rostrally across the entire length of the thalamus to the beginning of the caudate nucleus and caudally to the base of the caudal colliculus, causing compression of the adjacent parenchyma, enabling the diagnosis of cenurosis. Similar findings are described as Coenurus cerebralis. This lesion pattern macroscopically characterizes the parasite lesions. Thus, it is concluded that the visualization of a hypodense area in CNS regions of sheep with neurological signs allows the diagnosis of cenurosis and precise location of the lesion. The description of this case adds information so that other professionals in the field can be successful in diagnosing the disease.","output":"Cenurose em ovino com sinais neurolgicos - diagnstico com tomografia computadorizada/ Cenurosis in a sheep with neurological signs - diagnosis with computed tomography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main protease of SARS\\\\associated coronavirus (SARS\\\\CoV), also called 3C\\\\like protease (3CL(pro)), is vital for the viral replication.

Here, we explored the potential role of cross-reactive immunity acquired from pediatric vaccinations and exposure to common human pathogens in the protection and pathology of COVID-19. To that end, we sought for peptide matches to SARS-CoV-2 (identity  80%, in at least eight residues) in the proteomes of 25 human pathogens and in vaccine antigens, and subsequently predicted their T and B cell reactivity to identify potential cross-reactive epitopes. We found that viruses subject to pediatric vaccinations do not contain cross-reactive epitopes with SARS-CoV-2, precluding that they can provide any general protection against COVID-19. Likewise, common viruses including rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and several herpesviruses are also poor or null sources of cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2, discarding that immunological memory against these viruses can have any general protective or pathological role in COVID-19. In contrast, we found combination vaccines for treating diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis infectious diseases (DTP vaccine) to be significant sources of potential cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2. DTP cross-reactive epitopes with SARS-CoV-2 include numerous CD8 and CD4 T cell epitopes with broad population protection coverage and potentially neutralizing B cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Worldwide, children receive several DTP vaccinations, including three-four doses the first year of life and one at 4C6 years of age. Moreover, a low antigenic Tdap dose is also given at ages 9C14.

Despite editorials evaluating neurosurgery responses to 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), data reporting effects of COVID-19 on neurosurgical case volume, census, and resident illness are lacking. The aim of this study was to present a real-world analysis of neurosurgical volumes, resident deployment, and unique challenges encountered during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 outbreak peak in New York City. METHODS: Daily census and case volume data were prospectively collected throughout the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 outbreak in spring 2020. Neurosurgical census was compared against COVID-19 system-wide data. Neurosurgical cases during the crisis were analyzed and compared with 7-week periods from 2019 and early 2020. Resident deployment and illness were reviewed. RESULTS: From March 16, 2020, to May 5, 2020, residents participated in 72 operations and 69 endovascular procedures compared with 448 operations and 253 endovascular procedures from January 2020 to February 2020 and 530 operations and 340 endovascular procedures from March 2019 to May 2019. There was a 59% reduction in neurosurgical census during the outbreak (median 24 patients, 2.75 average total cases daily). COVID-19 neurosurgical admissions peaked in concert with the system-wide pandemic. Three residents demonstrated COVID-19 symptoms (no hospitalizations occurred) for a total 24 workdays lost (median 7 workdays).

As a result of a wider analysis of past crisis-management feedback, we define the term crisis and propose a crisis-management cycle, along with a set of decision support activities. From a system point of view, crisis management functionalities are structured along three crucial steps: information gathering, situation understanding, and decision making. For each step, the processes involved are described and for each one some relevant techniques are proposed to implement the processes. For the information-gathering step, the use of ontology allows the building and structuring of a coherent -situation model. The initial overall picture of the situation, obtained by some on-line -information extraction and fusion, is then consolidated in the situation understanding step to provide meaningful real-time situation awareness. This provides the essential base to derive the final decision-making step. In the decision phase, the context has a dual impact on the decision-making process; the context first constrains the resolution of the resource allocation problem, but it also contributes to discriminate between several resource allocation solutions. It is thus shown that each step of the crisis management process relies on the availability and quality of the crisis context, and that this in-time contextualisation is required to enhance the overall process of crisis management. To summarise, this chapter highlights the key role of situation understanding for crisis management and reveals the crucial necessity of in-time contextualisation at each step of the crisis management process.","output":"The Role of Context for Crisis Management Cycle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study describes the development of SYBR Green based real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) for detection and quantitation of canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV 2) in faecal samples of dogs.

The model is calibrated on international case introductions at the early stage of the pandemic.

RESULTS: Care process redesign was accomplished in a concentrated effort involving clinicians and educators.

The LMS was refined by input from team members provided through the authoring tool directly to the educator on the screens where the edit was applicable. The LMS was deployed after four days to more than 100 surgical team members who managed their first COVID-19 patient two days later. The number of COVID-19 patients managed was limited, but there were no untoward patient events and no staff exposure.

Moreover, CpG-c41 attenuated excessive inflammation in the imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like mouse model of skin inflammation by suppressing immune cell infiltration and release of inflammatory factors. We also found evidence that the immunosuppressive effects of CpG-c41 on other intracellular TLRs are mediated by a TLR9-independent mechanism. These results suggest that CpG-c41 acts as an upstream of signaling cascades, perhaps on the processes of ligand internalization and transfer.

Data sources We conducted searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature, and in a centralized repository in LOVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). LOVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from the Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, LOVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customized to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. All the searches covered the period until 23 April 2020 (one day before submission). Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods We adapted an already published standard protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We searched for randomized trials evaluating the effectiveness and safety of cell-based therapies versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Anticipating the lack of randomized trials directly addressing this question, we also searched for trials evaluating other coronavirus infections, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and nonrandomized studies in COVID-19. Two reviewers independently screened each study for eligibility. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit this review to a peer-reviewed journal every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. Results We screened 1 043 records, but no study was considered eligible. We identified 61 ongoing studies, including 39 randomized trials evaluating different types of cell-based therapies in COVID-19. Conclusions We did not find any studies that met our inclusion criteria, and hence there is no evidence to support or refute the use of cell-based therapies for treating patients with COVID-19.

Both genomes possess a large deletion in pol, indicating that they are defective retroviruses. Phylogenetic analysis places RlRV and MlRV within the diversity of mammalian gammaretroviruses, with the former falling closer to porcine endogenous retroviruses and the latter to Mus dunni endogenous virus, koala retrovirus and gibbon ape leukemia virus. Additional genomic mining suggests that both microbat (Myotis lucifugus) and megabat (Pteropus vampyrus) genomes harbour many copies of endogenous retroviral forms related to RlRV and MlRV. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis reveals the presence of three genetically diverse groups of endogenous gammaretroviruses in bat genomes, with M. lucifugus possessing members of all three groups.

CO-CEAL engaged urban Hispanic/LatinX, rural Hispanic/LatinX, urban African/American, rural African Immigrant and urban American Indian/Alaska Native communities through Community Connectors in each community. Our Community Connectors led recruitment of community members for our community survey data collection (goal of 200 surveys from each community) and participation in our 5 Community (Boot Camp) Translations. Where possible we worked with Community Connectors and leveraged community relationships with whom we had worked over multiple years and projects. In two communities we worked to quickly build and establish new relationships with Community Connectors and their communities. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: The rapid nature of the CO-CEAL project, its timeline and the unusual nature of the funding mechanism required adaptations to usual ways of working on both the academic and community side.In our CO-CEAL partner communities where there was a history of working together, concerns, possible barriers and other issues tended to be rapidly addressed. The prior existing, long-standing relationships fostered trust that enabled open airing of concerns and an ability to address issues as they arose. In CO-CEAL partner communities where new relationships were being forged, trust needed to be build from the ground up. This made adaptations more challenging and the ability to address concerns and issues as they arose more problematic. Although the work has moved forward in all communities, extra care has been required in some. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: When crises necessitate rapid action in communities, the depth of prior investments in building and maintaining relationships makes a difference in how rapidly and successfully partners can work together to address a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic.

The goal of the current study was to assess the association of COVID-19 clinical courses controlled by patients adaptive immune responses without progression to severe disease with patients Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genetics, the presence or absence of near-loss-of-function delta 32 deletion mutant of C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) and AB0 blood group antigens. We further analyzed the association of these immunogenetic background characteristics with patients humoral antiviral immune response patterns, assessed longitudinally. The study enrolled 157 convalescent adult patients followed up for up to 250 days. Univariate HLA analyses identified putatively protective HLA alleles (HLA class II DRB1*01:01 and HLA class I B*35:01, with a trend for DRB1*03:01) associated with reduced durations of disease and decreased (rather than increased) total anti-S IgG levels providing virus neutralizing capacity comparable to non-carriers. Conversely, analyses also identified HLA alleles (HLA class II DQB1*03:2 und HLA class I B*15:01) not associated with such benefit in the patient cohort of this study. Hierarchical testing by Cox regression analyses confirmed the significance of the protective effect of the HLA alleles identified (when assessed in composite) in terms of disease duration, whereas AB0 blood group antigen heterozygosity was found to be significantly associated with disease severity (rather than duration) in our cohort. A seeming association of a heterozygous CCR5 delta 32 mutation with prolonged disease duration suggested by univariate analyses was not confirmed by hierarchical multivariate testing.In conclusion, the current study shows that the presence of certain \\"protective\\" HLA alleles is of even stronger association with reduced duration of mild and moderate COVID-19 than age or any other potential risk factor assessed. Prospective studies in larger patient populations assessing the impact of HLA genetics on the capacity of mounting protective vaccination responses may be warranted.","output":"Association of HLA and Mutated CCR5 With the Clinical Course of the Disease in Subjects With mild / moderate disease following COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fundamental aim of this study is to determine the effects of prolonged usage of N95 respirators and surgical facemasks amid health care workers in our institution.

Fear of illness and uncertainty about the future precipitate anxiety- and stress-related disorders, and several groups have rightfully called for the creation and dissemination of robust mental health screening and treatment programs for the general public and front-line healthcare workers. However, in addition to pandemic-associated psychological distress, the direct effects of the virus itself (several acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2), and the subsequent host immunologic response, on the human central nervous system (CNS) and related outcomes are unknown. We discuss currently available evidence of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric sequelae while drawing parallels to past viral pandemic-related outcomes. Past pandemics have demonstrated that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as encephalopathy, mood changes, psychosis, neuromuscular dysfunction, or demyelinating processes, may accompany acute viral infection, or may follow infection by weeks, months, or longer in recovered patients. The potential mechanisms are also discussed, including viral and immunological underpinnings. Therefore, prospective neuropsychiatric monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at various points in the life course, as well as their neuroimmune status, are needed to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, and to establish a framework for integrating psychoneuroimmunology into epidemiologic studies of pandemics.","output":"Are we facing a crashing wave of neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19?

METHODS: All OSCC patients treated radically with IMRT (without primary surgery) between 2005-2014 were reviewed in a prospectively collected database. OSCC patients treated with definitive RT received concurrent chemotherapy except for early stage patients or those who declined or were unfit for chemotherapy. The 5-year local, and regional, distant control rates, disease-free, overall, and cancer-specific survival, and late toxicity were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 1316 OSCC patients treated with curative-intent; 108 patients (8%) received non-operative management due to: medical inoperability (n=14, 13%), surgical unresectability (n=8, 7%), patient declined surgery (n=15, 14%), attempted preservation of oral structure/function in view of required extensive surgery (n=53, 49%) or extensive oropharyngeal involvement (n=18, 17%). Sixty-eight (63%) were cT3-4, 38 (35%) were cN2-3, and 38 (35%) received concurrent chemotherapy.

Procedural success, technical complications, clinical outcome at 1 month, and immediate and 3- to 6-month angiographic follow-up results were analyzed. RESULTS Ten patients with unruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysms with a mean neck diameter of 5.4 mm were treated with the WEB. Treatment failed in 3 of the 10 aneurysms without further clinical complications. One patient developed a procedural thromboembolic event, and the other 6 had normal neurologic examination findings at 1-month follow-up. Immediate anatomic outcome evaluation showed adequate occlusion (total occlusion or neck remnant) in 6 of 7 patients.

Our model features three sets of adjustable parameters, which characterize (i) viral transmission, (ii) viral detection, and (iii) degree of personal mobility, and as such, it is able to provide a qualitative assessment of the potential for second-wave infection outbreaks based on the timing, extent, and pattern of the lockdown relaxation strategies. Our results suggest that a full lockdown will yield the lowest number of infections (as anticipated) but we also found that when personal mobility exceeded a critical level, infections increased, quickly reaching a plateau that depended solely on the population density. Confinement was not effective if not accompanied by a detection/quarantine capacity surpassing 40% of the symptomatic patients. Finally, taking action to ensure a viral transmission probability of less than 0.4, which, in real life, may mean actions such as social distancing or mask-wearing, could be as effective as a soft lockdown.","output":"Stochastic modelling of the effects of human-mobility restriction and viral infection characteristics on the spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The controlled, site-specific ligation of molecules to native DNA remains an unanswered challenge Herein, we report a simple solution to achieve this ligation through the tactical combination of two recently developed technologies: One for the manipulation of DNA in organic media, and another for the chemoselective labeling of alcohols Reversible Adsorption of Solid Support (RASS) is employed to immobilize DNA and facilitate its transfer into dry acetonitrile Subsequent ligation with P(V)-based ? reagents takes place in high yield with exquisite selectivity for the exposed 3a? or 5a? alcohols on DNA This two-stage process, dubbed SENDR for Synthetic Elaboration of Native DNA by RASS, can be applied to a multitude of DNA conformations and sequences with a variety of functionalized ? reagents to generate useful constructs Such entities can address numerous longstanding challenges, including the selective single coupling of DNA to proteins, ASOs, and functional small molecules, and also can allow the synthesis of doubly-labeled congeners for novel probe constructs including ones of potential interest to COVID-19 research Finally, a prototype for the industrialization of SENDR in a kit format is presented","output":"Synthetic Elaboration of Native DNA by RASS (SENDR)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aberdeen Fertility Centre provides fertility investigation and treatment across the north east, highlands and islands (Orkney & Shetland) of Scotland, which includes rural and remote communities.

No Delays (series of video packages and virtual consultations) has revolutionised clinical pathways, providing individualised patient information from investigation to treatment, permitting email prescription of digital postcards (personalised package of short videos introducing members of the team and explaining their role) that explain the fertility journey and management plan in detail, from investigation (ie., tubal evaluation), to treatment (ie., ovulation induction or IVF), and self-administration of medicines. Thereafter, patients receive invitation to virtual Near Me consultation which can take place in the comfort of their own home whilst acknowledging flexibility in lifestyle (partner can remotely access consultation from workplace, including overseas). Electronic patient records (EPRs) provide immediate access to complete, accurate and up to date clinical patient data, which, together with Electronic Consents compliment the tele-nursing experience through a complete library of consent forms, automatically allocated to patient and partner according to treatment type and personal circumstances: information being provided in video format to meet the requirements for informed consent. Forms are completed online, at home or in the virtual clinic via computers, tablets or smartphones, with workflow automation tools allowing for digital signature/s.

Vaccine-induced T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, may thus be the main mediators of protection at this early stage. The details of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell induction after prime/boost vaccination, their comparison to naturally induced CD8+ T cell responses and their association with other arms of vaccine-induced adaptive immunity remain, however, incompletely understood. Here, we show on a single epitope level that both, a stable memory precursor pool of spike-specific CD8+ T cells and fully functional spike-specific effector CD8+ T cell populations, are vigorously mobilized as early as one week after prime vaccination when CD4+ T cell and spike-specific antibody responses are still weak and neutralizing antibodies are lacking. Boost vaccination after 3 weeks induced a full-fledged recall expansion generating highly differentiated CD8+ effector T cells, however, neither the functional capacity nor the memory precursor T cell pool was affected. Compared to natural infection, vaccine-induced early memory T cells exhibited similar frequencies and functional capacities but a different subset distribution dominated by effector memory T cells at the expense of self-renewing and multipotent central memory T cells. Our results indicate that spike-specific CD8+ T cells may represent the major correlate of early protection after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA/bnt162b2 prime vaccination that precede other effector arms of vaccine-induced adaptive immunity and are stably maintained after boost vaccination.","output":"Rapid and stable mobilization of fully functional spike-specific CD8+ T cells preceding a mature humoral response after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Impact of mutations on the evolution of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are needed for ongoing global efforts to track and trace the current pandemic, in order to enact effective prevention and treatment options.

Its widespread use in agriculture represents a threat not only to the environment but also to human populations exposed to them. Erythrocytes serve as an excellent model system to study the interaction of pro-oxidants. Organocarbamates are known to produce free radical species and to induce toxicity to different body systems resulting into hematological and biochemical perturbations. The information available relating to the effect of organocarbamates on the biochemical indices of human erythrocytes is scanty. Therefore, the present study was carried out to evaluate the impact of carbofuran, a carbamate pesticide, on some key biochemical indices of human erythrocytes' membrane. The oxidative potential of the pesticide was assessed in vitro by monitoring the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) in human erythrocytes exposed to different sub-acute concentrations (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 25 and 50M) of carbofuran for different time intervals; maximally up to 120 min. It was observed that the level of MDA was elevated and that of GSH was significantly decreased after treatment of erythrocytes with carbofuran. The results indicated the negative impact of carbofuran in concentration and time dependent manner. Carbofuran was also found to sharply inhibit the activity of membrane bound Na(+)K(+)-ATPase at higher carbofuran concentrations (10, 25 and 50M). Further, carbofuran at aforesaid concentrations was also found to cause significant rise in the osmotic fragility of human erythrocytes indicating adverse effect on membrane fluidity.

Ultrasonography is the preferred method for differentiating benign and malignant thyroid nodules preoperatively and is recommended by guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To assess the application value of gray-scale ultrasound and shear wave elastography in distinguishing small thyroid nodules. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 228 thyroid nodules, all of which were confirmed by pathology after surgery or FNA from January 2019 to January 2020, was carried out. All nodules were divided into a a 5 mm group and a > 5 mm group according to their maximum size. We compared the differences in the gray scale and elastography of the nodules between the two groups and the accuracy of different diagnostic methods. RESULTS: The accuracies of gray-scale ultrasound and shear wave elastography in the a 5 mm group were found to be lower than those in the > 5 mm group, and the gray-scale accuracy was slightly higher than that of shear wave elastography in both groups (p< 0.05). The largest AUC (area under the curve) of elastic parameters in the a 5 mm and > 5 mm groups was found for Emax and Esd, respectively. Based on a combination of these two parameters, the accuracies of the two groups were significantly higher than those of the parameters or gray scale alone (p< 0.05) and were 84.62% and 85.48%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Shear wave elastography is valuable in the diagnosis of benign and malignant thyroid nodules using ultrasonography.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional questionnaire study, part of the longitudinal UK Medical Applicant Cohort Study (UKMACS). SETTING: UK medical school admissions in 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 2887 participants completed an online questionnaire from 8 April to 22 April 2020. Eligible participants had registered to take the University Clinical Admissions Test in 2019 and agreed to be invited to take part, or had completed a previous UKMACS questionnaire, had been seriously considering applying to medicine in the UK for entry in 2020, and were UK residents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Views on calculated grades, views on medical school admissions and teaching in 2020 and 2021, reported experiences of education during the national lockdown. RESULTS: Respondents were concerned about the calculated grades that replaced A-level examinations: female and Black Asian and Minority Ethnic applicants felt teachers would find it difficult to grade and rank students accurately, and applicants from non-selective state schools and living in deprived areas had concerns about the standardisation process. Calculated grades were generally not considered fair enough to use in selection, but were considered fair enough to use in combination with other measures including interview and aptitude test scores. Respondents from non-selective state (public) schools reported less access to educational resources compared with private/selective school pupils, less online teaching in real time and less time studying during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has and will have significant and long-term impacts on the selection, education and performance of our medical workforce. It is important that the views and experiences of applicants from diverse backgrounds are considered in decisions affecting their future and the future of the profession.","output":"The attitudes, perceptions and experiences of medical school applicants following the closure of schools and cancellation of public examinations in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional questionnaire study of UK medical applicants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Despite an increase in CT studies to evaluate patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), their indication in triage is not well-established. The purpose was to investigate the incidence of lung involvement and analyzed factors related to lung involvement on CT images for establishment of the indication for CT scans in the triaging of COVID-19 patients. Methods Included were 192 COVID-19 patients who had undergone CT scans and blood tests for triaging. Two radiologists reviewed the CT images and recorded the incidence of lung involvement. The prediction model for lung involvement on CT images using clinico-laboratory variables [age, gender, body mass index, oxygen saturation of the peripheral artery (SpO2), comorbidities, symptoms, and blood data] were developed by multivariate logistic regression with cross-validation. Results In 120 of the 192 patients (62.5%), CT revealed lung involvement. The patient age (odds ratio [OR];4.95, 95% confidence interval [CI];0.93C26.49), albumin (OR;4.66, 95%CI;1.37C15.84), lactate dehydrogenase (OR;5.79, 95%CI;1.43C23.38) and C-reactive protein (OR;8.93, 95%CI;4.13C19.29) were selected for the final prediction model for lung involvement on CT images. The cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was 0.83. Conclusions The high incidence of lung involvement (62.5%) was confirmed on CT images. The proposed prediction model that includes the patient age, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein may be useful for predicting lung involvement on CT images and may assist in deciding whether triaged COVID-19 patients should undergo CT.","output":"Triaging of COVID-19 patients using low dose chest CT: Incidence and factor analysis of lung involvement on CT

assist with decision-making in health crisis situations During the first six weeks of the COVID-19 crisis in Spain, we have contacted a large number of hospital and health department managers in the Valencian Community and other regions of Spain The result is that very few, at least when contact was made and at the time of writing this article, had consulted staff members in the Operations Management area for advice on this situation, and they are quite reluctant to do so This is in spite of the fact that some medical sources also consider this crisis to be one of resources, not merely a medical crisis Our opinion is that Operations Management can make a useful and valuable contribution to anticipate and improve the management of scarce resources, even in times of crisis If those responsible for public health or heads of hospitals do not see this usefulness, then there is a huge gap between research and practice in Operations Management and what is transmitted to the healthcare sector Our aim is to help reduce this gap Design/methodology/approach: In the first part of the article, we will justify that this crisis, besides being a medical crisis, is also a crisis in terms of resources We will briefly review some of the Operations Management tools that we believe are appropriate for managing this crisis We will focus on those that we will illustrate in the second part of the article as a practical example of the action research protocol (only the action planning phase), in which we are currently involved Findings: Due to the peculiarities of the COVID-19 epidemic, it is reasonable to think that the evolution and duration of each outbreak, and the way it is dealt with, will be different in each hospital and/or each health department Anticipating the number of patients who will require care and forecasting the consumption of resources over time is complex, due to the long and variable incubation times and the uncontrolled evolution of the treatments needed by each patient Furthermore, since the evolution of new patient admissions is not homogeneous, the forecasting of requirements is difficult Providing real-time support and detecting with a certain degree of anticipation the potential levels of demand for health care will enable hospitals to define what stages of the contingency plan to apply and how to (re)assign the available resources in the most efficient way possible Research limitations/implications: Hardly any current data are available, not only publicly, but also through public health ministries and managers;those that are available are not very reliable and come from studies with non-representative samples For this reason, all forecasts must be taken with a note of caution, and in particular, designing review mechanisms every time a new set of updated reliable data becomes available (something that occurs on a weekly basis) Originality/value: In this work, we will show an example of a proposal for the practical application of Operations Management tools Our proposal may be useful to hospital managers and public administrators in the healthcare sector (regional ministries or their equivalents) Each health department, hospital or hospital group will generate the aggregate data that facilitate the calculation of needs as input parameters for the model (available and occupied beds, daily admissions, mean lengths of stay in each healing phase and the percent of patients who evolve from one stage to another in the progression of the disease/healing process) and will be able to analyze how the system responds and evaluate different strategies or mitigating actions These tools have been shown to be useful and reliable in manufacturing and service contexts that show a strong seasonal demand (both occasional and recurring) requiring a great deal of resources We believe these situations are analogous to those faced by hospitals and the healthcare system in an epidemic like COVID-19 With them, we could facilitate the aggregate planning of resources for hospital administrators in order to provide them operational support during the COVID-19

had high rates of thrombosis. A novel condition in children infected with SARS-CoV-2, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), has limited data on their prothrombotic state or need for thromboprophylaxis. OBJECTIVES We aimed to analyze the prothrombotic state using coagulation profiles, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) parameters and clinical outcomes, to determine if this could aid in risk stratification for thromboprophylaxis. METHODS This analysis included patients (< 21 years of age) with a diagnosis of MIS-C (n=40) and controls (presenting with suspicion of MIS-C but later ruled out; n=26). RESULTS MIS-C patients had higher levels of inflammatory markers including D-dimer (p<0.0001), compared to controls, along with evidence of hypercoagulability on ROTEM with elevated FIBTEM MCF (p<0.05). For MIS-C patients with D-dimers >1000 ng/mL, there was a significant correlation of FIBTEM MCF (p<0.0001) with a mean value of 37.4 (standard deviation 5.1). D-dimer >2144 ng/mL was predictive of intensive care unit admission (area under the curve (AUC) 0.80, 95% CI: 0.60-0.99; p<0.01; sensitivity: 82%, specificity: 75%), and elevated FIBTEM MCF (AUC 1 for >2500 ng/mL). MIS-C patients (50%) received enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis (in addition to aspirin) with significant improvement in their inflammatory and ROTEM parameters upon outpatient follow up; none developed symptomatic thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS Despite an observed prothrombotic state, none of the MIS-C patients (on aspirin alone or in combination with enoxaparin) developed symptomatic thrombosis. ROTEM, in addition to coagulation profiles, may be helpful to tailor thromboprophylaxis in critically ill MIS-C patients.","output":"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and the Prothrombotic State: Coagulation Profiles and Rotational Thromboelastometry in a MIS-C Cohort."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This paper aims to analyse the main variables and causal relationships in the system structure of the diversification of non-agricultural activities on agricultural holdings using system dynamics (SD) modelling. The SD model aims to simulate depictions of the behaviour of the real system while testing the effects of alternative decisions over time. Design/methodology/approach: An SD methodology was chosen to model diversification in farm tourism. Findings: A system approach increases the authors understanding of the transition of agricultural holdings to farm tourism. The results indicate that the transition to farm tourism depends on the level of tourism development in a certain area. The system is influenced by subsidies allocated by authorities to expand primary agricultural activities. The model describes a situation in which the tourism and agricultural industries have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited by the small set of available data due to the limited number of farms in Slovenia. One major problem is the difference in statistical data on the same activity collected from different institutions in Slovenia. Practical implications: The paper includes implications for understanding the transition process to farm tourism, allowing policymakers to experiment with subsidies and promotion to explore the efficacy and efficiency of proposed policies.

Participants were 938 volunteers in the United States who responded to an online survey during the lockdown in April 2020. The main findings were that all three groups of variables, biological, psychological, and socio-economic, significantly contributed to PWB explaining 53% variance. Social loneliness and sense of agency were the strongest predictors. PWB was significantly predicted by physical health (not gender nor age); by spirituality, emotional loneliness, social loneliness, and sense of agency; by job security (not income, nor neighborhood safety, nor hours spent on social media). Comparing the coping strategies of participants, results show more intentional coping in the high-PWB group and more passive coping in the low-PWB group. During this unprecedented pandemic, the findings highlight that ability to sustainably cope with the global shifts in daily life depends on actively and intentionally attending to PWB by being one's own agent for physical health, spiritual health, and social connection.","output":"Thriving during COVID-19: Predictors of psychological well-being and ways of coping"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: We investigated the independent and joint association between muscle strength and health variables according to individual health status among adults.

Research attention is now being focused on this possibility, especially in the case of protozoan pathogens which may be the most important as they are often resistant to current methods used in public water treatment. In this review we highlight some of the many factors that are likely to influence the degree of pollution by their effect on both the vertical and horizontal transport of microorganisms through soil. Soil pH, temperature, the presence of plants, microbial surface properties, type of waste, soil type and soil water content and flow may all affect the rate and extent of vertical transport, with the latter two generally considered to be the most important. Lateral movement is a particular problem in soils with impermeable substrata or in waterlogged conditions and in these cases the major factors affecting movement include rainfall rate, topography of the land and the rate at which microorganisms partition into the runoff.","output":"Pathogens in livestock waste, their potential for movement through soil and environmental pollution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To date, existing animal models of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have failed to translate preclinical discoveries into effective pharmacotherapy or diagnostic biomarkers.

These policies were largely successful at curbing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1), but they came with social and economic costs, including increases in unemployment, interrupted education, social isolation, and related psychosocial outcomes (2,3). A better understanding of when and how these policies were effective is needed. Using data from 37 European countries, the impact of the timing of these mitigation policies on mortality from COVID-19 was evaluated. Linear regression was used to assess the association between policy stringency at an early time point and cumulative mortality per 100,000 persons on June 30. Implementation of policies earlier in the course of the outbreak was associated with lower COVID-19-associated mortality during the subsequent months.

Several guidelines have been developed, which recommend treatment adjustments depending on the site of cancer, grade, and stage. However, few studies in India and across the globe have looked into the real challenges faced by cancer patients and assessed the effectiveness of the adopted interventions. This study was undertaken with the objective to study the challenges faced by cancer patients in India during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study undertaken between May 1, 2020 and May 15, 2020. A link to a prestructured questionnaire was sent through email to 100 randomly selected cancer patients in different stages of treatment and follow-up. Data were decoded and entered in Microsoft Excel 2010 and analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Slot availability for teleconsultation, network issues, deferral of radiotherapy dates and long waiting hours beyond appointment time, transportation problems from residence to hospital, restriction of visitors/attendants, deferral of surgery, deferral of tumor boards, delay and deferral of advice of the nutritionist, problems faced in extension of visa, unavailability of peer group support services and psychological counseling sessions, difficulty in maintaining precautionary measures, availability of chemotherapy medications and availability of chemotherapy slots in day care were cited as problems faced by cancer patients. Majority (91.7%) of the study respondents mentioned an increase in their anxiety levels.

However, the plurality of advanced sequencing datasets-such as short and long reads-presents a formidable computational challenge to uniformly perform quantitative, variant or phylogenetic analysis, thus limiting its application in public health laboratories engaged in studying epidemic outbreaks. We present a computational tool, Infectious Pathogen Detector (IPD), to perform integrated analysis of diverse genomic datasets, with a customized analytical module for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The IPD pipeline quantitates individual occurrences of 1060 pathogens and performs mutation and phylogenetic analysis from heterogeneous sequencing datasets. Using IPD, we demonstrate a varying burden (5.055-999655.7 fragments per million) of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts across 1500 short- and long-read sequencing SARS-CoV-2 datasets and identify 4634 SARS-CoV-2 variants (~3.05 variants per sample), including 449 novel variants, across the genome with distinct hotspot mutations in the ORF1ab and S genes along with their phylogenetic relationships establishing the utility of IPD in tracing the genome isolates from the genomic data (as accessed on 11 June 2020). The IPD predicts the occurrence and dynamics of variability among infectious pathogens-with a potential for direct utility in the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond to help automate the sequencing-based pathogen analysis and in responding to public health threats, efficaciously.

Cardiac involvement is associated with increased morbidity. However, differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes based on initial sarcoidosis organ manifestation in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) have not been described. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 252 patients with CS at an urban, quaternary medical center was studied. Presentation, treatment and outcomes of de novo CS and prior ECS groups were compared. Survival free of primary composite outcome (left ventricular assist device implantation, orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT), or death) was assessed. RESULTS: There were 124 de novo CS patients and 128 with prior ECS at time of CS diagnosis. De novo CS patients were younger at CS diagnosis (p = 0.020). De novo CS patients had a more advanced cardiac presentation: lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (p < 0.001), more frequent sustained ventricular arrhythmias (VA) (p = 0.001), and complete heart block (p = 0.001). During follow-up, new VA (p < 0.001), ventricular tachycardia ablation (p < 0.001), and OHT (p = 0.003) were more common in the de novo CS group. Outcome free survival was significantly shorter for de novo CS patients (p = 0.005), with increased hazard of primary composite outcome (p = 0.034) and development of new VA (p = 0.027) when compared to ECS patients. Overall mortality was similar between groups. CONCLUSION: Patients presenting with CS as their first recognized organ manifestation of sarcoidosis have an increased risk of adverse cardiac outcomes as compared to those with a prior history of ECS.

To set the stage, we first briefly simulate and illustrate the benefit of lockdown. With these lockdown scenarios, and in general, the more dominant influence of the the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious over the symptomatic infectious, is shown in various ways. Numerical simulations for the U.S. show that an increase in testing and isolating for the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious group has up to 4 times more impact than an increase in testing for the symptomatic infectious in terms of cumulative deaths. An increase in testing for the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious group also has significantly more impact (on the order of twice as much) on reducing the control reproduction number than testing for symptomatic infectious. Lastly, we use our model to simulate an implementation of a natural herd immunity strategy for the entire U.S. and for the state of Wisconsin (once an epicenter for COVID-19).

The literature is scarce regarding the effects of obesity on laparoscopic rectal surgery. The aim of the current study was to analyze the effect of an increased body mass index (BMI) on outcome of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer. METHODS Patients who underwent laparoscopic rectal resection were allocated to one of three groups according to their BMI: normal weight (BMI < 25), overweight (25  BMI < 30) and obese (BMI  30). These three groups were compared with each other in terms of patient demographics, postoperative hospital stay, postoperative complications and histopathological data. RESULTS There were 100 patients operated on for rectal cancer. The median BMI of the patients was 27 (range 18.5-40) kg/m(2), and 43, 43 and 14 patients were classified as normal weight, overweight and obese, respectively. The conversion rate was 4.7% in the overweight group and 0% in the other groups.

In our previous efficacy trial, post-treatment outcomes for CBT-SAD and LT were very similar, but CBT-SAD was associated with fewer depression recurrences two winters later than LT (27.3% in CBT-SAD vs. 45.6% in LT). CBT-SAD engaged and altered a specific mechanism of action, seasonal beliefs, which mediated CBT-SADs acute antidepressant effects and CBT-SADs enduring benefit over LT. Seasonal beliefs are theoretically distinct from LTs assumed target and mechanism: correction of circadian phase. This study applies the experimental therapeutics approach to determine how each treatment works when it is effective and to identify the best candidates for each. Biomarkers of LTs target and effect include circadian phase angle difference and the post-illumination pupil response. Biomarkers of CBT-SADs target and effect include decreased pupillary and sustained frontal gamma-band EEG responses to seasonal words, which are hypothesized as biomarkers of seasonal beliefs, reflecting less engagement with seasonal stimuli following CBT-SAD. In addition to determining change mechanisms, this study tests the efficacy of a switch decision rule upon recurrence to inform clinical decision-making in practice. METHODS: Adults with SAD (target N = 160) will be randomzied to 6-weeks of CBT-SAD or LT in winter 1; followed in winter 2; and, if a depression recurrence occurs, offered cross-over into the alternate treatment (i.e., switch from LT?CBT-SAD or CBT-SAD?LT). All subjects will be followed in winter 3. Biomarker assessments occur at pre-, mid-, and post-treatment in winter 1, at winter 2 follow-up (and again at mid-/post-treatment for those crossed-over), and at winter 3 follow-up. Primary efficacy analyses will test superiority of CBT-SAD over LT on depression recurrence status (the primary outcome). Mediation analyses will use parallel process latent growth curve modeling. DISCUSSION: Consistent with the National Institute of Mental Healths priorities for demonstrating target engagement at the level of Research Domain Criteria-relevant biomarkers, this work aims to confirm the targets and mechanisms of LT and CBT-SAD to maximize the impact of future dissemination efforts.

During the high solar activity, emissions of matter and electromagnetic fields from the Sun make it difficult for cosmic rays to penetrate the Earth. When solar energy is high, cosmic ray intensity is lower, so that the solar magnetic field and solar winds affect the Earth externally and originate new viruses. In this paper, we assess the possible effects of sunspot numbers on the world virus appearance. The literature has no sufficient results about these phenomena. Therefore, we try to relate solar ray extremum to virus generation and the history of pandemics. First, wavelet decomposition is used for smoothing the sunspot cycle to predict past pandemics and forecast the future time of possible virus generation. Finally, we investigate the geographical appearance of the virus in the world to show vulnerable places in the world. The result of the analysis of pandemics that occurred from 1750 to 2020 shows that world's great viral pandemics like COVID-19 coincide with the relative extrema of sunspot number. Based on our result, 27 pandemic (from 36) incidences are on sunspot extrema.

Our estimates suggest that twice weekly testing, which was adequate for the original strains of SARS-CoV-2 will be insufficient on its own to contain the spread of the Delta variant of concern. We exclude consideration of contact tracing since the rapidity of the onset of viral titre in the case of the Delta variant suggests that unless contact tracing and quarantine are performed very rapidly (ie. much less than a day), these mitigations will be of minimal impact in reducing transmission.

Although, dog overpopulation is still a current problem, the importance of dogs as companion or work animals is undeniable. The source of the dog (size and type of kennels) seems to affect its performance and its life outcome. To understand the perception of dog breeders and puppy production in western societies, an online international survey was sent to breeders in North and South America, Europe and Oceania. The survey focused on breeders demographics and maternal behaviour and stress during the peripartum period. Overall, based on the responders feedback, puppy production is an activity driven partially by small-scale hobby or sporadic breeders. A close relation between dogs and breeders has been observed in different countries with small differences. In general, stress reduction during strategic times was a common concern amongst breeders who were using slightly different interventions. Spending more time with the bitches to reassure them was commonly employed. ABSTRACT: Dogs are part of many households worldwide and in recent years in some western countries, more and more people describe them as members of the family. The accurate number of dogs per household and the actual demand for puppies are hard to estimate correctly. The sources of dogs seem to be an important element to consider before acquiring a dog since some behavioural disorders are more likely observed in dogs coming from puppy mills and pet stores. Therefore, there is an increased need to better-know dog breeders, theirs believes and practices. To full-fill this objective, an online questionnaire in five different languages (English, German, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish) was sent to dog breeders. The survey intended to study the demographics of dog breeders and to understand their perception and practices about reproduction, maternal behaviour and management of the dam during the peripartum period. We were also interested to evaluate the occurrence and the impact of stress around parturition and how breeders deal with overstressed bitches and if they believe that motherly quality could have a later-on effect on the livelihood of the dog. Six hundred and sixty-eight respondents participated in the survey, mainly from Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Portugal, Poland, Spain, United Kingdom, United States of America and non-listed country (reported as other in the survey). A country effect was observed in relation to housing system, human interaction, the use of techniques to define breeding and whelping time and different methods to manage stress during the peripartum period. Considering the demographics of the responders, breeding activity is, in general, a family based activity with an effect of country. Use of progesterone levels to manage reproduction and pregnancy diagnosis by ultrasound were cited as common practice. In general, parturition takes place under human supervision. Peripartum period was perceived as a stressful moment with a difference in the way of addressing the problem based on the country but reassuring the bitch by increasing human presence was frequently described. Inappropriate maternal behaviour was observed by half of responders and if presented primiparous bitches and parturition by C-section were overrepresented. Puppies stayed with the dams from 4 weeks to 9 weeks and dog breeders from Spain, Poland and Portugal are keeping puppies with their mother the longest. Overall, poor maternal behaviour has an impact on puppies cognitive development with German breeders being more convinced than their counterparts from Brazil and Spain.","output":"Profile of Dogs Breeders and Their Considerations on Female Reproduction, Maternal Care and the Peripartum StressAn International Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Older age has been confirmed as a risk factor for severe clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19). The prevalence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Catalonia among people over 60 years is 6.6%. Biological agents have not been associated with a higher incidence nor a worse prognosis of COVID-19. However, the role of immunosuppressants (IMS) on this issue is still to be elucidated. Moreover, there are scarce data related about COVID-19 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients under IMS, and none focusing in elderly IBD. Our aim was to describe and to compare the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in patients over 65 years of age with IBD, particularly in relation to the use of IMS. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study including IBD patients over 65 years since January 2020, from two referral centres in the Barcelona metropolitan area (Catalonia, Spain). Patients were grouped in two cohorts regarding the use or not of IMS (thiopurines or methotrexate). Patients on biological treatment were excluded. We identified those cases with confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 (positive PCR) during the period from 1(st) of March 2020 (the beginning of the pandemic in Catalonia) to 1(st) March 2021 (the beginning of vaccination in the elderly). Demographic data, IBD comorbidities, concomitant non-IBD related treatments, and SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Four-hundred and eighteen elderly IBD patients were included. The median age was 74 years (IQR 69C78), 52% were male; 70% had ulcerative colitis, 28% Crohns disease and 2% IBD unclassified, 62% had arterial hypertension, 22% diabetes mellitus, 22% cardiovascular disease, 15% chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 10% chronic renal disease, 5% were active smokers. There were no differences regarding comorbidities and non-IBD treatments between the two study groups. From the whole cohort, 89 (21.3%) patients were on IMS (86 with thiopurines, 3 with methotrexate). The median time on IMS was 121 months (IQR 60C162). During the study period, 32 patients (7.7%) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (7 of whom were on IST; 7.6% not on IMS vs. 7.9% on IMS, P=0.933). Seventeen (53%) patients required hospital admittance (4% not IMS vs. 4.5% on IMS; P=0.818); 4 of them developed COVID-19 related complications (3 patients not on IMS vs. 1 on IMS), and 7 (22%) patients died (6 not on IMS vs. 1 patient on IMS).

In this study, we investigated whether the novel 'Fix for Life' (F4L) cadaver model is a suitable and realistic model for the teaching of these two intubation techniques to novices in airway management. METHODS Forty consultant anaesthetists and senior trainees were instructed to perform tracheal intubation with videolaryngoscopy and fibreoptic tracheoscopy in four F4L cadaver models. The primary outcome measure was the verbal rating scores (scale 1-10, higher scores indicate a better rating) for suitability and for realism of the F4L cadavers as training model for these techniques. Secondary outcomes included success rates of the procedures and the time to successful completion of the procedures. RESULTS The mean verbal rating scores for suitability and realism for videolaryngoscopy was 8.3 (95% CI, 7.9-8.6) and 7.2 (95% CI, 6.7-7.6), respectively. For fibreoptic tracheoscopy, suitability was 8.2 (95% CI, 7.9-8.5) and realism 7.5 (95% CI, 7.1-7.8). In videolaryngoscopy, 100% of the procedures were successful.

A qualitative risk assessment was conducted by a multi-disciplinary group to assess this risk in bats in the Australian context, with the aim of informing risk management strategies for human activities involving interactions with bats. The overall risk of SARS-CoV-2 establishing in an Australian bat population was assessed to be Low, however with a High level of uncertainty. The outcome of the assessment indicates that, for the Australian situation where the prevalence of COVID-19 in humans is very low, it is reasonable for research and rehabilitation of bats to continue, provided additional biosecurity measures are applied. Risk assessment is challenging for an emerging disease where information is lacking and the situation is changing rapidly;assessments should be revised if human prevalence or other important factors change significantly. The framework developed here, based on established animal disease risk assessment approaches adapted to assess reverse zoonotic transmission, has potential application to a range of wildlife species and situations.","output":"Risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to bats - An Australian assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Probiotics, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ATCC53103 and Lactobacillus plantarum JL01, can improve growth performance and immunity of piglets, and relieve weaning stress-related immune disorders such as intestinal infections and inflammation. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of co-administration of the probiotics L. rhamnosus GG ATCC53103 and L. plantarum JL01 to stimulate immune responses and improve gut health during the critical weaning period in piglets. Forty-eight weaned piglets were randomly divided into four groups, and fed daily for 28 days either without, or with the two probiotics independently, or in combination. On day 28, we analyzed the cytokine and bacterial changes in intestinal mucosa and the hepatic portal vein blood metabolites of the weaned piglets. Our results showed that combined L. rhamnosus GG ATCC53103 and L. plantarum JL01 significantly increased (p < 0.05) the growth performance and expression of IL-10 and TGF-1 mRNAs. In contrast, this treatment significantly decreased (p < 0.05) IL-1 mRNA level in the jejunum, ileum, and cecum. Furthermore, the secretion of IL-6 in the cecum, IL-1 in the jejunum, ileum, and cecum, and TNF- in the jejunum and ileum was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of Prevotella_9 and Enterococcus in ileum and cecum was significantly increased (p < 0.05).

We studied the association between use of statin/angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/ARB in the month before hospital admission, with risk of severe outcome, and with time to severe outcome or disease recovery, among patients hospitalized for COVID-19. We performed a retrospective single-center study of all patients hospitalized at University of California San Diego Health between February 10, 2020 and June 17, 2020 (na?=a?170 hospitalized for COVID-19, na?=a?5,281 COVID-negative controls). Logistic regression and competing risks analyses were used to investigate progression to severe disease (death or intensive care unit admission), and time to discharge without severe disease. Severe disease occurred in 53% of COVID-positive inpatients. Median time from hospitalization to severe disease was 2 days; median time to recovery was 7 days. Statin use prior to admission was associated with reduced risk of severe COVID-19 (adjusted OR 0.29, 95%CI 0.11 to 0.71, p < 0.01) and faster time to recovery among those without severe disease (adjusted HR for recovery 2.69, 95%CI 1.36 to 5.33, p < 0.01).

The aims of this study were to determine the diagnostic and therapeutic yields of endoscopy, CTA, and angiography for managing LGIB, and their influence on rebleeding, transfusion, and hospital stay. PATIENTS AND METHODS A systematic search of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL was undertaken to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized studies of intervention (NRSIs) published between 2000 and 12 November 2015 in patients hospitalized with LGIB. Separate meta-analyses were conducted, presented as pooled odds (ORs) or risk ratios (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS Two RCTs and 13 NRSIs were included, none of which examined flexible sigmoidoscopy, or compared endotherapy with embolization, or investigated the timing of CTA or angiography. Two NRSIs (57 - 223 participants) comparing colonoscopy and CTA were of insufficient quality for synthesis but showed no difference in diagnostic yields between the two interventions. One RCT and 4 NRSIs (779 participants) compared early colonoscopy (< 24 hours) with colonoscopy performed later; meta-analysis of the NRSIs demonstrated higher diagnostic and therapeutic yields with early colonoscopy (OR 1.86, 95 %CI 1.12 to 2.86, P = 0.004 and OR 3.08, 95 %CI 1.93 to 4.90, P < 0.001, respectively) and reduced length of stay (mean difference 2.64 days, 95 %CI 1.54 to 3.73), but no difference in transfusion or rebleeding.

METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical and radiological characteristics of patients with RICMs. The features of these RICMs were then compared with features of nonradiation cavernous malformations (CMs) in 270 patients. RESULTS Thirty-two patients with RICMs were identified (56.2% men), with a median age of 31.1 years at RICM diagnosis. The median latency from radiation treatment to RICM diagnosis was 12.0 years (interquartile range 5.0-19.6 years). RICMs were always within the previous radiation port. RICMs were symptomatic at diagnosis in 46.9%, and were associated with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage at any time in 43.8%. Older age at the time of radiation treatment and higher radiation dose were associated with shorter latency. RICMs tended to be diagnosed at a younger age than nonradiation CMs (median 31.1 vs 42.4 years, respectively; p = 0.054) but were significantly less likely to be symptomatic at the time of diagnosis (46.9% vs 65.8%, respectively; p = 0.036). RICMs were more likely to be multiple CMs than nonradiation CMs (p = 0.0002). Prospectively, the risk of symptomatic hemorrhage was 4.2% for RICMs and 2.3% for nonradiation CMs per person-year (p = 0.556). In the absence of symptoms at presentation, the risk of hemorrhage for RICMs was higher than for nonradiation CMs (4.2% vs 0.35%, respectively; p = 0.118). CONCLUSIONS In this patient population, RICMs occurred within the radiation port approximately 12 years after radiation treatment.

Lumbopelvic parameters in patients with or without spondylolysis were evaluated in three age groups (<50, 50-69, and 70). The influence of bilateral L5 spondylolysis (L5-lysis) and L5 vertebral slip on each lumbopelvic parameter, and correlation between cross-sectional area (CSA) of paraspinal muscles and the degree of vertebral slip were examined by multiple regression analysis.

The classic rate law central to the SIR compartmental models assumes that the rate of transmission is first order regarding the infectious agent. The current study demonstrates that this assumption does not always hold and provides a theoretical rationale for a more general rate law, inspired by mixed-order chemical reaction kinetics, leading to a modified mathematical model for non-first-order kinetics. Using observed data from 127 countries during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrated that the modified epidemic model is more realistic than the classic, first-order-kinetics based model. We discuss two coefficients associated with the modified epidemic model: transmission rate constant k and transmission reaction order n. While k finds utility in evaluating the effectiveness of control measures due to its responsiveness to external factors, n is more closely related to the intrinsic properties of the epidemic agent, including reproductive ability. The rate law for the modified compartmental SIR model is generally applicable to mixed-kinetics disease transmission with heterogeneous transmission mechanisms.

So far, the expression of capsid and envelope proteins in infected cells has been considered an absolute requirement for alphavirus budding and propagation. In the present study, we show that Semliki Forest virus and Sindbis virus lacking the capsid gene can propagate in mammalian and insect cells. This propagation is mediated by the release of infectious microvesicles (iMVs), which are pleomorphic and have a larger size and density than wild-type virus. iMVs, which contain viral RNA inside and viral envelope proteins on their surface, are released at the plasma membrane and infect cells using the endocytic pathway in a similar way to wild-type virus. iMVs are not pathogenic in immunocompetent mice when injected intravenously, but can infect different organs like lungs and heart. Finally, we also show that alphavirus genomes without capsid can mediate the propagation of heterologous genes, making these vectors potentially interesting for gene therapy or vaccination studies. The minimalist infectious system described in this study shows that a self-replicating RNA able to express membrane proteins with binding and fusion properties is able to propagate, providing some insights into virus evolution.

Currently no evidence for intrauterine vertical transmission of 2019-nCoV is found in the three women infected by 2019-nCoV in their late pregnancy.","output":"[Pregnant women with new coronavirus infection: a clinical characteristics and placental pathological analysis of three cases]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The indiscriminate consumption of antimalarials against coronavirus disease-2019 emphasizes the longstanding clinical weapons of medicines. In this work, we conducted a review on the antitumor mechanisms of aminoquinolines, focusing on the responses and differences of tumor histological tissues and toxicity related to pharmacokinetics. This well-defined analysis shows similar mechanistic forms triggered by aminoquinolines in different histological tumor tissues and under coexposure conditions, although different pharmacological potencies also occur. These molecules are lysosomotropic amines that increase the antiproliferative action of chemotherapeutic agents, mainly by cell cycle arrest, histone acetylation, physiological changes in tyrosine kinase metabolism, inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways, cyclin D1, E2F1, angiogenesis, ribosome biogenesis, triggering of ATM-ATR/p53/p21 signaling, apoptosis, and presentation of tumor peptides. Their chemo/radiotherapy sensitization effects may be an adjuvant option against solid tumors, since 4-aminoquinolines induce lysosomal-mediated programmed cytotoxicity of cancer cells and accumulation of key markers, predominantly, LAMP1, p62/SQSTM1, LC3 members, GAPDH, beclin-1/Atg6, -synuclein, and granules of lipofuscin. Adverse effects are dose-dependent, though most common with chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, amodiaquine, and other aminoquinolines are gastrointestinal changes, blurred vision ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, QTc prolongation, severe hypoglycemia with loss of consciousness, and retinopathy, and they are more common with chloroquine than with hydroxychloroquine and amodiaquine due to pharmacokinetic features. Additionally, psychological/neurological effects were also detected during acute or chronic use, but aminoquinolines do not cross the placenta easily and low quantity is found in breast milk despite their long mean residence times, which depends on the coexistence of hepatic diseases (cancer-related or not), first pass metabolism, and comedications. The low cost and availability on the world market have converted aminoquinolines into star drugs for pharmaceutical repurposing, but a continuous pharmacovigilance is necessary because these antimalarials have multiple modes of action/unwanted targets, relatively narrow therapeutic windows, recurrent adverse effects, and related poisoning self-treatment. Therefore, their use must obey strict rules, ethical and medical prescriptions, and clinical and laboratory monitoring.","output":"Aminoquinolines as Translational Models for Drug Repurposing: Anticancer Adjuvant Properties and Toxicokinetic-Related Features"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using a respiratory virus epidemiological model we derive equations for the critical levels of mask efficiency (fraction blocked) and mask adoption (fraction of population wearing masks) that lower the effective reproduction number to unity. The model extends a basic epidemiological model and assumes that a specified fraction of a population dons masks at a given initial number of infections. The model includes a contribution from the ocular (nasolacrimal duct) route, and does not include contributions from contact (fomite) routes. The model accommodates dose-response (probability of infection) functions that are linear or non-linear. Our motivation to study near-population-wide mask wearing arises from the concept that, between two mask wearers, the concentration of particles at inhalation should be the square of the mask penetration fraction. This combination, or team, of masks can provide a strong dose-lowering squaring effect, which enables the use of lower-efficiency, lower-cost, lower pressure-drop (easier breathing) masks. For an epidemic with basic reproduction number R0=2.5 and with a linear dose-response, the critical mask efficiency is calculated to be 0.5 for a mask adoption level of 0.8 of the population. Importantly, this efficiency is well below that of a N95 mask, and well above that of some fabric masks. Numerical solutions of the model at near-critical levels of mask efficiency and mask adoption demonstrate avoidance of epidemics. To be conservative we use mask efficiencies measured with the most-penetrating viral-particle sizes. The critical mask adoption level for surgical masks with an efficiency of 0.58 is computed to be 0.73. With surgical masks (or equally efficient substitutes) and 80% and 90% adoption levels, respiratory epidemics with R0 of about 3 and 4, respectively, would be theoretically extinguished.","output":"Critical levels of mask efficiency and of mask adoption that theoretically extinguish respiratory virus epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"World Gastroenterology Organization define acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) a syndrome in patients with chronic liver disease with or without previously diagnosed cirrhosis, characterized by acute hepatic decompensation resulting in liver failure and one or more extrahepatic organ failures, associated with increased mortality up to three months.

However, the current demand has exceeded the supply chain and, consequently, shortage of essential medical materials, such as surgical masks. Due to these alarming limitations, it is crucial to develop effective means of disinfection, reusing, and thereby applying antimicrobial shielding protection to the clinical supplies. Purpose: Therefore, in this work, we developed a novel, economical, and straightforward approach to promote antimicrobial activity to surgical masks by impregnating silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Methods: Our strategy consisted of fabricating a new alcohol disinfectant formulation combining special surfactants and AgNPs, which is demonstrated to be extensively effective against a broad number of microbial surrogates of SARS-CoV-2. Results: The present nano-formula reported a superior microbial reduction of 99.999% against a wide number of microorganisms. Furthermore, the enveloped H5N1 virus was wholly inactivated after 15 min of disinfection.

How these promoters are differentially regulated remains elusive. Here, we apply single-molecule imaging to quantify the transcriptional regulation of two alternative promoters (P1 and P2) of the Bicoid (Bcd) target gene hunchback in syncytial blastoderm Drosophila embryos. Contrary to the previous notion that Bcd only activates P2, we find that Bcd activates both promoters via the same two enhancers. P1 activation is less frequent and requires binding of more Bcd molecules than P2 activation. Using a theoretical model to relate promoter activity to enhancer states, we show that the two promoters follow common transcription kinetics driven by sequential Bcd binding at the two enhancers. Bcd binding at either enhancer primarily activates P2, while P1 activation relies more on Bcd binding at both enhancers. These results provide a quantitative framework for understanding the kinetic mechanisms of complex eukaryotic gene regulation.","output":"Differential regulation of alternative promoters emerges from unified kinetics of enhancer-promoter interaction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this commentary, we discuss the short\\\\term and long\\\\term implications of COVID\\\\19 on postgraduate dental training in the UK, specifically Dental Core Training (DCT) and Specialty Training.

METHODS: A total of 220 CAP patients and 110 control subjects were recruited. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Serum S100A9 and inflammatory cytokines were measured. RESULTS: Serum S100A9 was elevated in CAP patients on admission. Serum S100A9 was gradually elevated parallelly with CAP severity scores. Additionally, inflammatory cytokines were increased and blood routine parameters were changed in CAP patients compared with control subjects. Correlation analysis found that serum S100A9 was positively associated with CAP severity scores, blood routine parameters (WBC, NLR and MON) and inflammatory cytokines. Further, logistic regression analysis demonstrated that there were positive associations between serum S100A9 and CAP severity scores. Besides, the prognosis of CAP was tracked. Serum higher S100A9 on the early stage elevated the death of risk and hospital stay among CAP patients. CONCLUSION: Serum S100A9 is positively correlated with the severity of CAP.

Four overarching themes with four sub-themes were revealed: (a) Paying a personal price for authenticity, (b) Being the only one is hard even when you are in charge, (c) The illusion of diversity and inclusion while trying to survive, and (d) Focusing on building and sustaining diversity, equity, and inclusion. Implications for nursing education including instituting training for faculty in anti-racist pedagogy and requiring nursing programs to meet inclusivity metrics for approval and accreditation.","output":"Diversity and Inclusion or Tokens?

This study applied a novel mixed-methods, stakeholder-engaged approach to co-design a psychosocial intervention for mothers expecting a baby with congenital heart disease (CHD) and their partners to promote family wellbeing. The research team included parents and clinicians from 8 health systems. Participants were 41 diverse parents of children with prenatally diagnosed CHD across the 8 health systems. Qualitative data were collected through online crowdsourcing and quantitative data were collected through electronic surveys to inform intervention co-design. Phases of intervention co-design were: (I) Engage stakeholders in selection of intervention goals/outcomes; (II) Engage stakeholders in selection of intervention elements; (III) Obtain stakeholder input to increase intervention uptake/utility; (IV) Obtain stakeholder input on aspects of intervention design; and (V) Obtain stakeholder input on selection of outcome measures. Parent participants anticipated the resulting intervention, HEARTPrep, would be acceptable, useful, and feasible for parents expecting a baby with CHD.

Whereas this intervention contributes to reducing carbon emissions and those of other pollutants related with the burning of fossil fuel, it may also result in hidden impacts that are often overlooked. When co-firing, the physical and chemical properties of the mixed fuels and the subsequent technical implications on the process performance and by-products are significant. Interconnections between multiple values nested within four domains of value, i.e. environmental, economic, technical and social, mean that changes in the one domain (in the co-firing case, the technical one) can have considerable implications in the other domains as well. In this study, using a systematic and flexible approach to conceptualising multi-dimensional aspects associated with the co-firing of biomass and SRF with coal, we unveil examples of such interconnections and implications on overall value delivered through the use and recovery of waste resources. Such an analysis could underpin the selection of useful metrics (quantitative or semi-quantitative descriptors) for enabling a systemic multi-dimensional value assessment, and value's distribution amongst interconnected parts of resource recovery systems; key in enabling sound analysis and decision-making.","output":"Technical properties of biomass and solid recovered fuel (SRF) co-fired with coal: Impact on multi-dimensional resource recovery value."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Decreased cancer incidence and reported changes to clinical management indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic will result in diagnostic and treatment delays for cancer patients. We aimed to develop a flexible model to estimate the impact of delayed diagnosis and treatment initiation on survival outcomes and healthcare costs based on a shift in the disease stage at treatment initiation. Methods: The stage-shift model estimates population-level health economic outcomes by weighting disease stage-specific outcomes by the distribution of stages at treatment initiation, assuming delays lead to stage-progression. It allows for extrapolation of population-level survival data using parametric distributions to calculate the expected survival in life years. The model was demonstrated based on an analysis of the impact of 3 and 6-month delays for stage I breast cancer, colorectal cancer and lung cancer patients, and for T1 melanoma, based on Australian data. In the absence of patient-level data about time to stage progression, two approaches were explored to estimate the proportion of patients that would experience a stage shift following the delay: 1) based on the relation between time to treatment initiation and overall survival (breast, colorectal and lung cancer), and 2) based on the tumour growth rate (melanoma). The model is available on http://stage-shift.personex.nl/. Results: A shift from stage I to stage II due to a 6-month delay is least likely for colorectal cancer patients, with an estimated proportion of 3% of the stage I patients diagnosed in 2020 progressing to stage II, resulting in 11 excess deaths after 5 years and a total of 96 life years lost over a 10-year time horizon. For breast and lung cancer, progression from stage I to stage II due to a 6-month delay were slightly higher at 5% (breast cancer) and 8% (lung cancer), resulting in 25 and 43 excess deaths after 5 years, and 239 and 373 life years lost over a 10-year time horizon, respectively. For melanoma, with 32% of T1 patients progressing to T2 disease following a 6-month delay, the model estimated 270 excess death after 5 years and 2584 life years lost over a 10-year time horizon. Conclusions: Using a conservative 3-month delay in diagnosis and treatment initiation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this study predicts nearly 90 excess deaths and $12 million excess healthcare costs in Australia over 5 years for the in 2020 diagnosed patients for 4 cancers. If the delays increase to 6 months, excess mortality and cost approach nearly 350 deaths and $46 million in Australia.

Although the microbiology of the nasopharynx is an important determinant of the complications of URI, little is known of the nasopharyngeal (NP) microbiota of children, the factors that affect its composition, and its precise relationship with URI. RESULTS: Healthy children (n = 47) aged 49C84 months from a prospective cohort study based in Wisconsin, USA, were examined. Demographic and clinical data and NP swab samples were obtained from participants upon entry to the study. All NP samples were profiled for bacterial microbiota using a phylogenetic microarray, and these data were related to demographic characteristics and upper respiratory health outcomes. The composition of the NP bacterial community of children was significantly related prior to the history of acute sinusitis (R(2) = 0.070, P < 0.009). History of acute sinusitis was associated with significant depletion in relative abundance of taxa including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Akkermansia spp. and enrichment of Moraxella nonliquefaciens. Enrichment of M. nonliquefaciens was also a characteristic of baseline NP samples of children who subsequently developed acute sinusitis over the 1-year study period. Time to develop URI was significantly positively correlated with NP diversity, and children who experienced more frequent URIs exhibited significantly diminished NP microbiota diversity (P  0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest that previous history of acute sinusitis influences the composition of the NP microbiota, characterized by a depletion in relative abundance of specific taxa. Diminished diversity was associated with more frequent URIs.

But at least in the diplomatic literature, the importance of this regional dynamic (with a focus on diverse sites and actors and the pursuit of democratic control) has been missed. The objective of this article is to explore whether health diplomacy is catching up to this larger debate re-shaping the conceptualization and practice of diplomacy more generally. In some ways, the results may be counter-productive in that this shift may encourage an increasingly fragmented process. Yet, it may also point to some breakthroughs, with diplomats, acting as go to personnel on the front lines of operational activity, enabling actors to integrate with one another to produce effective governance.

However, the findings were heavily influenced by results from two arms of a six-arm cluster-randomised trial that were analysed without accounting for the cluster trial design. We have used publicly available data to provide results from the remaining four unpublished trial arms and to reanalyse the meta-analyses, accounting for the cluster trial design. Methods The intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) and design effect were estimated. We then calculated the risk reduction (RR) of ARI from summary statistics, adjusting for the design effect, individually for the five different vitamin D treatment groups (four previously unpublished) and for all the vitamin D groups pooled. For this trial, individual patient data were used to estimate the effect of vitamin D on ARI risk and number of ARIs, adjusting for the cluster trial design, using random-effects models. Finally, we reanalysed the most recent trial-level meta-analysis, including the trial data generated by the correct analysis of the cluster randomized trial. Results There were 744 trial participants (6 treatment groups, 21 clusters, mean cluster size 35.4). The ICC was 0.08 (95% CI 0.02-0.14) and design effect 3.75. In analyses based on summary statistics, there was no statistically significant effect of vitamin D on ARI risk in any individual treatment group, or when groups were pooled (RR 0.75, 95%CI 0.50-1.13). In individual patient data analyses, there was also no statistically significant effect of vitamin D on the ARI risk or number of ARIs in any treatment group, or when pooled: odds ratio 0.58 (0.26-1.29), rate ratio 0.70 (0.44-1.12), respectively. Update of the previous meta-analysis showed no effect of vitamin D on ARI either when data from the two arms of the trial, or when all trial arms were incorporated (RR 0.98, 0.96-1.00, P=0.10 both analyses). Conclusions Overall, vitamin D supplementation had no effect on the risk of an ARI or on the number of ARIs in this trial or in a re-analysis of the most recent meta-analysis.

The virus has spread rapidly throughout the world creating a pandemic scenario. Several risk factors have been identified, such as age, gender, concomitant diseases as well as viral load. One of the key questions since the beginning of the pandemic, is the role of asymptomatic people in spreading SARS-CoV-2. An observational study in Southern Italy was conducted in order to elucidate the possible role of asymptomatic individuals related to their viral loads in the transmission of the virus within two nursing facilities. Methods: : oro-nasopharyngeal swabs from 179 nursing health care workers and patients were collected. SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR was performed and viral loads were calculated by using standard curve. For positive results, a statistical correlation between viral loads , the presence/absence of symptoms , age and gender variables was investigated. Results: : SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in the 50.8% (n=91) of the cases. Median age of positive individuals resulted higher than negative ones. A statistically significant difference (p <.001) was observed for age and gender variables and over 65 years individuals showed higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection than younger ones (OR=3.93) as well as female (OR=2.86). Among 91 tested positive, the 70.3% was symptomatic (n=64) whilst the 29.7% was asymptomatic (n=27). Median viral loads of asymptomatic individuals were found statistically significant higher than symptomatic ones (p=.001), while no influence was observed in age and gender variables. Conclusions: : A range from 9.2% to 69% of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases remains asymptomatic, moreover, sporadic transmissions from asymptomatic people are reported, that makes their involvement an important issue to take into account in the spreading control of the virus. An asymptomatic clinical course was observed in the 29.7% of positive individuals, moreover, median viral loads resulted to be statistically significant when compared to symptomatic ones. Surely, such a relevant frequency should not be ignored in relation to the spread of the disease in an environment which has not only important intrinsic (age, gender, concomitant diseases) but also extrinsic factors such as high population density and close contacts.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Quantitative Real Time PCR and Viral Loads Analysis Among Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Patients: an Observational Study on an Outbreak in Two Nursing Facilities in Campania Region (Southern Italy)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic during spring semester 2020, teachers and students were forced to engage in online instruction.

However, incidence may be impacted by lower testing rates among vulnerable populations. We compared SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence, disease severity, and neutralizing antibody activity after infection among people with and without HIV receiving care within a county hospital system over a three-month period.Methods: From August through October 2020, remnant serum samples were collected from all PLWH who underwent routine outpatient laboratory testing in a municipal healthcare system which houses a large HIV clinic. Patients with HIV were date-of-collection and age-matched (same day, +/- 5 years respectively) to adults without HIV. SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralizing antibody titers were measured in serum. Severe disease was assessed by chart review.Findings: Overall, 2,256 samples from 955 PLWH and 1062 people without HIV were tested. Among PLWH, the seroprevalence was 3.7% as compared to 7.4% among people without HIV (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 048;95% Confidence Interval (CI): 034;071). Among those with evidence of prior infection (IgG or PCR), the odds of severe disease were more than 5-fold higher among PLWH (OR 513 95% CI: 105;389). Among those with past infection, SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were 45% lower among PLWH vs. those without HIV (95% CI: 22%;61%);neutralizing antibody titers were 63% lower among PLWH (2%-78%).Interpretation: Among PLWH, there were approximately 50% lower odds of past SARS-CoV-2 infection, possibly due to greater non-pharmaceutical intervention adherence among a population with experience of the HIV epidemic. However, in spite of fewer infections, PLWH experienced more cases of severe disease. Among PLWH with past SARS-CoV-2 infection, lower neutralizing antibody titers were observed and may lead to increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease or reinfection.

METHODS: HCWs of the radiation oncology departments from 29 tertiary cancer care centers of Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and Nepal were studied from May 2020 to July 2020. A total of 758 eligible HCWs were identified. The 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder, 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire, and 22-Item Impact of Events Scale-Revised were used for assessing anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Univariate and multivariate analysis was done to identify the causative factors affecting mental health. RESULTS: A total of 758 participants from 794 HCWs were analyzed. The median age was 31 years (IQR, 27-28). The incidence of moderate to severe levels of anxiety, depression, and stress was 34.8%, 31.2%, and 18.2%, respectively. Severe personal concerns were noticed by 60.9% of the staff. On multivariate analysis, the presence of commonly reported symptoms of COVID-19 during the previous 2 weeks, contact history (harzard ratio [HR], 2.04; CI, 1.15 to 3.63), and compliance with precautionary measures (HR, 1.69; CI, 1.19 to 2.45) for COVID-19 significantly predicted for increasing anxiety (HR, 2.67; CI, 1.93 to 3.70), depression (HR, 3.38; CI 2.36 to 4.84), and stress (HR, 2.89; CI, 1.88 to 4.43) (P < .001).

Development of novel virus-inhibiting drugs is therefore important goal. Previously, we identified camphor derivative, camphecene, as an effective anti-influenza compound. In the present study we optimize the regimen of its application to avoid high sub-toxic concentrations. METHODS The protective activity of camphecene was assessed on the model of lethal pneumonia of mice caused by influenza viruses. Camphecene was administered either once a day or four times a day, alone or in combination with Tamiflu. Mortality and viral titer in the lungs was studied. Pharmacokinetics of camphecene was studied in rabbits. RESULTS We have demonstrated that camphecene, being used every six hours at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg/day, results in anti-viral effect that was statistically equal to the effect of 100 mg/kg/day once a day, i.e. the same effect was achieved by thirteen-times lower daily dose of the drug. This effect was manifested in decrease of mortality and decrease of virus' titer in the lungs. The studies of pharmacokinetics of camphecene have demonstrated that it does not accumulate in blood plasma and that its multiple applications with dosage interval of 65 min is safe. In addition, the results of the study demonstrate also that camphecene possesses additive effect with Tamiflu allowing to decrease the dose of the latter.

Health care providers are in the frontline of COVID-19 patients diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation, and there is a well-documented impact of this context on their physical and mental health2. This might impact their wellbeing and reduce their quality of life. In this research letter, we investigated which factors are associated with QoL in Brazilian healthcare professionals. We aim to investigate both protective and risk factors for the four main aspects of QoL: physical, psychological, social relations, and environment. We assessed 97.771 Brazilian adults, most (92.3%) health professionals of different professions from all the five-country regions. All included individuals agreed in a written consent to participate. Participants showed an average of 35.45 years old (9.49) and were predominantly female (80%). They answered an online questionnaire about sociodemographic aspects, measures of mental health, and quality of life in the first semester of 2020. A detailed description of the sample and procedures can be found elsewhere3. All participants answered the WHOQoL-BREF, a standardized tool for QoL assessment developed by the World Health Organization. Stepwise linear regression analysis was used to assess the role of sociodemographic factors, previously diagnosed mental disorders, COVID-19 related symptoms as well a series of specific questions regarding participants worries and perceptions about the pandemic, including the protective behaviors' adoption (social distancing, usage of masks and sanitizer, among others). A full list of variables (64 in total) is available on the SAMBE webpage (http://abpbrasil.org.br/pcabp/). Since we have a large sample size our statistical power is about 99% (alpha=0.01) to detect small effect sizes. To simplify our results and allow a more direct application to real-life settings we only included significant predictors which showed at least 1% of adjusted explained variance in the stepwise models. The stepwise regression model was summarized in the figure below. All regression models were significant (p<0.001) as well all the predictors reported in the Figure. Total explained variance was 26% for Physical QoL, 27% for Psychological, 13% for Social Relations, and 19% for Environmental. A history of previous depression, presence of Headache, and the perception of worsening in home relationships were risk factors for lower QoL in all four domains. Our results suggest a multidimensional pattern of determinants of QoL in health care professionals in the early days of the pandemic. Interesting features emerged as predictors of QoL such as changes in home relationships, worsening in work productivity, and mental health. Expected and new predictors may shed light on which factors should be considered in interventions aiming at the development of mitigation of impact QoL in these populations.","output":"Determinants of Quality of Life during the COVID-19 pandemic: An analysis of a large sample of Brazilian Health Professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cognitive sequelae of COVID-19 including memory and concentration difficulties have been observed in 40-65% of persons who have been hospitalised with COVID-19 and 27-50% of non-hospitalised individuals.

PAP has been reported to be associated with a large number of clinical conditions and diseases. Whole lung lavages can be helpful to stabilize the clinical course of PAP until the underlying condition is identified, which may enable more specific treatment. Recently, heterozygous OAS1 gain-of-function variants were described as cause in a patient with infantile-onset PAP combined with hypogammaglobulinemia. CASE PRESENTATION At age 4 months, a female infant born to term was diagnosed with hypogammaglobulinemia and treated with monthly immunoglobulin injections. At age 15 months, the girl needed supplemental oxygen at night, and at age 18 months, also during the day. At age 2 years, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis of unknown etiology was diagnosed by computed tomography scan and open lung biopsy. Subsequently, monthly whole lung lavages (WLLs) were started, which stabilized the clinical course for over 2 years until a disease-causing OAS1 variant was diagnosed and the patient was successfully treated by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSION Here, we describe the successful management of a female patient with severe PAP caused by a heterozygous OAS1 gain-of-function variant until a definitive diagnosis was made and cured by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

METHODS: Visit outcome and patient demographic data were obtained via electronic health record (EHR) reports. Telehealth visit completion rates were compared by patient characteristics using the chi-square test and t-test. We used zip code data to generate latitude- and longitude-based maps of the range and density of service delivery. Patient cases highlighting challenges and opportunities for adolescent telehealth were summarized. RESULTS: Between March 16 and April 15, 2020, 392 telehealth visits were scheduled in 331 unique patients, with an 82% appointment completion rate. Video visits were conducted for eating disorders (39%), contraception/menstrual disorders (22%), gender-affirming care (17%), general adolescent medicine (15%), HIV treatment (6%), and substance abuse (1%). The majority of telehealth patients were female Caucasian minors with private insurance. There were no significant differences in telehealth visit completion rates by age, sex, gender, or insurance. Patients coded as non-white (African-American, Asian, or other) in the EHR had lower visit completion rates than white patients (p = .003). Telehealth patients were distributed across five states, with the highest concentration in the zip codes nearest to the clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid scale-up of telehealth for Adolescent Medicine was achieved at this large academic medical center.

To meet the increased demand for hand sanitizer during the pandemic, the US FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization allowing new manufacturers and importers to enter the market. Some of the newly introduced hand sanitizer products contained methanol in lieu of ethanol or isopropanol. We describe five patients with fatal methanol poisoning resulting from hand sanitizers improperly containing methanol. CASE SUMMARY: Comparing a 5-month period from 2019 to the same time frame in 2020, the Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center has seen an increase of 124% in exposures to hand sanitizer. Of these cases, 28% involved methanol-contaminated hand sanitizer. Five of these patients died from methanol poisoning. All five cases had similar clinical features with severe high anion gap metabolic acidosis and, in four patients, elevated osmolal gap. Methanol concentrations were consistently very elevated, but these results were not available before the patients succumbed. Four of the patients received fomepizole and adjunctive care. Two patients received emergency extracorporeal therapy. All five died despite maximal treatment efforts. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic in 2020, there was a proliferation of alcohol-based hand sanitizers which contained methanol. Exposure to these products, which failed to meet regulatory standards, led to increased harm and death. Challenges to treatment of methanol poisoning, especially in rural areas, include lack of access to timely laboratory measurement of methanol concentrations and lack of available emergency hemodialysis without transfer of the patient.","output":"Death by hand sanitizer: syndemic methanol poisoning in the age of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pneumonia is more frequent among the elderly and is associated with higher rates of hospitalization and death.

As the transmissibility of a pathogen increases, the dynamics of disease spread shifts from limited stuttering chains of transmission to potentially large scale outbreaks. One proposed method to anticipate this transition are early-warning signals (EWS), summary statistics which undergo characteristic changes as the transition is approached. Although theoretically predicted, their mathematical basis does not take into account the nature of epidemiological data, which are typically aggregated into periodic case reports and subject to reporting error. The viability of EWS for epidemic transitions therefore remains uncertain. Here we demonstrate that most EWS can predict emergence even when calculated from imperfect data. We quantify performance using the area under the curve (AUC) statistic, a measure of how well an EWS distinguishes between numerical simulations of an emerging disease and one which is stationary. Values of the AUC statistic are compared across a range of different reporting scenarios. We find that different EWS respond to imperfect data differently. The mean, variance and first differenced variance all perform well unless reporting error is highly overdispersed. The autocorrelation, autocovariance and decay time perform well provided that the aggregation period of the data is larger than the serial interval and reporting error is not highly overdispersed. The coefficient of variation, skewness and kurtosis are found to be unreliable indicators of emergence. Overall, we find that seven of ten EWS considered perform well for most realistic reporting scenarios. We conclude that imperfect epidemiological data is not a barrier to using EWS for many potentially emerging diseases.","output":"Anticipating epidemic transitions with imperfect data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the spread of new coronavirus infections, it is desirable to allow people to use public devices such as bank ATMs and beverage vending machines without touching them directly Therefore, we developed a system that enables non-contact operation of various public devices using personal smartphones while reducing the impact on existing public devices ? 2021 IEEE","output":"Research on contactless operation method for public equipment using personal smartphone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Die pulmonale Manifestation h?matoonkologischer Erkrankungen umfasst eine Vielzahl sehr unterschiedlicher Krankheitsbilder.

Urolithiasis is a disease that requires timely and appropriate management. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of the pandemic in hospital admissions for urolithiasis in the Brazilian public healthcare system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, hospital admissions were obtained from the Brazilian Public Health Information system. All hospital admissions associated with urolithiasis diagnosis (ICD-10 N20) between March 2017 and February 2021 were analyzed. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, there was a significant decrease in hospital admissions (p<0.0001). More than 20.000 patients probably did not have the opportunity to undergo their surgeries. The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on women's admissions was significantly more intense than for men, reducing from 48.91% to 48.36% of the total (p=0.0281). The extremes of age seemed to be more affected, with patients younger than 20 years and older than 60 years having a significant reduction in access to hospital services (p=0.033).

METHODS A 12-question survey investigating resident experiences with educational videoconferences was distributed to University of Washington plastic surgery residents. A modified Maslach Burnout Inventory was used to assess resident burnout from virtual conferences. Conference attendance and reasons for missing conferences were compared using paired two-tailed t-tests. RESULTS A total of 24 residents were given the survey with 100% response rate. There was a significant decrease in the total number of weekly attended videoconferences (p<0.01) and in the number of attended educational videoconferences (p<0.01) over time. Reasons for absences included clinical duties (92% of respondents) followed by symptoms of burnout, including forgetfulness (67%) and feeling fatigued by videoconferencing lectures (54%), and to a lesser extent the belief that the lecture was not educational (25%). 79% of residents reported at least occasionally feeling emotionally drained from videoconferencing and 88% reported at least occasionally feeling burned out due to the number of videoconferencing activities. Despite declining attendance and burnout, 96% believe that videoconferences should continue after the end of quarantine but in a limited quantity. CONCLUSION Videoconferences have become a valued means of resident education. The data suggests however that attendance has waned, largely due to what can be perceived as burnout.

The aim of this study was to investigate the transcriptional, functional, and morphological effects on renal tissue after 177Lu-octreotate administration in normal mice, and to identify biomarkers for radiation induced renal toxicity. METHODS C57BL/6N mice were i.v. injected with 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, or 150 MBq 177Lu-octreotate (0, 16, 29, 40, 48, and 54 Gy to the kidneys). At 4, 8, and 12 months after administration, radiation-induced effects were evaluated in relation to (a) global transcriptional variations in kidney tissues, (b) morphological changes in the kidneys, (c) changes in white and red blood cell count as well as blood levels of urea, and (d) changes in renal function using 99mTc-DTPA/99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy. RESULTS In general, the highest number of differentially regulated transcripts was observed at 12 months after administration. The Cdkn1a, C3, Dbp, Lcn2, and Per2 genes displayed a distinct dose-dependent regulation, with increased expression level with increasing absorbed dose. Ifng, Tnf, and Il1B were identified as primary up-stream regulators of the recurrently regulated transcripts. Furthermore, previously proposed biomarkers for kidney injury and radiation damage were also observed. The functional investigation revealed reduced excretion of 99mTc-DTPA after 150 MBq, an increased uptake of 99mTc-DMSA at all dose levels compared with the controls, and markedly increased urea level in blood after 150 MBq at 12 months.

While some are pushing just to get vaccines into arms as quickly as possible, others advocate prioritization in terms of risk. OBJECTIVE Our aim is to use demographic models to show the enormous potential of vaccine risk-prioritization in saving lives. METHODS We develop a simple mathematical model that accounts for the age distribution of the population and of COVID-19 mortality. This model considers only the direct live-savings for those who receive the vaccine, and does not account for possible indirect effects of vaccination. We apply this model to the United States, Japan, and Bangladesh. RESULTS In the United States, we find age-prioritization would reduce deaths during a vaccine campaign by about 93 percent relative to no vaccine and 85 percent relative to age-neutral vaccine distribution. In countries with younger age structures, such as Bangladesh, the benefits of age-prioritization are even greater. CONTRIBUTION For policy makers, our findings give additional support to risk-prioritized allocation of COVID-19 vaccines. For demographers, our results show how the age-structures of the population and of disease mortality combine into an expression of risk concentration that shows the benefits of prioritized allocation.

We used logistic regression for two risk-factor model: (1) simple positive (case: herd score 1+, at least one positive kid in the herd, versus control: herd score = 0), (2) strongly positive (case: overall herd score 3+ versus control: herd score <3+). Risk factors associated with simple positive herds were period of sampling compared to the peak of births (After versus Before, OR = 4.2, 95% CI 1.2, 15.3) and practice of kid grouping by age or weight (Yes versus No, OR = 4.4, 95% CI 1.0, 19.1). Risk factors associated with strongly positive herds were period of investigation (February/March versus January, OR = 12.7, 95% CI 2.1, 76.6), exposure to graminaceous plants in forage (OR = 11.6, 95% CI 1.7, 81.0) and type of ventilation in the goat premises (Vertical versus Wind effect, OR = 14.7, 95% CI 2.1, 106.1). No important association was found between kid-management practices and herd positivity. These results suggest a major role of the environment of kids during their first hours of life in the adult-goat premises regarding the transmission of C. parvum infection.","output":"Herd-level risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection in dairy-goat kids in western France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen Se efecta una revisin de los artculos ms interesantes de infecciones respiratorias, publicados en el ltimo trimestre del a?o 2009 y en 2010.

Although a high number of EV-D68 infections were expected in 2020 based on the EV-D68s known biannual circulation patterns, no apparent increase in EV-D68 detections or AFM cases was observed during 2020. We describe an upsurge of EV-D68 detections in wastewater samples from the United Kingdom between July and November 2021 mirroring the recently reported rise in EV-D68 detections in clinical samples from various European countries. We provide the first publicly available 2021 EV-D68 sequences showing co-circulation of EV-D68 strains from genetic clade D and sub-clade B3 as in previous years. Our results show the value of environmental surveillance (ES) for the early detection of circulating and clinically relevant human viruses. The use of a next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach helped us to estimate the prevalence of EV-D68 viruses among EV strains from other EV serotypes and to detect EV-D68 minor variants. The utility of ES at reducing gaps in virus surveillance for EV-D68 and the possible impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions introduced to control the COVID-19 pandemic on EV-D68 transmission dynamics are discussed.","output":"Detection of Enterovirus D68 in Wastewater Samples from the UK between July and November 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the most noticeable effects of the Covid-19 pandemic from the technology perspective has been the significant uptake of online meeting platforms, which many have suddenly found to be a necessary alternative to face-to-face meetings in all manner of contexts.

We discuss the anatomy, the critical issues of disinfection and reusability of masks, the alternative equipment available for the protection of the facial region from airborne diseases, such as face shields and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR), and the skin health impact of prolonged wearing of facial protection by HCW. Clearly, facial protection, either in the form of masks or alternates, appears to have mitigated the pandemic as seen from the minimal COVID-19 spread in countries where public mask wearing is strictly enforced. On the contrary, the healthcare systems, that appear to have been unprepared for emergencies of this nature, should be appropriately geared to handle the imbalance of supply and demand of personal protective equipment including face masks.

We therefore investigated the role of the hypoxia-associated plasma proteins osteopontin, galectin-3, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) as surrogate markers for imaging-based tumor hypoxia. Methods: Serial blood samples of HNSCC patients receiving chemoradiation within a prospective trial were analyzed for osteopontin, galectin-3, VEGF and CTGF concentrations. Tumor hypoxia was quantified in treatment weeks 0, 2 and 5 using [18F]FMISO PET/CT. The association between PET-defined hypoxia and the plasma markers was determined using Pearson's correlation analyses. Receiver-operating characteristic analyses were conducted to reveal the diagnostic value of the hypoxia markers. Results: Baseline osteopontin (r = 0.579, p < 0.01) and galectin-3 (r = 0.429, p < 0.05) correlated with the hypoxic subvolume (HSV) prior to radiotherapy, whereas VEGF (r = 0.196, p = 0.36) and CTGF (r = 0.314, p = 0.12) showed no association. Patients with an HSV > 1 mL in week 2 exhibited increased VEGF (p < 0.05) and CTGF (p < 0.05) levels in week 5. Pretherapeutic osteopontin levels were higher in patients exhibiting residual hypoxia at the end of treatment (104.7 vs. 60.8 ng/mL, p < 0.05) and could therefore predict residual hypoxia (AUC = 0.821, 95% CI 0.604-1.000, p < 0.05). Conclusion: In this exploratory analysis, osteopontin correlated with the initial HSV and with residual tumor hypoxia; therefore, there may be a rationale to study hypoxic modification based on osteopontin levels. However, as plasma hypoxia markers do not correspond to any spatial information of tumor hypoxia, they have limitations regarding the replacement of [18F]FMISO PET-based focal treatments. The results need to be validated in larger patient cohorts to draw definitive conclusions.","output":"The value of plasma hypoxia markers for predicting imaging-based hypoxia in patients with head-and-neck cancers undergoing definitive chemoradiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies have indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) may participate in the regulation of tumor cell proptosis. However, the connection between lncRNA expression and pyroptosis remains unclear in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD).

We identify 15 prognostic pyroptosis-related lncRNAs (ZNF667-AS1, OIP5-AS1, AL118506.1, AF117829.1, POC1B-AS1, CCDC18-AS1, THUMPD3-AS1, FLNB-AS1, SNHG11, HCG18, AL021707.2, UGDH-AS1, LINC00641, FGD5-AS1 and AC245452.1) from the TCGA-COAD dataset and use them to construct the risk model. After then, this pyroptosis-related lncRNA signature is validated in patients from the GSE17536 dataset. The COAD patients are divided into low-risk and high-risk groups by setting the median risk score as the cut-off point and represented differences in the immune microenvironment. Hence, we construct the immune risk model based on the infiltration levels of ssGSEA immune cells. Interestingly, the risk model and immune risk model are both independent prognostic risk factors. Therefore, a nomogram combined risk score, immune risk score with clinical information which is meaningful in univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis is established to predict the overall survival (OS) of COAD patients.

The object of disaster risk science research is the disaster system consisting of hazard, the geographical environment, and exposed units, with features of regionality, interconnectedness, coupling, and complexity. Environmental stability, hazard threat, and socioeconomic vulnerability together determine the way that disasters are formed, establish the spatial extent of disaster impact, and generate the scale of losses. In the formation of a disaster, a conducive environment is the prerequisite, a hazard is the necessary condition, and socioeconomic exposure is the sufficient condition. The geographical environment affects local hazard intensity and therefore can change the pattern of loss distribution. Regional multi-hazard, disaster chain, and disaster compound could induce complex impacts, amplifying or attenuating hazard intensity and changing the scope of affected areas. In the light of research progress, particularly in the context of China, we propose a three-layer disaster risk science disciplinary structure, which contains three pillars (disaster science, disaster technology, and disaster governance), nine core areas, and 27 research fields.

In addition to tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), recent epidemiological studies have shown the emergence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) species in causing lung diseases in humans. Although more than 170 NTM species are present in various environmental niches, only a handful, primarily Mycobacterium avium complex and M. abscessus, have been implicated in pulmonary disease. While TB is transmitted through inhalation of aerosol droplets containing Mtb, generated by patients with symptomatic disease, NTM disease is mostly disseminated through aerosols originated from the environment. However, following inhalation, both Mtb and NTM are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages in the lungs. Subsequently, various immune cells are recruited from the circulation to the site of infection, which leads to granuloma formation. Although the pathophysiology of TB and NTM diseases share several fundamental cellular and molecular events, the host-susceptibility to Mtb and NTM infections are different. Striking differences also exist in the disease presentation between TB and NTM cases. While NTM disease is primarily associated with bronchiectasis, this condition is rarely a predisposing factor for TB. Similarly, in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected individuals, NTM disease presents as disseminated, extrapulmonary form rather than as a miliary, pulmonary disease, which is seen in Mtb infection. The diagnostic modalities for TB, including molecular diagnosis and drug-susceptibility testing (DST), are more advanced and possess a higher rate of sensitivity and specificity, compared to the tools available for NTM infections. In general, drug-sensitive TB is effectively treated with a standard multi-drug regimen containing well-defined first- and second-line antibiotics. However, the treatment of drug-resistant TB requires the additional, newer class of antibiotics in combination with or without the first and second-line drugs. In contrast, the NTM species display significant heterogeneity in their susceptibility to standard anti-TB drugs. Thus, the treatment for NTM diseases usually involves the use of macrolides and injectable aminoglycosides. Although well-established international guidelines are available, treatment of NTM disease is mostly empirical and not entirely successful. In general, the treatment duration is much longer for NTM diseases, compared to TB, and resection surgery of affected organ(s) is part of treatment for patients with NTM diseases that do not respond to the antibiotics treatment. Here, we discuss the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment modalities available for TB and NTM diseases of humans.","output":"Of tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections C a comparative analysis of epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a novel disease entity that is spreading throughout the world. It has been speculated that patients with comorbidities and elderly patients could be at high risk for respiratory insufficiency and death. Immunosuppression could expose infected patients to even higher risks of disease complications due to dampened immune response. However, it has been speculated that overactive immune response could drive clinical deterioration and, based on this hypothesis, several immunosuppressants are currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19. Methods In this paper we report on a patient that has been treated with ocrelizumab (a B-cell depleting monoclonal antibody) for primary progressive multiple sclerosis who developed COVID-19. Results Despite complete B cell depletion, patient symptoms abated few days after hospitalization, and he was discharged to home-quarantine.

Over the subsequent 5 months, NPI policies were eased in stages according to a national strategy. COVID-19 spread throughout the country heterogeneously; the disease reached rural areas by July and case numbers peaked from July to August. A second COVID-19 wave began in late 2020. Data on the impact of NPI policies on social and economic well-being and access to health care are limited. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine how rural residents in three South African provinces changed their behaviors during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave. METHODS: The South African Population Research Infrastructure Network nodes in the Mpumalanga (Agincourt), KwaZulu-Natal, (Africa Health Research Institute) and Limpopo (Dikgale-Mamabolo-Mothiba) provinces conducted up to 14 rounds of longitudinal telephone surveys among randomly sampled households from rural and periurban surveillance populations every 2-3 weeks. Interviews included questions on the following topics: COVID-19Crelated knowledge and behaviors, the health and economic impacts of NPIs, and mental health. We analyzed how responses varied based on NPI stringency and household sociodemographics. RESULTS: In total, 5120 households completed 23,095 interviews between April and December 2020. Respondents self-reported satisfaction with their COVID-19Crelated knowledge and face mask use rapidly rose to 85% and 95%, respectively, by August. As selected NPIs were eased, the amount of travel increased, economic losses were reduced, and the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms fell. When the number of COVID-19 cases spiked at one node in July, the amount of travel dropped rapidly and the rate of missed daily medications doubled. Households where more adults received government-funded old-age pensions reported concerns about economic matters and medication access less often. CONCLUSIONS: South Africans complied with stringent, COVID-19Crelated NPIs despite the threat of substantial social, economic, and health repercussions. Government-supported social welfare programs appeared to buffer interruptions in income and health care access during local outbreaks. Epidemic control policies must be balanced against the broader well-being of people in resource-limited settings and designed with parallel support systems when such policies threaten peoples income and access to basic services.","output":"Protective Behaviors and Secondary Harms Resulting From Nonpharmaceutical Interventions During the COVID-19 Epidemic in South Africa: Multisite, Prospective Longitudinal Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The evolution of practice of Radiation Therapy in the United States (U.S.) is inevitable. The scope of a radiation therapists role has progressed with advancing technology, implementation of special procedures and patient care requirements. Internationally, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom have formalized this evolution through the Advanced Practice Radiation Therapist (APRT) role to provide new models of care, to meet growing demands in the practice of Radiation Oncology, to increase efficiency, decrease cost and retain skilled staff (Harnett et al., 2018; Society of Radiographers; Linden et al., 2019; Coleman et al., 2014) [1], [2], [3], [4]. Through evidence based practice, the APRT role has proven to provide benefits for multiple stakeholders including service-reconfiguration to reduce wait times, developing and retaining highly skilled radiation therapists, treatment review and most importantly improving patient care within much needed patient cohorts such as the palliative population (Duffton et al., 2019) [5]. The U.S. is no exception to requiring innovative care models and solutions to similar complex, care delivery challenges experienced internationally. The U.S. is experiencing an increase in demand for cancer services and a rapid rate of technological and treatment advancements.

Interferons (IFNs) are critical mediators of the innate defense to infection, and in this study we evaluated the contribution of a specific gene coding for IFIT2 induced by type I IFNs in a murine model of disseminated Candida albicans. Invasive candidiasis is a frequent challenge during immunosuppression or surgical medical interventions, and C. albicans is a common culprit that leads to high rates of mortality. When IFIT2 knockout mice were infected systemically with C. albicans, they were found to have improved survival and reduced fungal burden compared to wild-type mice. One of the mechanisms by which IFIT2 increases the pathological effects of invasive C. albicans appears to be suppression of NADPH oxidase activation. Loss of IFIT2 increases production of reactive oxygen species by leukocytes, and we demonstrate that IFIT2 is a binding partner of a critical regulatory subunit of NADPH oxidase, p67(phox). Since the administration of IFN has been used therapeutically to combat viral infections, cancer, and multiple sclerosis, we evaluated administration of IFN- to mice prior to C. albicans infection. IFN- treatment promoted pathology and death from C. albicans infection.

However, past work demonstrates that access is not uniform among youth in the United States, with lower access found among groups with higher health-related needs. Population-level data yield important insights about access and internet use in the United States. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine internet access and mode of access by social class and race and ethnicity among youth (aged 14-17 years) in the United States. METHODS: Using the Current Population Survey, we examined internet access, cell phone or smartphone access, and modes of connecting to the internet for adolescents in 2015 (unweighted N=6950; expanded weights N=17,103,547) and 2017 (unweighted N=6761; expanded weights N=17,379,728). RESULTS: Internet access increased from 2015 to 2017, but socioeconomic status (SES) and racial and ethnic disparities remained. In 2017, the greatest disparities were found for youth in low-income households (no home access=23%) and for Black youth (no home access=18%) and Hispanic youth (no home access=14%). Low-income Black and Hispanic youth were the most likely to lack home internet access (no home access, low SES Black youth=29%; low SES Hispanic youth=21%). The mode of access (eg, from home and smartphone) and smartphone-only analyses also revealed disparities. CONCLUSIONS: Without internet access, web-based dissemination of information, health promotion, and health care will not reach a significant segment of youth. Currently, SES and racial and ethnic disparities in access prolong health inequalities.

METHODS: We created a self-administrated electronic survey about the virtual management of patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated its clinical sensibility and pilot tested the instrument. We surveyed practicing oncologists in Gulf and Arab countries using snowball sampling via emails and social media networks. Reminders were sent 1 and 2 weeks later using SurveyMonkey. RESULTS: We received 222 responses from validated oncologists from April 2-22, 2020. An awareness of virtual clinics, virtual multidisciplinary teams, and virtual prescriptions was reported by 182 (82%), 175 (79%), and 166 (75%) respondents, respectively. Reported challenges associated with virtual management were the lack of physical exam (n=134, 60%), patients' awareness and access (n=131, 59%), the lack of physical attendance of patients (n=93, 42%), information technology (IT) support (n=82, 37%), and the safety of virtual management (n=78, 35%).

The CHERRIES checklist for reporting results of internet e-surveys was adhered to. RESULTS: A total of 554 completed responses were received from 20 countries, which include six in Northern Africa, six in West Africa, four in Southern Africa, three in East Africa and one in Central Africa. Consultant grade rheumatologists constituted 436 (78.7%) of respondents with a mean of 14.5  10.3 years of experience. A total of 77 (13.9%) rheumatologists avoided starting a new biologic. Face-to-face clinics with the use of some personal protective equipment continued to be held in only 293 (52.9%) rheumatologists' practices. Teleconsultation modalities found usage as follows: telephone in 335 (60.5%), WhatsApp in 241 (43.5%), emails in 90 (16.3%) and video calls in 53 (9.6%).

Exosomes secreted from MSCs were collected and purified using multiple ultrafiltration steps. All patients were treated with nebulization of MSC-derived exosomes, and primary safety and efficacy outcomes were evaluated. Results: : Our clinical study demonstrated that nebulization of MSC-derived exosomes is a novel method that might be utilized in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.

The resulting sample of 12 infants (9C24 months) divided equally into pre- and post-lockdown groups with matching ages and data quantity/quality. The groups had strikingly different FFA responses: pre-lockdown infants showed repetition suppression (Novel>Repeat), whereas post-lockdown infants showed the opposite (Repeat>Novel), often referred to as repetition enhancement.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all COVID patients diagnosed with AP in 62 Spanish EDs (20% of Spanish EDs, COVID-AP) during the COVID outbreak. We formed two control groups: COVID patients without AP (COVID-non-AP) and non-COVID patients with AP (non-COVID-AP). Unadjusted comparisons between cases and controls were performed regarding 59 baseline and clinical characteristics and 4 outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 54 AP in 74,814 patients with COVID-19 attending the ED (frequency=0.72?, 95%CI=0.54-0.94?). This frequency was lower than in non-COVID patients (2,231/1,388,879, 1.61?, 95%CI=1.54-1.67; OR=0.44, 95%CI=0.34-0.58). Etiology of AP was similar in both groups, being biliary origin in about 50%. Twenty-six clinical characteristics of COVID patients were associated with a higher risk of developing AP: abdominal pain (OR=59.4, 95%CI=23.7-149), raised blood amylase (OR=31.8; 95%CI=1.60-632) and vomiting (OR=15.8, 95%CI=6.69-37.2) being the strongest, and some inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, platelets, D-dimer) were more increased. Compared to non-COVID-AP, COVID-AP patients differed in 23 variables; the strongest ones related to COVID symptoms, but less abdominal pain was reported, pancreatic enzymes raise was lower, and severity (estimated by BISAP and SOFA score at ED arrival) was higher. The in-hospital mortality (adjusted for age and sex) of COVID-AP did not differ from COVID-non-AP (OR=1.12, 95%CI=0.45-245) but was higher than non-COVID-AP (OR=2.46, 95%CI=1.35-4.48). CONCLUSIONS: Acute pancreatitis as presenting form of COVID-19 in the ED is unusual (<1? cases). Some clinically distinctive characteristics are present compared to the remaining COVID patients and can help to identify this unusual manifestation. In-hospital mortality of COVID-AP does not differ from COVID-non-AP but is higher than non-COVID-AP, and the higher severity of AP in COVID patients could partially contribute to this increment.","output":"A case-control emergency department-based analysis of acute pancreatitis in Covid-19: Results of the UMC-19-S6"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global spread of COVID-19 has prompted countries worldwide to design initiatives and measures to ensure public health and safety.

Knowledge about the clinical profile, imaging findings, and outcomes is still evolving. Here we describe the characteristics of a cohort of 62 COVID-19-related stroke patients from 13 hospitals, from Bangalore city, south India. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical profile, neuroimaging findings, interventions, and outcomes in COVID-19-related stroke patients. METHODS: This is a multicenter retrospective study of all COVID-19-related stroke patients from 13 hospitals from south India; 1st June 2020C31st August 2020. The demographic, clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging data were collected along with treatment administered and outcomes. SARSCCoV-2 infection was confirmed in all cases by RT-PCR testing. The data obtained from the case records were entered in SPSS 25 for statistical analysis. RESULTS: During the three-month period, we had 62 COVID-19-related stroke patients, across 13 centers; 60 (97%) had ischemic strokes, while 2 (3%) had hemorrhagic strokes. The mean age of patients was 55.66  13.20 years, with 34 (77.4%) males. Twenty-six percent (16/62) of patients did not have any conventional risk factors for stroke. Diabetes mellitus was seen in 54.8%, hypertension was present in 61.3%, coronary artery disease in 8%, and atrial fibrillation in 4.8%. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 12.7  6.44. Stroke severity was moderate (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 5C15) in 27 (61.3%) patients, moderate to severe (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 16C20) in 13 (20.9%) patients and severe (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 21C42) in 11 (17.7%) patients. According to TOAST classification, 48.3% was stroke of undetermined etiology, 36.6% had large artery atherosclerosis, 10% had small vessel occlusion, and 5% had cardioembolic strokes. Three (5%) received intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase 0.2 mg/kg and 3 (5%) underwent mechanical thrombectomy, two endovascular and one surgical. Duration of hospital stay was 16.16  6.39 days; 21% (13/62) died in hospital, while 37 (59.7%) had a modified Rankin score of 3C5 at discharge. Hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and higher baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores were associated with increased mortality. A comparison to 111 historical controls during the non-COVID period showed a higher proportion of strokes of undetermined etiology, higher mortality, and higher morbidity in COVID-19-related stroke patients. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related strokes are increasingly being recognized in developing countries, like India. Stroke of undetermined etiology appears to be the most common TOAST subtype of COVID-19-related strokes. COVID-19-related strokes were more severe in nature and resulted in higher mortality and morbidity.

Initial research has examined the validity and acceptability of teleneuropsychology (teleNP) in research settings, but there is less information about teleNP implementation in clinical practice. Here we describe the development of a teleNP clinic and compare patient satisfaction to those completing in-person neuropsychological evaluations. Method: A teleNP clinic was developed at the VA Bedford Healthcare System to serve older Veterans with referral questions focused on cognitive aging concerns. Patients presented to affiliated VA satellite clinics and were connected to neuropsychology clinicians at the main hospital campus through synchronous video. An evaluation battery was compiled to closely approximate in-person evaluations. Trained staff members at the satellite clinic assisted with administration of select tasks. Patient satisfaction was evaluated using a self-report questionnaire and responses were compared to a group undergoing in-person neuropsychological evaluations. Results: Self-reported satisfaction was high for all aspects of the patient experience, with no significant difference found between teleNP (n = 67) and in-person (n = 64) groups. In particular, 90% of patients in the teleNP group and 98% of patients in the in-person group agreed or strongly agreed with the statement, \\"I was overall satisfied with this visit.\\". Conclusions: TeleNP is a feasible and acceptable alternative to traditional in-person neuropsychological evaluations in clinical practice focused on older adults.

We conducted a systematic review to define the prognostic value of early tumor size response in children with IRSG group III rhabdomyosarcoma. The search included MEDLINE/EMBASE from inception to 18 November 2020. In total, six studies were included, describing 2010 patients, and assessed by the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) instrument. Four studies found no prognostic value for tumor size response, whereas two studies reported a prognostic effect. In these two studies, the survival rate of patients with progressive disease was not separately analyzed from patients with stable disease, potentially explaining the difference in study outcome. In conclusion, our findings support that early progression of disease is associated with poorer survival, justifying adaptation of therapy. However, in patients with non-progressive disease, there is no evidence that the degree of response is a prognostic marker for survival. Because the vast majority of patients do not have progressive disease, early tumor size response should be reconsidered for assessment of treatment efficacy.

Spirometry is currently being done in hospital settings by having the patients blow the air out of their lungs forcefully and into the spirometer's tubes under the supervision and constant guidance of clinicians. This test is expensive, cumbersome and not easily applicable to every-day monitoring of these patients. The lung mechanism when performing a cough is very similar to when spirometry test is done. That includes a big inhalation, air compression and forceful exhalation. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that obstruction of lung airways should have a similar effect on both cough features and spirometry measures. This paper explores the estimation of lung obstruction using cough acoustic features. A total number of 3695 coughs were collected from patients from 4 different conditions and 4 different severity categories along with their lung function measures in a clinical setting using a smartphone's microphone and a hospital-grade spirometry lab. After feature-set optimization and model hyperparameter tuning, the lung obstruction was estimated with MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of 8% for COPD and 9% for asthma populations. In addition to lung obstruction estimation, we were able to classify patients' disease state with 91% accuracy and patients' severity within each disease state with 95% accuracy.Clinical Relevance- This enables effort-independent estimation of lung function spirometry parameters which could potentially lead to passive monitoring of pulmonary patients.","output":"Estimation of the Lung Function Using Acoustic Features of the Voluntary Cough."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the magnitude and determinants of knowledge of pregnancy danger signs in Chiro town health institutions, Ethiopia.

The current taxonomy of vt identifies three vt1 (a,c,d) and seven vt2 (a to g) subtypes. PCR detection of vt is convenient and rapid, but protocols may not detect all currently identified variants or subtypes of vt . The Health Canada Compendium of Analytical Methods for the analysis of food for VTEC is MFLP-52. MFLP-52 includes a VT Screening PCR that is used to determine the presumptive presence of VTEC by the detection of vt in food enrichments, and to differentiate VTEC from other isolates. The VT Screening PCR was developed prior to the establishment of the current vt taxonomy. An evaluation of VT Screening PCR for detection of the ten established vt -subtypes was performed and it was discovered that the method could not detect subtypes vt1d and vt2f .

Research groups have reported detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on surfaces days or weeks after the virus has been deposited, making it difficult to estimate when an infected individual may have shed virus onto a SARS-CoV-2-positive surface, which in turn complicates the process of establishing effective quarantine measures. In this study, we determined that reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) detection of viral RNA from heat-inactivated particles experiences minimal decay over 7 days of monitoring on eight out of nine surfaces tested. The properties of the studied surfaces result in RT-qPCR signatures that can be segregated into two material categories, rough and smooth, where smooth surfaces have a lower limit of detection. RT-qPCR signal intensity (average quantification cycle [Cq]) can be correlated with surface viral load using only one linear regression model per material category. The same experiment was performed with untreated viral particles on one surface from each category, with essentially identical results. The stability of RT-qPCR viral signal demonstrates the need to clean monitored surfaces after sampling to establish temporal resolution. Additionally, these findings can be used to minimize the number of materials and time points tested and allow for the use of heat-inactivated viral particles when optimizing environmental monitoring methods. IMPORTANCE Environmental monitoring is an important tool for public health surveillance, particularly in settings with low rates of diagnostic testing. Time between sampling public environments, such as hospitals or schools, and notifying stakeholders of the results should be minimal, allowing decisions to be made toward containing outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The Safer At School Early Alert program (SASEA) (https://saseasystem.org/), a large-scale environmental monitoring effort in elementary school and child care settings, has processed >13,000 surface samples for SARS-CoV-2, detecting viral signals from 574 samples. However, consecutive detection events necessitated the present study to establish appropriate response practices around persistent viral signals on classroom surfaces. Other research groups and clinical labs developing environmental monitoring methods may need to establish their own correlation between RT-qPCR results and viral load, but this work provides evidence justifying simplified experimental designs, like reduced testing materials and the use of heat-inactivated viral particles.","output":"Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA Persistence across Indoor Surface Materials Reveals Best Practices for Environmental Monitoring Programs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) 2 lopinavir/ritonavir was selected for treatment.

This study was conducted to assess the CT features in confirmed cases with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively, initial chest CT data of 363 confirmed cases with COVID-19 were reviewed. All subjects were stratified into three groups based on patients clinical outcomes; non-critical group (n=194), critical group (n=65), and death group (n=104). The detailed of CT findings were collected from patients medical records and then evaluated for each group. In addition, multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze risk factors according to CT findings in three groups of patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Compared with the non-critical group, mixed ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation lesion, pleural effusion lesion, presence of diffuse opacity in cases, more than 2 lobes involved and opacity scores were significantly higher in the critical and death groups (P<0.05). Having more mixed GGO with consolidation, pleural effusion, lack of pure GGO, more diffuse opacity, involvement of more than 2 lobes and high opacity score identified as independent risk factors of critical and death groups.

OBJECTIVES: This study examined the presence of CPV-2 variants in the fecal samples of dogs diagnosed with canine parvovirus in Bogot. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from 54 puppies and young dogs (< 1 year) that tested positive for the CPV through rapid antigen test detection between 2014C2018. Molecular screening was developed for VP1 because primers 555 for VP2 do not amplify, it was necessary to design a primer set for VP2 amplification of 982 nt. All samples that were amplified were sequenced by Sanger. Phylogenetics and structural analysis was carried out, focusing on residue 426. RESULTS: As a result 47 out of 54 samples tested positive for VP1 screening, and 34/47 samples tested positive for VP2 980 primers as subtype 2a (n = 30) or 2b (n = 4); subtype 2c was not detected. All VP2 sequences had the amino acid, T, at 440, and most Colombian sequences showed an S514A substitution, which in the structural modeling is located in an antigenic region, together with the 426 residue.

Using a MALDI-TOF based assay, we screen 1971 approved clinical compounds and identify five compounds that inhibit PLpro with IC(50)s in the low micromolar range but showed cross reactivity with other human deubiquitinases and had no significant antiviral activity in cellular SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. We therefore looked for alternative methods to block PLpro activity and engineered competitive nanobodies that bind to PLpro at the substrate binding site with nanomolar affinity thus inhibiting the enzyme.

The survey showed the negative impact of the pandemic on chemotherapeutic preparations, with decreased productions during the first and second waves (February-May 2020, and November 2020 to January 2021). The survey also helped visualize the stress levels and workloads of pharmacists. More than 70% of participants reported in August 2020 to have needed to procure themselves with Personal Protective Equipment. Working hours increased for 43% of the respondents, and more than 60% reported to have felt emotionally stressed. Conclusions: Thus, the presented results give a broad, yet detailed overview of how the pandemic has affected health professionals both in the hospital and the community, how professionals and governments have reacted to the situation, and how the care of oncology patience and the practice of oncology pharmacy has changed and reacted during the first year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 of oncology pharmacy services: Results of 8-months survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The review discusses the pathogenetic mechanisms of the development of respiratory infection COVID-19 and the clinical use of cell technologies based on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).

In much of the world, the demand for donor tissue heavily outstrips supply. With developments within lamellar corneal graft surgery, the use of split corneal donor tissue to increase donor tissue supply seems a pragmatic solution to reduce the supply and demand mismatch. This is especially important with tissue supply expected to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A literature review of techniques was performed, enabling multiple transplants to be derived from a single donor and simulation of a model to quantify the number of corneas potentially saved. RESULTS: Studies on splitting corneal donor tissue have demonstrated that up to 5 recipients may benefit from 1 donor scleral button. The impact of splitting donor tissue may provide a saving of up to 25.3% of donor graft tissue.

It has subsequently been reported globally, although there are limited data in lung transplant recipients. OBJECTIVES To prospectively analyze whether human metapneumovirus was circulating in our adult lung transplant community and assess the morbidity of this infection and to compare the clinical presentation and outcome after intravenous ribavirin of human metapneumovirus with that of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). METHODS Lung transplant patients with clinical features of respiratory viral infection underwent nasopharyngeal aspirates. Patients with a positive specimen for RSV or human metapneumovirus by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis and graft dysfunction received intravenous ribavirin and pulse steroid therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Eighty-nine patients had 199 visits for aspirate studies. A viral cause was determined for 62 visits in 47 patients (19 human metapneumovirus, 18 RSV, 13 parainfluenza, 9 influenza A, 2 adenovirus, and 1 influenza B). A significant percentage of patients with metapneumovirus (63%) and RSV (72%) developed graft dysfunction, with average declines in FEV(1) of 30 +/- 12.4% and 25.9 +/- 11.2%, respectively. In these patients, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome onset or progression occurred in no patients with human metapneumovirus compared with 5 of 13 (38%) patients with RSV at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS Human metapneumovirus is a leading cause of acute respiratory tract illness in lung transplant recipients. The incidence and clinical spectrum at presentation are similar to RSV, although the latter seems to be associated with a higher risk of chronic rejection.

DESIGN: Living systematic review and network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: World Health Organization covid-19 database, a comprehensive multilingual source of global covid-19 literature to 25 March 2021, and six additional Chinese databases to 20 February 2021. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised trials of people at risk of covid-19 who were assigned to receive prophylaxis or no prophylaxis (standard care or placebo). Pairs of reviewers independently screened potentially eligible articles. METHODS: Random effects bayesian network meta-analysis was performed after duplicate data abstraction. Included studies were assessed for risk of bias using a modification of the Cochrane risk of bias 2.0 tool, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS: The first iteration of this living network meta-analysis includes nine randomised trialssix of hydroxychloroquine (n=6059 participants), one of ivermectin combined with iota-carrageenan (n=234), and two of ivermectin alone (n=540), all compared with standard care or placebo. Two trials (one of ramipril and one of bromhexine hydrochloride) did not meet the sample size requirements for network meta-analysis. Hydroxychloroquine has trivial to no effect on admission to hospital (risk difference 1 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% credible interval 3 fewer to 4 more; high certainty evidence) or mortality (1 fewer per 1000, 2 fewer to 3 more; high certainty). Hydroxychloroquine probably does not reduce the risk of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (2 more per 1000, 18 fewer to 28 more; moderate certainty), probably increases adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation (19 more per 1000, 1 fewer to 70 more; moderate certainty), and may have trivial to no effect on suspected, probable, or laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (15 fewer per 1000, 64 fewer to 41 more; low certainty). Owing to serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision, and thus very low certainty of evidence, the effects of ivermectin combined with iota-carrageenan on laboratory confirmed covid-19 (52 fewer per 1000, 58 fewer to 37 fewer), ivermectin alone on laboratory confirmed infection (50 fewer per 1000, 59 fewer to 16 fewer) and suspected, probable, or laboratory confirmed infection (159 fewer per 1000, 165 fewer to 144 fewer) remain very uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis has trivial to no effect on hospital admission and mortality, probably increases adverse effects, and probably does not reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because of serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision, it is highly uncertain whether ivermectin combined with iota-carrageenan and ivermectin alone reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Aspergillosis, candidiasis, fusariosis, mucormycosis, cryptococcosis and trichosporonosis are the most important infections reported in patients with hematologic malignancies that undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These infections are caused by opportunistic fungal pathogens that do not cause severe issues in healthy individuals, but in patients with hematologic malignancies lead to disseminated infection with different clinical manifestations. Prophylaxis and creating a safe environment with proper filters and air pressure for patients to avoid contact with the pathogens in the surrounding environment can prevent IFI. Furthermore, due to the absence of specific symptoms in IFI, rapid and accurate diagnosis reduces the mortality rate of these infections and using molecular techniques along with standard mycological methods will improve the diagnosis of disseminated fungal infection in patients with hematologic disorders. Amphotericin B products, extended-spectrum azoles, and echinocandins are the essential drugs to control invasive fungal infections in patients with hematologic malignancies, and according to various conditions of patients, different results of treatment with these drugs have been reported in different studies.

The objective of the trial was to assess whether the immune response induced by a heterologous SARS-CoV-2 mRNA primo vaccination is non-inferior to that of a homologous mRNA vaccination. Methods We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial in adults 18 years of age and older who received a first dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a second dose of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, 28 to 49 days after the first dose. Randomization was stratified on the vaccine received at the first vaccination. The primary endpoint was the anti-spike IgG antibodies titer measured 28 days after the second vaccine dose. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, Trial, NCT04900467. Findings Of the 414 randomized participants recruited from May 28 to July 2, 2021, 390 were included in the per protocol analysis: 94 participants in group 1 (BNT162b2/BNT162b2), 96 in group 2 (BNT162b2/mRNA-1273), 97 in group 3 (mRNA-1273/mRNA-1273), and 103 in group 4 (mRNA-1273/BNT162b2). The geometric mean titers ratios of anti-spike IgG antibodies for each heterologous regimen relative to the corresponding homologous regimen were 137 (two-sided 95% CI, 110 to 172) in the groups 1 and 2 and 067 (two-sided 95% CI, 055 to 082) in the groups 3 and 4. Levels of neutralizing antibodies to the main circulating SARS-Cov-2 viral strains were higher with the vaccine regimen containing mRNA-1273. Participants who received mRNA-1273 as a second dose experienced a higher rate of local adverse reactions and general symptoms than those who received BNT162b2 (p < 00001).

Various countermeasures such as social distancing and in-vehicle disinfection have been implemented to reduce the potential risks concerning infection, the effectiveness in promoting the use of public transport however remains unclear. Unlike the usual situation where time and cost are the main factors affecting travel decisions, the uncertainty hiding behind the behavior change of public transport users in a pandemic might be greatly affected by the control measures and the perception of people. This paper therefore aims to examine the effects of COVID-19 related countermeasures implemented in public transport on individuals' travel decisions. We explore the extent to which do policy countermeasures influence different groups of people on the use of public transport.

Results show that the restrictions policy lifted by the Dutch central government have significant effect on individuals' transportation mode choice decision during the pandemic. The related measures adopted by the public transport sector, by contrast, present different effects on different people. The older and highly educated people are more susceptible to enforcement measures, whereas young and single Dutch citizens are more accessible to non-compulsory measures.

The NCT03055715 study of the Young DEGRO working group of the German Society of Radiation Oncology (DEGRO) evaluated the prognostic impact of GTV and its changes during RCT. METHODS A total of 21 university centers for radiation oncology from five different European countries (Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, and Austria) participated in the study which evaluated n = 347 patients with confirmed (biopsy) inoperable NSCLC in UICC stage III A/B who received radical curative-intent RCT between 2010 and 2013. Patient and disease data were collected anonymously via electronic case report forms and entered into the multi-institutional RadPlanBio platform for central data analysis. GTV before RCT (initial planning CT, GTV1) and at 40-50 Gy (re-planning CT for radiation boost, GTV2) was delineated. Absolute GTV before/during RCT and relative GTV changes were correlated with overall survival as the primary endpoint. Hazard ratios (HR) of survival analysis were estimated by means of adjusted Cox regression models. RESULTS GTV1 was found to have a mean of 154.4 ml (95%CI: 1.5-877) and GTV2 of 106.2 ml (95% CI: 0.5-589.5), resulting in an estimated reduction of 48.2 ml (p < 0.001). Median overall survival (OS) was 18.8 months with a median of 22.1, 20.9, and 12.6 months for patients with high, intermediate, and low GTV before RT. Considering all patients, in one survival model of overall mortality, GTV2 (2.75 (1.12-6.75, p = 0.03) was found to be a stronger survival predictor than GTV1 (1.34 (0.9-2, p > 0.05). In patients with available data on both GTV1 and GTV2, absolute GTV1 before RT was not significantly associated with survival (HR 0-69, 0.32-1.49, p > 0.05) but GTV2 significantly predicted OS in a model adjusted for age, T stage, and chemotherapy, with an HR of 3.7 (1.01-13.53, p = 0.04) per 300 ml. The absolute decrease from GTV1 to GTV2 was correlated to survival, where every decrease by 50 ml reduced the HR by 0.8 (CI 0.64-0.99, p = 0.04). There was no evidence for a survival effect of the relative change between GTV1 and GTV2. CONCLUSION Our results indicate that independently of T stage, the re-planning GTV during RCT is a significant and superior survival predictor compared to baseline GTV before RT. Patients with a high absolute (rather than relative) change in GTV during RT show a superior survival outcome after RCT.","output":"Prognostic impact of gross tumor volume during radical radiochemotherapy of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer-results from the NCT03055715 multicenter cohort study of the Young DEGRO Trial Group."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Commodity and financial markets are leading points of attraction to investors, but are very sensitive to external crises, such as financial and health crises. An example is the overwhelming plunge in the prices of the assets being traded in most of these markets during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has raised market fear beyond what is historically known, thus calling for an empirical assessment of its degree of persistence. Interestingly, the issue of persistence in financial and commodity markets has not even been generally explored in the literature. Using fractional integration approaches, our findings show that all the considered market fear indices exhibit mean reversion before COVID-19 pandemic, implying that the effect of shocks is transitory. However, persistence is higher during the pandemic period, with fear indices of the gold market (GVZ), energy sector (VXXLE) and Eurocurrency market (EVZ) reaching the unit root zone.

This study estimates the association between case counts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and social vulnerability in the U.S., identifying counties at increased vulnerability to the pandemic. Methods Using Social Vulnerability Index and COVID-19 case count data, an ordinary least squares regression model was fitted to assess the global relationship between COVID-19 case counts and social vulnerability. Local relationships were assessed using a geographically weighted regression model, which is effective in exploring spatial non-stationarity. Results As of May 12, 2020, a total of 1,320,909 people had been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the U.S. Of the counties included in this study (91.5%, 2,844/3,108), the highest case count was recorded in Trousdale, Tennessee (16,525.22 per 100,000) and the lowest in Tehama, California (1.54 per 100,000). At the global level, overall Social Vulnerability Index (e =1.65, p=0.03) and minority status and language (e =6.69, p<0.001) were associated with increased COVID-19 case counts. However, based on the local geographically weighted model, the association between social vulnerability and COVID-19 varied among counties. Overall, minority status and language, household composition and transportation, and housing and disability predicted COVID-19 infection. Conclusions Large-scale disasters differentially affect the health of marginalized communities. In this study, minority status and language, household composition and transportation, and housing and disability predicted COVID-19 case counts in the U.S. Addressing the social factors that create poor health is essential to reducing inequities in the health impacts of disasters.","output":"The Impact of Social Vulnerability on COVID-19 in the U.S.: An Analysis of Spatially Varying Relationships"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Internet of Things (IoT) is a trending technological field that converts any physical object into a communicable smarter one by converging the physical world with the digital world.

As a new energy policy, PPAPs have played an important role in alleviating rural poverty. However, the adoption of solar PV faces multiple barriers from the perspective of beneficiaries. Therefore, this study aims to discuss and analyze factors affecting beneficiaries satisfaction and their trust in State Grid, promoting the adoption of solar PV. METHODS: Based on the integrated American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) and Unified Theory of Acception and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, this study used the Structural Equation Model (SEM) to reveal how the beneficiaries satisfaction enhance their trust in State Grid. The data were obtained from a survey of 928 PPAPs beneficiaries by stratified and random sampling in Chinese rural areas. RESULTS: The results confirm that environmental perception in this study has positive impact on beneficiaries satisfaction. In addition, perceived quality also has a positive effect on beneficiaries satisfaction and trust in State Grid; however, social influence has a negative impact on beneficiaries satisfaction; behavior expectation can directly promote beneficiaries satisfaction while indirectly propel their trust in State Grid.

Doxycycline, with its pleiotropic effects, including anti-viral activity, has been proposed as a therapeutic candidate for COVID-19 and about twenty clinical trials have started since the beginning of the pandemic. To gain information on the activity of doxycycline against SARS-CoV-2 infection and clarify some of the conflicting clinical data published, we designed in vitro binding tests and infection studies with a pseudotyped virus expressing the spike protein, as well as a clinically isolated SARS-CoV-2 strain. Doxycycline inhibited the transduction of the pseudotyped virus in Vero E6 and HEK-293 T cells stably expressing human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 but did not affect the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2. Although this conclusion is apparently disappointing, it is paradigmatic of an experimental approach aimed at developing an integrated multidisciplinary platform. To avoid wasting precious time and resources we believe very stringent experimental criteria are needed in the preclinical phase, including infectious studies with SARS-CoV-2 in the platform before moving on to [failed] clinical trials. Author SummaryThe pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has created a completely unusual situation in rapidly searching for compounds able to interfere with the biological processes exploited by the virus. This new scenario has substantially changed the timing of drug development which has also resulted in the generation of controversial results, proving that the transition from computational screening to the clinical application requires great caution and careful studies. It is therefore necessary to establish new paradigms for evaluating the efficacy of a potential active molecule. We set up a preclinical platform aimed at identifying molecules active against SARS-CoV-2 infection developing a multidisciplinary approach based on very stringent experimental criteria, comprising in-silico studies, in vitro binding tests and infection studies with pseudovirus expressing the spike protein as well as clinically isolated SARS-CoV-2 strains. We focused our attention on doxycycline which has been suggested as potential therapeutic candidate for treating COVID-19 and is currently employed in about twenty clinical trials. Doxycycline resulted effective in inhibiting the transduction of pseudovirus but it did not affect the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2. The results obtained underline the need to define more stringent and controlled pharmacological approaches before wasting precious time and resources with clinical trials.","output":"Doxycycline inhibition of a pseudotyped virus transduction does not translate to inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Objective: To assess the usefulness of online teaching for undergraduate students during this Corona pandemic, to point the drawbacks of online teaching, and to learn the areas of improvement in online teaching for the future.

With improvement in health and sanitation facilities across the globe, there has been almost a 50% reduction in mortality rate due to RHD over the last 25 years. However, recent estimates suggest that RHD still results in more than 300,000 deaths annually. In India alone, more than 100,000 deaths occur due to RHD every year (Watkins DA et al., N Engl J Med, 2017). Children and adolescents (aged below 15 years) constitute at least one-fourth of the total population in India. Besides, ARF is, for the most part, a pediatric disorder. The pediatric population, therefore, requires special consideration in developing countries to reduce the burden of RHD. In the developed world, Kawasaki disease (KD) has emerged as the most important cause of acquired heart disease in children. Mirroring global trends over the past two decades, India also has witnessed a surge in the number of cases of KD. Similarly, many regions across the globe classified as high-risk for ARF have witnessed an increasing trend in the incidence of KD.

RECENT FINDINGS: Most of the research on the topic suggests that for the moment our ability to estimate whether SARS-CoV-2 is a direct causative agent in acute kidney injury (AKI) or whether it has a cytokine storm effect is limited. During our prospective assessment of 333 patients with COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) it was found that frequency of AKI of 9.6% (32 cases). Despite previous data suggestive of the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in urine, we were unable to identify any traces of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in our group. Both COVID-19 severity (odds ratio, ORa=a23.09, confidence interval, CI 7.89-67.57, Pa<a0.001) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) history (ORa=a7.17, CI 2.09-24.47, Pa=a0.002) were associated with the AKI rate.

METHODS: Ninety-four consecutive patients (mean age 64 years) admitted for acute respiratory failure on COVID-19 were enrolled. Coupling of right ventricular function to the pulmonary circulation was evaluated by a comprehensive trans-thoracic echocardiography with focus on the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) to systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PASP) ratio RESULTS: The majority of patients needed ventilatory support, which was noninvasive in 22 and invasive in 37. There were 25 deaths, all in the invasively ventilated patients. Survivors were younger (62  13 vs. 68  12 years, p = 0.033), less often overweight or usual smokers, had lower NT-proBNP and interleukin-6, and higher arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired O2 (FIO2) ratio (270  104 vs. 117  57 mmHg, p < 0.001). In the non-survivors, PASP was increased (42  12 vs. 30  7 mmHg, p < 0.001), while TAPSE was decreased (19  4 vs. 25  4 mm, p < 0.001).

In the previous study, the detection of the cyanines was achieved by whole body optical imaging, a technique that, due to the limited penetration of near-infrared light, is not suitable for investigations deeper than 1 cm within the human body. Therefore, in order to facilitate clinical translation, the purpose of the present study was to generate a necrosis avid cyanine-based NIRF probe that could also be used for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). For this, the necrosis avid NIRF cyanine HQ4 was radiolabeled with 111indium, via the chelate diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). PROCEDURES The necrosis avid properties of the radiotracer [111In]DTPA-HQ4 were examined in vitro and in vivo in different breast tumor models in mice using SPECT and optical imaging. Moreover, biodistribution studies were performed to examine the pharmacokinetics of the probe in vivo. RESULTS Using optical imaging and radioactivity measurements, in vitro, we showed selective accumulation of [111In]DTPA-HQ4 in dead cells.

Several centers are developing reusable stop-gap respirators as alternatives to disposable N95 respirators during public health emergencies, using techniques such as 3D-printing, silicone moulding and plastic extrusion. Effective sealing of the mask, combined with respiratory filters should achieve 95% or greater filtration of particles less than 1um. Quantitative fit-testing (QNFT) data from these stop-gap devices has not been published to date. Our team developed one such device, the SSM, and evaluated it using QNFT. METHODS: Device prototypes were iteratively evaluated for comfort, breathability and communication, by team members wearing them for 15-30min. The fit and seal were assessed by positive and negative pressure user seal checks. The final design was then formally tested by QNFT, according to CSA standard Z94.4C18 in 40 volunteer healthcare providers. An overall fit-factor >100 is the passing threshold. Volunteers were also tested by QNFT on disposable N95 masks which had passed qualitative fit testing (QLFT) by institutional Occupational Health and Safety Department. RESULTS: The SSM scored 3.5/5 and 4/5 for comfort and breathability. The median overall harmonic mean fit-factors of disposable N95 and SSM were 137.9 and 6316.7 respectively. SSM scored significantly higher than disposable respirators in fit-test runs and overall fit-factors (p <0.0001). Overall passing rates in disposable and SSM respirators on QNFT were 65% and 100%.

The aim of this study was to assess the trends of asthma mortality in China. Methods: Asthma deaths and demographic characteristics were collected from National Death Cause Datasets of Disease Surveillance System between 2004 and 2019. The data were analyzed with joinpoint regression analysis and age-period-cohort (APC) analysis for the mortality rate due to asthma in China. Results: Asthma mortality declined from 2.4 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.3C2.5) per 100,000 in 2004 to 1.6 (95% CI: 1.5C1.7) per 100,000 in 2019. Age-adjusted asthma mortality rates decreased for men and women in urban and rural areas from 2004 through 2019. The decreasing trend of the mortality rate has slowed down substantially during 2007 and 2009. After that, the decreasing trend has stabilized. The asthma mortality rates generally have a positive relationship with the age of the population when controlling for period and cohort. The period trend decreased and then increased when controlling for age and cohort.

Despite our knowledge of many important aspects of influenza virus biology, there is still much to learn about how influenza viruses replicate in infected cells, for instance, how they use entry receptors or exploit host cell trafficking pathways. These gaps in our knowledge are due, in part, to the difficulty of directly observing viruses in living cells. In recent years, advances in light microscopy, including super-resolution microscopy and single-molecule imaging, have enabled many viral replication steps to be visualised dynamically in living cells. In particular, the ability to track single virions and their components, in real time, now allows specific pathways to be interrogated, providing new insights to various aspects of the virus-host cell interaction. In this review, we discuss how state-of-the-art imaging technologies, notably quantitative live-cell and super-resolution microscopy, are providing new nanoscale and molecular insights into influenza virus replication and revealing new opportunities for developing antiviral strategies.","output":"Application of Super-Resolution and Advanced Quantitative Microscopy to the Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Influenza Virus Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To determine the safety and efficacy of aerobic exercise on activities of daily living in the subacute phase after stroke. DESIGN Multicentre, randomised controlled, endpoint blinded trial. SETTING Seven inpatient rehabilitation sites in Germany (2013-17). PARTICIPANTS 200 adults with subacute stroke (days 5-45 after stroke) with a median National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS, range 0-42 points, higher values indicating more severe strokes) score of 8 (interquartile range 5-12) were randomly assigned (1:1) to aerobic physical fitness training (n=105) or relaxation sessions (n=95, control group) in addition to standard care. INTERVENTION Participants received either aerobic, bodyweight supported, treadmill based physical fitness training or relaxation sessions, each for 25 minutes, five times weekly for four weeks, in addition to standard rehabilitation therapy. Investigators and endpoint assessors were masked to treatment assignment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcomes were change in maximal walking speed (m/s) in the 10 m walking test and change in Barthel index scores (range 0-100 points, higher scores indicating less disability) three months after stroke compared with baseline. Safety outcomes were recurrent cardiovascular events, including stroke, hospital readmissions, and death within three months after stroke. Efficacy was tested with analysis of covariance for each primary outcome in the full analysis set. Multiple imputation was used to account for missing values. RESULTS Compared with relaxation, aerobic physical fitness training did not result in a significantly higher mean change in maximal walking speed (adjusted treatment effect 0.1 m/s (95% confidence interval 0.0 to 0.2 m/s), P=0.23) or mean change in Barthel index score (0 (-5 to 5), P=0.99) at three months after stroke. A higher rate of serious adverse events was observed in the aerobic group compared with relaxation group (incidence rate ratio 1.81, 95% confidence interval 0.97 to 3.36). CONCLUSIONS Among moderately to severely affected adults with subacute stroke, aerobic bodyweight supported, treadmill based physical fitness training was not superior to relaxation sessions for maximal walking speed and Barthel index score but did suggest higher rates of adverse events. These results do not appear to support the use of aerobic bodyweight supported fitness training in people with subacute stroke to improve activities of daily living or maximal walking speed and should be considered in future guidelines.

METHODS A prospective monitoring system was implemented to monitor CEA outcomes at a major academic medical centre. Independent, trained monitors from the neurology department examined all patients undergoing CEA preoperatively and postoperatively at 24 h and 30 days. Clinical variables were analysed to identify risk factors for CHS, which was defined as cases with postoperative development of a severe headache, new neurological deficits without infarction, seizure or intracerebral haemorrhage. RESULTS Between 2008 and 2010, 841 CEAs were monitored and CHS occurred in 14 (1.7%) subjects, including seizures in 5 (0.6%) and intracerebral haemorrhage in 4 (0.5%). Univariate analysis identified a history of dyslipidaemia, coronary artery disease, diastolic blood pressure, intraoperative shunt use and non-elective CEA (performed during hospitalisation for a symptomatic ipsilateral stroke, transient ischaemic attack or amaurosis fugax) as potential risks for CHS (all p0.15); other variables-including the degree of ipsilateral and contralateral stenosis, operative time, intraoperative EEG slowing, history of prior CEA or carotid stent and time from prior carotid interventions- were not significant.

In previous studies we found that the application of ultraviolet light C (UV-C) in liquid plasma that was inoculated with a variety of bacteria or viruses of importance in the swine industry can be considered as redundant safety steps because in general achieve around 4 logs reduction for most of these pathogens. However, the final validation of the UV-C light as safety feature should be conducted with commercial liquid plasma and using the pig bioassay model. As a first objective, the potential infectivity of a raw liquid plasma product collected from an abattoir was tested by means of a swine bioassay. We used Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2), a ubiquitous virus that has been systematically detected by PCR in porcine plasma at abattoirs as selection criteria for commercial liquid plasma lot. As a second aim of the study, the effects of different doses of UV-C irradiation on the selected raw liquid plasma were assayed in the animal bioassay. Moreover, other swine infecting agents, including Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), were also determined in the original plasma and monitored in the inoculated animals. Pigs negative for PCV-2 and PRRSV genome and antibodies were allotted to one of five groups (6 to 8 pigs/ group) and injected intra-peritoneally with 10 mL of their assigned inoculum at 50 d of age. Negative control pigs (group 1) were injected with PBS. Positive control pigs (group 5) were injected with a PCV-2 inoculum. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were injected with liquid porcine plasma that had been subjected to 0 (raw plasma), 3000 or 9000 J/L UV-C irradiation, respectively.

However, to date there has been no review of implementation literature specific to adolescent healthcare. This integrative review therefore aimed to determine what implementation science theories, models and frameworks have been applied, what elements of these frameworks have been identified as influential in promoting the implementation and sustainability of service intervention, and to what extent, in what capacity and at what time points has the contribution of adolescent consumer perspectives on evidence implementation been considered. METHODS: An integrative design was used and reported based on a modified form of the PRISMA (2020) checklist. Seven databases were searched for English language primary research which included any implementation science theory, model or framework developed for/with adolescents or applied in relation to adolescent healthcare services within the past 10 years. Content and thematic analysis were applied with the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) used to frame analysis of the barriers and facilitators to effective implementation of evidence-informed interventions within youth health settings. RESULTS From 8717 citations, 13 papers reporting 12 studies were retained. Nine different implementation science theories, frameworks or approaches were applied; six of 12 studies used the CFIR, solely or with other models. All CFIR domains were represented as facilitators and barriers for implementation in included studies. However, there was little or no inclusion of adolescents in the development or review of these initiatives. Only three mentioned youth input, occurring in the pre-implementation or implementation stages. CONCLUSIONS The few studies found for this review highlight the internationally under-developed nature of this topic. Flagging the importance of the unique characteristics of this particular age group, and of the interventions and strategies to target it, the minimal input of adolescent consumers is cause for concern. Further research is clearly needed and must ensure that youth consumers are engaged from the start and consistently throughout; that their voice is prioritised and not tokenistic; that their contribution is taken seriously.

OBJECTIVES Evaluate the relative properties of four leading candidate trial designs - 'single-factor', 'multi-arm', 'all-in-one', and 'factorial' designs - for assessing individual and/or combination prevention intervention approaches. METHODS Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted, assuming a putative combination approach could choose its components from two candidate biomedical interventions, i.e. Treatment-as-Prevention (TasP) and Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), and three candidate behavioral interventions, i.e. linkage-to-care, counseling, and use of condoms. Various scenarios for individual components' effect sizes, their possible interaction, and the sample size based on real clinical studies are considered. RESULTS The all-in-one and factorial designs used to assess a combination approach and the multi-arm design used to assess multiple individual components are consistently more powerful than single-factor designs. The all-in-one design is powerful when the individual components are effective without negative interaction, while the factorial design is more consistently powerful across a broad array of settings. CONCLUSIONS The multi-arm design is useful for evaluating single factor regimens, while the all-in-one and factorial designs are sensitive in assessing the overall efficacy when there is interest in combining individual component regimens anticipated to have complementary mechanisms. The factorial design is a preferred approach when assessing combination regimens due to its favorable power properties and since it is the only design providing direct insights about the contribution of individual components to the combination approach's overall efficacy and about potential interactions.","output":"Trial designs for evaluating combination HIV prevention approaches."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Engineered camelid antibody multimers can potently block SARS-CoV-2 viral entry.","output":"Finding Camel-ot: A Holy Grail against pandemic SARS-CoV-2?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A emergncia da pandemia causada pela COVID-19 reclama enfaticamente pensar o estreitamento da relao homem-poder-violncia e a ressignificao do lugar dos homens na sustentao da vida reprodutiva, dos la?os emocionais e do cuidado.

Results showed that the dry weight per unit plant height (mg cm-1) was increased by 12.6% and 23.0% in F-HRW and I-HRW, respectively under salt stress as compared with CK. Application of HRW, regardless of the application method, modulated the antioxidant activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) while reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) contents under salt stress. Moreover, significant and positive relations were observed among total dry weight and shoot dry weight, dry weight per unit plant height, SOD and CAT activity in root.

Our study reveals novel interaction data on the variants and SARS-CoV-2. We could show that ACE2-K26R; which is more frequent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population decrease the electrostatic attraction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2. On the contrary, ACE2-I468V, R219C, K341R, D206G, G211R were found to increase the electrostatic attraction and increase the binding to SARS-CoV-2; ordered by the strength of binding from weakest to strongest. I468V, R219C, K341R, D206G and G211R were more frequent in East Asian, South Asian, African and African American, European and European and South Asian populations, respectively. SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 interface in the WT protein and corresponding variants is showed to be a dominated by van der Waals (vdW) interactions. All the mutations except K341R induce an increase in the vdW attractions between the ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2. The largest increase of is observed for the R219C mutant.","output":"ACE2 coding variants in different populations and their potential impact on SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Today, increasing Internet of Things devices are deployed, and the field of applications for decentralized, self-organizing networks keeps growing. The growth also makes these systems more attractive to attackers. Sybil attacks are a common issue, especially in decentralized networks and networks that are deployed in scenarios with irregular or unreliable Internet connectivity. The lack of a central authority that can be contacted at any time allows attackers to introduce arbitrary amounts of nodes into the network and manipulate its behavior according to the attackers goals, by posing as a majority participant. Depending on the structure of the network, employing Sybil node detection schemes may be difficult, and low powered Internet of Things devices are usually unable to perform impactful amounts of work for proof-of-work based schemes. In this paper, we present Rechained, a scheme that monetarily disincentivizes the creation of Sybil identities for networks that can operate with intermittent or no Internet connectivity. We introduce a new revocation mechanism for identities, tie them into the concepts of self-sovereign identities, and decentralized identifiers. Case-studies are used to discuss upper- and lower-bounds for the costs of Sybil identities and, therefore, the provided security level. Furthermore, we formalize the protocol using Colored Petri Nets to analyze its correctness and suitability. Proof-of-concept implementations are used to evaluate the performance of our scheme on low powered hardware as it might be found in Internet of Things applications.","output":"Rechained: Sybil-Resistant Distributed Identities for the Internet of Things and Mobile Ad Hoc Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the trends of carotid revascularization (endarterectomy (CEA), transfemoral stenting (TFCAS)) for symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid stenosis before, during and after the end of the first lockdown in 2020 in France. METHODS: Nationwide data were provided by the French National Hospital Discharge database (Programme de Mdicalisation des Systmes dInformation). We retrospectively analyzed patients admitted for CEA or TFCAS in all French public and private hospitals during a nine-month period (January-September) in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. Procedures were identified using the French Common Classification of Medical Procedures. Stenoses were considered symptomatic in the presence of stroke and/or transient ischemic attack codes (according to the International Classification of Diseases-Tenth Revision) during the stay, and asymptomatic in the absence of these codes. Hospitalization rates in 2020 were compared with the rates in the same period in the three previous years. RESULTS: Between January and September 2020, 12 546 patients were hospitalized for carotid artery surgery (CEA and TFCAS) in France. Compared with the three previous years, there was a decline in hospitalization rates for asymptomatic (-68.9%) and symptomatic (-12.6%) CEA procedures in April, starting at the pandemic peak concomitant with the first national lockdown. This decrease was significant for asymptomatic CEA (p<0.001). After the lockdown, while CEA for asymptomatic stenosis returned to usual activity, CEA for symptomatic stenosis presented a significant rebound, up 18.52% in August compared with previous years. Lockdown also had consequences on TFCAS procedures, with fewer interventions for both asymptomatic (-60.53%) and symptomatic stenosis (-16.67%) in April. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a severe drop for all interventions during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in France. However, the trends in the post-lockdown period were different for the various procedures. These data can be used to anticipate future decisions and organization for cardiovascular care.","output":"Impact of the first COVID-19 pandemic peak and lockdown on the interventional management of carotid artery stenosis in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oxidative stress has been recognized as a contributing factor in aging and in the progression of multiple neurological disorders such as Parkinsons disease, Alzheimers dementia, ischemic stroke, and head and spinal cord injury. The increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, altered metal homeostasis, and compromised brain antioxidant defence. All these changes have been reported to directly affect synaptic activity and neurotransmission in neurons, leading to cognitive dysfunction. In this context two non-invasive strategies could be employed in an attempt to improve the aforementioned stressful brain status. In this regard, it has been shown that exercise could increase the resistance against oxidative stress, thus providing enhanced neuroprotection. Indeed, there is evidence suggesting that regular physical exercise diminishes BBB permeability as it reinforces antioxidative capacity, reduces oxidative stress, and has anti-inflammatory effects. However, the differential effects of different types of exercise (aerobic exhausted exercise, anaerobic exercise, or the combination of both types) and the duration of physical activity will be also addressed in this review as likely determinants of therapeutic efficacy. The second proposed strategy is related to the use of probiotics, which can also reduce some biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines, although their underlying mechanisms of action remain unclear. Moreover, various probiotics produce neuroactive molecules that directly or indirectly impact signalling in the brain. In this review, we will discuss how physical activity can be incorporated as a component of therapeutic strategies in oxidative stress-based neurological disorders along with the augmentation of probiotics intake.","output":"The Therapeutic Role of Exercise and Probiotics in Stressful Brain Conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Synthesis of the available evidence on the effectiveness of medical and cloth facemask use by the general public in community settings is required to learn lessons for future respiratory epidemics/pandemics. METHOD: We utilized search terms relating to facemasks, infection, and community settings on PubMed, the Cochrane Library Database, and Google Scholar. A meta-analysis was conducted utilizing a random-effects model. RESULTS: The review included 12 primary studies on the effectiveness of medical facemask use to prevent influenza, influenza-like illness, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that facemask use significantly reduces the risk of transmitting these respiratory infections (pooled OR = 0.66, 95% confidence interval: 0.54-0.81). Of the 12 studies, ten clinical trials suggest that respiratory infection incidence is lower with high medical facemask compliance, early use, and use in combination with intensive hand hygiene. One cohort study conducted during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, demonstrated facemasks are effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission when used before those infected develop symptoms. One case-control study reported that controls used medical facemasks more often than cases infected with SARS-CoV (p-value<0.05). No primary study on cloth facemask effectiveness to prevent respiratory infection transmission was found. CONCLUSION: Based on the available evidence, we recommend medical facemask use by healthy and sick individuals for preventing respiratory infection transmission in community settings. Medical facemask effectiveness is dependent on compliance and utilization in combination with preventive measures such as intensive hand hygiene. Currently, no direct evidence is available in humans supporting the recommendation of cloth facemask use to prevent respiratory infection transmission.","output":"Facemask use in community settings to prevent respiratory infection transmission: a rapid review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Calibration of a SIR (Susceptibles-Infected-Recovered) model with official international data for the COVID-19 pandemics provides a good example of the difficulties inherent the solution of inverse problems.

We used computer-based immunoinformatic analysis and the newly resolved 3-dimensional (3D) structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimeric protein, together with analyses of the immunogenic profiles of SARS-CoV, to anticipate potential B-cell and T-cell epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein for vaccine design, particularly for peptide-driven vaccine design and serological diagnosis. Nine conserved linear B-cell epitopes and multiple discontinuous B-cell epitopes composed of 69 residues on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S protein were predicted to be highly antigenic. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has a different antigenic profile than that of the SARS-CoV S protein due to the variations in their primary and 3D structures. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 may exploit an immune evasion mechanism through two point mutations in the critical and conserved linear neutralization epitope (overlap with fusion peptide) around a sparsely glycosylated area. These mutations lead to a significant decrease in the antigenicity of this epitope in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. In addition, 62 T-cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein were predicted in our study. The structure-based immunoinformatic analysis for the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in this study may improve vaccine design, diagnosis, and immunotherapy against the pandemic of COVID-19.","output":"Immunoinformatic Analysis of T- and B-Cell Epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: People who inject drugs (PWID) are at increased risk for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and also have high levels of homelessness and unstable housing. We assessed whether homelessness or unstable housing is associated with an increased risk of HIV or HCV acquisition among PWID compared with PWID who are not homeless or are stably housed. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we updated an existing database of HIV and HCV incidence studies published between Jan 1, 2000, and June 13, 2017. Using the same strategy as for this existing database, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO for studies, including conference abstracts, published between June 13, 2017, and Sept 14, 2020, that estimated HIV or HCV incidence, or both, among community-recruited PWID. We only included studies reporting original results without restrictions to study design or language. We contacted authors of studies that reported HIV or HCV incidence, or both, but did not report on an association with homelessness or unstable housing, to request crude data and, where possible, adjusted effect estimates. We extracted effect estimates and pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to quantify the associations between recent (current or within the past year) homelessness or unstable housing compared with not recent homelessness or unstable housing, and risk of HIV or HCV acquisition. We assessed risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and between-study heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic and p value for heterogeneity. FINDINGS: We identified 14 351 references in our database search, of which 392 were subjected to full-text review alongside 277 studies from our existing database. Of these studies, 55 studies met inclusion criteria. We contacted the authors of 227 studies that reported HIV or HCV incidence in PWID but did not report association with the exposure of interest and obtained 48 unpublished estimates from 21 studies. After removal of duplicate data, we included 37 studies with 70 estimates (26 for HIV; 44 for HCV). Studies originated from 16 countries including in North America, Europe, Australia, east Africa, and Asia. Pooling unadjusted estimates, recent homelessness or unstable housing was associated with an increased risk of acquiring HIV (crude relative risk [cRR] 155 [95% CI 123C195; p=00002]; I(2)= 627%; n=17) and HCV (165 [144C190; p<00001]; I(2)= 448%; n=28]) among PWID compared with those who were not homeless or were stably housed. Associations for both HIV and HCV persisted when pooling adjusted estimates (adjusted relative risk for HIV: 139 [95% CI 106C184; p=0019]; I(2)= 655%; n=9; and for HCV: 164 [143C189; p<00001]; I(2)= 96%; n=14). For risk of HIV acquisition, the association for unstable housing (cRR 182 [113C295; p=0014]; n=5) was higher than for homelessness (144 [113C183; p=00036]; n=12), whereas no difference was seen between these outcomes for risk of HCV acquisition (172 [148C199; p<00001] for unstable housing, 166 [137C200; p<00001] for homelessness). INTERPRETATION: Homelessness and unstable housing are associated with increased risk of HIV and HCV acquisition among PWID. Our findings support the development of interventions that simultaneously address homelessness and unstable housing and HIV and HCV transmission in this population.

It is both time-consuming and costly to determine compound-protein interactions or potential drug-target interactions by experiments alone. As a complement, the in silico prediction methods can provide us with very useful information in a timely manner. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To realize this, drug compounds are encoded with functional groups and proteins encoded by biological features including biochemical and physicochemical properties. The optimal feature selection procedures are adopted by means of the mRMR (Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy) method. Instead of classifying the proteins as a whole family, target proteins are divided into four groups: enzymes, ion channels, G-protein- coupled receptors and nuclear receptors. Thus, four independent predictors are established using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm as their operation engine, with each to predict the interactions between drugs and one of the four protein groups. As a result, the overall success rates by the jackknife cross-validation tests achieved with the four predictors are 85.48%, 80.78%, 78.49%, and 85.66%, respectively.

Thirty-five articles with 8,170 patients were included, and all the available studies were case series. The pooled odds ratio for the development of severe COVID-19 was 3.21 for patients with CHD (fixed-effects model, 95% CI: 2.58-3.99), 2.27 for patients with hypertension (random-effects model, 95% CI: 1.79-2.90) and 2.34 for patients with diabetes (random-effects model, 95% CI: 1.79-3.05). The heterogeneity of the studies was moderate for the effect of CHD on COVID-19 severity, but was high for the effects of diabetes and hypertension. Funnel plots and Egger's tests revealed no publication bias in the CHD and hypertension analyses, but suggested publication bias in the diabetes analysis. This bias was corrected using the trim-and-fill method, and was ultimately found to have no effect on the results.

METHODS All clinical records of probable SARS patients in Beijing were collected and input into an Epi6 database, in which 1 291 patients had entire information and met the clinical criteria of SARS. The usage of GCS and GCS associated side effects were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS Patients accepted GCS therapy were 83.96% (n=1 084), whereas 16.04%(n=207) did not take GCS. The average dosage of GCS was 160 mg/d in the first week, and then reduced to 80 mg/d and 40 mg/d in the second and the third weeks, respectively. Initial blood glucose, systolic pressure (SBP), and diastolic pressure (DBP) were no significant difference between GCS group and non-GCS group. The highest blood glucose during the treatment in GCS group was markedly higher than that in non-GCS group [(8.68+/-4.80) mmol/L vs (6.39+/-3.71) mmol/L, P<0.05)]. The highest blood glucose and average blood glucose after initiation of GCS therapy were elevated in GCS group. The levels of blood glucose were correlated with the initial, maximum, and cumulative GCS dosages. Average blood glucose was increased markedly in groups with MP(Initial) > or =80 mg/d (Methyprednisonlone), MP(Maximal) > or =160 mg/d, or MP(Cumulative) > or = 3000 mg. The blood glucose grew up significantly in the first and the second weeks in the treatment with GCS, and then returned to normal level gradually. Hyperglycemia duration in the group with MP(Cumulative) > or =3000 mg persisted longer than that in the other groups (P< 0.05). The lowest serum potassium during the treatment and the duration of hypokalemia in GCS group were significantly different from that in non-GCS group [(3.66+/-0.50) mmol/L vs (4.01+/-0.51) mmol/L, P< 0.001 ;1(1, 75) days vs 1(1, 9) days, P<0.05, respectively]. Average serum potassium and the duration of hypokalemia were related to the dosages of GCS. Serum potassium reached its nadir in the first week of GCS treatment and then grew up in the second week. In groups with MP(Initial) > or =320 mg/d, MP(Maximal) > or =320 mg/d, and MP(Cumulative) > or =3000 mg, the level of serum potassium was lower and the duration of hypokalemia was longer than that in other groups. They began to returned to normal level in the third week. Administration of GCS prolonged the time of hypocalcemia[19 (1, 74) days in GCS group vs 8 (1, 32) days in non-GCS group, P< 0.05]. The duration of hypocalcemia was prolonged according to the increasing of the maximal or the cumulative dosage of GCS. However, the duration of hypocalcemia in group with MP(Cumulative) <999 mg was similar to that in non-GCS group (P > 0.05). After GCS administration, SBP and DBP were increased gradually, and reached their peaks in the fourth week [SBP(117.2+/-14.0) mm Hg and DBP (72.5+/-9.1) mm Hg vs SBP (120.0+/-12.5) mm Hg and DBP (74.5+/-8.7) mm Hg, P< 0.05, 1 mm Hg=0.133 kPa]. CONCLUSION Hyperglycemia and hypokalemia are correlated with GCS dosage and duration. Administration with GCS influences SBP, DBP, and duration of hypocalcemia. Appropriate low dosage of GCS (MP(Initial) and MP(Maximal) < 159 mg/d, MP(Cumulative)< 2999 mg) causes few changes of blood glucose, serum potassium, and blood calcium. It is important to monitor laboratory findings during the treatment with GCS.","output":"[Side effects of glucocorticosteroids in the management of 1291 patients of SARS]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coupling energy intake (EI) to increases in energy expenditure (EE) may be adaptively, compensatorily, or maladaptively leading to weight gain. This narrative review examines if functioning of the homeostatic responses depends on the type of physiological perturbations in EE (e.g., due to exercise, sleep, temperature, or growth), or if it is influenced by protein intake, or the extent, duration, timing, and frequency of EE. As different measures to increase EE could convey discrepant neuronal or humoral signals that help to control food intake, the coupling of EI to EE could be tight or loose, which implies that some ways to increase EE may have advantages for body weight regulation. Exercise, physical activity, heat exposure, and a high protein intake favor weight loss, whereas an increase in EE due to cold exposure or sleep loss likely contributes to an overcompensation of EI, especially in vulnerable thrifty phenotypes, as well as under obesogenic environmental conditions, such as energy dense high fathigh carbohydrate diets.

The United States has borne the largest absolute burden of disease globally, as COVID-19 exploited pre-existing poor population health among Americans to spread rapidly, with devastating consequences. Why does the country that spends the most on healthcare in the world have one of the worst responses to COVID-19? We argue that this is because the United States conception of health is predominantly focused on healthcare, an overwhelming investment in developing drugs and treatments, and an underinvestment in the foundational conditions that keep people healthy. COVID-19 has exposed the limits of this approach to health. In order to prevent COVID-19 and future such pandemics, we must create the conditions that can keep population-level health threats at bay. This means addressing the conditions that shape health, including economics, employment, community networks, racial disparities, how we treat older adults, and the physical layout of our communities. To do so means acknowledging health as a public good, as a transnational project with countries working together to build a healthier world. It also means acknowledging that everyone has a right to health. These aspirations should become core to the global communitys health aspirations in the post-COVID-19 era.","output":"Claiming Health as a Public Good in the Post-COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Over 25% of burn-injured patients at our institution never attended a follow-up appointment A quality-improvement discharge survey (QIS) identified potential barriers to follow-up as distance from the clinic, transportation, and time off work This study compares follow-up rates before and after the QIS was administered and correlates them with patients' self-identified barriers Methods Following IRB approval, a retrospective chart review was conducted using electronic medical records of adult burn-center admits who responded to the QIS and were discharged between September 2019 and July 2020 Controls were burn-center admits discharged from 2016C2018, prior to the survey period Exclusions included patients with non-burn injuries, and those who died in the hospital were transferred to another hospital, did not require follow-up, or followed up elsewhere Data analysis was conducted using chi-square, t-test, and logistic regression models Results The post-survey group includes 272 patients (mean age 47  16 8, 201 males (73 6%), mean burn size (TBSA) of 9 3%  9 6%) The pre-survey control group includes 878 patients (mean age 45 1  16 8 years, 646 males (73 6%), mean burn size (TBSA) 10 16  11 7%) Compared to the pre-survey group, post-survey patients had a lower frequency of missed appointments (MA) (47 3% post vs 56% pre), but worse overall follow-up rates (63 7% post vs 74 5% pre) Per multivariate analysis, different factors were associated with follow-up and MA in the two groups (Table 1) Rates of follow-up and MA were not significantly different before and after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic Conclusions Patients who were surveyed to identify barriers to follow-up had fewer missed appointments but worse overall follow-up rates Patients fail to follow up due to homelessness, substance dependence, and distance to the hospital These findings are consistent with patients' self-identified barriers to follow-up in a QI survey","output":"101 Homeless Status, Distance from Clinic, and Substance Dependence Associated with Low Follow-Up Rates for Burn-Injured Survey Respondents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has developed into a global health crisis, causing over 2 million deaths and changing people's daily life the world over. Current main-stream diagnostic methods in the laboratory include nucleic acid PCR tests and direct viral antigen tests for detecting active infections, and indirect human antibody tests specific to SARS-CoV-2 to detect prior exposure. In this Perspective, we briefly describe the PCR and antigen tests and then focus mainly on existing antibody tests and their limitations including inaccuracies and possible causes of unreliability. False negatives in antibody immunoassays can arise from assay formats, selection of viral antigens and antibody types, diagnostic testing windows, individual variance, and fluctuation in antibody levels. Reasons for false positives in antibody immunoassays mainly involve antibody cross-reactivity from other viruses, as well as autoimmune disease. The spectrum bias has an effect on both the false negatives and false positives. For assay developers, not only improvement of assay formats but also selection of viral antigens and isotopes of human antibodies need to be carefully considered to improve sensitivity and specificity. For clinicians, the factors influencing the accuracy of assays must be kept in mind to test patients using currently imperfect but available tests with smart tactics and realistic interpretation of the test results.","output":"COVID-19 Antibody Tests and Their Limitations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice associated with COVID-19 disease by undertaking a web-based online survey Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted all over India during the initial phase of COVID-19 hit between March 19, 2020, and March 29, 2020 Anyone aged 18 years and above using social media were included in the study The questionnaire had a section on sociodemography which had questions regarding age, gender, marital status, and occupation This was followed by questions on knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding the COVID-19 pandemic The knowledge scores were summarized as median with interquartile range as the data followed a non-normal distribution Attitude and practice questions were summarized individually as proportions and its association with socio-demographic variables was established using Chi-square test The statistical significance was set at p&lt;0 05 Results: Occupational groups, marital status, and age group had significant difference between the groups with at least one of the practices with p&lt;0 05 Conclusion: Since the study provides enhancing effect of knowledge toward protective behaviors, the awareness raising activities and health education through mass media and campaigns, this should urgently be conducted focusing on effectiveness of hand washing, cough etiquette, social distancing, and responsibility to inform suspected cases to local health authority to prevent COVID-19","output":"Knowledge attitude and practice toward covid-19 disease among various professionals: A cross-sectional online survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has hit Singapore hard.

Methods: 203 study participants underwent whole-body MRI and pulmonary function tests as part of the KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Augsburg Region) MRI study. Both visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) were derived from the T1-Dixon sequence, and hepatic adipose tissue from the proton density fat fraction (PDFF(hepatic)). Associations between adipose tissue parameters and spirometric indices such as forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and Tiffeneau-index (FEV1/FVC) were examined using multivariate linear regression analysis excluding cofounding effects of other clinical parameters. Results: VAT ( = ?0.13, p = 0.03) and SAT ( = ?0.26, p < 0.001), but not PDFF(hepatic) were inversely associated with FEV1, while VAT ( = ?0.27, p < 0.001), SAT ( = ?0.41, p < 0.001), and PDFF(hepatic) ( = ?0.17, p = 0.002) were inversely associated with FVC.

Guidelines were identified through search engines, electronic libraries, and personal contacts, and their content was analysed using an adapted version of a tool from the European DG XII-funded HARMONY project. Twenty-two guidelines were retrieved and 21 were evaluated. Documents varied in scope, approach, content and terminology.

The incidence of posterior segment complications was significantly lower than that of ocular surface lesions. Up to now, there has been no report about optic neuropathy associated with GVHD. CASE PRESENTATION A 23-year-old man presented with visual acuity decline after allo-HSCT for B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Red rashes were found all over the body simultaneously. Visual field examination revealed central scotomas in both eyes. Visual evoked potential showed prolonged P100 latency and decreased P100 amplitude in both eyes. Other ocular examinations showed no obvious abnormality except for blunt pupillary light reflex. The minimal residual disease test was negative after transplantation, and no obvious abnormalities were found in optic nerve and brain by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). After the multi-disciplinary consultation, the rashes and optic neuropathy were considered GVHD probably. As for the treatment, methylprednisolone and Ruxolitinib were suggested, supported by adjunctive neurotrophic therapy. Two months later, the rashes gradually subsided. However, the visual acuity was not significantly improved at latest follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The present case report demonstrated GVHD probably associated with optic neuropathy. Although extremely rare, optic nerve should be considered as a potential target of ocular GVHD, which could expand the dimensions of GVHD.","output":"Optic neuropathy associated with GVHD after bone marrow allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for B-Acute lymphoblastic leukemia: case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II) is the most well-known self-report measure to assess psychological inflexibility, a transdiagnostic pathological process, and targets for interventions.

Patients with diabetes infected with SARS-CoV-2 are likely to have more severe infective changes on CXR and CT chest imaging. Severity of airspace consolidation on CXR is associated with higher mortality, particularly in the presence of co-morbidities such as ischaemic heart disease. Poorly controlled diabetes is associated with more severe acute lung injury on CT.

Mass vaccination is conducted in Morocco using a vaccine against Massachusetts, which is the most dominant serotype; however no information about the pathogenesis and tissue distribution of the Moroccan Italy 02 genotype was reported. 40 one-day-old specific pathogen free chickens were divided randomly into four groups. Group1, 2 and 3 were inoculated intra oculo-nasally with 103.5 EID50 of Italy02 viruses, and group 4 was kept as control. Chickens in each group were monitored for 14 days post-infection (pi). RESULTS: Chickens in all infected groups showed severe respiratory signs, which most of them have been reproduced on 2dpi, with varying times of appearance and disappearance. The infected birds appeared lethargic, reluctant to move, with specific respiratory clinical signs and macroscopic lesions. However no nephritis lesions or mortality were recorded in all groups. The specific histological lesions finding in all infected birds, exhibited tracheal lesions with mucosal thickening, hyperplasia of the surface epithelium, mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate of lamina propria. Primary and secondary bronchi, epithelial hyperplasia and mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate of the lamina propria were also observed. Tracheal lesions developed in all infected birds, confirm the ability of the three tested strains to induce respiratory disease. The results at 14 dpi also revealed that all strains were able to induce serological response. Virus re-isolation from infected organs and amplification of the viral RNA by real-time PCR proved the presence of the virus in lung and trachea of infected chicks. Neither re-isolation nor significant viral RNA detection were detected in the kidney. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that the three strains Italy02 genotype emerging in Moroccan poultry farms have a wide distribution for respiratory system, without kidney damage and without causing mortality.","output":"Assessment of pathogenicity and tissue distribution of infectious bronchitis virus strains (Italy 02 genotype) isolated from moroccan broiler chickens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vaccination coverage for COVID-19 varies among immigrant groups in Norway and between different countries. Most likely, childhood/adolescence and consistent contact with the country of birth help form the attitudes to and the desire for vaccination. We therefore compared the vaccination rate among European-born immigrants in Norway and the vaccination coverage in their countries of birth. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Vaccination coverage, the percentage of the adult population that had received at least one vaccination dose, for 22 European countries with universal access to vaccines by 31 August 2021 was retrieved from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and from the Norwegian emergency preparedness register for COVID-19 for the equivalent immigrant groups in Norway on 30 September 2021. Scatter plots with least-squares regression lines showed the association between the vaccination coverage in the country of birth and the rate in the equivalent immigration group in Norway, in total and by time of residence in Norway (< 6 years and  6 years). RESULT: The model estimated an increase in the vaccination rate in immigrant groups in Norway of 0.64 percentage points for each percentage point increase in the vaccination coverage in their European countries of birth, and explained 63 % of the variation in the vaccination rate in the immigrant groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the co-variation with the country of birth when comparing immigrants with short versus long time of residence. INTERPRETATION: There is a correlation between the vaccination rate for COVID-19 among European-born immigrants in Norway and the coverage in their countries of birth. Attitudes to and desire for vaccination varies between countries and can explain part of the observed differences between immigrant groups in Norway.","output":"COVID-19 vaccination among immigrants from Europe and in their countries of birth./ Covid-19-vaksinasjon blant innvandrarar fr?

Time series analyses from data about crimes known to police between May 2019 and May 2020 are used to explore the extent to which cybercrime has been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. More specifically, we examine whether cybercrime has suffered an increase during the months with the strictest lockdown restrictions, as an effect of the displacement of crime opportunities from physical to online environments. Results indicate that reports of cybercrime have increased during the COVID-19 outbreak, and these were remarkably large during the two months with the strictest lockdown policies and measures. In particular, the number of frauds associated with online shopping and auctions, and the hacking of social media and email, which are the two most common cybercrime categories in the UK, have seen the largest increases in the number of incidents.

There will be a progressive increase in deferred cases during the pandemic that will require completion within a limited time frame once restrictions ease. We investigated the impact of various levels of increased post-pandemic hospital operating capacity on the time to clear the backlog of deferred cases. Methods We collected data from four cardiac surgery programs across two health systems. We recorded case rates at baseline and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We created a mathematical model to quantify the cumulative surgical backlog based on the projected pandemic duration. We then used our model to predict the time required to clear the backlog depending on the level of increased operating capacity. Results Cardiac surgery volumes fell to 54% of baseline after restrictions were implemented. Assuming a service restoration date of either June 1 or July 1, we calculated the need to perform 216% or 263% of monthly baseline volume, respectively, to clear the backlog in one month. The actual duration required to clear the backlog is highly dependent on hospital capacity in the post-COVID time period, and ranges from one to eight months depending on when services are restored and degree of increased capacity. Conclusions Cardiac surgical operating capacity during the COVID-19 recovery period will have a dramatic impact on the time to clear the deferred cases backlog. Inadequate operating capacity may cause substantial delays and increase morbidity and mortality. If only pre-pandemic capacity is available, the backlog will never clear.","output":"The Surge after the Surge: Cardiac Surgery post-COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Assess whether changes implemented to an Extension website increased website traffic and met user needs.

In this case, an integrator is used to combine the outputs of the modules, in this way achieving the goal of predicting a set of countries. At the level of the ensembles, forming a part of the modular network, these are constituted by a set of modules, which are nonlinear autoregressive neural networks that are designed to be efficient predictors under particular conditions for each country.

Specifically, TMPRSS2 proteolytically processes the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) Protein, enabling virus-host membrane fusion and infection of the lungs. We present here an efficient recombinant production strategy for enzymatically active TMPRSS2 ectodomain enabling enzymatic characterization, and the 1.95 ? X-ray crystal structure. To stabilize the enzyme for co-crystallization, we pre-treated TMPRSS2 with the synthetic protease inhibitor nafamosat to form a stable but slowly reversible (15 hour half-life) phenylguanidino acyl-enzyme complex. Our study provides a structural basis for the potent but non-specific inhibition by nafamostat and identifies distinguishing features of the TMPRSS2 substrate binding pocket that will guide future generations of inhibitors to improve selectivity. TMPRSS2 cleaved recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein ectodomain at the canonical S1/S2 cleavage site and at least two additional minor sites previously uncharacterized. We established enzymatic activity and inhibition assays that enabled ranking of clinical protease inhibitors with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 1.7 nM to 120 M and determination of inhibitor mechanisms of action. These results provide a body of data and reagents to support future drug development efforts to selectively inhibit TMPRSS2 and other type 2 transmembrane serine proteases involved in viral glycoprotein processing, in order to combat current and future viral threats. SUMMARY PARAGRAPH Viruses hijack the biochemical activity of host proteins for viral invasion and replication. Transmembrane protease, serine-2 (TMPRSS2) is a surface-expressed protease implicated in the activation of influenza A, influenza B, and coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, to drive efficient infection of the lungs1C5. TMPRSS2 is an attractive target for antiviral therapies, as inhibiting its proteolytic activity blocks efficient viral entry5,6. However, a structural and biochemical understanding of the protease has remained elusive and no selective inhibitors are available. We engineered on-demand activatable TMPRSS2 ectodomain and determined the 1.95 ? X-ray crystal structure of the stabilized acyl-enzyme after treatment with nafamostat, a protease inhibitor under investigation as a COVID-19 therapeutic. The structure reveals unique features of the TMPRSS2 substrate recognition pocket and domain architecture, and explains the potent, but nonselective inhibition by nafamostat. TMPRSS2 efficiently cleaved the SARS-CoV-2 S protein at the canonical S1/S2 site as well as two minor sites previously uncharacterized. We further established a robust enzymatic assay system and characterized inhibition by two additional clinical protease inhibitors under study for COVID-19, camostat and bromhexine. Our results provide a body of data and reagents to enable ongoing drug development efforts to selectively inhibit TMPRSS2 and other TTSPs involved in viral glycoprotein processing, in order to combat current and future viral threats.","output":"Structure, activity and inhibition of human TMPRSS2, a protease implicated in SARS-CoV-2 activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid positive pregnant women were increasingly getting delivery in the health institution.

In contrast, the potential impact of COVID -19 vaccination on asthma is entirely unexplored. Case Study We are shedding light on this critical topic by examining a challenging case of severe asthma exacerbation that a 28-year-old female patient developed after receiving two doses of mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) at our Hospital, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo of Pavia, in Northern Italy. The patient is a fourth year resident at the hospital, and like all health care workers at the facility, has been vaccinated since early 2021. She was an occasional smoker with a 10-year history of asthma and seasonal allergic rhinitis. She also tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on several negative molecular swabs and serology tests. Results After receiving the second vaccine dose, she started experiencing a worsening of respiratory symptoms. Following several episodes, and a severe asthma attack, the patient required treatment with mepolizumab, a biologic drug [interleukin-5 (IL-5)] antagonist monoclonal antibody. Conclusion This single case study is insufficient to draw conclusions about the association between asthma exacerbation and the COVID-19 vaccine. While the cause-effect link between vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and worsening of asthmatic disease might only be suggested, we consider the present case as a valuable prompt for further investigations. This is particularly true from the perspective of mass vaccination of adolescents and children currently underway across the globe.","output":"COVID vaccination and asthma exacerbation: might there be a link?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fear and uncertainty, related to emergency health measures such as confinement by Covid-19, has generated anxiety, depression and stress.

In this study, we used mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected bone-marrow-derived macrophage (BMM) and cyclic phosphate cDNA sequencing to identify the RNA targets of EndoU. EndoU targeted viral RNA, cleaving the 3 side of pyrimidines with a strong preference for U?A and C?A sequences (endoY?A). EndoU-dependent cleavage was detected in every region of MHV RNA, from the 5 NTR to the 3 NTR, including transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS).

MHV with EndoU (EndoUmut) or 2-5 phosphodiesterase (PDEmut) mutations provoked the activation of RNase L in BMM, with corresponding cleavage of RNAs by RNase L.

This motivates the conceptualization of effective interdiction rules to inform human mobility in a manner that the damage to lives as well as the economy could be minimized. In this work, we present three interdiction rules that employ machine learning-based network inference on daily infected cases to infer the influence of contagion between neighboring zones. The proposed rules leverage network science concepts such as coloring and clustering to attain time-varying partial or complete travel restrictions. Through extensive simulation experiments, we show that these strategies yield lower infection spread than greedy and random migration-based tie elimination approaches as well as a balance between contagion mitigation and economic gain.","output":"Effectiveness of Network Interdiction Strategies to Limit Contagion During a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the proportion of COVID\\\\19 infections among a population of Italian Dental workers across different geographical area of Italy and to analyze the impact of both the preventive measures/strategies adopted and the psychological influences.

No objective data is available for youth with spina bifida who use a manual wheelchair, so the seriousness of the problem is unknown. The purpose of this observational study was to quantify physical activity in wheelchair-using youth with spina bifida and evaluate the intensity of activities. METHODS Fifty-three children and adolescents (5-19 years) with spina bifida who use a manual wheelchair for daily life, long distances or sports were included. To assess time spent in several types of activities VitaMove data of 34 participants were used and were presented as time spent sedentary and time spent physically active. This was compared to reference data of typically developing youth. To assess time spent in several intensities Actiheart data of 36 participants were used. The intensities were categorized according to the American College of Sports Medicine, ranging from very light intensity to near to maximal intensity. Data of 25 participants were used to combine type of activity and intensity. RESULTS Children and adolescents with spina bifida who use a manual wheelchair were more sedentary (94.3% versus 78.0% per 24 h, p < 0.000) and less physically active (5.0% versus 12.2% per 24 h, p < 0.000) compared to typically developing peers. Physical activity during weekend days was worse compared to school days; 19% met the Guidelines of Physical Activity during school days and 8% during weekend days. The intensities per activity varied extensively between participants. CONCLUSIONS Children and adolescents with spina bifida who use a manual wheelchair are less physically active and more sedentary than typically developing youth. The physical activity levels on school days seem to be more favorable than the physical activity levels on a weekend day. The low levels of physical activity need our attention in pediatric rehabilitation practice.

The 2009-H1N1 pandemic demonstrated that without a robust mechanism at the international level to ensure fair allocation, developing countries will either not receive the vaccine at all, or receive it significantly later than developed countries. Using procurement of vaccines during 2009-H1N1 as a case study, this chapter explores how developing states may procure a COVID-19 vaccine, if one is developed. It considers both direct procurement of vaccines by developing countries, and procurement by international organizations on behalf of developing states. The chapter outlines some of the unique challenges associated with manufacturing and procuring vaccine, and argues that without strong and meaningful commitments from developed countries to donate vaccine to their developing neighbours, then developing countries are likely to be unable to procure this vital medical resource. Drawing on procurement of vaccine during 2009-H1N1 pandemic this chapter argues that developed states with the capacity to manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine are likely to utilise compulsory requisition and other regulatory measures such as government indemnification of vaccine manufacturers for failure to meet contractual obligations, export control measures, and other parallel regulatory measures in order to delay or prevent the export of a COVID-19 vaccine.","output":"The Procurement of a COVID-19 Vaccine in Developing Countries: Lessons from the 2009-H1N1 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (CADM) is a rare, aggressive variant of dermatomyositis associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and refractoriness to immunosuppressants Antibodies against melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5) are often found in patients with CADM We report a patient with advanced CADM with ILD and MDA-5 antibodies who failed to improve with immunosuppressants We performed 2 TPE over 3 days, using 5% albumin as replacement fluid Although five total TPE were planned, he was transferred for lung transplant evaluation after the second TPE;he died 16 days after transfer without receiving a transplant A literature review identified four patients with CADM and MDA-5 antibodies treated with TPE;all experienced symptomatic improvement of their ILD We attribute our patient's outcome to the advanced nature of his disease rather than a failure of TPE Additional research may indicate a possible reclassification of CADM with MDA-5 antibodies in future ASFA guidelines","output":"The role of therapeutic plasma exchange in clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis with MDA-5 antibody: A case report and review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hospital El Salvador: a novel paradigm of intensive care in response to COVID-19 in central America Lancet Glob Health 2021;9: e241?42?In this Comment, the conflict of interest statement should have included the following: ?By virtue of their roles within a public hospital or the Ministry of Health, MB, LC, WH, and XS are government employees The findings and conclusions in the Comment are only those of the authors ?

Herein, an oxygen plasma treatment on a polymer separator combined with high-speed centrifugal spraying to construct ultrastable interfacial contacts is reported. With the treatment, abundant hydrophilic oxygen-containing functional groups are produced and ensure strong chemical adhesion between the separator and the active materials. With single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) sprayed onto the active materials, a dense thin film is formed as the current collector. Meanwhile, the centrifugal force caused by high-speed rotation together with van der Waals forces under fast evaporation produces a much closer interface between the current collector and the active materials.

OBJECTIVE: To delineate the integrative regulatory actions governing inflammation and metabolism in endothelial cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Metabolomic profiling, glucose labeling and tracing, and Seahorse extracellular flux analyses revealed that the inflammatory mediators, TNF (tumor necrosis factor alpha) and lipopolysaccharide, extensively reprogram cellular metabolism and particularly enhance glycolysis, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and the pentose phosphate pathway in primary human arterial endothelial cells. Mechanistically, the enhancement in glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway is mediated by activation of the NF-B (nuclear factor-kappa B)CPFKFB3 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase 3) axis and upregulation of G6PD (glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase), respectively, while enhanced OXPHOS was attributed to suppression of the FOXO1 (forkhead box O1)-PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4) axis. Restoration of the FOXO1-PDK4 axis attenuated the TNF- or lipopolysaccharide-induced increase in OXPHOS but worsened inflammation in vitro, whereas enhancement of OXPHOS by pharmacological blockade of PDKs attenuated inflammation in mesenteric vessels of lipopolysaccharide-treated mice. Notably, suppression of G6PD expression or its activity potentiated the metabolic shift to glycolysis or endothelial inflammation, while inhibition of the NF-BCPFKFB3 signaling, conversely, blunted the increased glycolysis or inflammation in in vitro and in vivo sepsis models. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that inflammatory mediators modulate the metabolic fates of glucose and that stimulation of glycolysis promotes inflammation, whereas enhancement of OXPHOS and the pentose phosphate pathway suppresses inflammation in the endothelium.

It has been evident that the link structure in a website, better known as the websites information architecture, helps the practitioners with identifying factors that affect the usability of a website. In this sense, practitioners must ensure that the information architecture supports the usage intentions of a websites visitors to better serve and motivate them. However, in many cases, different types of users navigate websites that contain immense amounts of information, so understanding their needs is also important for practitioners. In parallel, this article addresses the problem that different visitors of a large-scale website will need to navigate through dense information to find the information they are looking for, and the information architecture of the website must support different user tasks for the website to be widely adopted. Thus, unlike previous studies, this article combines the principles of information architecture and the technology acceptance model to investigate the effect of information architecture on visitors usage intentions.

To add to this, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened delivery of TB care across the globe. As a global community, we have committed to end the TB epidemic by 2030. The World Health Organization has framed a strategy to achieve this goal which consists of three pillars namely i) integrated patient-centred care and prevention, ii) bold policies and systems and iii) intensified research and innovation. An analysis of the performance of national tuberculosis programmes (NTPs) across the globe against the ten priority indicators recommended for monitoring the end TB strategy show that there are huge gaps at every step in the cascade of care of TB patients. In our view, these gaps reflect suboptimal implementation of existing strategies known to be efficacious and operational research (OR) is one of the best available tools to plug the gaps. In this paper, we define what operational research is and how it differs from other kinds of research. We also share our views and experiences about how operational research can be used by NTPs to identify implementation gaps and their reasons, and develop and test possible solutions - which are then integrated to make changes to policy and practice and eventually improve programme outcomes. OR can be defined as research into interventions, strategies and tools which produces practical useable knowledge that can be used to enhance the quality, coverage, effectiveness and efficiency of disease control programmes, health services or health systems in which the research is conducted. The key steps in integrating operational research in the NTPs include: i) securing political commitment reflected by inclusion of OR in the national strategic plans of NTPs and earmarked funding, ii) having a critical mass of dedicated and trained human resources in OR within the NTP, iii) setting research priorities and steering the direction of research in the country, iv) using output-oriented models of capacity building such as the Structured Operational Research Training Initiative (SORT IT) model and building communities of practice, v) harnessing existing capacity in the country by forging partnerships with academia, vi) NTP-led nationwide, multicentre OR studies, vii) providing access to anonymized patient and programme surveillance data, vii) creating a forum for evidence dissemination and fostering policy change and ix) monitoring and accountability. In conclusion, ending the TB epidemic will not be possible without new tools (diagnostics, drugs, vaccines) and a multi-sectoral response involving stakeholders beyond the health ministry, including private providers, patients and communities. However, timely conduct of operational research to fine-tune programme implementation and ensuring proper deployment of new tools will be equally crucial to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of interventions and ultimately contribute towards ending TB.","output":"What is operational research and how can national tuberculosis programmes in low- and middle-income countries use it to end TB?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A pragmatic shift in the healthcare sector characterized by moving from curative to preventive approaches highlights the role of pharmacovigilance in patient safety.

Methods: Purposeful sampling was followed to recruit study participants, a semi-structured interview guide was used to conduct interviews, and the saturation was reached after the 13th interviewer; no new information was obtained after two subsequent interviews. All the interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed by means of a standard content analysis framework. Results: As per the WHO guidelines, eleven participants were aware of the term ADR. All the participants denied receiving any prior education and attending events about ADRs and were unaware of the Saudi FDA-ADR reporting systems. The use of technologies such as SPAs has been widely accepted with a high level of concern for data confidentiality and privacy. Conclusions: These findings point out the need to build patient-oriented educational programs to increase their awareness of ADR reporting and to prioritize the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to be integrated in the Saudi healthcare system to develop future SPAs for improving both patient safety and signal detection of ADRs.","output":"Understanding Patient Needs Regarding Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Smartphone Applications: A Qualitative Insight from Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The complete picture regarding transmission modes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unknown.

A further model based on kynurenine, 3-methylhistidine, Ornithine, p-Cresol sulfate and C24.0 sphingomyelin, measured one-week later, accurately predicted the duration of IMV (Pearson correlation=0.94). Both predictive models outperformed APACHE II scores and differentiated COVID-19 severity in published data. Conclusion: This study has identified specific metabolites that can predict in advance LOS and IMV, which could help in the management of COVID-19 cases at ICU.","output":"Predictive biomarkers of ICU and mechanical ventilation duration in critically-ill COVID19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article examines the methods of public governance during the first wave of coronavirus infection in the context of ensuring the national tax security. The authors use the experience of Russia and Poland - two post-socialist countries having the same foundations of administrative and legal systems. The purpose of the paper is to identify and evaluate the effectiveness of public governance methods used by public authorities to support the economic systems of Russia and Poland from the point of view of their impact on national tax security. The methodology is based on the philosophical theory of security which served as a basis for designing the characteristics of security risks and threats, as well as the principles of its provision. The authors also used the formal legal interpretation of legal acts to select normative legal acts fixing the applied methods of public administration as well as to clarify their provisions in accordance with the rules of formal logic and jurisprudence. The comparative method was used to select and compare Russian and Polish normative legal acts, Russian and foreign doctrinal sources in the field of theory and practice of public administration, administrative and tax law. The empirical basis of the research consists of normative legal acts and state statistics of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Poland, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The characteristics of tax risks caused by the coronavirus pandemic are revealed, and their correlation with threats to tax security is established. The authors classified tax risk governance methods in the context of the coronavirus pandemic and characterized administrative and economic measures that directly and indirectly affect the tax system. Conclusions are made about the effectiveness of the main tax risk governance measures applied in Russia and Poland, while the Russian measures differ in a wide variety and a high proportion of proactive support measures. The theoretical and practical significance of the research lies in the fact that it allows to identify the existing potential of governance decisions in case of another wave of the pandemic or the emergence of new crisis phenomena in the economy, accompanied by a reduction in supply and demand in the markets (military conflicts, natural and man-made emergencies, etc.).","output":"Methods of Tax Risks Management by the State in the Context of the Coronavirus Pandemic (experience of Russia and Poland)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection presents a high transmission in the group of health professionals in Spain (12-15% infected). Currently there is no accepted chemoprophylaxis but hydroxychloroquine (HDQ) is known to inhibit the coronavirus in vitro. Our hypothesis is that oral administration of hydroxychloroquine to healthcare professionals can reduce the incidence and prevalence of infection as well as its severity in this group. METHODS: Design: Prospective, single center, double blind, randomised, controlled trial (RCT). Participants: Adult health-care professionals (18-65 years) working in areas of high exposure and high risk of transmission of SARS-COV-2 (COVID areas, Intensive Care Unit CICUs-, Emergency, Anesthesia and all those performing aerosol-generating procedures) will be included. Exclusion criteria include previous infection with SARS CoV2 (positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or IgG serology), pregnancy or lactation, any contraindication to hydroxychloroquine or evidence of unstable or clinically significant systemic disease. INTERVENTIONS: Patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive once-daily oral Hydroxychloroquine 200mg for two months (HC group) or placebo (P group) in addition to the protective measures appropriate to the level of exposure established by the hospital. A serological evaluation will be carried out every 15 days with PCR in case of seroconversion, symptoms or risk exposure. Primary outcome is the percentage of subjects presenting infection (seroconversion and/or PCR +ve) by the SARS-Cov-2 virus during the observation period. Additionally, both the percentage of subjects in each group presenting Pneumonia with severity criteria (Curb 65 2) and that of subjects requiring admission to ICU will be determined. DISCUSSION: While awaiting a vaccine, hygiene measures, social distancing and personal protective equipment are the only primary prophylaxis measures against SARS-CoV-2, but they have not been sufficient to protect our healthcare professionals. Some evidence of the in vitro efficacy of hydroxychloroquine against this virus is known, along with some clinical data that would support the study of this drug in the chemoprophylaxis of infection. However, there are still no data from controlled clinical trials in this regard. If our hypothesis is confirmed, hydroxychloroquine can help professionals fight this infection with more guarantees. PARTICIPANTS: This is a single-center study that will be carried out at the Marqus de Valdecilla University Hospital. 450 health professionals working at the Hospital Universitario Marqus de Valdecilla in areas of high exposure and high risk of transmission of SARS COV2 (COVID hospital areas, Intensive Care Unit, Emergency, Anesthesia and all those performing aerosol-generating procedures) will be included. Inclusion criteria: 1) Health professionals aged between 18 and 65 years (inclusive) at the time of the first screening visit; 2) They must provide signed written informed consent and agree to comply with the study protocol; 3) Active work in high exposure areas during the last two weeks and during the following weeks. Exclusion criteria: 1) Previous infection with SARS CoV2 (positive coronavirus PCR or positive serology with SARS Cov2 negative PCR and absence of symptoms); 2) Current treatment with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine; 3) Hypersensitivity, allergy or any contraindication for taking hydroxychloroquine, in the technical sheet; 4) Previous or current treatment with tamoxifen or raloxifene; 5) Previous eye disease, especially maculopathy; 6) Known heart failure (Grade III to IV of the New York Heart Association classification) or prolonged QTc; 7) Any type of cancer (except basal cell) in the last 5 years; 6) Refusal to give informed consent; 8) Evidence of any other unstable or clinically significant untreated immune, endocrine, hematological, gastrointestinal, neurological, neoplastic or psychiatric illness; 9) Antibodies positive for the human immunodeficiency virus; 10) Significant kidney or liver disease; 11) Pregnancy or lactation. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: 1. Intervention: (n = 225): One 200 mg hydroxychloroquine sulfate coated tablet once daily for two months. 2. Comparator (control group) (n = 225): One hydroxychloroquine placebo tablet (identical to that of the drug) once daily for two months. MAIN OUTCOMES: number and percentage of healthcare personnel presenting symptomatic and asymptomatic infection (see Diagnosis of SARS CoV2 infection below) by the SARS-Cov2 virus during the study observation period (8 weeks) in both treatment arms; number and percentage of healthcare personnel in each group presenting with Pneumonia with severity criteria (Curb 65 2) and number and percentage of healthcare personnel requiring admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in both treatment arms. DIAGNOSIS OF SARS COV2 INFECTION: Determination of IgA, IgM and IgG type antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA kit (EUROIMMUN Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG, Germany) every two weeks. In cases of seroconversion, a SARS-CoV-2 PCR will be performed to rule out / confirm an active infection (RT-PCR in One Step: RT performed with mastermix (Takara) and IDT probes, following protocol published and validated by the CDC Evaluation of COVID-19 in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection RANDOMISATION: Participants will be allocated to intervention and comparator groups according to a balanced randomization scheme (1: 1). The assignment will be made through a computer-generated numeric sequence for all participants BLINDING (MASKING): Both participants and investigators responsible for recruiting and monitoring participants will be blind to the assigned arm. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): Taking into account the current high prevalence of infection in healthcare personnel in Spain (up to 15%), to detect a difference equal to or greater than 8% in the percentage estimates through a two-tailed 95% CI, with a statistical power of 80% and a dropout rate of 5%, a total of 450 participants will need to be included (250 in each arm).

We followed up the incidence rates (IRs) of eight infectious respiratory diseases, including chickenpox, measles, pertussis, mumps, invasive pneumococcal disease, scarlet fever, rubella, and meningococcal disease, after COVID-19 mitigation measures were implemented in South Korea, and then compared those with the IRs in the corresponding periods in the previous 3 years. Overall, the IRs of these diseases before and after age- or sex-standardization significantly decreased in the intervention period compared with the pre-intervention periods (p < 0.05 for all eight diseases). However, the difference in the IRs of all eight diseases between the IRs before and after age-standardization was significant (p < 0.05 for all periods), while it was not significant with regard to sex-standardization. The incidence rate ratios for eight diseases in the pre-intervention period compared with the intervention period ranged from 3.1 to 4.1. These results showed the positive effects of the mitigation measures on preventing the development of respiratory infectious diseases, regardless of age or sex, but we need to consider the age-structure of the population to calculate the effect size. In the future, some of these measures could be applied nationwide to prevent the occurrence or to reduce the transmission during outbreaks of these infections.

Data on vaccine effectiveness (VE) of an additional primary or booster dose against infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) among nursing home residents are limited, especially against the highly transmissible B.1.1.529 and BA.2 (Omicron) variants. Weekly COVID-19 surveillance and vaccination coverage data among nursing home residents, reported by skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) to CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) during February 14-March 27, 2022, when the Omicron variant accounted for >99% of sequenced isolates, were analyzed to estimate relative VE against infection for any COVID-19 additional primary or booster dose compared with primary series vaccination. After adjusting for calendar week and variability across SNFs, relative VE of a COVID-19 additional primary or booster dose was 46.9% (95% CI = 44.8%-48.9%). These findings indicate that among nursing home residents, COVID-19 additional primary or booster doses provide greater protection against Omicron variant infection than does primary series vaccination alone. All immunocompromised nursing home residents should receive an additional primary dose, and all nursing home residents should receive a booster dose, when eligible, to protect against COVID-19.

The extent and reproducibility of this is unclear. We evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency general surgical activity in a district general hospital. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients admitted under general surgery and urology between 01/01/2017-31/12/2020 using coding data. Unpaired t-tests were used to compare the total monthly admissions, admissions by diagnosis and monthly operations performed between the first wave (April-May 2020) and average (all months 2017-2019), and between the second wave (November-December 2020) and average. RESULTS: Overall emergency admissions in 2020 were reduced compared to the mean 2017-2019 (4498 vs 5037). Monthly admissions were significantly reduced in the first wave compared to 2017-2019 (mean monthly admissions=284.5 vs 419.8; p < 0.001) with the greatest reduction in patients with non-specific abdominal pain (mean=58 vs 109; p = <0.001). A significant reduction in monthly admissions with pancreatitis (mean=8.0 vs 14.6; p = 0.010) and diverticulitis (mean=10.5 vs 18.8; p = 0.028) were also observed.

BACKGROUND: No study has investigated the role of migraine as a risk factor for development of post-COVID symptoms. METHODS: A case-control study including individuals hospitalised during the first wave of the pandemic (from February 20 to May 31, 2020) was conducted. Patients with confirmed previous diagnosis of migraine were considered cases. Two age- and sex-matched individuals without a history of headache per case were also recruited as controls. Hospitalisation/clinical data were collected from hospital medical records. Patients were scheduled for a telephone interview. A list of post-COVID symptoms was systematically evaluated, but participants were invited to freely report any symptom. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were used to assess anxiety/depressive symptoms and sleep quality. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were constructed. RESULTS: Overall, 57 patients with confirmed diagnosis of migraine and 144 non-migraine controls who had recovered from COVID-19 were assessed at 7.3 months (SD 0.6) after hospital discharge. The number of post-COVID symptoms in the migraine group was significantly greater (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.29C2.25, P < 0.001) than in the non-migraine group.

PRO-C1 was only elevated in patients with ovarian cancer. PRO-C20 could discriminate between patients and healthy controls with AUROC values ranging from 0.76 to 0.92. Elevated levels were confirmed in a separate cohort of patients with PDAC (p < 0.0001). High PRO-C20 levels (above 2.57 nM) were predictive of poor survival after adjusting for the presence of metastasis, age, and sex (HR: 4.25, 95% CI: 1.52-11.9, p-value: 0.006).

COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) comorbidities have significantly increased morbidity and mortality. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor type 1 blockers (ARBs) improve CVD outcomes; however, there is concern that they may worsen the prognosis of CVD patients that become infected with SARS-CoV-2 because the virus uses the ACE2 receptor to bind to and subsequently infect host cells. Thus, some health care providers and media sources have questioned the continued use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs. In this brief review, we discuss the effect of ACE inhibitor-induced bradykinin on the cardiovascular system, on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) regulation in COVID-19 patients, and analyze recent clinical studies regarding patients treated with RAAS inhibitors. We propose that the application of RAAS inhibitors for COVID-19 patients with CVDs may be beneficial rather than harmful.","output":"Good or bad: Application of RAAS inhibitors in COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular comorbidities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This commentary aimed to deconstruct xenophobia and its worldwide impact, particularly on people of Asian descent, amid the global COVID-19 pandemic The commentary begins with an overview of COVID-19s impact on the United States economy and educational landscape, continues with a discussion about the global history of pandemic-prompted xenophobia and its relationship to sensationalized media discourse, and concludes with recommendations to reconsider various aspects of intercultural communication in relation to public health issues","output":"Conflating Culture With COVID-19: Xenophobic Repercussions of a Global Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variant 20I/501Y.V1 (VOC-202012/1 or GR/501Y.V1) is concerning given its increased transmissibility.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of pandemic-related factors on the severity and course of chronic urticaria (CU). METHODS: A total of 194 CU patients who were on regular follow-up, were enrolled in the study. The disease activity was assessed by means of the weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7) and urticaria control test (UCT). Patients were divided into two subgroups according to their disease aggravation as \\"aggravated\\" and \\"non-aggravated\\". Two groups were compared in terms of demographic, clinical, COVID-19-associated parameters, and parameters related with the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on CU management. RESULTS: The omalizumab use was statistically higher (P = .017), and the systemic corticosteroid use was statistically lower (P = .025) in the \\"aggravated\\" group. Adherence to quarantine was significantly lower in the 'aggravated' group (P = .027). 173 patients (89.2%) were unable to contact a dermatologist during the pandemic. Among 186 patients who received treatment for CU before the pandemic, 48 (25.8%) did not continue the existing treatment during the pandemic. CU aggravated in one patient with COVID-19 and remained stable in the other. CONCLUSION: The present study showed that CU patients, especially those on omalizumab therapy, had difficulties in attending medical care and even in the maintenance of their existing therapies during the pandemic.

The authors have proposed a methodology to evaluate frequent item sets of web parts over a dedicated time. Based on the verification of applied methodology on two commercial banks, the results show that stakeholders interest in disclosures is highest in the first quarter at each year and after turbulent times in 2009 their interests decreased. Moreover, the results suggest that stakeholders expressed higher interest than in regulatory required Pillar 3 information in the following group of information: Pillar3 related information, Annual reports, Information on Group.

However, pancreatic transplantation has become debatable following the improvements in the results of islet transplantation and artificial pancreas. Therefore, surgeons who perform pancreas transplants require the best surgical technique that can minimize technical failure. We aimed to report our experiences with pancreatic transplantations. We transplanted 65 pancreatic grafts between 2015 and 2020. Except for one death due to hypoxic brain damage after surgery, no postoperative technical failure was observed. We usually perform duodeno-duodenal anastomosis using the transperitoneal approach, with retrocolic placement of the graft pancreas. There was no leakage from the duodenum even after immunologic graft failure. To prevent venous thrombosis, which is the most common cause of technical failure, we used the inferior vena cava for anastomosis and added graft venoplasty with a patch of donor vena cava or aortic interposition graft to the bench procedure; subsequently, there were no cases of technical failure due to thrombosis post-transplantation. Therefore, the 1-year graft survival (insulin-free) rate was more than 95%.

Many surgical procedures are continuing to be performed during this state of pandemic as is thoracic surgery. We present six cases of tube thoracostomy in COVID-19 patients and the modifications to the routine surgical technique. Methods: We serially attached two closed underwater drainage systems (CUDS) together and added a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to the port of the second CUDS, because the intrapleural air, which passes through the CUDS into the air in intensive care unit (ICU), may contain high concentrations of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Second, we attached the chest drain to the first CUDS in order to prevent the spread of virus during the placement of drain into the pleural cavity. Third, just before opening the parietal pleura, ventilation was put on standby mode and the endotracheal tube was clamped to prevent viral dissemination to the environment. Fourth, we covered the incision with a gauze sponge soaked with sterile saline solution during pleural entry, to prevent viral dissemination into the environment. Results: There were a total of six patients enrolled in our study. All these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. The surgical indication for the chest tube thoracostomy was tension pneumothorax in all six patents. All patients had lung expansion defects and subcutaneous emphysema after intervention. Unfortunately, all of them succumbed to COVID-19, despite best available treatment. There was no COVID-19 infection reported in the healthcare professionals during this study. Conclusions: Thoracic surgical procedures may cause dissemination of high amounts of 2019-nCoV in the environment and thus are perhaps the most dangerous surgeries to perform.

However, such metrics ignore other potentially important acoustic characteristics, in particular the macro-temporal pattern of sounds as constituted by quiet periods (noise breaks). Little is known to date about its effect on noise annoyance and cognitive performance, e.g., during work. This study investigated how the macro-temporal pattern of road traffic noise affects short-term noise annoyance and cognitive performance in an attention-based task. In two laboratory experiments, participants worked on the Stroop task, in which performance relies predominantly on attentional functions, while being exposed to different road traffic noise scenarios. These were systematically varied in macro-temporal pattern regarding break duration and distribution (regular, irregular), and played back with moderate L(Aeq) of 42C45 dB(A). Noise annoyance ratings were collected after each scenario. Annoyance was found to vary with the macro-temporal pattern: It decreased with increasing total duration of quiet periods. Further, shorter but more regular breaks were somewhat less annoying than longer but irregular breaks. Since Stroop task performance did not systematically vary with different noise scenarios, differences in annoyance are not moderated by experiencing worsened performance but can be attributed to differences in the macro-temporal pattern of road traffic noise.","output":"Does the Macro-Temporal Pattern of Road Traffic Noise Affect Noise Annoyance and Cognitive Performance?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tularemia is a rare zoonotic disease found worldwide.

To confirm the sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 assays used at the Wadsworth Center for the detection of VOC and VBM, relevant specimens were selected from the specimen archive and tested in the various platforms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: : Patient respiratory specimens submitted from clinal laboratories across the state were selected; three samples per variant were chosen to account for inter assay and variant reproducibility. The four molecular diagnostic platforms for SARS-CoV-2 currently in use at our facility were examined. RESULTS: : A total of 64 specimens were tested, representing 2 VOC, 8 VBM and 4 other variants circulating in New York State. For certain samples, original Ct values provided by sample submitters were much higher, or lower, than those obtained from this study. The investigation of submitter testing platforms, with consideration of the assay's viral targets, confirmed the differences in Ct were not variant specific.

In this review article, first, we summarize the common mobility measures extracted from accelerometry and GPS. Second, we summarize studies assessing the associations of facilitators and barriers influencing mobility of community-dwelling older adults with mobility measures from sensor technology. We found the most used accelerometry measures focus on the duration and intensity of activity in daily life. Gait quality measures, e.g., cadence, variability, and symmetry, are not usually included. GPS has been used to investigate mobility behavior, such as spatial and temporal measures of path traveled, location nodes traversed, and mode of transportation. Factors of note that facilitate/hinder community mobility were cognition and psychosocial influences. Fewer studies have included the influence of external environments, such as sidewalk quality, and socio-economic status in defining enacted mobility.

We then discuss potential solutions in the realm of translational bioinformatics. RECENT FINDINGS: Current case definitions are inconsistent and do not capture the underlying pathophysiology of MIS-C, which remains poorly understood. Although overall mortality is low, some patients rapidly decompensate, and a test to identify those at risk for severe outcomes remains an unmet need. Treatment consists of various combinations of immunoglobulins, corticosteroids, and biologics, based on extrapolated data and expert opinion, while the benefits remain unclear as we await the completion of clinical trials. SUMMARY: The small size and heterogeneity of the pediatric population contribute to unmet needs because of financial and logistical constraints of the current research infrastructure focused on eliminating most sources of heterogeneity, leading to ungeneralizable results. Data sharing and meta-analysis of gene expression shows promise to accelerate progress in the field of MIS-C as well as other childhood diseases beyond the current pandemic.","output":"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children: a microcosm of challenges and opportunities for translational bioinformatics in pediatric research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Multimonth dispensing (MMD) of antiretroviral treatment (ART) aims to reduce patient-related barriers to access long-term treatment and improve health system efficiency. However, randomized evidence of its clinical effectiveness is lacking. We compared MMD within community ART refill groups (CARGs) vs. standard-of-care facility-based ART delivery in Zimbabwe. METHODS: A three-arm, cluster-randomized, pragmatic noninferiority trial was performed. Thirty health care facilities and associated CARGs were allocated to either ART collected three-monthly at facility (3MF, control); ART delivered three-monthly in CARGs (3MC); or ART delivered six-monthly in CARGs (6MC). Stable adults receiving ART six months with baseline viral load (VL) <1000 copies/ml were eligible. Retention in ART care (primary outcome) and viral suppression (VS) 12 months after enrollment were compared, using regression models specified for clustering (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03238846). RESULTS: 4800 participants were recruited, 1919, 1335, and 1546 in arms 3MF, 3MC, and 6MC, respectively. For retention, the prespecified noninferiority limit (-3.25%, risk difference [RD]) was met for comparisons between all arms, 3MC (94.8%) vs. 3MF (93.0%), adjusted RD = 1.1% (95% CI: -0.5% to 2.8%); 6MC (95.5%) vs. 3MF: aRD = 1.2% (95% CI: -1.0% to 3.6%); and 6MC vs. 3MC: aRD = 0.1% (95% CI: -2.4% to 2.6%).

Cervical cancer screening and early detection and treatment of precancer is one of the evidence-based interventions to reduce incidence and mortality. The application of community-based participatory research (CBPR) has been used in the United States to improve participation in screening and reduce cervical cancer disparities. However, it is unclear whether these engaged approaches have been used in sub-Saharan African to address disparities related to cervical cancer mortality. Objectives: Highlight community engagement in cervical cancer prevention and control in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), describe the community engagement efforts that are currently being used, and to describe the best practices for community engagement toward the end-goal of cervical cancer prevention and control. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, CINHAL, African Journals Online (AJOL), and African Index Medicus-WHO from inception until June 8, 2020. After screening 620 titles and abstracts, and reviewing 56 full-text articles according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, 9 articles met the selection criteria and were included. Relevant data variables were extracted from the included articles and a narrative synthesis was performed. Results: Between 2005 and 2019, 9 articles describing research in Ghana, Kenya, Zambia, Senegal, South Africa, and Nigeria were included. These articles described work that largely took place in rural settings predominantly among women age 15-65 years. Leveraging community networks such as community health workers, religious organizations, traditional leaders, and educational institutions increased awareness of cervical cancer. Working within existing social structures and training community members through the research effort were promising methods for addressing the disparities in cervical cancer incidence and mortality among communities. Discussion: The findings of this scoping review have contributed to the understanding of which novel approaches to community-based practices can be used to address cervical cancer disparities among SSA communities that carry a disproportionate disease burden. Community engagement in the research process, while effortful, has shown to be beneficial to researchers and to the communities that they serve, and provides valuable next steps in the effort to address cervical cancer disparities in SSA.","output":"Community-Engaged Approaches to Cervical Cancer Prevention and Control in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Scoping Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The S?o Domingos mine is within the Iberian Pyrite Belt, a mining district with large concentrations of polymetallic massive sulfide deposits.

A kinetic breast tissue disposition was performed in rats. CUR and RSV were analyzed using UPLC-QTOF-MS and GC-MS, respectively. Antiproliferative activity was tested in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and MCF-10A non-tumorigenic cells. Cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, caspases activation, and endocytosis pathways were determined. CUR and RSV peaked in the mammary tissue (41  15 and 300  80 nM, respectively) 6 min after intravenous administration of EXO-CUR and EXO-RSV, but not with equivalent free polyphenol concentrations. Nanomolar EXO-CUR or EXO-RSV concentrations, but not free CUR or RSV, exerted a potent antiproliferative effect on cancer cells with no effect on normal cells. Significant (p < 0.05) cell cycle alteration and pro-apoptotic activity (via the mitochondrial pathway) were observed. EXO-CUR and EXO-RSV entered the cells primarily via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, avoiding ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC). Milk EXOs protected CUR and RSV from metabolism and delivered both polyphenols to the mammary tissue at concentrations compatible with the fast and potent anticancer effects exerted in model cells. Milk EXOs enhanced the bioavailability and anticancer activity of CUR and RSV by acting as Trojan horses that escape from cancer cells' ABC-mediated chemoresistance.","output":"Milk-Derived Exosomes as Nanocarriers to Deliver Curcumin and Resveratrol in Breast Tissue and Enhance Their Anticancer Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A fully automatic, non-contact method for the assessment of the respiratory function is proposed using an RGB-D camera-based technology. The proposed algorithm relies on the depth channel of the camera to estimate the movements of the bodys trunk during breathing.

Food accessibility implies ability to acquire food through various means. The study is based on primary data collected from field survey in the selected villages. The total sample size is 500. Food accessibility of the households is analysed in terms of their monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) on food. This calculated MPCE has been compared with the MPCE on food as per the minimum food basket for rural India set by the Planning Commission in 2014. The households have been classified into two groups, viz, households lying above the specified threshold of food accessibility are considered to be those having food accessibility and households below that cut off of food accessibility are taken to be those not having that accessibility. Logit regression, applied for finding out the determinants, reveals that number of years of education of the heads of the households, female literacy rate, monthly income of the households, work force participation rate positively influences food accessibility, while monthly expenses on intoxicants have a deterring effect on food accessibility of the households.

Using different cohorts of samples collected before and after the pandemic, we show that this assay is more sensitive than ELISAs performed in our laboratory. The combination of three viral antigens allows for the interrogation of full seroconversion. Importantly, we have detected N-reactive antibodies in COVID-19-negative individuals.

METHODS: We collected data about COVID-19 cases associated with New York City (NYC) public schools from polymerase chain reaction testing performed in each school on a sample of asymptomatic students and staff and from routine reporting. We compared prevalence from testing done in schools to community prevalence estimates from statistical models. We compared cumulative incidence for school-associated cases to all cases reported to the city. School-based contacts were monitored to estimate the secondary attack rate and possible direction of transmission. RESULTS: To assess prevalence, we analyzed data from 234 132 persons tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in 1594 NYC public schools during October 9 to December 18, 2020; 986 (0.4%) tested positive. COVID-19 prevalence in schools was similar to or less than estimates of prevalence in the community for all weeks.

METHOD: Recovering Quality of Life was translated to Traditional Chinese adhering to standard guideline recommended by the official distributors. Five hundred members of the general population were successfully recruited to participate in a telephone-based survey. The following psychometric properties of the ReQoL were evaluated: construct, convergent, and known-group validity and internal consistency and testCretest reliability. The item measurement invariance was assessed on the basis of differential item functioning (DIF). Multiple regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between respondents characteristics and mental HRQoL. RESULTS: Results of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported a two-factor structure of the ReQoL. The ReQoL showed significant correlations with the other mental health, quality of life, and well-being measures, which indicated a satisfactory convergent validity. Known-group validity confirmed that ReQoL is able to differentiate between people with different mental health status. The (Cronbachs alpha = 0.91 and 0.76 for positive [PF] and negative [NF] factor), and McDonalds omega of 0.89 (PF = 0.94, NF = 0.82) indicated the ReQoL has good reliability as well as testCretest reliability with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.75.

AIM: This pilot study aimed to address this knowledge gap by examining GP attendance trends among patients attending a post-COVID-19 hospital follow-up clinic, 3-6 months after an initial clinic visit. DESIGN & SETTING: Data were collected from adult patients attending a post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital (MMUH), Dublin, Ireland. METHOD: Participants completed questionnaires outlining their demographics; medical histories; emergency hospital admissions and readmissions where applicable; and, where relevant, GP attendances following hospital discharge. Analyses were conducted using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: Participants' (n = 153) median age was 43.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 30.9-52.1 years). There were 105 females (68.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 61.3% to 75.9%). Various medical histories were reported among participants. Sixty-seven (43.2%, 95% CI = 35.9% to 51.6%) received emergency COVID-19 hospital care.

RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in bed occupancy rates and case numbers of inpatient treatment. The latter declined by 20.06% in the UKER and 60.76% in the KKH. Nononcological elective surgery was reduced by 33.04% in the UKER and 60.87% in the KKH. The number of emergency procedures remained unchanged in the UKER, while they decreased by 51.58% in the KKH.

Results: 23 (10.8%) of 212 patients died and 34 (16%) were admitted to ICU. The AUC values of MEWS, NEWS, and qSOFA for predicting mortality in < 65 years old were 0.852 (95% confidence interval 0.708-0.997), 0.882(0.741-1.000) and 0.879(0.768-0.990) and >65 years old, 0.854(0.720-0.987), 0.931(0.853-1.000), 0.776(0.609-0.944) respectively. For ICU admission AUC values of MEWS, NEWS and qSOFA in <65 years old followed as;0.882(0.783-0.981), 0.914(0.817-1.000), 0.868(0.764-0.973) and 0.845(0.725-0.965), 0.926(0.854-0.998), 0.815(0.676-0.954) in  65 years old. While < 65 years old;MEWS and qSOFAs optimal cut-off values for mortality were 2 with %90.0 sensitivity %74.7 specificity and 1 with %90.0 sensitivity %74.7 specificity, for  65 years NEWS optimal cut-off is 6 with 91.7% sensitivity and 76.7% specificity. Conclusion: All these three scores have good predictive value for mortality and ICU admission, but NEWS is better than MEWS and qSOFA especially in  65 years old patient with Covid 19 pneumonia.","output":"The Ability of Early Warning Scores to Predict in Hospital Mortality and ICU Admission for Patients with Covid 19 Pneumonia in the Emergency Department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 restructured the health care delivery process, catapulting telemedicine to the mainstream.

We found that chromosome oscillation, an iterative chromosome motion during metaphase, is attenuated in cancer cell lines. We also found that metaphase phosphorylation of Hec1 at serine 55, which is mainly dependent on Aurora A on the spindle, is reduced in cancer cell lines. The Aurora A-dependent Hec1-S55 phosphorylation level was regulated by the chromosome oscillation amplitude and vice versa: Hec1-S55 and -S69 phosphorylation by Aurora A is required for efficient chromosome oscillation. Furthermore, enhancement of chromosome oscillation reduced the number of erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments and chromosome missegregation, whereas inhibition of Aurora A during metaphase increased such errors. We propose that Aurora A-mediated metaphase Hec1-S55 phosphorylation through chromosome oscillation, together with Hec1-S69 phosphorylation, ensures mitotic fidelity by eliminating erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments.

We aimed to describe the association of COVID-19 and T-wave inversion (TWI) in a large case series. METHODS: We conducted an observational, retrospective study of confirmed COVID-19 cases with at least one electrocardiogram (ECG) in a large hospital in New York City (March 23, 2020-April 23, 2020). Patients with new TWI or pseudonormalization were further analyzed. Mortality and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation were the main outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 3225 patients were screened; 195 (6%) were selected for further analysis: 181 with TWI and 14 with T-wave pseudonormalization. Mean age was 66  7 years; 51% were male. TWI were more commonly noted in the lateral (71%), followed by anterior (64%), inferior (57%), and septal (26%) leads. A total of 44 patients (23%) had elevated troponin. A total of 50 patients died (26%). Mortality rates of 35%, and 52% were observed in patients with diffuse TWI, and elevated troponin, respectively. Mortality rate of 80% was observed in patients with both elevated troponin and diffuse TWI. Additionally, 30% of the entire cohort and 58% of patients with elevated troponin required invasive mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that new TWI is a relatively common finding in COVID-19 patients.

Livery yard managers/owners therefore have a major impact on the potential wellbeing of horses within each yard, but their role has not been previously studied. This study used the COVID-19 pandemic as a lens to view the priorities and decisions of livery yard managers at a time when everything was already subject to change. Yard managers/owners of 24 very diverse yards were interviewed over a period of nine months, repeating interviews quarterly. Discussion forum threads on relevant topics about livery yards during COVID-19 were also collected. These data were analysed using a qualitative approach called Grounded Theory. The results showed that running a yard required a careful balance between conflicting priorities, which made change difficult within each individual yard culture. During the pandemic, maintaining usual horse care routines and standards was prioritised above human health and the business model of the yard, and above horseChuman relationships. However, each yard adopted individual approaches to managing human health alongside maintaining equine management. These findings are important for future initiatives which aim to support livery yard management and change. ABSTRACT: Approximately 60% of the UKs leisure horses are kept at livery yards under the management and oversight of a livery yard owner or manager (LYO/M), yet their role has received little research attention. This study used the COVID-19 pandemic as a lens through which to view LYO/Ms decisions around equine care and management at a time when changes to usual practice were necessary. Qualitative research methods were used. Up to 3 interviews were conducted with 24 different LYO/Ms over nine months (n = 48). Discussion threads from open-access UK discussion fora were also analysed. All data were anonymised and analysed using a Grounded Theory methodology. Prior to the pandemic, equine care and management practices varied greatly across yards, and yard cultures were a product of LYO/Ms construction of good equine care, their business model, and the need to balance human and equine contentment. The role of the LYO/M was to maintain an equilibrium between those interlinked factors. During the pandemic, LYO/Ms adopted new measures designed to influence the movement of horse owners and other people on yards to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission. During this time, LYO/Ms reported prioritising equine wellbeing by limiting change to equine routines and management wherever possible. Instead of altering equine management, there was an expectation that the lives of humans would be moulded and re-shaped to fit with the government COVID-19 guidelines. These results highlight the importance of routines, traditions and cultures in each individual yard. Maintaining the standard of care for the horse was prioritised regardless of who provided that care.","output":"Equine Management in UK Livery Yards during the COVID-19 PandemicAs Long As the Horses Are Happy, We Can Work Out the Rest Later"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examined the disruptive influence of COVID\\\\19 pandemic rates in the community on telecommuters' satisfaction with balancing their work and family roles and consequently their well\\\\being.

METHODS: This is a case series of hematological /oncological cases, diagnosed with MERS-CoV, in a tertiary care setting in 2015. The cases were identified based on the World Health Organization (WHO) MERS-CoV case definition. The demographic, clinical, and outcome data were retrieved from the patients medical charts and electronic health records. RESULTS: In total, nine hematological or oncological cases were identified, diagnosed with MERS-CoV. The baseline malignant condition was hematological malignancy in seven patients, as well as colon cancer and osteosarcoma in one patient each. Six (67%) patients were male. The median age was 65 years (range 16C80 years). Co-morbidities included chronic kidney disease (n = 3.33%), diabetes mellitus (n = 3.33%), and hypertension (n = 2.22%). The presenting symptoms were shortness of breath (n = 6.66%), fever (n = 5.55%), cough (n = 2.22%), and diarrhea (n = 2.22%). Chest x-rays indicated bilateral infiltrates in 6 patients (66%).

In all cases, CEE was performed in the acutest period of ACVA. These patients were included in group 1. The comparison group was represented by 89 patients who underwent CEE in the acute period of stroke, in the period before the COVID-19 pandemic (April 1, 2019 - March 1, 2020).

In the hospital postoperative period, the groups were comparable in terms of the incidence of deaths (group 1: 2.3%, n = 1; group 2: 1.1%, n = 1; p = 0.81; OR = 2.09; 95 % CI = 0.12 - 34.3) myocardial infarction (group 1: 2.3%, n = 1; group 2: 0%; p = 0.7; OR = 6.3; 95% CI = 0, 25 - 158.5), CVA (group 1: 2.3%, n = 1; group 2: 2.2%, n = 2; p = 0.55; OR = 1.03; 95% CI = 0, 09 - 11.7). ICA thrombosis and hemorrhagic transformations were not recorded. However, due to severe coagulopathy with ongoing anticoagulant / antiplatelet therapy, patients with COVID-19 more often developed bleeding in the operation area (group 1: 11.6%, n = 5; group 2: 1.1%, n = 1; p = 0.02; OR = 11.5; 95% CI = 1.3 - 102.5). In all cases, the flow of hemorrhagic discharge came from the drainage localized in the subcutaneous fat.

Nonetheless, parasite isolates lacking the pfhrp2 gene are relatively frequent in some endemic regions, thereby hampering the diagnosis of malaria using HRP2-based RDTs. To track the efficacy of RDTs in areas of the Brazilian Amazon, we assessed pfhrp2 deletions in 132 P. falciparum samples collected from four malaria-endemic states in Brazil. Our findings show low to moderate levels of pfhrp2 deletion in different regions of the Brazilian Amazon. Overall, during the period covered by this study (2002-2020), we found that 10% of the P. falciparum isolates were characterized by a pfhrp2 deletion. Notably, however, the presence of pfhrp2-negative isolates has not been translated into a reduction in RDT efficacy, which in part may be explained by the presence of polyclonal infections. A further important finding was the discrepancy in the proportion of pfhrp2 deletions detected using two assessed protocols (conventional PCR versus nested PCR), which reinforces the need to perform a carefully planned laboratory workflow to assess gene deletion. This is the first study to perform a comprehensive analysis of PfHRP2 sequence diversity in Brazilian isolates of P. falciparum. We identified 10 PfHRP2 sequence patterns, which were found to be exclusive of each of the assessed regions. Despite the small number of PfHRP2 sequences available from South America, we found that the PfHRP2 sequences identified in Brazil and neighboring French Guiana show similar sequence patterns. Our findings highlight the importance of continuously monitoring the occurrence and spread of parasites with pfrhp2 deletions, while also taking into account the limitations of PCR-based testing methods associated with accuracy and the complexity of infections.","output":"A Comprehensive Analysis of the Genetic Diversity of Plasmodium falciparum Histidine-Rich Protein 2 (PfHRP2) in the Brazilian Amazon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A variety of rapid molecular PCR tests has been developed and commercialised that interrogate the junction site between the staphylococcal core genome, and the mobile genetic element (SCCmec) which harbours the gene responsible for methicillin-/beta-lactam-resistance. Aim: The purpose of the present study was to investigate why a clinical MRSA isolate yielded false negative test results with widely used, commercial orfX/SCCmec junction site PCR tests. Methods: A collection of isolates that belonged to the same epidemic strain as the index isolate were investigated with commercial MRSA assays and all isolates were sequenced in order to explain this observation. Results: It was found that isolates of the epidemic European CC1-MRSA-IV clone, which likely originated in South-Eastern Europe and subsequently spread to Western Europe, generally exhibit this behaviour. The failure of the assays was attributable to a characteristic large insertion in the orfX/SCCmec integration site presumably targeted by such tests. In contrast to MW2 (GenBank BA000033.2, a CC1 USA400 strain which also harbours SCCmec IVa), the European CC1 clone harbours an insertion of ca. 5,350 nucleotides adjacent to orfX. This sequence starts with a novel SCC terminal sequence alternate to dcs and encodes six different hypothetical proteins (E7MHX1, ydiL2, C5QAP8, A8YYX4, npd-SCC, H4AYD7; nucleotide positions 280,690-286,024 of GenBank RBVO000005.1). An SCCmec element with the same insertion was previously found in a Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate (GenBank MH188467.1) suggesting transfer between staphylococcal species. Conclusion: In order to ensure the reliability of molecular MRSA tests, it is vital to monitor the emergence of new SCCmec junction sites, not only in Staphylococcus aureus but also in coagulase-negative staphylococci.","output":"An epidemic CC1-MRSA-IV clone yields false negative test results in molecular MRSA identification assays: a note of caution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory viruses are responsible for a variety of clinical syndromes including the common cold, acute otitis media, laryngitis, sinusitis, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, influenza-like illness, and exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Even if the efficacy of this combination is under evaluation, clinicians have begun to use it largely. As these medications are known to prolong QT interval, we analyzed serial electrocardiograms (ECG) performed in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia and treated with HCQ + AZ. 50 consecutive patients received the combination of HCQ (600mg/d for 10 days) and AZ (500mg Day 1 and 250mg daily days 2 to 5). Twelve-lead ECG were performed before treatment, at Day 3, 5 and at discharge. Median age of patients was 68 years, 55.2% were males. Main comorbidities were hypertension (37%) and diabetes (17%). Mean QTc was 408 ms at baseline and rose up to 437 ms at Day 3 and to 456 ms at Day 5. 38 patients (76 %) presented short term modifications of QTc (> 30 ms). Treatment discontinuation was decided in 6 patients (12%) leading to QTc normalization in 5 of them. No death, no cardiac arrhythmic event were observed in this cohort. Our report confirms that a short duration treatment with HCQ + AZ modifies QTc interval. Treatment has to be stopped for QTc modifications in 12% of patients. Nevertheless, in inpatients hospitalized for COVID-19, we did not observe any clinically relevant consequence of these transitory modifications. In conclusion, when patients are treated with HCQ+AZ, cardiac monitoring should be regularly performed and hospital settings allow to do it in safe conditions.","output":"ACUTE QT INTERVAL MODIFICATIONS DURING HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE-AZITHROMYCIN TREATMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF COVID-19 INFECTION."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Penyebaran COVID-19 yang begitu cepat dan tidak terkendali membutuhkan upaya dari pemerintah dan peran masyarakat untuk memutus rantai penularan virus tersebut.

We aimed to identify previously unreported immune markers able to discriminate COVID-19 patients from healthy controls and to predict mild and severe disease. METHODS: An observational, prospective, multicentric study was conducted in patients with confirmed mild/moderate (n = 7) and severe (n = 19) COVID-19. Immunophenotyping of whole-blood leukocytes was performed in patients upon hospital ward or intensive care unit admission and in healthy controls (n = 25). Clinically relevant associations were identified through unsupervised analysis. RESULTS: Granulocytic (neutrophil, eosinophil, and basophil) markers were enriched during COVID-19 and discriminated between patients with mild and severe disease. Increased counts of CD15+CD16+ neutrophils, decreased granulocytic expression of integrin CD11b, and Th2-related CRTH2 downregulation in eosinophils and basophils established a COVID-19 signature. Severity was associated with emergence of PD-L1 checkpoint expression in basophils and eosinophils. This granulocytic signature was accompanied by monocyte and lymphocyte immunoparalysis. Correlation with validated clinical scores supported pathophysiological relevance. CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic markers of circulating granulocytes are strong discriminators between infected and uninfected individuals as well as between severity stages.

METHODS Influenza VE in children was estimated in the first influenza season (2019/20) overlapping with the COVID-19 epidemic by conducting a single-center, test-negative case-control (TNCC) study. Effects of prior influenza infection and vaccination in children were assessed for the 2019-2020 season. RESULTS Among 386 children, the adjusted VE was significant for influenza A/H1N1 (45.5%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0-69.7) and influenza B (66.7%; 95% CI: 35.9-82.7). Among patients aged 0-6 years, the adjusted VE was significant for influenza A (total: A/H1N1+A/H3N2) (65.0%; 95% CI: 22.2-84.3), influenza A/H1N1 (64.8%; 95% CI: 16.9-85.1), and influenza B (87.4%; 95% CI: 50.5-96.8). No VE was observed in patients aged 7-15 years. Two vaccine doses tended to decrease the incidences of influenza A (total) and influenza A/H1N1 in patients aged 0-6 years. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of influenza B infection in patients, who had influenza during the previous season, were significantly low among all participants (0.29; 95% CI: 0.11-0.78) and patients aged 7-15 years (0.34; 95% CI: 0.12-0.94).

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study with a presurvey and postsurvey. SETTING: University of Split School of Medicine (USSM), Split, Croatia. The lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic lasted from late March to mid-May 2020. There was a full switch to e-learning at the USSM during this period, and all clinical teaching was stopped. PARTICIPANTS: Students enrolled in the 2019/2020 academic year. Data were collected before lockdown in December 2019 and January 2020 and again after the end of lockdown in June 2020. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Study satisfaction was assessed using the study satisfaction survey. Burnout was assessed using two instruments: Oldenburg Burnout Inventory and Copenhagen Burnout Inventory. We used Bayesian statistics to compare before-and-after differences. RESULTS: 437 independent responses (77.2% response rate) were collected before and 235 after lockdown (41.5% response rate). 160 participant responses were eligible for pairing. There was no significant difference for both paired and unpaired participants in study satisfaction before (3.38 on a 1C5 scale; 95% credible interval (95% CrI) 3.32 to 3.44) and after (3.49, 95% CrI 3.41 to 3.57) lockdown.

However, vaccine hesitancy, often fueled by misinformation, poses a major barrier to achieving herd immunity.

METHODS: We applied a weakly supervised aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) technique, which involves the human-in-the-loop system, on COVID-19 vaccinationCrelated tweets in Canada. Automatically generated aspect and opinion terms were manually corrected by public health experts to ensure the accuracy of the terms and make them more domain-specific. Then, based on these manually corrected terms, the system inferred sentiments toward the aspects. We observed sentiments toward key aspects related to COVID-19 vaccination, and investigated how sentiments toward vaccination changed over time. In addition, we analyzed the most retweeted or liked tweets by observing most frequent nouns and sentiments toward key aspects. RESULTS: After applying the ABSA system, we obtained 170 aspect terms (eg, immunity and pfizer) and 6775 opinion terms (eg, trustworthy for the positive sentiment and jeopardize for the negative sentiment). While manually verifying or editing these terms, our public health experts selected 20 key aspects related to COVID-19 vaccination for analysis. The sentiment analysis results for the 20 key aspects revealed negative sentiments related to vaccine distribution, side effects, allergy, reactions, and anti-vaxxer, and positive sentiments related to vaccine campaign, vaccine candidates, and immune response. These results indicate that the Twitter users express concerns about the safety of vaccines but still consider vaccines as the option to end the pandemic. In addition, compared to the sentiment of the remaining tweets, the most retweeted or liked tweets showed more positive sentiment overall toward key aspects (P<.001), especially vaccines (P<.001) and vaccination (P=.009). Further investigation of the most retweeted or liked tweets revealed two opposing trends in Twitter users who showed negative sentiments toward vaccines: the anti-vaxxer population that used negative sentiments as a means to discourage vaccination and the Covid Zero population that used negative sentiments to encourage vaccinations while critiquing the public health response.

Using an established model of hypertrophic scarring, rabbits were divided into four groups and scars were tape-stripped or occluded with Kelocote, Cavilon, or Indermil, with each rabbit serving as its own internal control. All wounds were harvested on day 28 and examined histologically to measure the scar elevation index (SEI), epithelial thickness, and cellularity. Immunohistochemistry fluorescence was used to quantify inflammation in the dermis. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured for each occlusive agent and tape stripping. Ultrastructural analysis was performed by electron microscopy. Kelocote, Cavilon, and Indermil all significantly decreased SEI when compared with controls. Each of the occlusive treatments was shown to decrease TEWL while tape stripping increased TEWL. Tape stripping significantly increased the SEI, epithelial thickness, and cellularity. Immunostaining for macrophages showed increased density of inflammatory cells in the tape-stripped scars. Under electron microscopy, the tape-stripped wounds displayed extensive inflammation and keratinocyte damage. Both unwounded skin and occlusion-treated scars did not display these characteristics. In conclusion, hypertrophic scarring was reduced regardless of occlusive method used. Furthermore, repeated disruption of the permeability barrier by tape stripping led to an increase in scarring.

DESIGN: Rapid review. METHOD: A search of MEDLINE and Embase was conducted to identify studies published from 1 January 2020 to 12 February 2021, which quantitatively reported the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the amount of outpatient care services delivered (in-person visits, diagnostic/screening procedures and treatments). There was no restriction on the type of medical care (emergency/primary/specialty care) or target population (adult/paediatric). All articles presenting primary data from studies reporting on outpatient care utilisation were included. Studies describing conditions requiring hospitalisation or limited to telehealth services were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 517 articles reporting 1011 outpatient care utilisation measures in 49 countries worldwide were eligible for inclusion. Of those, 93% focused on the first semester of 2020 (January to June). The reported results showed an almost universal decline in in-person outpatient care utilisation, with a 56% overall median relative decrease. Heterogeneity across countries was high, with median decreases ranging from 10% to 91%. Diagnostic and screening procedures (?63%), as well as in-person visits (?56%), were more affected than treatments (?36%). Emergency care showed a smaller relative decline (?49%) than primary (?60%) and specialty care (?58%). CONCLUSIONS: The provision of in-person outpatient care services has been strongly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but heterogeneously across countries. The long-term population health consequences of the disruption of outpatient care service delivery remain currently unknown and need to be studied.

Advanced age is a significant predisposing factor for a more severe COVID-19 infection, increasing the risk for hospitalization and mortality. Even though restrictions have been, thus, well-grounded, they may also have had detrimental effects on the social well-being of older people. Personal networks and social activity are known protective factors against the premature decline in health and functioning, and it is widely acknowledged that social isolation increases feelings of loneliness, poor quality of life, and even the risk for diseases and disabilities among older adults. This qualitative study investigated changes in personal networks among community-dwelling oldest-old individuals (persons aged 80 and over) during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Finland. The data is part of the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Dementia (CAIDE85+) study, which is an ongoing large longitudinal population-based study in Finland. In this qualitative sub-study, we analyzed fifteen in-depth telephone interviews using directed content analyses and identified five types of changes in personal social networks during the pandemic. In type 1, all social contacts were significantly reduced due to official recommendations and fear of the virus. Type 2 included modified ways of being socially active i.e., by deploying new technology, and in type 3, social contacts increased during the lockdown. In type 4, personal social networks were changed unexpectedly or dramatically due to a death of a spouse, for example. In type 5, we observed stable social networks, which had not been affected by the pandemic. At an individual level, one person could have had different types of changes during the pandemic. These results highlight the heterogeneity of the oldest olds' personal social networks and changes related to them during the exceptional times of the COVID-19 pandemic. Social activity and personal networks play an important role in the well-being of the oldest old, but individual situations, needs, and preferences toward personal social networks should be taken into account when planning social activities, policies, and interventions.","output":"Personal Social Networks of Community-Dwelling Oldest Old During the Covid-19 PandemicA Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread to all countries in the world after more than six months since it was first reported in late 2019, and different countries have been impacted differently Correlation analysis between COVID-19 death numbers and different demographic and socioeconomic factors for all world countries (n=210) as of June 1, 2020, reveals that COVID-19 deaths per million population in a country significantly correlates with the country's median age (r=0 48, p=4 8e-4) and per capita gross domestic product (GDP) (r=0 55, p=4 14e-5), and inversely correlates with the country's Bacille Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination rate (r=-0 63, p=9 9e-7) COVID-19 death is found not significantly associated, however, with a country's policy stringency index, population density, extreme poverty rate, hospital beds availability per thousand people, and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) immunization Old age is likely a confounding factor for the correlation between COVID-19 and per capita GDP (r=0 66, p=2 3e-7) To control for possible confounding effects of age, countries with similar median age were grouped and analyzed The inverse correlation between BCG vaccination rates and COVID-19 case (r=-0 338, p=0 0082) and death (r=-0 411, p=0 0011) remained significant among the top 61 countries with highest median age The current study suggests that BCG might be protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection","output":"Worldwide inverse correlation between Bacille Calmette-Gurin immunization and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) initiated shocks to the Canadian agri-food industry moving the sector away from its prepandemic equilibrium Disequilibrium can mean, postshock, that sectors follow different paths of adjustment The public and politicians appear to desire that economic activity returns to prepandemic norms?but this is far from assured In the case of the Canadian agri-food industry, the postshock path of adjustment appears to be returning to the preshock equilibrium, or near to it This provides a familiar and stable anchor for those whose lives are otherwise considerably disrupted by the pandemic The multilateral international trade system has long been in need of reform?reforms that would benefit Canada's agri-food exporting sector The pandemic has raised trade issues that require urgent action and some countries see this as an opportunity for reform Canada has been at the forefront of this activity through the fostering, hosting, and chairing of the Ottawa Group of 13 World Trade Organization members that have been charged with bringing forward proposals for reform that will break the log jam in multilateral negotiations The work of the Ottawa Group is examined and the likelihood of the initiative succeeding assessed","output":"Agriculture after a year with COVID-19: Any long-term implications for international trade policy?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anxiety is a common symptom in patients with advanced cancer.

Fourteen informal caregivers were interviewed; 64% were women and the median age was 55 years. Informal caregivers assessed patients' anxiety as moderate to severe and identified a negative impact of anxiety on physical, psychological, social, and spiritual dimensions of the patients' lives. They indicated a variety of expressions of anxiety and mentioned physical and mental deterioration as an important source of anxiety. Informal caregivers recognized patients' needs as having a safe environment, presence of people around, and a sense of control over the situation. Although the patients' perspective is the gold standard, informal caregivers can be a valuable source of information in identifying anxiety and providing personalized support.

This archetypical or primary meaning comes before the development of any other meanings of the word, and it is therefore authentic and genuine because it does not derive from something else. After establishing the archetypical meaning of solidarity, the article translates this meaning into the area of nursing and demonstrates a deep connectivity between healthcare and solidarity. The second part of the article offers and develops a new definition of nursing solidarity as the responsibility for the healthcare of a person (unit) shared as a whole (entirety) by that person and a nurse or a nursing team (plurality). This new definition has some implications for nursing practice and education, since the definition emphasizes the idea that solidarity helps to (a) foster respect and avoid discrimination, (b) promote cohesion in health communities, (c) increase individual responsibility and a spirit of service, (d) stimulate motivation, (e) improve communication, (f) create an engaging workplace, and (g) develop leadership.","output":"Redefining nursing solidarity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A snapshot of how scientists are personally affected by the global Covid\\\\19 pandemic.[Image: see text]","output":"When SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 comes knocking on your lab door: Individual scientists experiences during the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF PROGRAM: This paper will provide guidance on how to best manage patients with end-stage kidney disease who will be or are being treated with home dialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. SOURCES OF INFORMATION: Program-specific documents, pre-existing, and related to COVID-19; documents from national and international kidney agencies; national and international webinars, including webinars that we hosted for input and feedback; with additional information from formal and informal review of published academic literature. METHODS: Members of the Canadian Society of Nephrology (CSN) Board of Directors solicited a team of clinicians and administrators with expertise in home dialysis. Specific COVID-19-related themes in home dialysis were determined by the Canadian senior renal leaders community of practice, a group compromising medical and administrative leaders of provincial and health authority renal programs. We then developed consensus-based recommendations virtually by the CSN work-group with input from ethicists with nephrology training. The recommendations were further reviewed by community nephrologists and over a CSN-sponsored webinar, attended by 225 kidney health care professionals, for further peer input. The final consensus recommendations also incorporated review by the editors at the Canadian Journal of Kidney Health and Disease (CJKHD). KEY FINDINGS: We identified 7 broad areas of home dialysis practice management that may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) peritoneal dialysis catheter placement, (2) home dialysis training, (3) home dialysis management, (4) personal protective equipment, (5) product delivery, (6) minimizing direct health care provider and patient contact, and (7) assisted peritoneal dialysis in the community.

Participants were also asked about sample acceptability using a five-point Likert scale. For those previously diagnosed with COVID-19, all samples underwent real-time PCR testing using a lab-developed assay, and the majority were also tested using an FDA-authorized assay. For those presenting with suspected COVID-19, only those with a positive nasopharyngeal swab sample went on to have other samples tested. Saline mouth rinse/gargle and saliva samples were tested daily at time zero, day 1, and day 2 to assess nucleic acid stability at room temperature. Fifty participants (aged 4 to 71 years) were included; of these, 40 had at least one positive sample and were included in the primary sample yield analysis. Saline mouth rinse/gargle samples had a sensitivity of 98% (39/40), while saliva samples had a sensitivity of 79% (26/33). Both saline mouth rinse/gargle and saliva samples showed stable viral RNA detection after 2 days of room temperature storage. Mouth rinse/gargle samples had the highest (mean, 4.9) and health care worker (HCW)-collected NP swabs had the lowest acceptability scores (mean, 3.1).

Yet, it is still uncertain today which developing treatments will be successful against cystic fibrosis. This study addresses this gap by assessing the opinions of over 524 cystic fibrosis researchers who participated in a global web-based survey. For most respondents, CFTR modulator therapies are the most likely to succeed in treating cystic fibrosis in the next 15 years, especially through the use of CFTR modulator combinations.

These trends bring many benefits to the trading partners involved, but increasing international trade also facilitates the spread of pathogens and increases disease risks. The rapid growth of trade, transport, and travel across national borders has increased the frequency of introduction, establishment, and spread of invasive infectious pathogens (Jones et al. 2008). The development of new trade pathways and the growth in the number and volume of commodities traded increase the likelihood that novel infectious pathogens are introduced to importing or stop-over countries. The growth in trade volumes has increased the risk that introduced pathogens establish and spread, because it has increased the frequency with which infectious pathogens are introduced (Cassey et al. 2004; Dalmazzone 2000; Semmens et al. 2004).

However, vaccine hesitancy and refusal are significant issues globally. This mixed-methods study aimed to investigate university students' attitudes in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) toward the COVID-19 vaccination, determine the factors associated with vaccine hesitancy, and understand the underlying reasons. We conducted an online survey between 16th-24th February 2021 in 669 students from the University of Sharjah (UAE) and semi-structured qualitative interviews with a subsample of 11 participants. Data on COVID-19 vaccine intention and uptake, risk perception, beliefs and attitudes toward the disease and the vaccine were collected. Multinomial logistic regression was applied and thematic content analysis was conducted with qualitative data. Overall, 31.8% of students demonstrated vaccine hesitancy; 24.4% of students reported a high intention to get the vaccine, and 43.8% were already vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with less positive beliefs and attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine (AdjOR = 0.557;95%CI 0.468-0.662), high perceived adverse effects (AdjOR = 1.736;95%CI 1.501-2.007), and not perceiving easy access to a vaccination center (AdjOR = 0.820;95%CI 0.739-0.909). The main reasons underlying vaccine hesitancy were related to uncertainty about the effectiveness of the vaccine, knowledge about negative experiences from vaccination among family and/or community, overvaluing the risks of the vaccine in relation to the potential benefits, and not perceiving immunization as a social norm. To increase COVID-19 vaccination uptake, interventions to reduce hesitancy could focus on reducing fears about adverse effects and highlighting individual and societal benefits of the vaccination.","output":"A mixed-methods study to assess COVID-19 vaccination acceptability among university students in the United Arab Emirates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AimsTo investigate the prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviours (STB;i e suicidal ideation, plans or attempts) in the Spanish adult general population during the first wave of the Spain coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (March?July, 2020), and to investigate the individual- and population-level impact of relevant distal and proximal STB risk factor domains MethodsCross-sectional study design using data from the baseline assessment of an observational cohort study (MIND/COVID project) A nationally representative sample of 3500 non-institutionalised Spanish adults (51 5% female;mean age = 49 6 [s d = 17 0]) was taken using dual-frame random digit dialing, stratified for age, sex and geographical area Professional interviewers carried out computer-assisted telephone interviews (1C30 June 2020) Thirty-day STB was assessed using modified items from the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale Distal (i e pre-pandemic) risk factors included sociodemographic variables, number of physical health conditions and pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders;proximal (i e pandemic) risk factors included current mental disorders and a range of adverse events-experiences related to the pandemic Logistic regression was used to investigate individual-level associations (odds ratios [OR]) and population-level associations (population attributable risk proportions [PARP]) between risk factors and 30-day STB All data were weighted using post-stratification survey weights ResultsEstimated prevalence of 30-day STB was 4 5% (1 8% active suicidal ideation;n = 5 [0 1%] suicide attempts) STB was 9 7% among the 34 3% of respondents with pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders, and 1 8% among the 65 7% without any pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorder Factors significantly associated with STB were pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders (total PARP = 49 1%) and current mental disorders (total PARP = 58 4%), i e major depressive disorder (OR = 6 0;PARP = 39 2%), generalised anxiety disorder (OR = 5 6;PARP = 36 3%), post-traumatic stress disorder (OR = 4 6;PARP = 26 6%), panic attacks (OR = 6 7;PARP = 36 6%) and alcohol/substance use disorder (OR = 3 3;PARP = 5 9%) Pandemic-related adverse events-experiences associated with STB were lack of social support, interpersonal stress, stress about personal health and about the health of loved ones (PARPs 32 7C42 6%%), and having loved ones infected with COVID-19 (OR = 1 7;PARP = 18 8%) Up to 74 1% of STB is potentially attributable to the joint effects of mental disorders and adverse events?experiences related to the pandemic ConclusionsSTB at the end of the first wave of the Spain COVID-19 pandemic was high, and large proportions of STB are potentially attributable to mental disorders and adverse events?experiences related to the pandemic, including health-related stress, lack of social support and interpersonal stress There is an urgent need to allocate resources to increase access to adequate mental healthcare, even in times of healthcare system overload Study registration numberNCT04556565","output":"Thirty-day suicidal thoughts and behaviours in the Spanish adult general population during the first wave of the Spain COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe courses of COVID-19 are associated with elevated levels of interleukin 6. However, there is a growing body of evidence pointing to a broad and more complex disorder of pro-inflammatory and anti-viral responses with disturbed interferon signaling in COVID-19. METHODS: In this prospective single-center registry, we included SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and patients with similar symptoms and severity of disease but negative for SARS-CoV-2 admitted to the emergency department and compared their serum protein expression profiles. RESULTS: Interleukin-6 abundance was similar in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n = 24) compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative control (n = 61). In contrast, we observed a specific upregulation of the immunomodulatory protein progranulin (GRN). High GRN abundance was associated with adverse outcomes and increased expression of interleukin-6 in COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The data from this registry reveals that GRN is specifically upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients while interleukin-6 may serve as marker for disease severity. The potential of GRN as a biomarker and a possible impact of increased GRN expression on interferon signaling, virus elimination, and virus-induced lung tissue damage in COVID-19 should be further explored.","output":"Serum protein profiling reveals a specific upregulation of the immunomodulatory protein progranulin in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we consider the valuation of longevity bonds under a regime-switching interest rate and a regimeswitching force of mortality model.

The participation rate of people with disabilities (PWDS) in tourism activities is low, and there is a big gap in the travel and accommodation sector in this regard. Studies of previous scholars have concluded that the accessible tourism market is a significant and profitable area, but determinants of participation to travel and process of travel, such as wheelchair user expectations, are consistently ignored by the tourism industry. The main purpose of this study is to determine the determinants of travel by examining the motivations, expectations, processes and experiences of PWDS using wheelchairs to participate in tourism. Research was performed in Turkeys Bodrum district; 25 wheelchair users were included in the study. The keywords that emerged in the theoretical framework in light of the answers given to 39 open-ended questions online were coded in the Nvivo program. The results showed that wheelchair users intended to go on vacation but were less motivated to participate due to the lack of travel conditions. Wheelchair travelers argued that a companion was required for an enjoyable holiday that could meet their needs. In addition, the results revealed that the types of wheelchairs used by disabled passengers differ.

Unfortunately, hand hygiene adherence of healthcare workers (HCWs) in Japan is suboptimal according to previous studies. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to evaluate hand hygiene adherence among physicians and nurses before touching hospitalized patients and to evaluate changes in hand hygiene adherence after a multimodal intervention was implemented. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a pre- and postintervention study with HCWs at four tertiary hospitals in Niigata, Japan. Hand hygiene observations were conducted from June to August 2018 (preintervention) and February to March 2019 (postintervention). INTERVENTION: The multimodal hand hygiene intervention recommended by the World Health Organization was tailored to each hospital and implemented from September 2018 to February 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We observed hand hygiene adherence before touching patients in each hospital and compared rates before and after intervention. Intervention components were also evaluated. RESULTS: There were 2,018 patient observations preintervention and 1,630 postintervention. Overall, hand hygiene adherence improved from 453 of 2,018 preintervention observations (22.4%) to 548 of 1,630 postintervention observations (33.6%; P < .001). Rates improved more among nurses (13.9 percentage points) than among doctors (5.7 percentage points). Improvement varied among the hospitals: Hospital B (18.4 percentage points) was highest, followed by Hospitals D (11.4 percentage points), C (11.3 percentage points), and Hospital A (6.5 percentage points). CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal intervention improved hand hygiene adherence rates in physicians and nurses in Niigata, Japan; however, further improvement is necessary. Given the current suboptimal hand hygiene adherence rates in Japanese hospitals, the spread of COVID-19 within the hospital setting is a concern.","output":"Improving Hand Hygiene Adherence in Healthcare Workers Before Patient Contact: A Multimodal Intervention in Four Tertiary Care Hospitals in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Increasing physical activity reduces secondary stroke risk factors, but many stroke survivors have low levels of physical activity. Supervised exercise delivered via telehealth has the potential to overcome barriers to increased physical activity in stroke survivors. Our scoping review will examine the emerging field of supervised exercise delivered via telehealth to map the available evidence in relation to its efficacy, acceptability, safety and feasibility in chronic conditions to inform future research into its ability to increase physical activity. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley will be applied to our scoping review. A systematic search of Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane, Pedro and Embase; hand searching of pertinent studies' reference lists; and consultation with experts in the field will identify relevant papers. Studies involving participants with a chronic condition who undertake supervised exercise delivered by a health professional via telehealth targeted at improving secondary stroke risk factors or involving lower limb weight-bearing exercise will be included. Study selection and critical appraisal of individual studies will be carried out independently by two authors with discrepancies resolved by a third author. Quantitative and qualitative data will be charted using a standardised form. Results will be tabulated and narratively summarised to highlight findings relevant to the review's research questions and to inform recommendations for future research. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Our review will significantly contribute to the knowledge base of exercise and rehabilitation delivered via telehealth and its application in chronic conditions, including stroke. Findings will be relevant to researchers, healthcare workers and policy-makers and will be disseminated through publication and presentations.

Advanced glycation end products are produced under the influence of oxidative stress and in the skin (measured by skin autofluorescence [SAF]) serve as marker for cumulative oxidative stress. Aim of study was to determine whether SAF is associated with presence of affective disorders. METHODS Participants in the Lifelines cohort study who had completed the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for affective disorders and a SAF-measurement were included. Cross-sectional associations between SAF and presence of the following psychiatric disorders were investigated through logistic regression analyses adjusted for sociodemographic factors, cardiometabolic parameters, and somatic morbidities: major depressive disorder, dysthymia, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder or social phobia. RESULTS Of 81,041 included participants (41.7% male, aged 18-91 years), 6676 (8.2%) were cases with an affective disorder. SAF was associated with presence of affective disorders (OR=1.09 [95%CI 1.07-1.12], P<.001 adjusted for sociodemographic factors). Association with major depressive disorder was strongest and significant after adjustment for all confounders (OR=1.31 [95%CI 1.25-1.36], P<.001 in the crude model; OR=1.12 [95%CI 1.07-1.17], P<.001 in the fully adjusted model).

The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M (pro) ) and papain-like protease (PL (pro) ) are attractive antiviral drug targets given their vital roles in viral replication and modulation of host immune response. Structurally disparate compounds were reported as M (pro) and PL (pro) inhibitors from either drug repurposing or rational design. Two polyphenols dieckol and 1,2,3,4,6-pentagalloylglucose (PGG) were recently reported as SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M (pro) ) inhibitors. With our continuous interest in studying the mechanism of inhibition and resistance of M (pro) inhibitors, we report herein our independent validation/invalidation of these two natural products. Our FRET-based enzymatic assay showed that neither dieckol nor PGG inhibited SARS-CoV-2 M (pro) (IC (50) > 20 M), which is in contrary to previous reports. Serendipitously, PGG was found to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PL (pro) ) with an IC (50) of 3.90 M. The binding of PGG to PL (pro) was further confirmed in the thermal shift assay. However, PGG was cytotoxic in 293T-ACE2 cells (CC (50) = 7.7 M), so its intracellular PL (pro) inhibitory activity could not be quantified by the cell-based Flip-GFP PL (pro) assay. In addition, we also invalidated ebselen, disulfiram, carmofur, PX12, and tideglusib as SARS-CoV-2 PL (pro) inhibitors using the Flip-GFP assay. Overall, our results call for stringent hit validation, and the serendipitous discovery of PGG as a putative PL (pro) inhibitor might worth further pursuing.","output":"Invalidation of dieckol and 1,2,3,4,6-pentagalloylglucose (PGG) as SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors and the discovery of PGG as a papain-like protease inhibitor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE We sought to identify the major risk factors associated with mortality in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. BACKGROUND Bariatric surgery has become an established treatment for extreme obesity. Bariatric surgery mortality has steadily declined with current rates of less than 0.5%. However, significant variation in the mortality rates has been reported for specific patient cohorts and among bariatric centers. METHODS Clinical outcome data from 185,315 bariatric surgery patients from the Bariatric Outcome Longitudinal Database were reviewed. Of these, 157,559 patients had either documented 30 or more day follow-up data, including mortality. Multiple demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical factors were analyzed by univariate analysis for their association with 30-day mortality after gastric bypass. Variables found to be significant were entered into a multiple logistic regression model to identify factors independently associated with 30-day mortality. On the basis of these results, a RYGB mortality risk score was developed. RESULTS The overall 30-day mortality rate for the entire bariatric surgery cohort was 0.1%. Of the 81,751 RYGB patients, the mortality rate was 0.15%. Factors significantly associated with 30-day gastric bypass mortality included increasing body mass index (BMI) (P<0.0001), increasing age (P<0.005), male gender (P<0.001), pulmonary hypertension (P<0.0001), congestive heart failure (P=0.0008), and liver disease (P=0.038). When the RYGB risk score was applied, a significant trend (P<0.0001) between increasing risk score and mortality rate is found. CONCLUSIONS Increasing BMI, increasing age, male gender, pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, and liver disease are risk factors for 30-day mortality after RYGB. The RYGB risk score can be used to determine patients at greater risk for mortality after RYGB surgery.","output":"Risk factors associated with mortality after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite ample research on the prevalence of specific psychiatric disorders during COVID-19, we know little about the broader psychological impact of the pandemic on a wider population.

This study was carried out to assess the function of artificial reefs as alternative habitats for two common reef-associated predatory fishes in the north of Yellow Sea, China, Fat Greenling Hexagrammos otakii and Korean rockfish Sebastes schlegelii. According to the catch per unit effort (CPUE), the biomass of predatory fishes at the artificial reef was comparable (H. otakii) to or higher (S. schlegelii) than the natural reef, highlighting the environmental fitness of the artificial reef. Gut content analysis (GCA) showed that H. otakii preyed primarily on Decapod and Amphipoda, while S. schlegelii exhibited higher dependence on fish (Blinniidae and Gobiidae) and Decapod. Collectively, prey richness and diversity were greater at the natural reef relative to the artificial reef, and prey availability may be different between the two reef types. Stable isotopic analysis (SIA) in conjunction with the Bayesian mixing model (MixSIAR) revealed spatial and interspecific difference on the diet composition of H. otakii and S. schlegelii as well. Based on GCA and MixSIAR result, the habitat-specific effect on the prey availability was confirmed. Additionally, comparisons on trophic niche breadth and niche overlap indicated higher trophic diversity but relatively lower food resources partitioning degree for both species at the natural reef than at the artificial reef. Our results suggest that artificial reefs may harbor a different prey assemblage comparing to natural reef but can support large populations of predatory reef-associated fishes and accommodate their coexistence.","output":"Trophic interactions of reef-associated predatory fishes (Hexagrammos otakii and Sebastes schlegelii) in natural and artificial reefs along the coast of North Yellow Sea, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review covers recent advances in the wettability of aligned carbon nanotubes (ACNT). Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are inherently somewhat hydrophilic, with a water contact angle of less than 86. When they are arranged in a textured manner on substrates having different surface topographies, different wettabilities are exhibited. These range from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, and even superhydrophobic, and with isotropic to anisotropic contact angle (CA) hysteresis. If chemical modification is involved, the wettability can be adjusted from superhydrophobic to superhydrophilic on a certain structured ACNTs. Here, we first examine the structural influence of isotropic roughness on this effect (including nano-structures and hierarchical structures), where isotropic wetting (including wetting and anti-wetting) is observed. Water can wet the nano-structured CNT alignment, resulting in self-assembly; on the other hand, superhydrophobicity is durable on hierarchical and chemically-modified nano-structured alignments. Secondly, the effects of anisotropic roughness on wetting behavior are discussed. Finally, we suggest the remaining challenges in the field, and several practical applications of ACNT possessing special wettability.","output":"Wetting and anti-wetting on aligned carbon nanotube films"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with immune dysregulation and hyperinflammation, including elevated interleukin-6 levels. The use of tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor, has resulted in better outcomes in patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia in case reports and retrospective observational cohort studies. Data are needed from randomized, placebo-controlled trials. METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients who were hospitalized with severe Covid-19 pneumonia in a 2:1 ratio receive a single intravenous infusion of tocilizumab (at a dose of 8 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo. Approximately one quarter of the participants received a second dose of tocilizumab or placebo 8 to 24 hours after the first dose. The primary outcome was clinical status at day 28 on an ordinal scale ranging from 1 (discharged or ready for discharge) to 7 (death) in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all the patients who had received at least one dose of tocilizumab or placebo. RESULTS: Of the 452 patients who underwent randomization, 438 (294 in the tocilizumab group and 144 in the placebo group) were included in the primary and secondary analyses. The median value for clinical status on the ordinal scale at day 28 was 1.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 1.0) in the tocilizumab group and 2.0 (non-ICU hospitalization without supplemental oxygen) (95% CI, 1.0 to 4.0) in the placebo group (between-group difference, -1.0; 95% CI, -2.5 to 0; P = 0.31 by the van Elteren test). In the safety population, serious adverse events occurred in 103 of 295 patients (34.9%) in the tocilizumab group and in 55 of 143 patients (38.5%) in the placebo group.

Method: A follow-up after nine-months of a school-based survey among 1,491 secondary students was conducted during COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Psychological well-being, psychological factors, family support, and COVID-19-related experiences were examined. Findings: The prevalence of suicidal ideation were 24% and 21% among the participants before and during COVID-19, respectively. In particular, 897 (65.0%) remained non-suicidal, 193 (14.0%) recovered from being suicidal, 148 (10.7%) newly reported being suicidal, and 143 (10.4%) remained suicidal. Respondents who remained suicidal were found to have significantly higher depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness, and social anxiety;fixed mindset;lower meaning of life and self-control;and lower parental support and supervision than the other groups. Participants with suicidal ideation reported more negative perceptions about the pandemic than non-suicidal participants. Logistic regression showed that participants with higher trait anxiety and higher stress from self-expectations in the baseline survey predicted higher likelihood of having suicidal ideation than the non-suicidal students at follow-up. Conclusion: Poor psychological well-being, lower level of family support, and negative impacts of the pandemic were consistently associated with students presence of suicidal ideation during the pandemic.

Thus, nursing students must show interest in nursing studies and in work with people. Moreover, it is desired that they have good communication skills. On the other hand, students who choose nursing as their future career may have high expectations from nursing education. The aim of this study was to explore nursing students' reasons for pursuing nursing studies. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate nursing students in Slovenia and Croatia. RESULTS A total of 314 students participated in the study. General satisfaction with their studies is higher among those students who are satisfied with their chosen study programme. The most important reasons to enter nursing studies were interest in the subject and good employment possibilities. As the biggest disadvantage of studying nursing, Slovenian students listed crowded schedules, while Croatian students mentioned faculty organization. Students from both countries agreed that the biggest advantage is the ease of finding a job after graduation. DISCUSSION As there is a lack of workforce in the healthcare sector, particularly a lack of nurses, universities must adjust their demands and improve study conditions to gain students' attention. Therefore, it is important to notice that nursing students perceive more advantages of studying nursing than disadvantages. CONCLUSION There are many different reasons to enter nursing studies. Students perceive many advantages in studying nursing, such as ease of employment, getting many hours of clinical practice and the possibility for promotion. On the other hand, there are some challenges in studying nursing, such as the schedule and organization of lectures, seminars and clinical placement. There is a need for further research in the field of nursing student's motivation, especially due to their decreasing motivation during the studies.","output":"What motivates students to enter nursing?

IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE In current practice, such as management of the coronavirus (COVID-19), other pandemics, or natural/environmental disasters, texting is a solution-focused intervention that can deliver and retrieve real-time information to a medically complex population. It can link patients to resources and increase outreach, efficiency, quality, and coordination of care. Texting can promote adherence to appointments, increase medication compliance and disease management interventions, and provide motivational change messages. However, there are legal and regulatory concerns that carry potential consequences and implications that should be approached judiciously (Mellette, 2015).

Identifying themes in policy responses provides a framework for subsequent evaluations of the relationship between state policies and health service utilization.Methods: Between May and June 2020, we searched all Single State Agencies for Substance Abuse Services (SSA) websites for statements of SUD treatment policy responses to the pandemic. We conducted Iterative Categorization of policies for outpatient programs, opioid treatment programs, and other treatment settings to identify themes in policy responses.Results: We collected 220 documents from SSA websites from 45 states and Washington D.C. Eight specific themes emerged from our content analysis: delivery of pharmacological and non-pharmacological services, obtaining informed consent and documentation for remote services, conducting health assessments, facility operating procedures and staffing requirements, and permissible telehealth technology and billing protocols. Policy changes often mirrored federal guidance, for instance, by expanding methadone take-home options for opioid treatment programs. The extent and nature of policy changes varied across jurisdictions, including telehealth technology requirements and staffing flexibility.Conclusion: States have made significant policy changes to SUD treatment policies during COVID-19, particularly regarding telehealth and facilitation of remote care.

Since late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel seventh coronavirus disease has been reported in China caused by \\"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\\" (SARS-CoV-2). On March 11, 2020, the new clinical condition COVID-19 (Corona-Virus-Disease-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Patients with COVID-19 mainly have a mild disease course, but severe disease onset might result in death due to proceeded lung injury with massive alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure. However, the detailed mechanisms that cause organ injury still remain unclear. We investigated the morphological findings of a COVID-19 patient who died during self-isolation. Pathologic examination revealed massive bilateral alveolar damage, indicating early-phase \\"acute respiratory distress syndrome\\" (ARDS).

Its clinical symptoms manifest as behavioral impairment, cognitive decline, communication difficulties, etc. The pathophysiological mechanisms of TBI are complex and involve inflammatory response, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and so on. Among them, oxidative stress, one of the important mechanisms, occurs at the beginning and accompanies the whole process of TBI. Most importantly, excessive oxidative stress causes BBB disruption and brings injury to lipids, proteins, and DNA, leading to the generation of lipid peroxidation, damage of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, neuronal apoptosis, and neuroinflammatory response. Transcription factor NF-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2), a basic leucine zipper protein, plays an important role in the regulation of antioxidant proteins, such as oxygenase-1(HO-1), NAD(P)H Quinone Dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), to protect against oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis. Recently, emerging evidence indicated the knockout (KO) of Nrf2 aggravates the pathology of TBI, while the treatment of Nrf2 activators inhibits neuronal apoptosis and neuroinflammatory responses via reducing oxidative damage. Phytochemicals from fruits, vegetables, grains, and other medical herbs have been demonstrated to activate the Nrf2 signaling pathway and exert neuroprotective effects in TBI. In this review, we emphasized the contributive role of oxidative stress in the pathology of TBI and the protective mechanism of the Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response for the treatment of TBI. In addition, we summarized the research advances of phytochemicals, including polyphenols, terpenoids, natural pigments, and otherwise, in the activation of Nrf2 signaling and their potential therapies for TBI. Although there is still limited clinical application evidence for these natural Nrf2 activators, we believe that the combinational use of phytochemicals such as Nrf2 activators with gene and stem cell therapy will be a promising therapeutic strategy for TBI in the future.","output":"Targeting Nrf2-Mediated Oxidative Stress Response in Traumatic Brain Injury: Therapeutic Perspectives of Phytochemicals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and measures aimed at its mitigation, such as physical distancing, have been discussed as risk factors for loneliness, which increases the risk of premature mortality and mental and physical health conditions. To ascertain whether loneliness has increased since the start of the pandemic, this study aimed to narratively and statistically synthesize relevant high-quality primary studies.

Searched databases were PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library/Central Register of Controlled Trials/EMBASE/CINAHL, Web of Science, the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 database, supplemented by Google Scholar and citation searching (cutoff date of the systematic search December 5, 2021). Summary data from prospective research including loneliness assessments before and during the pandemic were extracted. Of 6,850 retrieved records, 34 studies (23 longitudinal, 9 pseudolongitudinal, 2 reporting both designs) on 215,026 participants were included. Risk of bias (RoB) was estimated using the risk of bias in non-randomised studies-of interventions (ROBINS-I) tool. Standardized mean differences (SMD, Hedges' g) for continuous loneliness values and logOR for loneliness prevalence rates were calculated as pooled effect size estimators in random-effects meta-analyses. Pooling studies with longitudinal designs only (overall N = 45,734), loneliness scores (19 studies, SMD = 0.27 [95% confidence interval = 0.14-0.40], Z = 4.02, p < .001, I 2 = 98%) and prevalence rates (8 studies, logOR = 0.33 [0.04-0.62], Z = 2.25, p = .02, I 2 = 96%) increased relative to prepandemic times with small effect sizes.

The overall infectious diseases burden experienced a dramatic drop during 1975C1995, but since then, it reverted and maintained a gradual upward trend to date. Most notifiable diseases are contained at a low endemic level; however, local small-scale outbreaks remain common.

Zoonotic infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), rabies and influenza, pose constant threats to Chinese residents and remain the most deadly disease type among the infected individuals. Therefore, second-generation surveillance of behavioural risks or vectors associated with pathogen transmission should be scaled up.

Most of the common cold illnesses are caused by one of four HCoVs, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43. Several studies have applied global transcriptomic methods to understand host responses to HCoV infection, with most studies focusing on the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2. In this study, Next Generation Sequencing was used to gain new insights into cellular transcriptomic changes elicited by alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E. HCoV-229E-infected MRC-5 cells showed marked downregulation of superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis and eIF2 signaling pathways. Moreover, upregulation of cyclins, cell cycle control of chromosomal replication, and the role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, alongside downregulation of the cell cycle G1/S checkpoint, suggest that HCoV-229E may favors S phase for viral infection. Intriguingly, a significant portion of key factors of cell innate immunity, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and other transcripts of early antiviral response genes were downregulated early in HCoV-229E infection. On the other hand, early upregulation of the antiviral response factor Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3B (APOBEC3B) was observed.

To guarantee high quality during long-term storage and to avoid metabolic activities, cryostorage is often conducted in the N(2) vapour phase or in liquid nitrogen (LN) at temperatures below ? 150 C. One potential risk of cryostorage is microbial cross contamination in the LN storage tanks. The current review summarises data on the occurrence of microorganisms that may compromise the safety and quality of biological materials during long-term storage. We assess the potential for the microbial contamination of LN in storage tanks holding different biological materials based on the detection by culture-based and molecular approaches. The samples themselves, the LN, the human microbiome, and the surrounding environment are possible routes of contamination and can cause cross contaminations via the LN phase. In general, the results showed that LN is typically not the source of major contaminations and only a few studies provided evidence for a risk of microbial cross contamination. So far, culture-based and culture-independent techniques detected only low amounts of microbial cells, indicating that cross contamination may occur at a very low frequency. To further minimise the potential risk of microbial cross contaminations, we recommend reducing the formation of ice crystals in cryotanks that can entrap environmental microorganisms and using sealed or second sample packing. A short survey demonstrated the awareness for microbial contaminations of storage containers among different culture collections. Although most participants consider the risk of cross contaminations in LN storage tanks as low, they prevent potential contaminations by using sealed devices and ? 150 C freezers. It is concluded that the overall risk for cross contaminations in biobanks is relatively low when following standard operating procedures (SOPs).

Mitigation and repression actions to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease are necessary. However, they are criticised in the economic, social and psychological spheres. This social isolation, increased unemployment, routine changes, news of health complications and deaths related to COVID-19 can cause psychological repercussions that will certainly intensify in the coming months, and suicidal behaviour presents itself as a fatal outcome. It is necessary to know factors associated with suicidal behaviour in adults during the pandemic. Although there are studies, there is no systematic review to assess these factors, specifically in adults. The objective is to critically synthesise the scientific evidence on the factors associated with suicidal behaviour in adults in the COVID-19 pandemic.

This paper aims to propose an Ensemble model using a combination of deep CNN architectures, which are Xception, InceptionResnetV2, VGG19, DenseNet-201, and NasNetLarge, using image processing and artificial intelligence algorithms to quickly and accurately identify COVID-19 and other coronary diseases from X-Rays to stop the rapid transmission of the virus. We have used classifiers for the Xception model, VGG19, and InceptionResnet model and compiled a CXR dataset from various open datasets. Since the dataset lacked 1000 viral pneumonia images, we used image augmentation and focal loss to compensate for the unbalanced data and to introduce more variation. After implementing the focal loss function, we got better results. Moreover, we implemented transfer learning using ImageNet weights. Finally, we obtained a training accuracy of 92% to 94% across all models.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of CD73 in IBD-associated tumorigenesis. A mouse model of colitis-associated tumorigenesis (CAT) induced by azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium was successfully constructed. Model mice were injected with CD73 inhibitor or adenosine receptor agonist. Colon length, body weight loss and tumor formation were assessed macroscopically. Inflammatory cytokine measurement and RNA sequencing on colon tissues were performed. Inhibition of CD73 by adenosine 5'-(&#945;,?-methylene) diphosphate (APCP) suppressed the severity of CAT with attenuated weight loss, longer colons, lower tumor number and smaller tumor size compared with the model group. Activation of adenosine receptors using 1-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)-1-deoxy-N-ethyl-?-D-ribofuranuronamide (NECA) exacerbated CAT. Histological assessment indicated that inhibition of CD73 reduced, while activation of adenosine receptors exacerbated, the histological damage of the colon. Increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-&#945; and interleukin-6) in colonic tissue was detected in the NECA group. According to RNA sequencing results, potential oncogenes such as arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), Bcl-2-like protein 15 (Bcl2l15) and N-acetylaspartate synthetase (Nat8l) were downregulated in the APCP group and upregulated in the NECA group compared with the model group. Therefore, inhibition of CD73 attenuated IBD-associated tumorigenesis, while activation of adenosine receptors exacerbated tumorigenesis in a C57BL/6J mouse model.

Methods: For 3 months after January 20, 2020, cancellation rates of elective surgeries were investigated, and the number of elective surgeries conducted in the same period over the last two years was compared. Four different questionnaires were used to investigate psychologic status among the orthopedic health care workers. We compared the outcomes according to occupation (physician or nurse), and type of work (faculty staff or resident physician). Outcomes according to occupation and type of work were compared. Preventive surgeries underwent in patients who could not wait for the results of the COVID-19 diagnosis were investigated. Results: Spine and hip surgery had relatively lower cancellation rates, and elective surgeries were significantly reduced. During the initial pandemic, the cancellation rate of orthopedic elective surgeries was significantly higher than in the same period of the previous year and was different for each subdivision depending on the degree of pain or disability. The psychological outcomes were within the normal range and there were no significant differences between groups. After preventive surgery, all medical staff involved in the operation tested negative.

Here, we simulated the three-dimensional structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins with high performance computer, predicted the B cell epitopes on spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using structure-based approaches, and then validated the epitope immunogenicity by immunizing mice. Almost all 33 predicted epitopes effectively induced antibody production, six of which were immunodominant epitopes in patients identified via the binding of epitopes with the sera from domestic and imported COVID-19 patients, and 23 were conserved within SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and bat coronavirus RaTG13. We also found that the immunodominant epitopes of domestic SARS-CoV-2 were different from that of the imported, which may be caused by the mutations on S (G614D) and N proteins. Importantly, we validated that eight epitopes on S protein elicited neutralizing antibodies that blocked the cell entry of both D614 and G614 pseudo-virus of SARS-CoV-2, three and nine epitopes induced D614 or G614 neutralizing antibodies, respectively.

New alternative therapies may reduce mortality rates in patients with COVID19. This study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of injecting intravenous Whartons jelly-derived MSCs in patients with COVID-19 as a treatment. METHODS: In this study, five patients with severe COVID-19 were treated with Whartons jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (150  106 cells per injection). These patients were subject to three intravenous injections 3 days apart, and monitoring was done on days 0, 3, 6, and 14 in routine tests, inflammatory cytokines, and flow cytometry of CD4 and CD8 markers. A lung CT scan was performed on base and days 14 and 28. In addition, IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were measured before and after treatment. RESULTS: The results showed that IL-10 and SDF-1 increased after cell therapy, but VEGF, TGF-, IFN-, IL-6, and TNF decreased. Routine hematology tests, myocardial enzyme tests, biochemical tests, and inflammation tests were performed for all patients before and after cell therapy on base and days 3, 6, and 14, which indicated the improvement of test results over time. COVID-19 antibody tests rose in 14 days after WJ-MSC injection. The total score of zonal involvement in both lungs was improved.

For this reason, an exploratory study on rough and flat terrains was conducted to use and validate the Iterative Ray-Tracing method in combination with a Bearings-Range Extended Kalman Filter as a real-time forest fire georeferencing and filtering algorithm on images captured by an aerial vehicle. The Iterative Ray-Tracing method requires a vehicle equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS), an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a calibrated camera, and a Digital Elevation Map (DEM). The proposed method receives the real-time input of the GPS, IMU, and the image coordinates of the pixels to georeference (computed by a companion algorithm of fire front detection) and outputs the geographical coordinates corresponding to those pixels. The Unscented Transform B is proposed to characterize the Iterative Ray-Tracing uncertainty. A Bearings-Range filter measurement model is introduced in a sequential filtering architecture to reduce the noise in the measurements, assuming static targets. A performance comparison is done between the Bearings-Only and the Bearings-Range observation models, and between the Extended and Cubature Kalman Filters. In simulation studies with ground truth, without filtering we obtained a georeferencing Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSE) of 30.7 and 43.4 m for the rough and flat terrains respectively, while filtering with the proposed Bearings-Range Extended Kalman Filter showed the best results by reducing the previous RMSE to 11.7 and 19.8 m, respectively.

Environmental stressors, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), can contribute to certain chronic diseases and might aggravate the course of COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To explore putative links between EDCs and COVID-19 severity, an integrative systems biology approach was constructed and applied. METHODS: As a first step, relevant data sets were compiled from major data sources. Biological associations of major EDCs to proteins were extracted from the CompTox database. Associations between proteins and diseases known as important COVID-19 comorbidities were obtained from the GeneCards and DisGeNET databases. Based on these data, we developed a tripartite network (EDCs-proteins-diseases) and used it to identify proteins overlapping between the EDCs and the diseases. Signaling pathways for common proteins were then investigated by over-representation analysis. RESULTS: We found several statistically significant pathways that may be dysregulated by EDCs and that may also be involved in COVID-19 severity. The Th17 and the AGE/RAGE signaling pathways were particularly promising. CONCLUSIONS: Pathways were identified as possible targets of EDCs and as contributors to COVID-19 severity, thereby highlighting possible links between exposure to environmental chemicals and disease development. This study also documents the application of computational systems biology methods as a relevant approach to increase the understanding of molecular mechanisms linking EDCs and human diseases, thereby contributing to toxicology prediction.","output":"Endocrine disrupting chemicals and COVID-19 relationships: A computational systems biology approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"2019 y?l?n?n son aylar?nda ?inin Wuhan kentinde ortaya kan, Dnya Sa?l?k ?rgtnn COVID-19 olarak adland?rd virs tm dnyada pandemiye neden olmu?tur.

METHODS: Twenty-one dentists performed maxillary anterior incisor veneer preparations using a microscope and drape and loupes with or without a face shield. In each test condition, the following 3 levels of filtration were tested: no filtration, a high-volume evacuator [HVE], and an HVE with an extraoral suction device. Measurements were made using a mass monitor attached to the operators chest with inlet within 10 inches of the operators face. RESULTS: The authors found that the microscope and drape provided the lowest levels of aerosolized particles compared with loupes with or without a face shield (P < .001). There was no detectable difference in the concentration of particles between operators wearing a face shield and wearing loupes alone (P = .47). The particles in each test condition were lowered when an HVE was used (P < .001) and further lowered with an extraoral suction device. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that the use of a surgical microscope and bag barrier drape, HVE, and extraoral suction device result in the lowest concentration of aerosolized particles.

The objective of the study was to identify the presence of SARS-CoV-2 host attachment receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) along with endocytic vacuoles, early endosome antigen-1 (EEA1), late endosome marker RAB7, cathepsin-L and lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1) as lysosome markers, in the airways of smokers and COPD patients. The study design was cross-sectional and involved lung resections from 39 patients in total, which included 19 patients with GOLD stage I or stage II COPD, of which 9 were current smokers with COPD (COPD-CS), and 10 ex-smokers with COPD (COPD-ES), 10 normal lung function smokers (NLFS) and 10 were never smoking normal controls (NC). Immunostaining for ACE2, EEA1, RAB7, and cathepsin-L was done. A comparative description for ACE2, EEA1, RAB7, and cathepsin-L expression pattern is provided for the patient groups. Further, staining intensity for LAMP-1 lysosomes was measured as the ratio of the LAMP-1 stained areas per total area of epithelium or sub-epithelium, using Image ProPlus software. LAMP-1 expression showed a positive correlation to patient smoking history while in COPD LAMP-1 negatively correlated to lung function. The active presence of ACE2 protein along with endocytic vacuoles such as early/late endosomes and lysosomes in the small airways of smokers and COPD patients provides evidence that these patient groups could be more susceptible to COVID-19.","output":"Dysregulation of endocytic machinery and ACE2 in small airways of smokers and COPD patients can augment their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study proposes a novel approach that investigates the dynamic dependency among exchange rates by extending time-varying copulas' parameters following an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) process. The process consists of an autoregressive part that explains the effect of the previous parameters and a forcing variable that measures the dependence structure between marginal variables. We apply this model to the daily data of the exchange rates of five Asian countries with the strongest economies before and during the 2020 pandemic, namely CNY/USD, IDR/USD, INR/USD, JPY/USD, and KRW/USD. The ARIMA-GARCH model was used to model the exchange rates data and estimate the dynamic dependence using time-varying copulas with the extended parameters. The dynamic dependencies between Chinas and the four countries' exchange rates before and during the 2020 pandemic was evidenced. Moreover, India is the country whose exchange rate has been most strongly affected by the pandemic. Some of the highlights of the proposed approach are: ? This paper provides two algorithms to investigate the dynamic dependencies among exchange rates data during a crisis and forecast the data using time-varying copulas with the extended parameters. ?

Numerous case reports and retrospective cohort studies have been published with mixed characteristics of COVID-19 patients with stroke regarding age, comorbidities, treatment, and outcome. We aimed to depict the frequency and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with stroke. METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched on June 10, 2020, to investigate COVID-19 and stroke through retrospective cross-sectional studies, case series/reports according to PRISMA guidelines. Study-specific estimates were combined using one-group meta-analysis in a random-effects model. RESULTS: 10 retrospective cohort studies and 16 case series/reports were identified including 183 patients with COVID-19 and stroke. The frequency of detected stroke in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 1.1% ([95% confidential interval (CI)]: [0.6-1.6], I(2)=62.9%). Mean age was 66.6 ([58.4-74.9], I(2)=95.1%), 65.6% was male (61/93 patients). Mean days from symptom onset of COVID-19 to stroke was 8.0 ([4.1-11.9], p< 0.001, I(2)=93.1%). D-dimer was 3.3 g/mL ([1.7-4.9], I(2)=86.3%), and cryptogenic stroke was most common as etiology at 50.7% ([31.0-70.4] I(2)=64.1%, 39/71patients).

In this study, to mimic cellular crowding conditions, we have used polyethylene glycol as a chemical crowding agent. The degree of glycation and the results of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) indicated that a crowding environment triggers glycosylation and that the glycosylation degree gradually increases (p < 0.05) with increasing PEG concentration, which shortens the reaction time. The surface hydrophobicity of soybean protein isolate (SPI) significant decreased (p < 0.05), and the protein structure gradually unfolded from a helix to a random coil to prevent aggregation of SPI in the crowded environment.

The CGA membranes together with control membranes of plain chitosan and chitosan plus green banana peel extract, were characterized by contact angle measurement, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Macroscopic analysis showed significant differences in color and transparency caused by the number of decoction days used for extract preparation and the oil content. SEM observations disclosed the formation of two phases, lipid and polymer, in the CGA. The number of decoction days and the andiroba oil content were inversely related to the swelling moisture uptake. All membranes were found to be hydrophilic with contact angles less than 90. The incorporation of plant extract and oil promoted the appearance of related XRD peaks. DSC curves revealed a reduction in the enthalpy of the CGA membranes compared with plain chitosan, which might be attributed to the evaporation of the natural extract and oil.

Participants also highlighted the importance of external facilitators, like dedicated time to work on implementation strategies, as well as the additional benefits like the professional development that comes from being in a learning collaborative and learning different implementation strategies. CONCLUSION: Implementation strategies may help accelerate the adoption and expansion of medication management services within and across organizations. The results of this evaluation shed light on the experiences of different organizations using select implementation strategies in their medication management implementation efforts. The perspectives of participants in this study may help other organizations in selecting and developing similar implementation strategies.","output":"Evaluating the Experience of Organizations Implementing Medication Management Services Using a Variety of Implementation Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: : Electrosurgery smoke is the smoke emitted from tissue cauterization when using the electrosurgery device.

In the current study, we aimed to investigate the level of knowledge reported by the operating room nurses on the effects of electrosurgery smoke during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This descriptive, survey-based cross-sectional study was performed on 533 OR nurses in all the referring hospitals of COVID-19 infection. The required information were collected using a questionnaire regarding the knowledge on the side effects of electrosurgery smoke. The obtained data were then analyzed using t-test and ANOVA by SPSS software. Results: Most of the included participants (93.6%) had a low level of awareness and only a small number of them (0.4%) had a good level of knowledge on the effects of electrosurgery smoke. As well, a significant relationship (P0.05) was found between the level of knowledge reported by the OR nurses and the type of hospital (educational or private). Most of the studied hospitals used no electrosurgery smoke reduction equipment during electrosurgery. Conclusion: The level of knowledge reported by the OR nurses was generally poor. It is recommended that managers and health officials try to increase the level of awareness of OR nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic by providing standard and protective equipment as well as holding some well-organized and related training courses.","output":"Knowledge about the effects of electrosurgery smoke among operating room nurses during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has implacably stricken on the wellness of many countries and their health-care systems. The aim of the present study is to analyze the clinical characteristics of the initial wave of patients with COVID-19 attended in our center, and to identify the key variables predicting the development of respiratory failure. Prospective design study with concurrent data retrieval from automated medical records of all hospitalized adult patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rRT-PCR assay performed on respiratory samples from March 2nd to 18th, 2020. Patients were followed up to May 1st, 2020 or death. Respiratory failure was defined as a PaO2/FiO2 ratio &#8804; 200 mm Hg or the need for mechanical ventilation (either non-invasive positive pressure ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation). We included 521 patients of whom 416 (81%) had abnormal Chest X-ray on admission. Median age was 64.6  18.2 years. One hundred eighty-one (34.7%) developed respiratory failure after a median time from onset of symptoms of 9 days (IQR 6-11). In-hospital mortality was 23.8% (124/521). The modeling process concluded into a logistic regression multivariable analysis and a predictive score at admission. Age, peripheral pulse oximetry, lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein were the selected variables. The model has a good discriminative capacity with an area under the ROC curve of 0.85 (0.82-0.88).

Here, we studied evolutionary relationships for 31 complete genomes of betacoronaviruses, including eight newly sequenced MERS-CoV genomes isolated from dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia. Through bioinformatics tools, we also used available sequences and 3D structure of MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein to predict MERS-CoV epitopes and assess antibody binding affinity. Phylogenetic analysis showed the eight new sequences have close relationships with existing strains detected in camels and humans in Arabian Gulf countries. The 2019-nCov strain appears to have higher homology to both bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV strains. The spike protein tree exhibited clustering of MERS-CoV sequences similar to the complete genome tree, except for one sequence from Qatar (KF961222). B cell epitope analysis determined that the MERS-CoV spike protein has 24 total discontinuous regions from which just six epitopes were selected with score values of >80%.

It has been shown that dysfunction of pancreatic acinar cells can lead to AP progression. Emodin is a natural product, which can alleviate the symptoms of AP. However, the mechanism by which emodin regulates the function of pancreatic acinar cells remains unclear. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which emodin modulates the function of pancreatic acinar cells. To mimic AP in vitro, pancreatic acinar cells were cotreated with caerulein and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Exosomes were isolated using the ExoQuick precipitation kit. Western blot analysis, Nanosight Tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy were performed to detect the efficiency of exosome separation. Gene expression was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. The levels of IL-1 and TNF- were detected by ELISA. The data indicated that emodin significantly decreased the levels of IL-1 and TNF- in the supernatant samples derived from AR42J cells cotreated with caerulein and LPS. In addition, emodin significantly promoted the proliferation of AR42J cells cotreated with caerulein and LPS, and inhibited apoptosis, while the effect of emodin was reversed by long non-coding (lnc)RNA taurine upregulated 1 (TUG1) overexpression. The expression level of TUG1 in AR42J cells or exosomes derived from AR42J cells was significantly increased following treatment of the cells with LPS and caerulein, while this effect was notably reversed by emodin treatment. In addition, exosomes derived from caerulein and LPS cotreated AR42J cells inhibited the differentiation and anti-inflammatory function of regulatory T cells, while treatment of the cells with emodin significantly decreased this effect. In conclusion, the data indicated that emodin inhibited the induction of inflammation in AR42J cells by regulating the expression of cellular and exosomal lncRNA. Therefore, emodin may be used as a potential agent for the treatment of AP.","output":"Emodin inhibits the progression of acute pancreatitis via regulation of lncRNA TUG1 and exosomal lncRNA TUG1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the prevalence, categories and predictors of drug-related hospitalisation (DRH) among patients visiting emergency departments of Addis Ababa city hospitals, Ethiopia. DESIGN: A multicentre prospective observational study was conducted through patients interview and chart review. SETTINGS: The study was undertaken in three tertiary care hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 423 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included. OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence and preventability of DRH, categories of drug-related problems causing DRH, medications and diseases involved in DRH, and factors significantly associated with DRH. RESULT: More than half of the patients (216, 51.1%) were female. The mean age (SD) was 47.50 (17.21) years. The mean length of hospital stay (SD) was 10.29 (8.99) days. Nearly 60% (249) of them were hospitalised due to drug-related problems, of which 87.8% were preventable. The cause for hospitalisation for more than half (130, 53%) of them was a failure to receive drugs, and 37.85 (94) patients were categorised as untreated indications.

The prolonged immunosuppression following specific treatment may be associated with a high risk of developing severe infections. Recently, the use of monoclonal antibodies (rituximab) has allowed sustained remissions to be obtained in the majority of pediatric patients with refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemia. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of an 8-month-old Caucasian girl affected by a severe form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which required continuous steroid treatment for 16 months. Thereafter, she received 4 weekly doses of rituximab (375 mg/m(2)/dose) associated with steroid therapy, which was then tapered over the subsequent 2 weeks. One month after the last dose of rrituximab, she presented with recurrence of severe hemolysis and received two more doses of rrituximab. The patient remained in clinical remission for 7 months, before presenting with a further relapse. An alternative heavy immunosuppressive therapy was administered combining cyclophosphamide 10 mg/kg/day for 10 days with methylprednisolone 40 mg/kg/day for 5 days, which was then tapered down over 3 weeks. While still on steroid therapy, the patient developed an interstitial pneumonia with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, which required immediate admission to the intensive care unit where extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy was administered continuously for 37 days. At 16-month follow-up, the patient is alive and in good clinical condition, with no organ dysfunction, free from any immunosuppressive treatment and with a normal Hb level. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that aggressive combined immunosuppressive therapy may lead to a sustained complete remission in children with refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemia. However, the severe life-threatening complication presented by our patient indicates that strict clinical monitoring must be vigilantly performed, that antimicrobial prophylaxis should always be considered and that experienced medical and nursing staff must be available, to deliver highly specialized supportive salvage therapies, if necessary, during intensive care monitoring.","output":"Prolonged extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome in a child affected by rituximab-resistant autoimmune hemolytic anemia: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of patients suffering from addictive disorders is of major concern. This study aimed to explore the presence and potential increase in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression, and anxiety since the beginning of the pandemic for patients in opioid substitution therapy (OST). Methods: This cross-sectional survey study evaluated a clinical sample of patients in OST (N = 123). Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed by an adapted version of the impact of event scale (IES-R), resulting in two subgroups of low and high risk for PTSD. The depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) was applied to collect data on the respective symptoms, and changes since the onset of the pandemic were reported on separate scales. Sociodemographic and COVID-19 related factors, as well as data on craving, consumption patterns, concomitant use, and the drug market were further assessed. Results: A binary logistic regression analysis confirmed the impact of self-perceived higher burden by psychological and economic factors on the elevated risk for PTSD due to the pandemic. The high-risk PTSD group also showed higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress, as well as a more pronounced deterioration in these symptoms since the pandemic. While reported levels of craving did not differ between the two groups, the high-risk PTSD group indicated a significantly higher increase in craving since the crisis, when compared to the low-risk group. Discussion: Our findings demonstrate elevated levels of clinical symptoms among patients in OST, with more than a quarter of patients found at risk for PTSD due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, about 30C50% of our patients reported concerning levels of depression, anxiety, or stress. Special attention should be drawn to these findings, and potential deterioration of the situation should be addressed by health care facilities. Particularly, psychological, and financial burden due to the crisis were identified as factors increasing the risk for PTSD. These factors can easily be evaluated during routine anamneses, and might be a valuable source of information, when special attention is needed.","output":"Risk of PTSD Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Patients in Opioid Substitution Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with chronic heart failure (HF) are among the most vulnerable populations in the COVID era.

Guidelines in many countries recommend antiviral treatment for older people and individuals with comorbidity at increased risk of complications. However, antivirals are not often prescribed in primary care in Europe, partly because its clinical and cost effectiveness has been insufficiently demonstrated by non-industry funded and pragmatic studies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Antivirals for influenza-Like Illness? An rCt of Clinical and Cost effectiveness in primary CarE is a European multinational, multicentre, open-labelled, non-industry funded, pragmatic, adaptive-platform, randomised controlled trial. Initial trial arms will be best usual primary care and best usual primary care plus treatment with oseltamivir for 5 days. We aim to recruit at least 2500 participants 1 year presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI), with symptom duration 72 hours in primary care over three consecutive periods of confirmed high influenza incidence. Participant outcomes will be followed up to 28 days by diary and telephone. The primary objective is to determine whether adding antiviral treatment to best usual primary care is effective in reducing time to return to usual daily activity with fever, headache and muscle ache reduced to minor severity or less. Secondary objectives include estimating cost-effectiveness, benefits in subgroups according to age (<12, 12C64 and >64 years), severity of symptoms at presentation (low, medium and high), comorbidity (yes/no), duration of symptoms (48 hours/>48C72 hours), complications (hospital admission and pneumonia), use of additional prescribed medication including antibiotics, use of over-the-counter medicines and self-management of ILI symptoms.

Here, we propose an information-theoretic approach for the analysis of synthetic brain networks (based on generative models) and empirical brain networks, and to assess connectomes information capacity at different stages of dementia. Remarkably, our framework accounts for the whole network state, overcoming limitations due to limited sets of descriptors, and is used to probe human connectomes at different scales. We find that the spectral entropy of empirical data lies between two generative models, indicating an interpolation between modular and geometry-driven structural features. In fact, we show that the mesoscale is suitable for characterizing the differences between brain networks and their generative models. Finally, from the analysis of connectomes obtained from healthy and unhealthy subjects, we demonstrate that significant differences between healthy individuals and the ones affected by Alzheimers disease arise at the microscale (max. posterior probability smaller than 1%) and at the mesoscale (max. posterior probability smaller than 10%).","output":"Persistence of information flow: A multiscale characterization of human brain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To estimate excess mortality for care home residents during the COVID-19 pandemic in England, exploring associations with care home characteristics. METHODS: Daily number of deaths in all residential and nursing homes in England notified to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) from 1 January 2017 to 7 August 2020. Care home-level data linked with CQC care home register to identify home characteristics: client type (over 65s/children and adults), ownership status (for-profit/not-for-profit; branded/independent) and size (small/medium/large). Excess deaths computed as the difference between observed and predicted deaths using local authority fixed-effect Poisson regressions on pre-pandemic data. Fixed-effect logistic regressions were used to model odds of experiencing COVID-19 suspected/confirmed deaths. RESULTS: Up to 7 August 2020, there were 29,542 (95% CI 25,176 to 33,908) excess deaths in all care homes. Excess deaths represented 6.5% (95% CI 5.5 to 7.4%) of all care home beds, higher in nursing (8.4%) than residential (4.6%) homes. 64.7% (95% CI 56.4 to 76.0%) of the excess deaths were confirmed/suspected COVID-19. Almost all excess deaths were recorded in the quarter (27.4%) of homes with any COVID-19 fatalities. The odds of experiencing COVID-19 attributable deaths were higher in homes providing nursing services (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.0), to older people and/or with dementia (OR 5.5, 95% CI 4.4 to 6.8), amongst larger (vs. small) homes (OR 13.3, 95% CI 11.5 to 15.4) and belonging to a large provider/brand (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.3). There was no significant association with for-profit status of providers.

RESULTS: Median VWF:Ag, VWF:RCo and VWFpp levels were markedly elevated in COVID-19 patients and increased with intensity of care, with VWF:Ag being 268, 386 and 476 IU/dL, VWF:RCo 216, 334 and 388 IU/dL, and VWFpp 156, 172 and 192 IU/dL in patients at low, intermediate and high intensity of care, respectively.

The E-protein of this virus shares sequence similarity with that of SARS- CoV-1, and is highly conserved in the N-terminus regions. Incidentally, compared to spike proteins, E proteins demonstrate lower disparity and mutability among the isolated sequences.

In particular, restrictions of physical activity (PA) due to pandemic-related lockdown have impacted their psychological status. The aim of this work was to investigate the relationship between PA habits, before the pandemic and during the lockdown, and responses to stress due to home isolation during the lockdown, in older people. METHODS To this aim, an online survey addressed to people aged 65 years and over was conducted during the first pandemic wave in Italy (Study 1). To explore the effect of PA restrictions on responses to stress over time, the survey was replicated during the second wave (Study 2). A group of 72 and 43 participants, from 65 to 88 years, completed the two studies, respectively. The survey required the completion of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and of two questionnaires on stress response, namely, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Perceived Stress Scale. The correlation between the questionnaires' scores was examined. RESULTS Study 1 demonstrated that higher levels of PA during the lockdown, related to working and walking activities, were associated with fewer stress-related symptoms and lower stress perception. In parallel, greater reduction of PA, during lockdown compared to the pre-pandemic period, was associated with more stress-related symptoms. People who spent more time at rest (sitting) before and during the pandemic lockdown were those who showed higher psychological impact. Study 2 confirmed the benefits of maintaining working activities during lockdown, but also showed that during the second pandemic wave people were more resilient to PA restrictions and home isolation, even if conducting a sedentary lifestyle. CONCLUSIONS Maintaining good levels of PA during lockdown was a protective factor against developing stress-related symptoms in older people.

Urgent studies to identify new antiviral drugs, repurpose existing drugs, or identify drugs that can target the overactive immune response are ongoing. Antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) have been tested in past human coronavirus infections, and also against SARS-CoV-2, but a trial of lopinavir and ritonavir failed to show any clinical benefit in COVID-19. However, there is limited data as to the course of COVID-19 in people living with HIV, with some studies showing a decreased mortality for those taking certain ARV regimens. We hypothesized that ARVs other than lopinavir and ritonavir might be responsible for some protection against the progression of COVID-19. Here, we used chemoinformatic analyses to predict which ARVs would bind and potentially inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) or RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) enzymes in silico. The drugs predicted to bind the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro included the protease inhibitors atazanavir and indinavir. The ARVs predicted to bind the catalytic site of the RdRp included Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors, abacavir, emtricitabine, zidovudine, and tenofovir. Existing or new combinations of antiretroviral drugs could potentially prevent or ameliorate the course of COVID-19 if shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in clinical trials.

METHODS In total, 130 patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia lasting >120 minutes were divided into 2 groups: peri-induction warming (n = 65) and control (n = 65). Patients in the peri-induction warming group were warmed during the anesthetic induction period using a forced-air warmer set at 47C, whereas patients in the control group were covered passively with a cotton blanket. All patients were warmed with a forced-air warmer during surgery. Body temperature was measured using a tympanic membrane thermometer in the pre- and postoperative periods and using a nasopharyngeal temperature probe during surgery. Patients were evaluated for shivering scale score, thermal comfort scale score, and satisfaction score in the post-anesthesia care unit. RESULTS The incidence rates of intraoperative and postoperative hypothermia were lower in the peri-induction warming group than in the control group (19.0% vs 57.1%, P < .001; 3.3% vs 16.9%, P = .013, respectively). Body temperature was higher in the peri-induction warming group (P < .001). However, intraoperative blood loss, as well as postoperative thermal comfort scale score, shivering scale score, and patient satisfaction score, were similar between groups. Post-anesthesia care unit duration was also similar between groups.

Given the critical role of NFPs in the global surveillance and response system supported by the IHR, we sought to assess their experiences in carrying out their functions. METHODS: In collaboration with WHO officials, we administered a voluntary online survey to all 196 States Parties to the IHR (2005) in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South and North America, from October to November 2019. The survey was available in six languages via a secure internet-based system. RESULTS: In total, 121 NFP representatives answered the 56-question survey; 105 in full, and an additional 16 in part, resulting in a response rate of 62% (121 responses to 196 invitations to participate). The majority of NFPs knew how to notify the WHO of a potential PHEIC, and believed they have the content expertise to carry out their functions. Respondents found training workshops organized by WHO Regional Offices helpful on how to report PHEICs. NFPs experienced challenges in four critical areas: 1) insufficient intersectoral collaboration within their countries, including limited access to, or a lack of cooperation from, key relevant ministries; 2) inadequate communications, such as deficient information technology systems in place to carry out their functions in a timely fashion; 3) lack of authority to report potential PHEICs; and 4) inadequacies in some resources made available by the WHO, including a key tool - the NFP Guide. Finally, many NFP representatives expressed concern about how WHO uses the information they receive from NFPs. CONCLUSION: Our study, conducted just prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, illustrates key challenges experienced by NFPs that can affect States Parties and WHO performance when outbreaks occur. In order for NFPs to be able to rapidly and successfully communicate potential PHEICs such as COVID-19 in the future, continued measures need to be taken by both WHO and States Parties to ensure NFPs have the necessary authority, capacity, training, and resources to effectively carry out their functions as described in the IHR.","output":"A survey of International Health Regulations National Focal Points experiences in carrying out their functions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Handling Medical waste during this pandemic is the most challenging job of the sanitary workers involved in collecting, segregation, and disposal.

However, results are conflicting and relative effectiveness of AxMs regimens is unknown. We conducted a Bayesian multi-treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analysis to identify the best AxM treatment regimen that will improve clinical outcomes. METHODS PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane databases were searched from the inception of databases through August 2020. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing AxMs supplementations with placebo among critically ill adults were included. Two authors assessed trial quality using Cochrane risk of bias tool and assessed certainty of evidence (CoE). A random effect model, non-informative priors Bayesian MTC meta-analysis using gemtc package in R version 3.6.2 was performed. AxMs treatment effect on clinical outcomes (mortality, infection rates, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays and ventilator days) were represented by absolute risk differences (ARD) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. Prior to final analysis, we repeated the search through January 2021. RESULTS 37 RCT (4905 patients) were included with 16 direct comparisons. With respect to mortality, the ARD for \\"vitamin E\\" compared with placebo was centred at -0.19 [95%CrI: -0.54,0.16; very low CoE] and was ranked the best treatment for mortality reduction as per surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA 0.71, 95%CrI: 0.07,1.00).

The discovery of disease-associated proteins with causal genetic evidence provides an opportunity to identify new therapeutic targets. METHODS: We investigated the observational and causal associations of 90 cardiovascular proteins, which were measured using affinity-based proteomic assays. First, we estimated the associations of 90 cardiovascular proteins with incident heart failure by means of a fixed-effect meta-analysis of 4 population-based studies, composed of a total of 3019 participants with 732 HF events. The causal effects of HF-associated proteins were then investigated by Mendelian randomization, using cis-protein quantitative loci genetic instruments identified from genomewide association studies in more than 30 000 individuals. To improve the precision of causal estimates, we implemented an Mendelian randomization model that accounted for linkage disequilibrium between instruments and tested the robustness of causal estimates through a multiverse sensitivity analysis that included up to 120 combinations of instrument selection parameters and Mendelian randomization models per protein. The druggability of candidate proteins was surveyed, and mechanism of action and potential on-target side effects were explored with cross-trait Mendelian randomization analysis. RESULTS: Forty-four of ninety proteins were positively associated with risk of incident HF (P<6.010(C4)). Among these, 8 proteins had evidence of a causal association with HF that was robust to multiverse sensitivity analysis: higher CSF-1 (macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1), Gal-3 (galectin-3) and KIM-1 (kidney injury molecule 1) were positively associated with risk of HF, whereas higher ADM (adrenomedullin), CHI3L1 (chitinase-3-like protein 1), CTSL1 (cathepsin L1), FGF-23 (fibroblast growth factor 23), and MMP-12 (matrix metalloproteinase-12) were protective. Therapeutics targeting ADM and Gal-3 are currently under evaluation in clinical trials, and all the remaining proteins were considered druggable, except KIM-1. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 44 circulating proteins that were associated with incident HF, of which 8 showed evidence of a causal relationship and 7 were druggable, including adrenomedullin, which represents a particularly promising drug target.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of and risk factors associated with depression symptoms among US adults during vs before the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nationally representative survey study used 2 population-based surveys of US adults aged 18 or older. During COVID-19, estimates were derived from the COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being study, conducted from March 31, 2020, to April 13, 2020. Before COVID-19 estimates were derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, conducted from 2017 to 2018. Data were analyzed from April 15 to 20, 2020. EXPOSURES: The COVID-19 pandemic and outcomes associated with the measures to mitigate it. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Depression symptoms, defined using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 cutoff of 10 or higher. Categories of depression symptoms were defined as none (score, 0-4), mild (score, 5-9), moderate (score, 10-14), moderately severe (score, 15-19), and severe (score, 20). RESULTS: A total of 1470 participants completed the COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being survey (completion rate, 64.3%), and after removing those with missing data, the final duringCCOVID-19 sample included 1441 participants (619 participants [43.0%] aged 18-39 years; 723 [50.2%] men; 933 [64.7%] non-Hispanic White). The preCCOVID-19 sample included 5065 participants (1704 participants [37.8%] aged 18-39 years; 2588 [51.4%] women; 1790 [62.9%] non-Hispanic White). Depression symptom prevalence was higher in every category during COVID-19 compared with before (mild: 24.6% [95% CI, 21.8%-27.7%] vs 16.2% [95% CI, 15.1%-17.4%]; moderate: 14.8% [95% CI, 12.6%-17.4%] vs 5.7% [95% CI, 4.8%-6.9%]; moderately severe: 7.9% [95% CI, 6.3%-9.8%] vs 2.1% [95% CI, 1.6%-2.8%]; severe: 5.1% [95% CI, 3.8%-6.9%] vs 0.7% [95% CI, 0.5%-0.9%]). Higher risk of depression symptoms during COVID-19 was associated with having lower income (odds ratio, 2.37 [95% CI, 1.26-4.43]), having less than $5000 in savings (odds ratio, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.02-2.26]), and exposure to more stressors (odds ratio, 3.05 [95% CI, 1.95-4.77]).

Unprecedented lockdown was enforced in many countries including India as a first response to contain virus and its spread. That lead to a lot of confusion, fear, anxiety among general population as well as orthopaedic surgeons. We have studied the impact of this pandemic with fear as a denominator and how it affected the practice and health of orthopaedic surgeons. METHODS: Cross-sectional web-based national survey distributed to orthopaedic surgeons by social media platform over period of one month from July 25, 2020 to august 25, 2020. RESULTS: Among 1065 responders, 731 completed the survey. Among 1065 responders, 27.22% had orthopaedic practice experience ranging from 10 to 20 years while 21.48% had orthopaedic experience more than 20 years. Scientific literature as well as social media and news media contributed significantly to Covid-19 knowledge and fear. 98.88% were worried about contracting disease by themselves or to family members. 89.47% were worried due to financial loss due to pandemic. 37 (5.06%) surgeons had a FCV- 19 (Fear for Covid-19 scale) score more than 60 (8.2%) while 291 (39.8%) had 41C60 and score was <40 in 403 (55.12%) surgeons.

A decision tree (DT) model to predict COVID-19 length of stay was developed based on patient clinical information. The model showed very good performance with a coefficient of determination R(2) of 49.8% and a median absolute deviation of 2.85 days. Furthermore, another DT-based model was constructed to predict COVID-19 risk of death. The model showed excellent performance with sensitivity and specificity of 96.5 and 87.8%, respectively, and overall prediction accuracy of 96%. Further validation using unsupervised learning methods showed similar separation patterns, and a receiver operator characteristic approach suggested stable and robust DT model performance. The results show that a high risk of death of 78.2% is indicated for intubated COVID-19 patients who have not used anticoagulant medications. Fortunately, intubated patients who are using anticoagulant and dexamethasone medications with an international normalized ratio of <1.69 have zero risk of death from COVID-19.

As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, high sensitivity assays such as the EM Kit will have an important role in ensuring high throughput and sensitive testing using pooled samples can be maintained, delivering the most cost-effective sample extraction and amplification option for national test and trace programs.","output":"Development of a high sensitivity RT-PCR assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in individual and pooled nasopharyngeal samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The December 2019 outbreak of coronavirus has once again thrown the vexed issue of quarantine into the spotlight, with many countries asking their citizens to 'self-isolate' if they have potentially come into contact with the infection. However, adhering to quarantine is difficult. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence to increase the likelihood of people adhering to protocols. We conducted a rapid review to identify factors associated with adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. STUDY DESIGN: The study design is a rapid evidence review. METHODS: We searched Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science for published literature on the reasons for and factors associated with adherence to quarantine during an infectious disease outbreak. RESULTS: We found 3163 articles and included 14 in the review. Adherence to quarantine ranged from as little as 0 up to 92.8%. The main factors which influenced or were associated with adherence decisions were the knowledge people had about the disease and quarantine procedure, social norms, perceived benefits of quarantine and perceived risk of the disease, as well as practical issues such as running out of supplies or the financial consequences of being out of work. CONCLUSIONS: People vary in their adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. To improve this, public health officials should provide a timely, clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; emphasise social norms to encourage this altruistic behaviour; increase the perceived benefit that engaging in quarantine will have on public health; and ensure that sufficient supplies of food, medication and other essentials are provided.","output":"How to improve adherence with quarantine: rapid review of the evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our knowledge of the evolution and the role of untranslated region (UTR) in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity is very limited. Leader sequence, originated from UTR, is found at the 5 ends of all encoded SARS-CoV-2 transcripts, highlighting its importance. Here, evolution of leader sequence was compared between human pathogenic and non-pathogenic coronaviruses. Then, profiling of microRNAs that can inactivate the key UTR regions of coronaviruses was carried out. A distinguished pattern of evolution in leader sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was found. Mining all available microRNA families against leader sequences of coronaviruses resulted in discovery of 39 microRNAs with a stable thermodynamic binding energy. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 had a lower binding stability against microRNAs. hsa-MIR-5004-3p was the only human microRNA able to target the leader sequence of SARS and to a lesser extent, also SARS-CoV-2. However, its binding stability decreased remarkably in SARS-COV-2. We found some plant microRNAs with low and stable binding energy against SARS-COV-2. Meta-analysis documented a significant (p < 0.01) decline in the expression of MIR-5004-3p after SARS-COV-2 infection in trachea, lung biopsy, and bronchial organoids as well as lung-derived Calu-3 and A549 cells. The paucity of the innate human inhibitory microRNAs to bind to leader sequence of SARS-CoV-2 can contribute to its high replication in infected human cells.","output":"A Transcription Regulatory Sequence in the 5 Untranslated Region of SARS-CoV-2 Is Vital for Virus Replication with an Altered Evolutionary Pattern against Human Inhibitory MicroRNAs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread worldwide, with a vast majority of confirmed cases presenting with respiratory symptoms. Potential neurological manifestations and their pathophysiological mechanisms have not been thoroughly established. In this narrative review, we sought to present the neurological manifestations associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Case reports, case series, editorials, reviews, case-control and cohort studies were evaluated, and relevant information was abstracted. Various reports of neurological manifestations of previous coronavirus epidemics provide a roadmap regarding potential neurological complications of COVID-19, due to many shared characteristics between these viruses and SARS-CoV-2. Studies from the current pandemic are accumulating and report COVID-19 patients presenting with dizziness, headache, myalgias, hypogeusia and hyposmia, but also with more serious manifestations including polyneuropathy, myositis, cerebrovascular diseases, encephalitis and encephalopathy. However, discrimination between causal relationship and incidental comorbidity is often difficult. Severe COVID-19 shares common risk factors with cerebrovascular diseases, and it is currently unclear whether the infection per se represents an independent stroke risk factor. Regardless of any direct or indirect neurological manifestations, the COVID-19 pandemic has a huge impact on the management of neurological patients, whether infected or not. In particular, the majority of stroke services worldwide have been negatively influenced in terms of care delivery and fear to access healthcare services.

METHODS: All children (0C12 y of age) diagnosed and confirmed as dengue fever at a tertiary care hospital at Puducherry, between the 1st of August 2012 and January 31st 2015 were reviewed retrospectively from hospital case records as per the revised World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines 2011 for dengue fever. The diagnosis was confirmed by NS1 antigen-based ELISA test or dengue serology for IgM and IgG antibodies and the data was analyzed using SPSS 16.0 statistical software. RESULTS: Out of 254 children admitted with dengue fever, non-severe dengue and severe dengue were seen in 62.6 % and 37.4 % respectively. Atypical manifestations were seen in 106 cases (41.7 %). Mean age of presentation was 6.9(3.3) y. M: F ratio was 1.2:1. The common manifestations of severe dengue infection were shock (37.4 %), bleeding (20.1 %) and multi-organ dysfunction (2.4 %). The most common atypical manifestations of dengue fever were lymphadenopathy (41.7 %), splenomegaly (21.2 %), biphasic fever (18.1 %), hepatitis (11.4 %), febrile diarrhea (6.3 %), refractory shock (2.4 %) and impaired consciousness (1.9 %). The other atypical manifestations present were portal hypertension, acalculous cholecystitis, appendicitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), myocarditis, pericardial effusion, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), myositis, acute kidney injury (AKI), hemophagocytic syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Platelet count did not always correlate well with the severity of bleeding. There were six deaths (2.4 %) and out of them four presented with impaired consciousness (66.6 %). The common causes for poor outcome were multiorgan failure, encephalopathy and refractory shock. CONCLUSIONS: The atypical manifestations of dengue fever are no more a rare entity.

We studied the impact of COVID-19 on acute stroke care in our health system serving Southeast Michigan as we rolled out a policy to limit admissions and transfers. METHODS: in this retrospective study conducted at two stroke centers, we included consecutive patients presenting to the ED for whom a stroke alert was activated during the period extending from 3/20/20 to 5/20/20 and a similar period in 2019. We compared demographics, time metrics, and discharge outcomes between the two groups. RESULTS: of 385 patients presented to the ED during the two time periods, 58% were African American. There was a significant decrease in the number of stroke patients presenting to the ED and admitted to the hospital between the two periods (p <0.001). In 2020, patients had higher presenting NIHSS (median: 2 vs 5, p = 0.012), discharge NIHSS (median: 2 vs 3, p = 0.004), and longer times from LKW to ED arrival (4.8 vs 9.4 h, p = 0.031) and stroke team activation (median: 10 vs 15 min, p = 0.006). In 2020, stroke mimics rates were lower among African Americans. There were fewer hospitalizations (p <0.001), and transfers from outside facilities (p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: a trend toward faster stroke care in the ED was observed during the pandemic along with dramatically reduced numbers of ED visits, hospitalizations and stroke mimics. Delayed ED presentations and higher stroke severity characterized the African American population, highlighting deepening of racial disparities during the pandemic.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Acute Stroke Care, Time Metrics, Outcomes, and Racial Disparities in a Southeast Michigan Health System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Death rates higher than expected, but control measures seem to be working.","output":"SARS hits hard"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Microbial drug resistance is one of the biggest public health problems. Antibiotic consumption is an essential factor for the emergence and spread of multiresistant bacteria. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the antibiotics consumption in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), identifying trends in the antibiotics use profile and microbiological isolates throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We performed this retrospective observational study in intensive care units of a Brazilian tertiary hospital from January 2019 to December 2020. The primary outcome was antimicrobial consumption in the ICU, measured by defined daily doses (per 100 bed-days. As a secondary outcome, bacterial infections (microbiological isolates) were calculated in the same fashion. Outcomes trends were analyzed using Joinpoint regression models, considering constant variance (homoscedasticity) and first-order autocorrelation assumptions. A monthly percent change (MPC) was estimated for each analyzed segment. Results: Seven thousand and nine hundred fifty-three patients had data available on prescribed and received medications and were included in the analyses. Overall, the use of antibiotics increased over time in the ICU. The reserve group (World Health Organization Classification) had an increasing trend (MPC = 7.24) from February to April 2020. The azithromycin consumption (J01FA) increased rapidly, with a MPC of 5.21 from January to April 2020. Polymyxin B showed a relevant increase from March to June 2020 (MPC = 6.93). The peak of the antibiotic consumption of Reserve group did not overlap with the peak of the pathogenic agents they are intended to treat. Conclusion: Overall antimicrobial consumption in ICU has increased in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The peaks in the antimicrobials use were not associated with the rise of the pathogenic agents they intended to treat, indicating an empirical use, which is especially concerning in the context of treating multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections.

CIITA is the founding member of the mammalian nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich-repeat (NLR) protein family but stood apart for a long time as the only transcriptional regulator. More recently, it was found that its closest homolog, NLRC5 (NLR protein caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD)-containing 5), is a regulator of MHC-I gene expression. Both act as non-DNA-binding activators through multiple proteinCprotein interactions with an MHC enhanceosome complex that binds cooperatively to a highly conserved combinatorial cis-acting module. Thus, the regulation of MHC-II expression is regulated largely through the differential expression of CIITA. In addition to the well-defined role of CIITA in MHC-II GENE regulation, we will discuss several other aspects of CIITA functions, such as its role in cancer, its role as a viral restriction element contributing to intrinsic immunity, and lastly, its very recently discovered role as an inhibitor of Ebola and SARS-Cov-2 virus replication. We will briefly touch upon the recently discovered role of NLRP3 as a transcriptional regulator, which suggests that transcriptional regulation is, after all, not such an unusual feature for NLR proteins.","output":"The MHC Class II Transactivator CIITA: Not (Quite) the Odd-One-Out Anymore among NLR Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has accelerated vaccine development.

Methods: A middle-aged recreational female runner was monitored during a competitive 20-wk macrocycle divided into first (M1) and second mesocycle (M2) in which best performances over 10 km and 21 km were recorded. Volume (km), session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE), TL, and monotony (mean TL/SD TL) were the workload parameters recorded. The root mean square of the successive differences in R-R intervals (RMSSD), its coefficient of variation (RMSSDcv), and the RMSSD:RR ratio were the HRV parameters monitored. Results: During M2, RMSSD (p = 0.006) and RMSSD:RR (p = 0.002) were significantly increased, while RR was significantly reduced (p = 0.017). Significant correlations were identified between monotony and volume (r = 0.552; p = 0.012), RR (r = 0.447; p = 0.048), and RMSSD:RR (r = ?0.458; p = 0.042).

Thus, other therapeutic options are necessary. One such therapeutic option that leverages SARS-CoV-2 initiation of infection by binding of its spike receptor binding domain (S RBD) to surface-expressed host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an ACE2 decoy that would trap the virus by competitive binding and thus inhibit propagation of infection. Here, we used Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations to predict ACE2 mutations that might increase its affinity for S RBD and screened these candidates for binding affinity in vitro. A double mutant ACE2(T27Y/H34A)-IgG1FC fusion protein was found to have very high affinity for S RBD and to show greater neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 in a live virus assay as compared to wild type ACE2. We further modified the double mutant ACE2 decoy by addition of an H374N mutation to inhibit ACE2 enzymatic activity while maintaining high S RBD affinity. We then confirmed the potential efficacy of our ACE2(T27Y/H34A/H374N)-IgG1FC Triple Decoy against S RBD expressing variant-associated E484K, K417N, N501Y, and L452R mutations and found that our ACE2 Triple Decoy not only maintains its high affinity for S RBD expressing these mutations, but shows enhanced affinity for S RBD expressing the N501Y or L452R mutations and the highest affinity for S RBD expressing both the E484K and N501Y mutations. The ACE2 Triple Decoy also demonstrates the ability to compete with wild type ACE2 in the cPass? surrogate virus neutralization in the presence of S RBD with these mutations. Additional MD simulation of ACE2 WT and decoy interactions with S RBD WT or B.1.351 variant sequence S RBD provides insight into the enhanced affinity of the ACE2 decoy for S RBD and reveals its potential as a tool to predict affinity and inform therapeutic design.

To investigate the direct and indirect effects before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, a moderated mediation model was used to test the hypothesis of this study by three-step approach analysis. The attitude toward residence was defined to test the hypothesis of the mediator, and the walking distance to the nearest mass transit station was employed to identify the level of the moderator. The results indicated that the attitude toward residence mediated the relationship between the attitude toward travel mode and travel mode behavior. The sensitivity of COVID-19 accurately reflects the various effects on travel mode. Moreover, multi-group analyses show that walking distance moderators have a direct effect on attitudes toward travel mode and travel mode behavior as well as the attitude toward residence.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 on Attitude and Travel Mode Based on Walking Distance-The Moderated Mediation Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic that started in 2020 forced a rapid change in university teaching, with large numbers of courses switching to distance learning with very little time for preparation.

The aim of the investigation is to evaluate the benefits of 20-30 minutes in contact with nature. BACKGROUND: The Scientific Community, also through the evidence-based design approach, has already demonstrated the importance of greenery and nature on the psychophysical well-being of people and, in a moment of emergency, contact with the nature can be therapeutic and quite influential on the mental health of staff subject to stress. METHOD: During the lockdown, an Italian multidisciplinary working group promoted an experience-based survey, based on the Profile of Mood States methodology, for measuring the psychophysical well-being of hospital staff. RESULTS: The author collected 77 questionnaires. The benefits that users have obtained from the experience in nature have been investigated by comparing the type of stresses they were subjected to and highlighting various peculiarities in the data analysis associated with the type of green in which they carried out the survey, the healthcare areas in which they worked during the pandemic emergency, and the moment in which the survey was conducted.

We examined visits for ectopic pregnancies and pregnancies of unknown location (PUL) in the emergency department (ED) of three NYC hospitals during the height of the early pandemic and compared them to the same months in the prior year. Methods: Our study is an IRB-approved retrospective chart review of all patients who presented to the ED with a positive pregnancy test during the months of MarchCJune 2020 (pandemic period) and MarchCJune 2019 (pre-pandemic).

Decentralization of testing can put tremendous stresses on fragile health systems if the laboratory is not involved in the planning, introduction, and scale-up strategies. RECENT FINDINGS The impact of investments in novel technologies can only be realized if these tests are evaluated, adopted, and scaled up within the healthcare system with appropriate planning and understanding of the local contexts in which these technologies will be used. SUMMARY In this digital age, the laboratory needs to take on the role of the Command Centre for technology introduction and implementation. Implementation science is needed to understand the political, cultural, economic, and behavioural context for technology introduction. The new paradigm should include: building a comprehensive system of laboratories and point-of-care testing sites to provide quality-assured diagnostic services with good laboratory-clinic interface to build trust in test results and linkage to care; building and coordinating a comprehensive national surveillance and communication system for disease control and global health emergencies; conducting research to monitor the impact of new tools and interventions on improving patient care.","output":"Implementation science: the laboratory as a command centre."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to cholesterol deprivation, SCAP escorts SREBP transcription factors from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex for their proteolytic activation, leading to gene expression for cholesterol synthesis and uptake.

SCAP knockdown inhibited the turnover of PI4P, perhaps due to a cholesterol transport defect, and altered the subcellular distribution of the VAP-OSBP complex. As in the case of perturbation of lipid transfer complexes at ER-Golgi MCSs, SCAP knockdown inhibited the biogenesis of the trans-Golgi network-derived transport carriers CARTS, which was reversed by expression of wild-type SCAP or a Golgi transport-defective mutant, but not of cholesterol sensing-defective mutants. Altogether, our findings reveal a new role for SCAP under cholesterol-fed conditions in the facilitation of CARTS biogenesis via ER-Golgi MCSs, depending on the ER cholesterol.","output":"The ER cholesterol sensor SCAP promotes CARTS biogenesis at ER-Golgi membrane contact sites."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plasmids remain important microbial components mediating the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. To systematically explore the relationship between mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), a novel strategy using single-molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing was developed. This approach was applied to pooled conjugative plasmids from clinically isolated multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae from a tertiary referral hospital over a 9-month period. The conjugative plasmid pool was obtained from transconjugants that acquired antimicrobial resistance after plasmid conjugation with 53 clinical isolates. The plasmid pool was then subjected to SMRT sequencing, and 82 assembled plasmid fragments were obtained. In total, 124 ARGs (responsible for resistance to -lactam, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycoside, among others) and 317 MGEs [including transposons (Tns), insertion sequences (ISs), and integrons] were derived from these fragments. Most of these ARGs were linked to MGEs, allowing for the establishment of a relationship network between MGEs and/or ARGs that can be used to describe the dissemination of resistance by mobile elements. Key elements involved in resistance transposition were identified, including IS26, Tn3, IS903B, ISEcp1, and ISKpn19. As the most predominant IS in the network, a typical IS26-mediated multicopy composite transposition event was illustrated by tracing its flanking 8-bp target site duplications (TSDs).

SETTING: SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from a 58-year-old man from Wuhan, China who arrived in Melbourne on 19 January 2020 and was admitted to the Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne from the emergency department on 24 January 2020 with fever, cough, and progressive dyspnoea. MAJOR OUTCOMES: Clinical course and laboratory features of the first reported case of COVID-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) in Australia; isolation, whole genome sequencing, imaging, and rapid sharing of virus from the patient. RESULTS: A nasopharyngeal swab and sputum collected when the patient presented to hospital were each positive for SARS-CoV-2 (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). Inoculation of Vero/hSLAM cells with material from the nasopharyngeal swab led to the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 virus in culture. Electron microscopy of the supernatant confirmed the presence of virus particles with morphology characteristic of viruses of the family Coronaviridae. Whole genome sequencing of the viral isolate and phylogenetic analysis indicated the isolate exhibited greater than 99.99% sequence identity with other publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Within 24 hours of isolation, the first Australian SARS-CoV-2 isolate was shared with local and overseas reference laboratories and major North American and European culture collections.

Therefore it is aimed to develop a machine learning method for the detection of viral epidemics by analyzing X-ray and CT images. In this study, images belonging to six situations, including coronavirus images, are classified using a two-stage data enhancement approach. Since the number of images in the dataset is deficient and unbalanced, a shallow image augmentation approach was used in the first phase. It is more convenient to analyze these images with hand-crafted feature extraction methods because the dataset newly created is still insufficient to train a deep architecture. Therefore, the Synthetic minority over-sampling technique algorithm is the second data enhancement step of this study. Finally, the feature vector is reduced in size by using a stacked auto-encoder and principal component analysis methods to remove interconnected features in the feature vector. According to the obtained results, it is seen that the proposed method has leveraging performance, especially to make the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a short time and effectively.

The aim of this study was to correlate autopsy-based cause of death in SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive patients with chest imaging and severity grade of pulmonary and systemic morphological vascular pathology. METHODS: Fifteen SARS-CoV-2 positive autopsies with clinically distinct presentations (age 22C89 years) were retrospectively analyzed with focus on vascular, thromboembolic, and ischemic changes in pulmonary and in extrapulmonary sites. Eight patients died due to COVID-19 associated respiratory failure with diffuse alveolar damage in various stages and/or multi-organ failure, whereas other reasons such as cardiac decompensation, complication of malignant tumors, or septic shock were the cause of death in 7 further patients. The severity of gross and histopathological changes was semi-quantitatively scored as 0 (absent), 1 (mild), and 3 (severe). Severity scores between the 2 groups were correlated with selected clinical parameters, initial chest imaging, autopsy-based cause of death, and compared using Pearson 2 and Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Severe pulmonary endothelitis (p = 0.031, p = 0.029) and multi-organ involvement (p = 0.026, p = 0.006) correlated significantly with COVID-19 associated death.

However, it is still unknown whether and, if so, to what extent, viruses from different lyssavirus species vary in their pathogenic potential. In order to characterize and systematically compare a broader group of lyssavirus isolates for their viral replication kinetics, pathogenicity, and virus release through saliva-associated virus shedding, we used a mouse infection model comprising a low (10(2) TCID(50)) and a high (10(5) TCID(50)) inoculation dose as well as three different inoculation routes (intramuscular, intranasal, intracranial). Clinical signs, incubation periods, and survival were investigated. Based on the latter two parameters, a novel pathogenicity matrix was introduced to classify lyssavirus isolates. Using a total of 13 isolates from ten different virus species, this pathogenicity index varied within and between virus species. Interestingly, Irkut virus (IRKV) and Bokeloh bat lyssavirus (BBLV) obtained higher pathogenicity scores (1.14 for IRKV and 1.06 for BBLV) compared to rabies virus (RABV) isolates ranging between 0.19 and 0.85. Also, clinical signs differed significantly between RABV and other bat lyssaviruses. Altogether, our findings suggest a high diversity among lyssavirus isolates concerning survival, incubation period, and clinical signs. Virus shedding significantly differed between RABVs and other lyssaviruses. Our results demonstrated that active shedding of infectious virus was exclusively associated with two RABV isolates (92% for RABV-DogA and 67% for RABV-Insectbat), thus providing a potential explanation as to why sustained spillovers are solely attributed to RABVs. Interestingly, 3D imaging of a selected panel of brain samples from bat-associated lyssaviruses demonstrated a significantly increased percentage of infected astrocytes in mice inoculated with IRKV (10.03%; SD7.39) compared to RABV-Vampbat (2.23%; SD2.4), and BBLV (0.78%; SD1.51), while only individual infected cells were identified in mice infected with Duvenhage virus (DUVV).

Only 25% (3 of 12) of the IMV patients were successfully extubated during the study period. The median duration on IMV was 17 days (range 4-35). The mortality in the 158 COVID-19-positive patients was 5.7% (9 of 158). None of the 24 non-ICU patients died. The ICU mortality rate was 53% (9 of 17). CONCLUSIONS: This report describes a community hospital experience with COVID-19. Patient outcome was comparable to that reported at larger centers. Obesity was a major comorbidity and correlated with adverse outcomes. Amidst the initial wave of COVID-19 with high demand for inpatient treatment, it is reassuring that appropriate care can be provided in a community health system.","output":"COVID-19 in a Mississippi Community Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination induces variable protection against pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), and a more effective TB vaccine is needed.

As of September 2021, there have been over 229 million cases of COVID-19 reported worldwide, with over 4.7 million COVID-19Cassociated deaths. BODY: The devastating second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India has seen a rise in various extrapulmonary manifestations. One of key components in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is downregulation of ACE-2, which is expressed on many organs and counterbalances the pro-inflammatory effects of ACE/angiotensin-II axis. This leads to influx of inflammatory cells into alveoli, increased vascular permeability and activation of prothrombotic mediators. Imaging findings such as ground glass opacities, interlobular septal thickening, vascular dilatation and pulmonary thrombosis correlate well with the pathogenesis. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that the systemic complications of COVID-19 are caused by either direct viral invasion or effect of cytokine storm leading to inflammation and thrombosis or a combination of both. Gaining insights into pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 will help understanding the various multisystemic manifestations of COVID-19. To date, only a few articles have been published that comprehensively describe the pathophysiology of COVID-19 along with its various multisystemic imaging manifestations.","output":"Emerging complications of COVID-19 in a subset of Indian population: a pathological review with clinico-radiological case scenarios"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plaque formation by A59 virus, a murine coronavirus, was facilitated in AL/N and Balb mouse cells transformed by polyoma virus, simian virus 40, murine sarcoma virus, or mammary tumor virus.

Design/methodology/approach This research is of a qualitative nature. The thematic exploration uses the analysis of findings from 19 in-depth interviews with experienced HR managers and is preceded by desk research. Findings The findings advance our understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected developmental processes in organisations. The results indicate, apart from the change in the form and methodology of employee trainings due to the pandemic, that employees also desire new subjects to aid their development. One also noticed decreased employee engagement and increased fatigue with the use of multiple, online development initiatives. Practical implications For learning and development (L&D) practitioners, there are implications in relation to tailoring developmental offerings to fit the needs of employees to help them to progress more in the course of their work. In this new reality, an agile approach to employee development can work much better. The activities of the L&D departments should also take into greater account the changing and unpredictable reality as well as the evolving nature of information and communication technologies (ICT). The COVID-19 pandemic may contribute to the analysis and modernisation of existing offerings for development in organisations and foster a culture of lifelong learning. Originality/value This research makes an important contribution to the literature by examining the impact of situational context on modifications in development activities undertaken in organisations. The results indicate the need to change the existing role of L&D teams in organisations, taking into account the maximum use of e-learning potential, while understanding its limitations. It can be assumed that while the pandemic develops, designing hybrid learning will become even more important and L&D professionals will focus on combining the flexibility of self-training and available online resources with highly engaging real-world experiences.","output":"Changes in the approach to employee development in organisations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Raising knowledge over cardiac complications and managing them can play a key role in their recovery. In this study, we aim to investigate the evidence regarding the prevalence of cardiac complications and the resulting mortality rate in COVID-19 patients. Method Search was conducted in electronic databases of Medline (using PubMed), Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science, in addition to the manual search in preprint databases, and Google and Google scholar search engines, for articles published from 2019 until April 30th, 2020. Inclusion criterion was reviewing and reporting cardiac complications in patients with confirmed COVID-19. Results The initial search resulted in 853 records, out of which 40 articles were included. Overall analysis showed that the prevalence of acute cardiac injury, heart failure and cardiac arrest were 19.46% (95% CI: 18.23-20.72), 19.07% (95% CI: 15.38-23.04) and 3.44% (95% CI: 3.08-3.82), respectively. Moreover, abnormal serum troponin level was observed in 22.86% (95% CI: 21.19-24.56) of the COVID-19 patients. Further analysis revealed that the overall odds of mortality is 14.24 (95% CI: 8.67-23.38) times higher when patients develop acute cardiac injury. The pooled odds ratio of mortality when the analysis was limited to abnormal serum troponin level was 19.03 (95% CI: 11.85-30.56). Conclusion Acute cardiac injury and abnormal serum troponin level were the most prevalent cardiac complications/abnormalities in COVID-19 patients. The importance of cardiac complications is emphasized due to the higher mortality rate among patients with these complications. Thus, troponin screenings and cardiac evaluations are recommended to be performed in routine patient assessments.","output":"Cardiac Complications and Pertaining Mortality Rate in COVID-19 Patients; a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in health care are well documented in the United States. As machine learning methods become more common in health care settings, it is important to ensure that these methods do not contribute to racial disparities through biased predictions or differential accuracy across racial groups. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to assess a machine learning algorithm intentionally developed to minimize bias in in-hospital mortality predictions between white and nonwhite patient groups. METHODS: Bias was minimized through preprocessing of algorithm training data. We performed a retrospective analysis of electronic health record data from patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at a large academic health center between 2001 and 2012, drawing data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III database. Patients were included if they had at least 10 hours of available measurements after ICU admission, had at least one of every measurement used for model prediction, and had recorded race/ethnicity data. Bias was assessed through the equal opportunity difference. Model performance in terms of bias and accuracy was compared with the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), and the Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE). RESULTS: The machine learning algorithm was found to be more accurate than all comparators, with a higher sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic. The machine learning algorithm was found to be unbiased (equal opportunity difference 0.016, P=.20). APACHE was also found to be unbiased (equal opportunity difference 0.019, P=.11), while SAPS II and MEWS were found to have significant bias (equal opportunity difference 0.038, P=.006 and equal opportunity difference 0.074, P<.001, respectively).

To understand how this occurs, we investigated the role of the receptor Tva in avian leukosis virus-A (ALV-A) infection. We find that Tva binding induced the formation of a reactive thiolate on Cys38 (Cys38-S(?)) in SU. Both chemical and genetic inactivation of Cys38-S(?) completely abrogated ALV fusion and infection. Remarkably, Cys38-S(?) does not mediate isomerization of the SU-TM disulfide bond and is not required for Tva-induced activation of TM, including pre-hairpin association with membranes and low pH assembly of helical bundles. These findings indicate that, contrary to current models, receptor activation of TM is not sufficient for ALV fusion and infection and that formation of a reactive thiolate is an additional receptor-dependent step.","output":"Receptor-Induced Thiolate Couples Env Activation to Retrovirus Fusion and Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: This review summarizes the updated literature on airway management during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

Conventional DNA methylation detection methods using sodium bisulphite treatment do not distinguish between methylated and hydroxymethylated forms of cytosine, meaning that past studies report a composite of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). To identify the distinct contributions of DNA methylation modifications to axonal regeneration, we collected spinal cord tissue after sharp injury from untreated adult F3 male rats with enhanced regeneration of injured spinal axons or controls, derived from folate- or water-treated F0 lineages, respectively. Genomic DNA was profiled for genome-wide 5hmC levels, revealing 658 differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs). Genomic profiling with whole genome bisulphite sequencing disclosed regeneration-related alterations in composite 5mC + 5hmC DNA methylation levels at 2,260 differentially methylated regions (DMRs). While pathway analyses revealed that differentially hydroxymethylated and methylated genes are linked to biologically relevant axon developmental pathways, only 22 genes harbour both DhMR and DMRs. Since these differential modifications were more than 60 kilobases on average away from each other, the large majority of differential hydroxymethylated and methylated regions are unique with distinct functions in the axonal regeneration phenotype. These data highlight the importance of distinguishing independent contributions of 5mC and 5hmC levels in the central nervous system, and denote discrete roles for DNA methylation modifications in spinal cord injury and regeneration in the context of transgenerational inheritance.","output":"DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation have distinct genome-wide profiles related to axonal regeneration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates all kinds of access entrance guard control systems at home and abroad and analyzes their advantages and disadvantages.

It discusses ontological and epistemic challenges raised in the humanities and social sciences, and attempts to systematically reply to their criticisms from the viewpoint of clinical medicine, philosophy of medicine, particularly the ontology of disease and the epistemology of diagnosis, and medical ethics. The ontological challenge focuses on the doubt about the persistence of a disease over historical time, whereas the epistemic challenge disputes the inaccessibility of scientific verification of a diagnosis in the past. I argue that the critics are in error in conflating the taxonomy of disease (nosology) and the act of diagnosing a patient. Medical diagnosis is fundamentally a hypothesis-construction and an explanatory device that can be generated under various degrees of uncertainty and limited amount of information. It is not an apodictic judgment (true or false) as the critics presuppose, but a probabilistic (Bayesian) judgment with varying degrees of plausibility under uncertainty. In order to avoid this confusion, I propose that retrospective diagnosis of a historical figure be syndromic without identifying underlying disease, unless there is justifiable reason for such specification. Moreover it should be evaluated not only from the viewpoint of medical science but also in a larger context of the scholarship of the humanities and social sciences by its overall plausibility and consistency. On the other hand, I will endorse their concerns regarding the ethics and professionalism of retrospective diagnosis, and call for the need for situating such a diagnosis in an interdisciplinary scope and the context of the scholarship of the historical figure. I will then enumerate several important caveats for interdisciplinary retrospective diagnosis using an example of the retrospective diagnosis of Socrates for his life-long intermittent neurologic symptoms. Finally, I will situate the present argument in a larger context of the major debate among the historians of medicine and paleopathologists, and discuss the similarities and differences.","output":"Retrospective diagnosis of a famous historical figure: ontological, epistemic, and ethical considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As with other national disasters, epidemics, and pandemics, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted health disparities in Black communities in the USA.

If so, the cost-effective COP data measurements can be used to indicate the level of postural stability and lower limb muscle activity. The HilbertCHuang Transform method was used to analyse the data from the experimental designed to examine the correlation between lower-limb muscles and postural stability. We randomly selected 24 university students to participate in eight scenarios and simultaneously measured their COP and EMG signals during the experiments. The Empirical Mode Decomposition was used to identify the intrinsic-mode functions (IMF) that can distinguish between the COP and EMG at different states. Subsequently, similarity indices and synchronization analyses were used to calculate the correlation between the lower-limb muscle strength and the postural stability. The IMF5 of the COP signals and the IMF6 of the EMG signals were not significantly different and the average frequency was 0.8 Hz, with a range of 0C2 Hz. When the postural stability was poor, the COP and EMG had a high synchronization with index values within the range of 0.010C0.015. With good postural stability, the synchronization indices were between 0.006 and 0.080 and both exhibited low synchronization.

Still, with higher levels of parallelization becoming available, the strategies that work for a few tens of parallel evaluations become limiting, in particular due to the complexity of selecting more evaluations. It is even more crucial when the black-box is noisy, necessitating more evaluations as well as repeating experiments.

Objectives: To explore clinical and biological parameters of COVID-19 patients with hospitalization criteria that could predict referral to intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: Analyzing the clinical and biological profiles of COVID-19 patients at admission. Results: Among 99 consecutive patients that fulfilled criteria for hospitalization, 48 were hospitalized in the medicine department, 21 were first admitted to the medicine ward department and referred later to ICU, and 30 were directly admitted to ICU from the emergency department. At admission, patients requiring ICU were more likely to have lymphopenia, decreased SpO2, a D-dimer level above 1,000 ng/mL, and a higher high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (Hs-cTnI) level. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified Hs-cTnI above 9.75 pg/mL as the best predictive criteria for ICU referral [area under the curve (AUC), 86.4; 95% CI, 76.6-96.2]. This cutoff for Hs-cTnI was confirmed in univariate [odds ratio (OR), 22.8; 95% CI, 6.0-116.2] and multivariate analysis after adjustment for D-dimer level (adjusted OR, 20.85; 95% CI, 4.76-128.4).

Conclusion: Hs-cTnI appears to be the best relevant predictive factor for referring COVID-19 patients to ICU.

METHODS: A prospective cohort was developed with patients with PM, excluding those with aerodigestive trauma, inside a hospital COVID-19 dedicated hospital. Clinical variables including onset of symptoms, hemodynamic instability, associated complications, the need of interventions, and disease course were all recorded. Also, radiological findings such as the presence of the Macklin effect, extension of lung involvement by COVID-19, and characteristics of the PM were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with non-traumatic PM were followed, resulting in an overall incidence of 0.5% during the study period. Seven (33%) patients had associated pneumothorax and malignant/tension PM was observed in three (14%) cases. The Macklin effect could be found in 11 patients (52%) and the majority of them had more than 50% of lung involvement due to COVID-19. The mortality rate was 49%; however, no deaths were directly related to the PM.

This study aimed at screening a convenience sample in Germany during lockdown for perceived vulnerability to disease, knowledge about COVID-19, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and behavioral responses. In an online survey, 1358 participants completed the perceived vulnerability to disease scale (PVD), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4), and questionnaires on knowledge about COVID-19 and self-perceived change in behaviors in response to COVID-19. Lower and upper quartiles of the PVD were used to classify individuals into low and high PVD. A confirmatory factor analysis supported three factors representing risk, preventive and adaptive behavior as behavioral responses to COVID-19 lockdown. A structural equation model showed that the score of the knowledge scale significantly predicted the self-reported increase in adaptive and preventive behavior. The score in the PVD-subscale Perceived Infectability predicted a self-reported increase in preventive behavior, whereas the Germ Aversion score predicted a self-reported increase in preventive and a decrease in risk behavior.

Face masks have become increasingly accepted as one of the most effective means for combating the spread of the disease, when used in combination with social-distancing and frequent hand-washing. However, there is an increasing trend of people substituting regular cloth or surgical masks with clear plastic face shields, and with masks equipped with exhalation valves. One of the factors driving this increased adoption is improved comfort compared to regular masks. However, there is a possibility that widespread public use of these alternatives to regular masks could have an adverse effect on mitigation efforts. To help increase public awareness regarding the effectiveness of these alternative options, we use qualitative visualizations to examine the performance of face shields and exhalation valves in impeding the spread of aerosol-sized droplets. The visualizations indicate that although face shields block the initial forward motion of the jet, the expelled droplets can move around the visor with relative ease and spread out over a large area depending on light ambient disturbances. Visualizations for a mask equipped with an exhalation port indicate that a large number of droplets pass through the exhale valve unfiltered, which significantly reduces its effectiveness as a means of source control. Our observations suggest that to minimize the community spread of COVID-19, it may be preferable to use high quality cloth or surgical masks that are of a plain design, instead of face shields and masks equipped with exhale valves.","output":"Visualizing droplet dispersal for face shields and masks with exhalation valves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Minimally invasive laparoscopic surgical procedures are increasingly being used for the management of vesicoureteral reflux. OBJECTIVE We present our experience of the laparoscopic Politano-Leadbetter technique performed under pneumovesicum conditions, which allows an orthotopic ureteral location after vesicoureteral reflux correction. Our procedure recreates the new ureteric orifice in a normal anatomical position with potential less morbidity and better cosmesis. STUDY DESIGN Our series comprises ten cases. The three 5 mm ports were introduced through bladder wall under cystoscopic vision. A 5-0 monofilament traction suture was used and dissection was carried out. After the ureteral mobilization, the location of the new hiatus was selected in a straight line superior to the original orifice. Dissection of the submucosal tunnel was started from the new hiatus and advanced to the original hiatus and the ureter was gently drawn passed through the tunnel. The ureter was rolled up and muscle fibers were incised until ureter could freely move from the base of the new hiatus. Finally, after spatulation of the terminal part of the ureter, ureterovesical anastomosis was performed with intracorporeal suturing using 5-0 monofilament sutures. RESULTS The average operative time was 125 min, with an average of 93 min for unilateral and 133 min for bilateral reimplantation. Blood loss was minimal and drains were used selectively. Removal of urethral catheter was decided empirically after hematuria stopped. Mean catheterization time was 5.1 days. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 6.2 days. DISCUSSION This study had limitations: the small number of cases, follow-up period is relatively short and data on the pre-operative bladder capacity, catheter-related morbidity, pain control and cosmesis are lacking. But most cases showed positive clinical results including acceptable operating time and good resolution rate with minimal complication. Our Politano-Leadbetter transvesicoscopic ureteric reimplantation is safe and useful in the resolution of VUR, even though the laparoscopic ureteric reimplantation is technically demanding even for experienced pediatric surgeons. Considering the main advantages of endoscopic surgery, our new vesicoscopic technique could be an optional treatment to the open reimplantation and has merits because whole the procedure are performed within the bladder, so there is no risk of intraperitoneal organ injury. CONCLUSION Though the role of this new technique in the treatment of VUR remains to be determined, the technique could be an optional treatment to replace other surgical methods as a less invasive and effective therapeutic method.","output":"Initial experiences of laparoscopic intravesical detrusorraphy using the Politano-Leadbetter technique."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surfactants are multipurpose products found in most sectors of contemporary industry.

However, little is known about the association of perceived job insecurity with memory function and decline among older adults. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between perceived job insecurity and subsequent memory function and rate of memory decline among older adults in the US and England. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 10-year prospective population-based cohort study used data from the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) collected from 2006 to 2016. Participants included 9538 adults 55 years or older. Data were analyzed from August 1 to 31, 2021. EXPOSURES: Perceived job insecurity (yes vs no) at baseline. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Episodic memory z scores at baseline and rate of decline during the follow-up. RESULTS: Among the 9538 study participants, the mean (SD) age at baseline was 60.97 (6.06) years, and 4981 (52.22%) were women. A total of 2320 participants (24.32%) reported job insecurity at baseline (1088 of 3949 [27.55%] in England and 1232 of 5589 [22.04%] in the US). Perceived job insecurity after 55 years of age was associated with lower baseline memory z scores in the fully adjusted model ( = ?0.04 [95% CI, ?0.08 to ?0.01]) but not with rate of memory decline ( = 0.01 [95% CI, ?0.01 to 0.01]). The association appeared to be stronger in the US than in England (job insecurity  US,  = ?0.05 [95% CI, ?0.11 to 0.02]), but the estimate was imprecise, potentially owing to low statistical power. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this cohort study suggest that exposure to job insecurity in middle to late life was associated with worse memory function among older adults in the US and England.

This new epidemic caused a great mental reaction among the public. This study aimed to assess and compare the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety and depression among the public affected by quarantine and those unaffected during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data were collected using the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and the self-rating depression scale (SDS) administered to 1593 respondents aged 18 years and above. The respondents were grouped as 'affected group' and 'unaffected group' on the basis of whether they or their families/colleagues/classmates/neighbors had been quarantined. RESULTS Among 1593 participants, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was approximately 8.3% and 14.6%, respectively, and the prevalence in the affected group (12.9%, 22.4%) was significantly higher than that in the unaffected group (6.7%, 11.9%). Lower average household income, lower education level, having a higher self-evaluated level of knowledge, being more worried about being infected, having no psychological support, greater property damage, and lower self-perceived health condition were significant associated with higher scores on the SAS and SDS. People living in Chongqing had higher SAS and SDS scores than those living in Yunnan Province.

Cellular miRNAs may directly target virus to inhibit its infection and be developed as potential anti-virus drugs. METHODS: In this study, we established a broad-spectrum anti-IAV miRNA screening method using miRanda software. The screened miRNAs were further verified by luciferase assay, viral protein expression assay and virus replication assay. RESULTS: Five cellular miRNAs (miR-188-3p, miR-345-5p, miR-3183, miR-15-3p and miR-769-3p), targeting 99.96, 95.31, 92.9, 94.58 and 97.24% of human IAV strains recorded in NCBI, respectively, were chosen for further experimental verification.

New particle formation (NPF) is globally an important source of aerosols but its relevance especially towards aerosol mass loadings in highly polluted regions is still controversial. In addition, uncertainties remain regarding the processes leading to severe pollution episodes, concerning e.g. the role of atmospheric transport. In this study, we utilize air mass history analysis in combination with different fields related to the intensity of anthropogenic emissions in order to calculate air mass exposure to anthropogenic emissions (AME) prior to their arrival at Beijing, China. The AME is used as a semi-quantitative metric for describing the effect of air mass history on the potential for aerosol formation. We show that NPF events occur in clean air masses, described by low AME. However, increasing AME seems to be required for substantial growth of nucleation mode (diameter < 30 nm) particles, originating either from NPF or direct emissions, into larger mass-relevant sizes. This finding assists in establishing and understanding the connection between small nucleation mode particles, secondary aerosol formation and the development of pollution episodes. We further use the AME, in combination with basic meteorological variables, for developing a simple and easy-to-apply regression model to predict aerosol volume and mass concentrations. Since the model directly only accounts for changes in meteorological conditions, it can also be used to estimate the influence of emission changes on pollution levels. We apply the developed model to briefly investigate the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing. While no clear influence directly attributable to the lockdown measures is found, the results are in line with other studies utilizing more widely applied approaches.

METHODS: We sequenced the genomes from 916 SARS-CoV-2 strains from COVID-19 patients in our institute. The patients' demographic and clinical features were compared according to the infecting viral variant. RESULTS: From June 26th to August 14th, we identified a new viral variant (Marseille-1). Based on genome sequences (n = 89) or specific qPCR (n = 53), 142 patients infected with this variant were detected. It is characterized by a combination of 10 mutations located in the nsp2, nsp3, nsp12, S, ORF3a, ORF8 and N/ORF14 genes. We identified Senegal and Gambia, where the virus had been transferred from China and Europe in February-April as the sources of the Marseille-1 variant, which then most likely reached Marseille through Maghreb when French borders reopened. In France, this variant apparently remained almost limited to Marseille.

So the clinical symptoms pneumonia-confirmation is the turning point of the COVID-19 battle of Wuhan. The measure of clinical symptoms pneumonia-confirmation in Wuhan has delayed the growth and reduced size of the COVID-19 epidemic, decreased the peak number of the hospitalized cases by 96% in Wuhan. Our modeling also indicates that the earliest start date of COVID-19 in Wuhan may be Nov 2, 2019.?","output":"The effects of the clinical symptoms pneumonia-confirmation strategy of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), is a heterogeneous disease. Cell-of-origin classification in DLBCL has identified Activated B-cell (ABC) and Germinal Center B-Cell (GCB) as two major subtypes. ABC subtype patients show reduced overall survival with standard therapies. We report development of a qRT-PCR-based Lymphoma cell-of-origin (LCOO) assay to determine ABC, GCB, and Unclassifiable (UC) subtypes in formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPET) DLBCL samples. We trained the LCOO classifier on two DLBCL cohorts with validation done using an analytical grade assay in an independent cohort of 60 FFPET DLBCL samples. In the validation cohort, LCOO classification was 88.1%, 84.7%, and 84.7% concordant, respectively with microarray, Immunohistochemistry (Hans), and Lymphoma Subtyping Test (LST; NanoString Technologies, Inc. Seattle, WA, USA). Importantly, LCOO and LST assays commonly assigned subtypes in 17/18 (94.4%) ABC and 34/38 (89.5%) GCB DLBCL samples from this cohort. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of ABC and GCB subtypes, as classified by all platforms, were not significantly different in validation cohort. LCOO classification using publicly available microarray gene expression from two independent data sets (414 fresh frozen (FF) and 474 FFPET DLBCL biopsies) showed significantly worse outcome for ABC subtype compared to GCB subtype. In conclusion, a sensitive, reproducible, LCOO assay developed on an easy to standardize qRT-PCR platform could be an important clinical tool for DLCBL cell-of-origin classification.","output":"Molecular Subtyping of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Using a Novel Quantitative Reverse Transcription-polymerase Chain Reaction Assay."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article studies the Kosovo Government decision to restrict freedom of movement vis--vis freedom of gathering during the Covid-19 pandemic, a restriction which has directly affected religious freedoms and practices across multiple religions.

Methods: : A total of 73 patients, including 39 migraine and 34 controls, completed the study during the lockdown period. The patients were evaluated by using Structured Headache Questionnaire, PCL-5 and COVID -19 Phobia Scale via the telephone-based telemedicine method. Results: : Migraine patients had significantly lower scores in all subgroups of the COVID-19 Phobia Scale (mean = 42.33  12.67) than those in the healthy control group (mean = 52.88  13.18). PCL-5 scale scores in migraine patients were significantly lower (mean = 27.18  14.34) compared to the healthy controls (Mean = 34.03  14.36).

Teaching surgical skills has historically been a hands-on activity, with instructors and learners in close physical proximity. This paradigm was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring innovative solutions to surmount the challenges of teaching surgical skills remotely. In this work, we describe our institution's path and early results of developing an interactive remote surgical skills course for medical students in the surgical clerkship. Methods. 31 third-year medical students were distributed a set of surgical equipment and 3D printed phone dock. Each participant completed a baseline questionnaire and underwent 3 structured interactive remote sessions on surgical instruments, knot tying, and suturing techniques. Students were instructed on sharing their first-person viewpoint and received real-time feedback on their knot tying and suturing techniques from the course instructor. Pre- and post-session surveys were conducted and analyzed. Results. All students were able to complete the remote surgical skills course successfully, as defined by visually demonstrating successful two-handed knot and simple suture techniques. Students' aggregate confidence score in their knot tying ability (pretest mean 7.9, SD 0.7 vs posttest mean 9.7, SD 0.9, t-statistic -2.3, P = .03) and suturing ability (pretest mean 8.0, SD 1.3 vs posttest mean 13.8, SD 0.9 t-statistic -5.5, P < .001) significantly improved after the intervention. Qualitative feedback from the students underscored the utility of the first-person perspective for teaching surgical technique. Conclusion. This study demonstrates that remote teaching of knot tying and simple suturing to medical students can be effectively implemented using a remote learning curriculum that was well received by the learners.","output":"Development of an Interactive Remote Basic Surgical Skills Mini-Curriculum for Medical Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Clinical data suggest an aggravated COVID-19 disease course in cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) European guidelines advise to defer ICI therapy until complete resolution of COVID-19 However, mechanistic insight into how ICI impacts COVID-19 immunopathology is absent Methods: We performed single-cell RNA- and T-Cell Receptor-sequencing (TCR-seq) on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of COVID-19 pneumonia (n=19) and non-COVID pneumonia (n=10), and co-analyzed CD8+ T-cells with publicly available tumor-infiltrating T-cell data of treatment-na?ve and ICI-treated patients (Sade-Feldman, Cell, 2018;Lambrechts, Nat Med, 2018) Cell lineages were determined by trajectory inference (Slingshot, Monocle v2) and stratified per condition Pathogen- or tumor-directed T-cells were defined based on clonal selection (Zhang, Nature, 2018) To identify ICI responsive cells, we calculated a score derived from a validated gene set denoting ICI reactivity (Okamura, J Autoimmun, 2019) Results: We identified 3 CD8+ T-cell lineages, with Na?ve T-cells transitioning into Effector Memory cells and then branching into either Recently Activated Effector Memory (TEMRA), Exhausted (TEX) or Resident Memory (TRM) T-cells In COVID-19, clonal expansion indicating a SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific T-cell response, was mainly observed in the highly cytotoxic TEMRA lineage In contrast, tumor-specific T-cells were found in the TEX lineage Of importance, the ICI responsiveness score was significantly higher in the non-pathogen-directed TRM and TEX cells in COVID-19 In cancer, TEX cells were shown to be ICI responsive as expected [Formula presented] Conclusions: We are the first to provide a mechanistic rationale for an aggravated COVID-19 disease course in ICI-treated patients Whereas ICI reactivates tumor-directed exhausted T-cells in cancer, it preferentially potentiates non-pathogen-directed T-cells in COVID-19, thereby contributing to lung damage without boosting the antiviral immune response Clinical trial identification: In-depth Immunological Investigation of COVID-19 (COntAGIouS) - Clinical Trial identifier: NCT04327570 - Ethical approval obtained by the Ethics Committee of University Hospitals - KU Leuven File number S63881 Legal entity responsible for the study: University Hospitals - KU Leuven Funding: Kom op tegen Kanker (Stand up to Cancer) Disclosure: All authors have declared no conflicts of interest","output":"Keeping exhausted T-cells in check in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To analyse the reason and countermeasure for the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in health care workers, to provide reference for the health care workers to control infection of SARS.

We posit the discussion of religious and spiritual matters as a potential feature of religious life that may be helpful or harmful for dealing with the impacts of spiritual struggles. Purpose This study has two objectives. First, we assess the association between religious/spiritual struggles and both perceptions of psychological distress and self-rated health, affording attention to the prevalence of religious struggles during this time. Second, drawing from social penetration theory, we consider both the potential helpful and harmful role of discussing religion with friends and family members for the well-being of those experiencing various degrees of religious/spiritual struggles. Methods Using data from a nationally representative sample of Americans collected in January 2021, nearly a year after the onset of the pandemic (N = 1,711), we conduct a series of OLS and ordinal logistic regression models. Results Results suggest that religious/spiritual struggles were somewhat common among Americans during COVID-19 and were associated with greater psychological distress and worse perceived self-rated health during the pandemic. In the context of high R/S struggles, both psychological distress and perceived self-rated health were more favorable when religious and spiritual matters were discussed very frequently, several times a week or more. Unlike for psychological distress, however, we found no evidence that discussion of religious matters in the face of greater R/S struggles exacerbated their ill effect on health. Supplemental analyses showed that these findings are not being driven by religious denominational differences across our focal variables. Conclusions and implications Encouraged by discussions of faith with close network confidants, people experiencing R/S struggles might seek help in the form of counseling in both secular and/or religious settings. Exploring potential resilience factors, such as religious discussion, may help inform broader or more local strategies aimed at economic recovery. Our results therefore invite future investigation into the role of religious coping in mitigating the health effects of pandemic hardship.","output":"Religious/spiritual struggles and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic: Does talking religion help or hurt?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dynamic transportation networks have been analyzed for years by means of static graph-based indicators in order to study the temporal evolution of relevant network components, and to reveal complex dependencies that would not be easily detected by a direct inspection of the data.

Generalized pustular psoriasis mainly affects adults, with a female preponderance, but juvenile GPP also occurs. Flares are a hallmark of GPP and may occur de novo or be provoked by triggers, including withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids, infections, stress, pregnancy, and menstruation. Severity of flares varies widely between patients, and between flares in an individual patient. Significant flares are often accompanied by systemic symptoms, notably fever, general malaise, and extracutaneous manifestations such as arthritis, uveitis, and neutrophilic cholangitis. Common laboratory abnormalities include neutrophilia, elevated C-reactive protein levels, hypocalcemia, and abnormal liver function tests. The clinical course of GPP is highly variable; it can be a relapsing disease with recurrent flares and no pustulation between flares or a persistent disease with perpetual mild pustulation punctuated with flares of greater severity.

In 2019, the trade volume of kiwifruit reached 3.46 billion U.S. dollars. The major exporters include New Zealand, Italy, Belgium and Chile, and meanwhile, China, Japan, Belgium and Germany are playing important roles in importing. At the beginning of the 2020, the COVID-19 broke out in many countries one after another. What drove the world economy down was not simply virus itself, but a series of regulations came after. The epidemic led governments to issue lockdown order, which resulted in a chain reaction and global trade shrinking, and the kiwifruit market had been hit without exception. Farmers who got used to JIT mode suffered the impact from both the upstream and downstream of the supply chain. So far, the existing literatures in relative area mainly focus on the macro market level, in which they quote official data and make speculations base on facts. In the meanwhile, there is merely no analysis of specific industries nor has the quantitative analysis of trade data been made. As a result, our study aimed to understand the fluctuation of the kiwifruit trade volume due to the COVID- 19 worldwide in an empirical way. A time sequence model was built based on the dataset collected from FAO, UN database and customs website of relevant countries to get the monthly predicted trade value in 2020. We selected several most representative import and export countries for analysis, and the results showed that although the total value of kiwifruit trading witnessed a slight drop, the fluctuation was enormously varied from month to month. The most significant import rise appeared in China in February and March, reaching 2425% and 1380%, respectively. In March, the import value in Japan soared by 446% and the export value in New Zealand raised by 167%. In terms of regions, China experienced the raging virus and ushered in the dawn at the end of February. At the beginning of the epidemic, unprecedented strict lockdown measures made it hard to get commodities from international market, which explained the declining of import in January. In February, China's imports and exports had basically recovered to normal, so the import of kiwifruit surged in the next two months. Japan is another fat part in importing kiwifruit, and a small outbreak scale as well as the lack of domestic stocks explained the rise of importing before May. New Zealand is the largest exporter of kiwifruit in the world. Although it was less affected by the epidemic, the decline of global demand at the beginning of 2020 and the short of available labor in the second quarter may be main stumbling blocks ahead their way to export. All in all, the data from January to August reflected that the greater impact had imposed on Asia and Oceania than that on Europe, except the export value in Belgium. When talking about some of the worst affected nations, U.S. A, India and Brazil are the only three countries whose number of infections have exceeded 5 million. After comparing available trade data in 2020 with previous figures separately, we found that conspicuous ups and downs had reflected in those countries. Especially in June in U.S.A and September in India, the growth rate of import reached 100% and 103%, respectively. The huge fluctuations are considered to have connection with disrupted global supply chain, hindered labor mobility, plunging global demand, the rise of trade protectionism as well as the time lag between the spread of the virus among countries. However, as those problems were prominent in North America and Europe attributed to the increasingly serious epidemic, the kiwifruit trade in those two markets may be severely affected in the future. China is one of the very first countries to emerge from the shadow of the COVID-19, which provides an opportunity for Chinese kiwifruit industry to develop the good fruit quality and seize the global market share. As the world's largest producer and importer of kiwifruit, China owned more than 1 2 thousand hectares kiwifruit orchards and yielded more than 2 million tones fruit in 2019. In the same year, China spent more than $450 million in importing kiwifruit, which made it the biggest kiwifruit buyer in international market. Although China's kiwifruit market has huge throughput, its domestic fruit needs to face problems like uneven product quality, low average profit margin and low unit output. In order to settle current problems, we came up with three suggestions: Firstly, strengthen the integration of industry and academia, and tap into regional dominant varieties;Secondly, increase government support in multiple ways in order to build a thorough export system;Finally, construct closer cooperation in worldwide and conform to international standards. All of them are intended to improve the industry of Chinese kiwifruit better and healthier by not only using the existing advantages but also exploring new ways. ? 2021, Office of Journal of the Fruit Science.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 79-year-old male person was admitted to the emergency department due to a worsening of his general health state expressed by weakness, fatigue and anorexia. Vital signs and clinical findings were normal, in particular the patient was considered to be euvolemic. Laboratory investigations revealed a serum sodium of 117 mmol/L, a serum osmolality of 241 mosm/kg and a urea of 1.2 mmol/L with creatinine within normal range. Urine chemistry showed a urine osmolality of 412 mosm/kg and urine sodium of 110 mmol/L. TSH, C-reactive protein, and basal cortisol levels were normal. Under therapy with balanced crystalloid fluids, hyponatremia worsened and in absence of diuretic medications, diagnosis of SIADH was made. Since fluid restriction was not sufficiently effective, oral urea was administered. Under this therapy regimen hyponatremia resolved.

This review describes the application of self-assembly process for the production of peptide-based vaccine candidates and the ability of these nanostructures to stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses.","output":"The application of self-assembled nanostructures in peptide-based subunit vaccine development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Previous studies have showed clinical characteristics of patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the evidence of person-to-person transmission. Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Methods: Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. Findings: None of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms before nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue and etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and five (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining seven (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These seven cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P = 0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Interpretation: The asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.","output":"Clinical Characteristics of 24 Asymptomatic Infections with COVID-19 Screened among Close Contacts in Nanjing, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding how efforts to limit exposure to COVID-19 have altered electricity demand provides insights not only into how dramatic restrictions shape electricity demand but also about future electricity use in a post-COVID-19 world. We develop a unified modeling framework to quantify and compare electricity usage changes in 58 countries and regions around the world from January-May 2020. We find that daily electricity demand declined as much as 10% in April 2020 compared to modelled demand, controlling for weather, seasonal and temporal effects, but with significant variation. Clustering techniques show that four impact groups capture systematic differences in timing and depth of electricity usage changes, ranging from a mild decline of 2% to an extreme decline of 26%. These groupings do not align with geography, with almost every continent having at least one country or region that experienced a dramatic reduction in demand and one that did not. Instead, we find that such changes relate to government restrictions and mobility. Government restrictions have a non-linear effect on demand that generally saturates at its most restrictive levels and sustains even as restrictions ease. Mobility offers a sharper focus on electricity demand change with workplace and residential mobility strongly linked to demand changes at the daily level. Steep declines in electricity usage are associated with workday hourly load patterns that resemble pre-COVID weekend usage. Quantifying these impacts is a crucial first step in understanding the impacts of crises like the pandemic and the associated societal response on electricity demand.","output":"Power and the Pandemic: Exploring Global Changes in Electricity Demand During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are standard techniques of forecasting the spread of pandemics.

We have seen that instead of taking data of all 60 days together, a better picture of uncertainty can be observed if we consider the data separately in three equal parts from June 23 to July 12, from July 13 to August 1, and from August 2 to August 21. For that we would first need to ascertain that the current spread pattern in India is almost exponential. Thereafter we shall show that the data regarding the total number of cases in India are not really behaving in an expected way, making forecasting the time to peak very difficult.

To palliate this need, our team recently developed and evaluated the initial acceptability of a dyadic, Tailored, wEb-based, psychosocial, and physical activity self-Management PrOgram (TEMPO). TEMPO is a 10-week, interactive, web-based intervention consisting of five modules designed to help dyads manage their physical and psychosocial needs. It aims to teach dyads new self-management strategies and encourages them to increase their physical activity (PA) levels, mainly through walking and strength-based exercises. Initial acceptability evaluation of TEMPO revealed high user satisfaction, in addition to having a number of potential benefits for participants. After integrating suggested changes to TEMPO, the proposed pilot study aims to further test the acceptability and feasibility of TEMPO. METHODS: This study is a multicenter, stratified, parallel, two-group, pilot randomized control trial (RCT), where patientCcaregiver dyads are randomized (stratified by anxiety level) to receive (a) TEMPO or (b) usual care. Participants (n goal = 40) are recruited across Canada at participating cancer centers and through self-referral (e.g., online recruitment). Patient inclusion criteria are (a) having received prostate cancer treatment within the past 2 years or scheduled to receive treatment, (b) identified a primary caregiver willing to participate in the study, and (c) has access to the Internet. Eligible caregivers are those identified by the patient as his primary source of support. Dyads complete a baseline questionnaire (T1) and another one 3 months later (T2) assessing various aspects of physical and emotional functioning (e.g., the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)), self-management behaviors (e.g., the Health Education Impact Questionnaire (heiQ)), physical activity (the International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ) and the Multidimensional Self-efficacy for Exercise Scale (MSES)), and dyadic coping (the Dyadic Coping Inventory (DCI)). Dyads that used TEMPO are also asked to participate in a semi-structured exit interview exploring their overall experience with the program.

This study explored the application of a combined visible and thermal image processing approach that uses a CMOS camera equipped with IRT to remotely sense multiple vital signs and screen patients with suspected infectious diseases. METHODS: An IRT system that produced visible and thermal images was used for image acquisition. The subjects respiration rates were measured by monitoring temperature changes around the nasal areas on thermal images; facial skin temperatures were measured simultaneously. Facial blood circulation causes tiny color changes in visible facial images that enable the determination of the heart rate. A logistic regression discriminant function predicted the likelihood of infection within 10 s, based on the measured vital signs. Sixteen patients with an influenza-like illness and 22 control subjects participated in a clinical test at a clinic in Fukushima, Japan. RESULTS: The vital-sign-based IRT screening system had a sensitivity of 87.5% and a negative predictive value of 91.7%; these values are higher than those of conventional fever-based screening approaches.

Understanding the molecular pathways of severe COVID-19 opens the door for novel therapeutic design. We summarize the current insights into pathology, risk factors, secondary infections, genetics, omics, and drugs being tested to treat severe COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate a new platelet assays (Anysis-Epinephrine, Anysis-ADP) and to compare them with PFA-200 in cardiology visiting patients and inpatients. METHODS: Citrated blood samples were collected from 184 patients for ADP test and 163 patients for EPI test, who visited Korea University Guro Hospital with written consent. The PFA-200 assay gives a test result the closure time (CT) until the blood flow rate decreases to 10% of the initial value, whereas Anysis-200 assay does a blood flow migration distance (MD) until blood flow completely stops. According to the results of PFA closure time (CT), the tested samples were classified as either negative control or positive group. The measurements were simultaneously conducted with two devices and compared. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of Anysis-200 C/EPI kit in comparison to PFA-200 C/EPI kit was 87.5% and 85.7%, respectively. Regarding C/ADP kit, the sensitivity and specificity of Anysis-200 was 96.9% and 87.5%, respectively. In addition, the sums of sensitivity and specificity are greater than 150% for both of EPI and ADP. Also, it was found that likelihood ratio and odd ratio for each assay provide useful additional information. Since the Cohens kappa coefficients value between the two devices was relatively high, the equivalence between the two devices was confirmed.

However, few studies have addressed LC sequelae on brain functions. This study was aimed to examine if acute symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) would persist during LC, and if memory problems would be correlated with sleep, depressive mood, or anxious complaints. METHODS: Our work followed a cohort of 236 patients from two public hospitals of the Federal District in mid-western Brazil. Patients interviews checked for clinical symptoms during acute and LC (5C8 months after real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, RT-qPCR). RESULTS: Most cases were non-hospitalized individuals (86.3%) with a median age of 41.2 years. While myalgia (50%), hyposmia (48.3%), and dysgeusia (45.8%) were prevalent symptoms in acute phase, fatigue (21.6%) followed by headache (19.1%) and myalgia (16.1%) commonly occurred during LC. In LC, 39.8% of individuals reported memory complaints, 36.9% felt anxious, 44.9% felt depressed, and 45.8% had sleep problems.

We undertook this study to evaluate and compare cost of care and reimbursement with robotic versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS AND PROCEDURES The charges and reimbursement of all robotic and laparoscopic cholecystectomies at one hospital undertaken from June 2012 to June 2013 were determined. Operative duration is defined as time into and time out of the operating room. Data are presented as median data. Comparisons were undertaken using the Mann-Whitney U-test with significance accepted at p  0.05. RESULTS Robotic cholecystectomy took longer (47 min longer) and had greater charges ($8,182.57 greater) than laparoscopic cholecystectomy (p < 0.05 for each). However, revenue, earnings before depreciation, interest, and taxes (EBDIT), and Net Income were not impacted by approach. CONCLUSIONS Relative to laparoscopic cholecystectomy, robotic cholecystectomy takes longer and has greater charges. Revenue, EBDIT, and Net Income are similar after either approach; this indicates that costs with either approach are similar. Notably, this is possible because much of hospital-based costs are determined by cost allocation and not cost accounting. Thus, the cost of longer operations and costs inherent to the robotic approach for cholecystectomy do not translate to a perceived financial burden.","output":"Does the cost of robotic cholecystectomy translate to a financial burden?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are small DNA viruses carried by diverse vertebrates. The evolutionary relationships of viruses and hosts remain largely unclear due to very limited surveillance in sympatric communities. In order to investigate whether PyVs can transmit among different mammalian species and to identify host-switching events in the field we conducted a systematic study of a large collection of bats (n=1,083) from 29 sympatric communities across China which contained multiple species with frequent contact. PyVs were detected in 21 bat communities with 192 PyVs identified in 186 bats from 15 species within 6 families representing at least 28 newly-described PyVs. Surveillance results and phylogenetic analyses surprisingly revealed three inter-family PyV host-switching events in these sympatric bat communities: two distinct PyVs were identified in two bat species in restricted geographical locations, while another PyV clustered phylogenetically with PyVs carried by bats from a different host family. Virus-host relationships of all discovered PyVs were also evaluated and no additional host-switching events were found. PyVs were identified in different horseshoe bat species in sympatric communities without observation of host-switching events, showed high genomic identities, clustered with each other. This suggested that even for PyVs with high genomic identities in closely-related host species, the potential for host-switching is low. In summary, our findings revealed that PyV host-switching in sympatric bat communities can occur but is limited, and host-switching events of bat-borne PyVs are relatively rare on the predominantly evolutionary background of co-divergence with their hosts.ImportanceSince the discovery of murine polyomavirus in the 1950s, polyomaviruses (PyVs) have been considered highly host-restricted in mammals. Sympatric bat communities commonly contain several different bat species in an ecological niche facilitating viral transmission, and therefore represent a model to identify host-switching events of PyVs. In this study, we screened PyVs in a large number of bats in sympatric communities from diverse habitats across China. We provide evidence that cross-species bat-borne PyV transmission exists, though is limited and that host-switching events appear relatively rare during the evolutionary history of these viruses. PyVs with close genomic identities were also identified in different bat species without host-switching events. Based on these findings, we propose an evolutionary scheme for bat-borne PyVs in which limited host-switching events occur on the background of co-divergence and lineage duplication generating the viral genetic diversity in bats.","output":"Extensive genetic diversity of polyomaviruses in sympatric bat communities: host-switching versus co-evolution."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiological characteristics of human infection with COVID-19 in Moscow, Lima, Kuwait and Singapore, to analyze the effects of climate factors on the incidence of COVID-19.

Once activated, they are able to fulfil numerous tasks to fight inflammatory insults while keeping a balanced immune response. Besides well-known functions, such as phagocytosis and degranulation, neutrophils are also able to release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). In response to most stimuli, the neutrophils release decondensed chromatin in a NADPH oxidase-dependent manner decorated with histones and granule proteins, such as neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase, and cathelicidins. Although primarily supposed to prevent microbial dissemination and fight infections, there is increasing evidence that an overwhelming NET response correlates with poor outcome in many diseases. Lung-related diseases especially, such as bacterial pneumonia, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, aspergillosis, influenza, and COVID-19, are often affected by massive NET formation. Highly vascularized areas as in the lung are susceptible to immunothrombotic events promoted by chromatin fibers. Keeping this fragile equilibrium seems to be the key for an appropriate immune response. Therapies targeting dysregulated NET formation might positively influence many disease progressions. This review highlights recent findings on the pathophysiological influence of NET formation in different bacterial, viral, and non-infectious lung diseases and summarizes medical treatment strategies.","output":"A Fragile Balance: Does Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formation Drive Pulmonary Disease Progression?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mainstreaming biodiversity in production landscapes ensures conservation and sustainable use of agricultural biodiversity, the key objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the projects supported by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) Global Environment Facility (GEF) Mainstreaming integrates biodiversity in existing or new programs and policies, both cross\\\\sectoral and sector\\\\specific The conventional model of agricultural production with limited diversity in production systems and use of high chemical input has taught us a valuable lesson as it is adversely impacting the environment, the essential ecosystem services, the soil health and the long term sustainability of our food systems Using a qualitative participant observation approach, our study investigated four distinct traditional Indian production landscapes to gage (i) the farming communities response to institutional policies, programs and agricultural biodiversity\\\\related activities in traditional Indian production landscapes and (ii) opportunities and challenges for sustainable development in smallholder traditional Indian farming systems Results indicate that the top\\\\down decision\\\\making regime is the least effective towards achieving sustainable development in traditional Indian farming landscapes and that farmers experiential knowledge on participatory biodiversity management, maintenance and use for sustainable development are of critical importance to Indias agriculture and economy Reclaiming agricultures spiritual roots through organic farming and locally grown food emerged as key, including the need for designing and implementing a more sovereign food system Revisiting traditional smallholder farming under the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and lessons learned for repurposing Indias agricultural policy are also highlighted ? 2020 by the authors Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland","output":"Mainstreaming agricultural biodiversity in traditional production landscapes for sustainable development: The Indian scenario"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We explore the realized alpha-performance heterogeneity in green and brown stocks' universes using the peer performance ratios of Ardia and Boudt (2018).

Safety and short-term angiographic effectiveness of this device have recently been reported. However, long-term angiographic results are lacking. We report herein the 18 months' angiographic outcome in patients treated for a wide-neck intracranial aneurysm with the MED. MATERIALS AND METHODS Nineteen patients (17 female, mean age 50 years) with 20 wide-neck intracranial aneurysms (six ruptured; 14 unruptured) were treated by the MED between January 2015 and June 2016. Procedure-related complications were systematically recorded; discharge and 6-9 months' follow-up modified Rankin Scale scores were assessed. Angiographic mid-term and long-term follow-up were performed with a mean delay of 6.41.5 months (n=16 aneurysms) and 17.74.2 months (n=15 aneurysms), respectively. Occlusion rates were evaluated after the procedure and at the mid-term and long-term follow-up using the Roy-Raymond scale. RESULTS Embolization with the MED was feasible in all except two cases (2/20, 10%). One per-procedural perforation was recorded (1/20, 5%) and one MED deployment failed because of the aneurysm's shape (1/20, 5%). Three cases of thromboembolic complications were observed (3/20, 15%). Only one thromboembolic complication was responsible for clinical sequelae. Grade A occlusion rate was 61% (11/18) after the procedure, 75% at 6 months' follow-up (12/16), and 80% (12/15) at long-term follow-up. Two cases (2/18, 11%) of recanalization at mid-term were documented angiographically. No recanalization occurred between the mid-term and long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION MED is a hybrid embolization device, combining properties of a conventional coil with those of an intrasaccular flow disrupter. Our series focusing on long-term angiographic follow-up shows a satisfactory long-term occlusion rate. Larger series with longer angiographic follow-up times are warranted to confirm these preliminary results.","output":"Medina embolization device for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms: 18 months' angiographic results."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The theory of social conditions as fundamental causes of health, in conjunction with the notions of social class and territory, is used in reflections about the trajectory and distribution of the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country It starts with theoretical syntheses, approaches and evidences from the authors works on health inequality in Brazil It is understood that the social environment, of a relational and structured nature, affects the spread and distribution of the disease among the groups Class differences in circumstances of work, location and housing are mentioned Regarding social differences in the risk of fatal outcome of the disease, the previous distribution of adverse conditions and differences in the way health institutions process people are considered As proposed by the theory, inequalities in resources, information, dispositions and capacity would be affecting the social distribution of the effects of the pandemic in Brazil","output":"[COVID-19, fundamental causes, social class and territory Covid-19, causas fundamentais,classe social e territrio]/ COVID-19, fundamental causes, social class and territory Covid-19, causas fundamentales, clase social y territorio"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to their robust immunomodulatory capabilities, mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) have been used as a cellular therapy for a number of human diseases.

Although HCoV-specific drugs are still lacking, many potent targets for drug discovery are being explored, and many vigorously designed clinical trials are being carried out in an orderly manner. The aim of this review was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current status of drug development against HCoVs, particularly severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). MAIN TEXT: A scoping review was conducted by electronically searching research studies, reviews, and clinical trials in PubMed and the CNKI. Studies on HCoVs and therapeutic drug discovery published between January 2000 and October 2020 and in English or Chinese were included, and the information was summarized. Of the 3248 studies identified, 159 publication were finally included. Advances in drug development against HCoV, especially SARS-CoV-2, are summarized under three categories: antiviral drugs aimed at inhibiting the HCoV proliferation process, drugs acting on the host's immune system, and drugs derived from plants with potent activity. Furthermore, clinical trials of drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 are summarized. CONCLUSIONS: During the spread of COVID-19 outbreak, great efforts have been made in therapeutic drug discovery against the virus, although the pharmacological effects and adverse reactions of some drugs under study are still unclear. However, well-designed high-quality studies are needed to further study the effectiveness and safety of these potential drugs so as to provide valid recommendations for better control of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Human coronaviruses and therapeutic drug discovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since early 2020, the world suffers from a new beta-coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, that has devastating effects globally due to its associated disease, Covid-19. Until today, Covid-19, which not only causes life-threatening lung infections but also impairs various other organs and tissues, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and caused irreparable damage to many others. Since the very onset of the pandemic, huge efforts were made worldwide to fully understand this virus and numerous studies were, and still are, published. Many of these deal with structural analyses of the viral spike glycoprotein and with vaccine development, antibodies and antiviral molecules or immunomodulators that are assumed to become essential tools in the struggle against the virus. This paper summarizes knowledge on the properties of the four structural proteins (spike protein S, membrane protein M, envelope protein E and nucleocapsid protein N) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its relatives, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, that emerged few years earlier. Moreover, attention is paid to ways to analyze such proteins using freely available bioinformatic tools and, more importantly, to bring these proteins alive by looking at them on a computer/laptop screen with the easy-to-use but highly performant and interactive molecular graphics program DeepView. It is hoped that this paper will stimulate non-bioinformaticians and non-specialists in structural biology to scrutinize these and other macromolecules and as such will contribute to establishing procedures to fight these and maybe other forthcoming viruses.","output":"Scrutinizing Coronaviruses Using Publicly Available Bioinformatic Tools: The Viral Structural Proteins as a Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue antiviral drug developed for Ebola, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of COVID-19. However, the findings of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies vary regarding the effectiveness of remdesivir. We aimed to comprehensively review the available evidence identify the effectiveness and safety of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. Methods: : Seven databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Wanfang database, SinoMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and Chinese Science Journal Database) were searched for literatures published until November 2020.Following the PRISMA flow diagram, we included RCTs and prospective observational studies that reported the effectiveness and safety of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. With extracting study details, as well as patient characteristics and outcomes, data were meta-analyzed by using Review Manager software version 5.4.1. Meta-analyses were conducted with fixed-effect model or random-effect model to calculate risk ratio (RR). Results: : Four studies involving 2,279 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with placebo, 10-day remdesivir was associated with significant increased clinical improvement on days 14 and 28 with RR 1.19 (95%CI 1.09-1.30) and RR 1.09 (95%CI 1.03-1.16). The clinical improvement of 5-day remdesivir was better than 10-day remdesivir on days 7 with RR 1.20 (95%CI 1.02-1.41), but the efficacy advantage of 5-day remdesivir disappeared on days 14 (RR 1.08;95%CI 0.90-1.29). Remdesivir was associated with lower serious adverse events rates and grade 3 or 4 adverse events rates as compared with placebo with RR 0.75(95%CI 0.63-0.89) and RR 0.89(95%CI 0.80-0.99). Compared with 10-day remdesivir, 5-day remdesivir for patients with COVID-19 decreased the risk of serious adverse events rates and grade 3 or 4 adverse events rates with RR 0.65(95%CI 0.47-0.88) and RR 0.74 (95%CI 0.58-0.95). Conclusions: : Our meta-analysis suggested that remdesivir would increase clinical improvement conditions and decrease serious adverse events on patients with COVID-19. 5-day remdesivir had the similar clinical effectiveness and mortality with 10-day remdesivir, and had lower serious adverse events rate. Comprehensive considering the cost and benefit, 5-day remdesivir may be a better therapeutic option if available medical resources are limited.","output":"Effectiveness and Safety of Remdesivir in Patients with COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Appropriate interfacility transfers are a key component of highly functioning trauma systems but transfer of unsalvageable patients can overburden the resources of higher-level centers. We sought to identify the occurrence and associated reasons for futile transfers within our trauma system. METHODS Using prospectively collected data from our system database, a retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify patients who underwent interfacility transfer to our American College of Surgeons level I center. Adult patients from June 2017 to June 2019 who died, had comfort measures implemented, were discharged, or went to hospice care within 48 hours of admission without significant operation, procedure, or radiologic intervention were examined. Futility was defined as resulting in death or hospice discharge within 48 hours of transfer without major operative, endoscopic, or radiologic intervention. RESULTS A total of 1,241 patients transferred to our facility during the study period. Four hundred seven patients had a length of stay less than or equal to 48 hours. Eighteen (1.5%) met the criteria for futility. The most common reason for transfer in the futile population was traumatic brain injury (56%) and need for neurosurgical capabilities (62%). Futile patients had a median age and Injury Severity Score of 75 and 21. The main transportation method was ground 9 (50%) with 8 (44.4%) being transported by helicopter and 1 (5.6%) being transported by both. Combining transport costs with hospital charges, each futile transfer was estimated to cost US $56,396 (interquartile range, 41,889-106,393) with a total cost exceeding US $1.7 million. With an estimated 33,000 interfacility transfers annually for trauma in the United States, the cost of futile transfers to the American trauma system would exceed 27 million dollars each year. CONCLUSION Futile transfers represent a small but costly portion transfer volume. Identification of patients whose conditions preclude the benefit of transfer due to futility and development of appropriate support for referral will significantly improve appropriate allocation of health care resources.

This article searched articles in PubMed with the following keywords: stem cells, exosomes, angiogenesis, ischemic diseases either alone or in grouping form. The most relevant selected items were stem cell-derived exosomes and ischemic diseases. A growing body of evidence indicates that stem cells produce exosomes, which is the novel emerging approach to cell-to-cell communication and offers a new standpoint on known therapeutic strategies of ischemic diseases. Exosomes transport biological molecules such as many types of proteins, RNAs, DNA fragments, signaling molecules, and lipids between cells. Different stem cells release exosomes representing beneficial effects on ischemic diseases as they promote angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Application of exosomes for therapeutic angiogenesis opened new opportunities in the regenerative medicine, however, some limitations regarding exosomes isolation and application remain concerned. In addition, most of the experiments were conducted in preclinical and therefore translation of these results from bench to bed requires more effort in this field.

We aimed to study the role of inflammatory markers, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), in predicting infection, blood culture positivity, and short-term (1 month) mortality in hospitalized cirrhotic patients. METHODS: This prospective study was done over a period of 14 months (October 2017 to November 2018). Patient data included age, gender, etiology of cirrhosis, reason for admission, and comorbidity. Laboratory tests included blood chemistry and blood cell counts, and blood and urine culture. The specific tests included were CRP and NLR. Survival of patients in the following 1 month was noted. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, diagnostic accuracy were calculated and logistic regression analysis performed. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Two hundred and eight patients formed the study cohort. The median age was 51.5 years and male predominance was noted. Alcohol-related liver disease (49%) was the commonest etiology. The infection rate was 62%, culture positivity was 58.5%, and mortality was 30.8%. NLR and CRP were significantly higher in those with documented infection (culture positive or negative) and among nonsurvivors. Optimal cutoffs for NLR and CRP to predict infection were 5.86 and 33.7, respectively. The risk of having an infection was 7.5 times and about 15 times if NLR and CRP were above the cutoffs. The risk of 1-month mortality was 2-3 times higher if patients had NLR and CRP above the cutoffs. The combination of NLR and CRP (&#8805; 5.86 and &#8805; 33.7, respectively) increased specificity and diagnostic accuracy for infection.

We present a review of various benefits of 3DP particularly in emergency situations such as a pandemic. Furthermore, some relevant iterative design and 3DP case studies are discussed systematically. Finally, this article highlights the areas that can help to control the emergency situation such as a pandemic, and critically discusses the research gaps that need further research in order to exploit the full potential of 3DP in pandemic and post-pandemic future era.","output":"The rise of 3D Printing entangled with smart computer aided design during COVID-19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Indian cities attract a considerable number of low-income migrants from marginal rural households experiencing difficult economic, political and social conditions at home Based on fieldwork in Jalandhar and Guwahati, this article focuses on the precarity of low-income migrants in Indian cities It argues that the concept of precarity, used in the context of migrant labour, should be extended to capture multiple and reinforcing forms of vulnerability, examining the relationship between structural inequalities, including difficult conditions at home, exclusion from public services and poor access to justice It puts forward a proposition that the widespread media representations of migrant workers returning home in the context of COVID-19 are not simply a result of the sudden outbreak of the coronavirus but that these journeys must be seen as part of the history of the circulatory system of labour","output":"COVID-19 and the Precarity of Low-income Migrant Workers in Indian Cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has taken the world by surprise;even the most sophisticated healthcare systems have been unable to cope with the volume of patients and lack of resources Yet the gradual spread of the virus in Lebanon has allowed healthcare facilities critical time to prepare Simulation is the most practical avenue not only for preparing the staff but also for troubleshooting systems latent safety threats (LSTs) and for understanding these challenges via Hollnagels safety ICII approaches This is a quality improvement initiative: daily in situ simulations were conducted across various departments at the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC), a tertiary medical care center in Beirut, Lebanon These simulations took place in the hospital with native multidisciplinary teams of 3C5 members followed by debriefing with good judgment using the modified PEARLS (Promoting Excellence and Reflective Learning in Simulation) for systems integration All participants completed the simulation effectiveness tool (SET-M) to assess the simulation Debriefings were analyzed qualitatively for content based on the Safety Model and LST identification, and the SET-Ms were analyzed quantitatively Twenty-two simulations have been conducted with 131 participants SET-M results showed that the majority (78C87%) strongly agreed to the effectiveness of the intervention We were able to glean several clinical and human factor safety ICII components and LSTs such as overall lack of preparedness and awareness of donning/doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE), delayed response time, lack of experience in rapid sequence intubation, inability to timely and effectively assign roles, and lack of situational awareness On the other hand, teams quickly recognized the patients clinical status and often communicated effectively This intervention allowed us to detect previously unrecognized LSTs, prepare our personnel, and offer crucial practical hands-on experience for an unprecedented healthcare crisis","output":"In-situ simulations for COVID-19: a safety II approach towards resilient performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Empirical data on the consequences of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on HIV care are lacking. We surveyed people living with HIV (PLWH) in different countries to investigate whether their medical follow-up and psychosocial well-being had been compromised due to COVID-19 and associated restrictions. METHODS: In April 2020, a cross-sectional survey among PLWH was conducted using a web-based multilingual questionnaire. The research tool assessed HIV follow-up, psychosocial well-being, COVID-19 (flu-like) symptoms and prevention measures. Consenting respondents provided answers anonymously. RESULTS: Three hundred seventeen PLWH were included (mean age 43.4  11.7; 71.6% men); 60.3% of participants resided in Belgium and Brazil. One hundred forty (44.2%) reported experiencing a cold with at least one flu-like symptom since January 2020. Of the 18 who reported COVID-19 test results, 4 (22.2%) were positive. Seventy-four (23.3%) respondents screened positive for major depressive disorders, whereas 72 (22.7%) had generalized anxiety disorders. Fifty-six (17.7%) respondents reported difficulties in obtaining antiretroviral medications because of COVID-19-related measures. Adaptations of HIV care during the COVID-19 outbreak included greater quantities of antiretroviral refill in 67 (21.1%), phone consultations in 25 (7.9%), and new refill sites in 12 (3.9%). Factors associated with a reduced risk of experiencing flu-like symptoms included flu vaccination during the past 12 months (P = 0.005) and adaptations of HIV care during the COVID-19 pandemic (P = 0.010). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 and associated restrictive measures seem detrimental to the well-being and follow-up of PLWH. We recommend that health systems devise innovative approaches for antiretroviral provision and psychosocial support to PLWH during such outbreaks.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Medical Follow-up and Psychosocial Well-Being of People Living With HIV: A Cross-Sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Central venous catheter (CVC) for hemodialysis are frequently implanted to the internal jugular vein.

METHODS All study subjects were diagnosed with incarcerated obturator hernia, preoperatively and TEP was performed as for TEP groin hernia repair. The incarcerated intestine was retracted into the peritoneal cavity with the hernia sac. The obturator foramen was then covered with a rectangular mesh (9  13 cm), which also covered the internal inguinal ring, Hesselbach's triangle, and the femoral ring. Non-ischemia of the incarcerated bowel was confirmed laparoscopically. In patients undergoing laparotomy, the obturator foramen was closed by continuous sutures, and no prosthesis was used. We recorded the length of hospital stay, operative time, amount of intraoperative bleeding, and postoperative complications. RESULTS Twenty-two patients underwent obturator hernia repair in our hospital between January 2000 and December 2012, of whom 10 were treated with laparotomy and the remaining 12 via TEP. Three patients undergoing TEP were converted to laparotomy. The operation time was significantly longer in the conversion group compared with either the laparotomy or the TEP groups. There was no difference between the laparotomy and TEP groups regarding intraoperative bleeding. Patients who underwent TEP without conversion had a significantly shorter hospital stay than those who underwent laparotomy or required conversion.

Emerging evidence suggests that the leptin receptor (LepR) signaling system, residing within the agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons of the hypothalamus, critically contributes to obesogenic feeding, nutrient partitioning, and energy metabolism. However, the neural circuit mechanism underlying the leptin-dependent control of obesogenic feeding and energy balance remains largely elusive. Here, we show that two distinct subgroups of LepR-expressing AgRP neurons send non-collateral, GABAergic projections to the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) and to the medial part of the medial preoptic nucleus (MPO) for the differential control of metabolic homeostasis and obesogenic feeding, respectively. We found that the AgRPLepR-DMH neural circuit plays a significant role in leptin-dependent control of metabolic homeostasis through the 3-containing GABAA receptor signaling on the melanocortin 4 receptor neurons within the DMH (MC4RDMH). In contrast, the AgRPLepR-MPO neural circuit elicits dominant effects on the appetitive response to high-fat diet through the 2-containing GABAA receptors on the MC4RMPO neurons. Consistent with these behavioral results, the post-synaptic GABAA neurons located within the DMH and MPO displayed differentiated firing responses under various feeding and nutrient conditions. Our results demonstrate that these novel GABAergic neural circuits exert differentiated control of metabolic hemostasis and obesogenic feeding via distinct post-synaptic targets of leptin-responsive AgRP neurons. The findings of two genetically and anatomically distinct GABAA receptor signaling pathways within the DMH and MPO would undoubtedly accelerate the development of targeted, individualized, anti-obesity therapy.","output":"Reversal of obesogenic feeding and hypometabolism by a bifurcating GABAergic neural circuit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mokola virus (MOKV) appears to be exclusive to Africa.

The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature related to exercise timing, relative to meal consumption, and glycemic control in individuals with T2DM. METHODS Systematic searches in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov Registry databases were performed to identify articles published in English from inception to October 2017. Two authors independently extracted data and evaluated the quality of studies using the Cochrane Collaboration Data Collection Form and the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Assessment Tool, respectively. A qualitative synthesis was performed on the included studies, and results summarized in tables. RESULTS Nineteen randomized controlled trials with a total of 346 participants were included. Improvements in glycemia (glucose concentrations and glucose area under the curve) and insulin area under the curve appeared more consistent when exercise was performed during the postmeal period as compared with the premeal period; however, this observation was largely based on indirect comparisons between studies. CONCLUSIONS There is some evidence from randomized controlled trials that exercise performed 30 min after meal consumption may convey greater improvements in glycemic control for individuals with T2DM. However, there are only two studies that have directly assessed the role of exercise timing on glycemic management, and adopted methodologies are heterogeneous. Future low-risk trials in this field are warranted.","output":"Exercise Timing in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly emerged to seriously threaten public health.

Methods: To evaluate the causal associations between various white blood cell traits and severe COVID-19, we conducted a two-sample MR analysis with summary statistics from recent large genome-wide association studies. Results: Our MR results indicated potential causal associations of white blood cell count, myeloid white blood cell count, and granulocyte count with severe COVID-19, with odds ratios (OR) of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.72-0.98), 0.81 (95% CI: 0.70-0.94), and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.71-0.99), respectively. Increasing eosinophil percentage of white blood cells was associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.03-1.45).

We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to study 9 virus groups, including 16 different viruses or viral strains, in 56 ambulatory children with radiologically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The same tests were carried out on 474 apparently healthy control children of the same age and sex. The mean age of children with CAP was 6.5 years (SD 4.2). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was found in 19.6 % of 56 cases and in 2.1 % of 474 controls. Adenoviruses were present in 12.5 % of cases (0.2 % controls) and metapneumovirus and influenza A virus each in 10.7 % of cases (0.2 % controls).

Feasibility, safety and outcome of EVT in a-ICAD are not well described yet. METHODS From an institutional database, we retrospectively selected consecutive patients treated for a-ICAD between January 2007 and July 2015. We assessed recanalization results defining <50 % residual stenosis and mTICI 2b as successful. Procedural adverse events and symptomatic haemorrhages were reported as well as clinical outcome at 90 days defining a mRS 2 as favourable. Follow-up angiographies were reviewed and retreatments reported. RESULTS In the defined period, 73 patients (mean age 48 years (31-73), mean NIHSS 11 (0-27)) received EVT for a-ICAD. The majority (60 %) had tandem occlusions. Cervical artery reconstruction was successful in 100 % and intracranial thrombectomy in 85 %. Thrombus formation (18 %) and thromboembolism (20 %) were the most frequent adverse events but clinically relevant only in 8 %. Symptomatic haemorrhage occurred in 5 %. Clinical outcome was favourable in 64 %, with a lower chance after tandem occlusion (55 vs. 79 %, p = 0.047). Death rate was 10 %. None of the patients developed recurrent ischaemic symptoms, but control angiography revealed abnormal findings of the reconstructed ICA in 38 % leading to retreatment in 17 %. CONCLUSION EVT of a-ICAD is feasible with a predominantly favourable clinical outcome. Improvement of devices and techniques is warranted to reduce the risk of thrombus formation and thromboembolism during treatment and insufficient vessel wall healing thereafter.","output":"Endovascular treatment of acute internal carotid artery dissections: technical considerations, clinical and angiographic outcome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bam-readcount is a utility for generating low-level information about sequencing data at specific nucleotide positions.

Due to vindesine unavailability, we assessed the safety and efficacy of replacing vindesine with vincristine in a modified R-ACVBP protocol (mR-ACVBP). METHODS: This is a retrospective study including all consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL who received first-line mR-ACVBP. Vindesine was replaced with vincristine 1.5 mg on days 1 and 5 of each cycle. Responders continued with published R-ACVBP consolidation. Patients with inadequate response on interim imaging were offered consolidative autologous stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: We identified 56 patients with DLBCL, with a median age of 41 years (range, 21-67). Thirty-seven (66%) patients had an age-adjusted International Prognostic Index of &#8805; 2. Complete response was achieved in 41 (80%) patients and partial response in 6 (12%).

We inspected catheter lab records and interviewed electrophysiologists in each centre to gather information on the impact of the pandemic on working patterns and on the health of staff members and patients. There was a striking decline in interventional electrophysiology activity in each of the centres. The decline occurred within a week of the recognition of widespread community transmission of the virus in each region and shows a striking correlation with the national figures for new diagnoses of COVID-19 in each case. During the period of restriction, workflow dropped to <5% of normal, consisting of emergency cases only. In two of three centres, electrophysiologists were redeployed to perform emergency work outside electrophysiology. Among the centres studied, only Wenzhou has seen a recovery from the restrictions in activity. Following an intense nationwide programme of public health interventions, local transmission of COVID-19 ceased to be detectable after 18 February allowing the electrophysiology service to resume with a strict testing regime for all patients.

They are biologically active molecules produced by different organisms as an essential component of their innate immune response against invading pathogens. Lactoferrin (LF), one of the AMPs, is an iron-binding glycoprotein that is present in several mucosal secretions. The antiviral activity of LF exists against a wide range of human and animal viruses (DNA and RNA). LF was proven to increase the host immunity against viral infection. Since LF is one of the constituents of breast milk and significantly located at the mucosal layers of the human body, it is considered the first line of defense against microbial infection. LF was reported to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV infection.

Common themes in the narratives had been extracted and a coding book had been developed where a brief definition and description of each code had been included. Response rate was 88.8% out of 304 participating first-year students. Most students (93.5%) were satisfied with the VLSs. Extracted themes of students perceptions were categorized into advantages, limitations/disadvantages, and recommendations to improve the approach. Regarding the advantages, seven subcategories, namely, knowledge, skills, learning environment, self-efficiency, content & technique, focusing, and feedback, were extracted. Students mentioned the long duration, less collaborative teams, and connection problems as the main limitations/disadvantages. In addition, regarding recommendations, four subcategories, namely, generalization of experience, frequency of repetition, feedback, and duration of sessions, were extracted.

METHODS: A cohort of 158 employees, who were identified as high risk to respiratory biohazard exposure, were invited to participate in the RPP. We provided a bundle of interventions, which included an online training package, and mandatory quantitative fit testing. The main outcomes included the participants' knowledge and attitude toward respiratory protection equipment (RPE), which were assessed via an online survey.

To help clinicians distinguish KD, KDSS, septic shock, and TSS earlier, we suggest differential diagnosis and treatment guideline. METHODS: Medical records of immunocompetent patients who were admitted to the pediatric department with a diagnosis of KDSS, septic shock or TSS (SS group) were retrospectively reviewed. In addition, KD patients were selected by seasonal matching to each case of KDSS patient by date of admission ( 2 weeks). RESULTS: There were 13 patients with KDSS, 35 patients with SS group, and 91 patients with KD. In comparison between KDSS and septic shock group, KDSS group had significantly higher rate of coronary aneurysm incidence, and higher left ventricle dysfunction rate. In comparison between KDSS and TSS, patients with KDSS had a significantly higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and significantly lower creatinine.

However, the extent to which comorbidities contribute to excess COVID\\\\19 mortality in cirrhosis is controversial. METHODS: We used the multinational Lean European Open Survey on SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2\\\\infected patients (LEOSS) to identify patients with cirrhosis documented between March 2020 and March 2021, when the wild\\\\type and alpha variant were predominant. We compared symptoms, disease progression and mortality after propensity score matching (PSM) for age, sex, obesity, smoking status, and concomitant diseases. Mortality was also compared with that of patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) without SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection, a common bacterial infection and well\\\\described precipitator of acute\\\\on\\\\chronic liver failure. RESULTS: Among 7096 patients with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection eligible for analysis, 70 (0.99%) had cirrhosis, and all were hospitalized. Risk factors for severe COVID\\\\19, such as diabetes, renal disease, and cardiovascular disease were more frequent in patients with cirrhosis. Case fatality rate in patients with cirrhosis was 31.4% with the highest odds of death in patients older than 65 years (43.6% mortality; odds ratio [OR] 4.02; p = 0.018), Child\\\\Pugh class C (57.1%; OR 4.00; p = 0.026), and failure of two or more organs (81.8%; OR 19.93; p = 0.001).

OBJECTIVE To analyze the results of a consecutive series of patients with unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs), including a subgroup analysis of ARUBA-eligible patients. METHODS One hundred five patients with unruptured BAVMs were treated over an 8-year period. From this series, 90 adult patients and a subgroup of 61 patients determined to be ARUBA eligible were retrospectively reviewed. A subgroup analysis for Spetzler-Martin grades I/II, III, and IV/V was performed. The modified Rankin Scale was used to assess functional outcome. RESULTS Persistent deficits, modified Rankin Scale score deterioration, and impaired functional outcome occurred less frequently in ARUBA-eligible grade I/II patients compared with grade III to V patients combined (P = .04, P = .04, P = .03, respectively). Twenty-two of 39 patients (56%) unruptured grade I and II BAVMs were treated with surgery without and with preoperative embolization, and all had a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1 at the last follow-up. All patients treated with surgery without and with preoperative embolization had radiographic cure at the last follow-up. CONCLUSION The results of ARUBA-eligible and unruptured grade I/II patients overall show that excellent outcomes can be obtained in this subgroup of patients, especially with surgical management. Functional outcomes for ARUBA-eligible patients were similar to those of patients who were randomized to medical management in ARUBA. On the basis of these data, in appropriately selected patients, we recommend treatment for low-grade BAVMs.","output":"Treatment outcomes of unruptured arteriovenous malformations with a subgroup analysis of ARUBA (A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations)-eligible patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical features of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a sample of Italian patients and to investigate the occurrence of smell and taste disorders.

Multiple techniques are used in clinical practice without agreement regarding the optimal approach. We evaluated a novel device, the Cric-Guide (CG), a channelled bougie introducer that enters the airway in a single action and compared it with a scalpel-bougie-tube (SBT) technique in laboratory benchtop model. METHODS Seven anaesthesiologists attempted eFONA on both obese and non-obese models using both techniques in randomized order on an excised porcine trachea with an intact larynx with variable subcutaneous tissue depth. The primary outcome was successful tracheal cannulation. Secondary outcomes included false passage rate, time and tissue injury. RESULTS Anaesthesiologists performed 4 cricothyroidotomies on each model with each device. The CG was more successful in airway cannulation (47/56 [89.4%] vs. 33/56 [58.9%], P = 0.007). This difference was observed in the obese model only. The CG was associated with fewer false passages than the standard technique in the obese model (8/56 [14.3%] vs. 23/56 [41.1%], P = 0.006). There were no significant differences in time to completion or injury patterns between the techniques in the obese model, but the SBT was faster in the non-obese model. There was no difference in the proportion of specimens injured. CONCLUSION The Cric-Guide device was more successful than the standard SBT technique in airway cannulation in an obese neck model and with equivalent frequency and distribution of injury but performed equivalently in the non-obese model.","output":"Evaluation of a novel emergency front of neck access device in a benchtop model of obesity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper develops nonparametric methods for the survival analysis of epidemic data based on contact intervals.

We show that the Nelson-Aalen estimator produces an unbiased estimate of the contact interval cumulative hazard function when who-infects-whom is observed. When who-infects-whom is not observed, we average the Nelson-Aalen estimates from all transmission networks consistent with the observed data using an EM algorithm. This converges to a nonparametric MLE of the contact interval cumulative hazard function that we call the marginal Nelson-Aalen estimate.

Given the fact that cancer patients are at increased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), analysis of viral load and disease outcome in COVID-19-infected cancer patients is needed. Here, we measured the SARS-CoV-2 viral load using qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values collected from 120 noncancer and 64 cancer patients nasopharyngeal swab samples who are admitted to hospitals. Our results showed that the in-hospital mortality for high viral load cancer patients was 41.38%, 23.81% for medium viral load and 14.29% for low viral load patients (p < ?0.01). On the other hand, the mortality rate for noncancer patients was lower: 22.22% among patients with high viral load, 5.13% among patients with medium viral load, and 1.85% among patients with low viral load (p < 0.05). In addition, patients with lung and hematologic cancer showed higher possibilities of severe events in proportion to high viral load. Higher attributable mortality and severity were directly proportional to high viral load particularly in patients who are receiving anticancer treatment. Importantly, we found that the incubation period and serial interval time is shorter in cancer patients compared with noncancer cases.

METHODS: We prospectively studied 201 hospitalised frail patients (89.5  4.7 years, female 70.1%). We examined Katz Index (KI) against adverse outcomes in CFS6 (n = 106). We then compared predictive performances of a modified CFS version 1 (mCFS-1; category 6A: CFS6 and KI  2; 6B: CFS6 and KI  1) and modified CFS version 2 (mCFS-2; category 6A: CFS6 and KI  2; 6B1: CFS6, KI  1 and feeding independent; 6B2: CFS6, KI  1 and feeding dependent) against the CFS. Multivariate analysis was used to compare each tool against mortality and institutionalisation. Receiver operator characteristic analysis was performed to determine area under curve and optimal cut-points for each tool. RESULTS: KI  1 in CFS6 was associated with higher 12-month mortality (39.3% vs. 15.6%, p = 0.01); amongst KI items, feeding dependent predicted 12-month mortality (p < 0.05). Using mCFS-1, category 6A did not increase 12-month mortality compared with category 5 (OR 1.83, 95% CI 0.52C6.47), unlike category 6B (OR 6.33, 95% CI 2.07C19.33). mCFS-2 produced higher mortality in category 6B1 (OR 5.19, 95% CI 1.30C20.69) and 6B2 (OR 6.92, 95% CI 2.14C22.35).

METHODS: In the assessment, seventy-five patient Epic EMR (electronic medical record) charts were reviewed to collect information on demographics, socioeconomic factors, healthcare access and sobriety during the pandemic period between March 1st, 2020 and June 15th, 2020. Patient charts were selected based on those receiving office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) for OUD at an urban healthcare center. RESULTS: 98.7% of patients accessed the healthcare center in some form since March 1st, 2020. The most common form of communication was through telemedicine with 94.6% of calls over audio.

Objective To assess the COVID-19 pandemic?s effect on weight, food choices, and health behaviors in patients receiving medical treatment for overweight or obesity. Methods Adult patients treated at an urban academic weight management center between May 1, 2019 and May 1, 2020 were electronically surveyed between February 23 and March 23, 2021. The survey assessed changes in weight, eating, behaviors, and the use of antiobesity medications (AOMs) following issuance of social distancing/stay-at-home policies in March 2020. Results In 970 respondents, median percent weight change for those taking AOMs was -0.459% [interquartile range (IQR) -5.46%-(+3.73%)] compared to +2.33% [IQR-1.92%-(+6.52%)] for those not taking AOMs (p<0.001). More participants achieved 5% weight loss if they were taking AOMs compared to those who were not (26.7% vs 15.8%, p=0.004), and weight gain 5% was also lower in those taking AOMs (19.8% vs 30.3%, p=0.004). Patients with pre-pandemic BMI 30 kg/m2 taking AOMs experienced the greatest weight reduction, and there was greater weight loss associated with increased physical activity. Conclusions and relevance. Medical weight management protected against weight gain during this period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased physical activity, decreased alcohol intake, and use of AOMs were factors that contributed to this protective effect. This article is protected by copyright.

Despite this, a significant proportion of the US tobacco control and prevention field continues to be guided by a precept that there is \\"no safe tobacco,\\" therefore failing to acknowledge practices that may be used to reduce the harms associated with consuming combustible forms of nicotine and tobacco. In this commentary, we argue that ignoring the potential benefits of harm reduction strategies may unintentionally lead to an erosion of trust in tobacco control among some members of the public. Trust in tobacco control as an institution is crucial for the success of tobacco control efforts. To ensure trust, we must return to our basic principles of doing no harm, developing programs that are responsive to people's experiences, and providing resources in assisting people to reduce the harms that may be associated with practices, such as smoking, which adversely affect health. Only by respecting an individual's priorities can we cultivate trust and develop tobacco prevention efforts that are grounded in the realities of people's lives and responsive to their needs.","output":"Tobacco Harm Reduction as a Path to Restore Trust in Tobacco Control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This months MMWR selections summarize several recent observations related to COVID\\\\19 infection.","output":"MMWR summary: COVID\\\\19 reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Veal calf hemorrhagic enteritis, a condition that has no identified specific etiology, is a fatal syndrome of veal calves and has recently become a major concern of the veal calf industry in the midwestern United States. To determine the possible role of common enteric pathogens in this disease, 40 veal calves with hemorrhagic enteritis (cases) and 25 dairy calves diagnosed with enteric infection (control) were investigated. The veal calves were negative for several known enteric pathogens except for pathogenic Escherichia coli isolates that expressed multiple virulence attributes. To determine whether such isolates have a significant association with hemorrhagic enteritis in veal calves, we compared the prevalence of pathogenic E. coli in the 40 veal calves with the prevalence of similar E. coli in the dairy calves that were diagnosed with colibacillosis within the same season of the year. Escherichia coli isolates from the two groups of calves were tested for several properties of E. coli related to pathogenicity, i.e. production of verotoxins, heat-stable enterotoxin (ST(a)), heat-labile enterotoxin, enterohemolysin, K99 fimbrial antigens, hemagglutination activity, and attachment to Hep-2 tissue culture cells. Escherichia coli that produces ST(a) were more commonly isolated from veal calves with hemorrhagic enteritis (45%) than from dairy calves with enteritis (12%) (P<0.05). Various patterns of attachment of E. coli to Hep-2 tissue culture cells were studied. The E. coli that demonstrated aggregative patterns of attachment were more commonly represented in veal calves (32%) than in dairy calves (8%). We observed that there was no correlation between ST(a) production and K99 pili expression among the enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) isolates that were recovered from veal calves. This may indicate the emergence of K99-negative ETEC, probably as a result of the wide use of K99-based vaccines.","output":"The role of pathogenic Escherichia coli in the etiology of veal calf hemorrhagic enteritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Southeast Asia has been identified as a potential epicentre of emerging diseases with pandemic capacity, including highly pathogenic influenza. Cambodia in particular has the potential for high rates of avoidable deaths from pandemic influenza due to large gaps in health system resources. This study seeks to better understand the course and cost-of-illness for cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Cambodia. METHODS: We studied the 18 laboratory-confirmed cases of avian influenza subtype H5N1 identified in Cambodia between January 2005 and August 2011. Medical records for all patients were reviewed to extract information on patient characteristics, travel to hospital, time to admission, diagnostic testing, treatment and disease outcomes. Further data related to costs was collected through interviews with key informants at district and provincial hospitals, the Ministry of Health and non-governmental organisations. An ingredient-based approach was used to estimate the total economic cost for each study patient. Costing was conducted from a societal perspective and included both financial and opportunity costs to the patient or carer. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to evaluate potential change or variation in the cost-of-illness. RESULTS: Of the 18 patients studied, 11 (61%) were under the age of 18 years. The majority of patients (16, 89%) died, eight (44%) within 24 hours of hospital admission. There was an average delay of seven days between symptom onset and hospitalisation with patients travelling an average of 148 kilometres (8-476 km) to the admitting hospital. Five patients were treated with oseltamivir of whom two received the recommended dose. For the 16 patients who received all their treatment in Cambodia the average per patient cost of H5N1 influenza illness was US$300 of which 85.0% comprised direct medical provider costs, including diagnostic testing (41.2%), pharmaceuticals (28.4%), hospitalisation (10.4%), oxygen (4.4%) and outpatient consultations (0.6%). Patient or family costs were US$45 per patient (15.0%) of total economic cost. CONCLUSION: Cases of avian influenza in Cambodia were characterised by delays in hospitalisation, deficiencies in some aspects of treatment and a high fatality rate. The costs associated with medical care, particularly diagnostic testing and pharmaceutical therapy, were major contributors to the relatively high cost-of-illness.","output":"Human H5N1 influenza infections in Cambodia 2005C2011: case series and cost-of-illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a persistent organic pollutant, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) have gained increasing research attention over recent years because of their potential risk to humans and the environment. In this paper, we investigated the reproductive toxicity of these pollutants using a C. elegans model to evaluate spermatogenesis throughout the entire developmental cycle of him-5 mutant by exposing to 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 mmol/L PFOS or PFOA for 48 h. Experimental results suggested that PFOS and PFOA exposure led to reductions in brood size, germ cell number, spermatid size, and motility, and increases in rate of malformation spermatids. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that exposure to PFOS resulted in higher levels of damage than PFOA in germ cells only in 0.001 mmol/L exposure group. RT-qPCR was used to further investigate the expression of genes associated with different stages of spermatogenesis, such as mitosis and meiosis, fibrous body-membranous organelles (FB-MOs), and sperm activation. The expression levels of wee-1.3, spe-4, spe-6, and spe-17 genes were increased, while those of puf-8, spe-10, fer-1, swm-1, try-5, and spe-15 genes were decreased. Our results suggesting that PFOS or PFOA may cause spermatogenesis damage by disrupting the mitotic proliferation, meiotic entry, formation of the MOs, fusion of the MOs and plasma membrane (PM), and pseudopods. Loss-of-function studies using puf-8 and spe-10 mutants revealed spe-10 gene was specifically involved in PFOS- or PFOA-induced reproductive toxicity via regulating one or more critical palmitoylation events, while puf-8 gene was not direct target of PFOS and PFOA, and PFOS and PFOA may act on the upstream gene of puf-8, thus affecting reproductive ability. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential adverse impact of PFOS and PFOA exposure on spermatogenesis and provide valuable data for PFC risk assessment.

The development of novel antiviral agents is considered an urgent research subject. Objectives: The objective of the study is to discover the phenolic constituents of the methanolic extract of Tecoma mollis Humb. and Bonpl. heartwood and to investigate their potential inhibitory action against SARS-CoV-2 protease and/or entry proteins. Materials and Methods: The heartwood of T. mollis was extracted by maceration with 70% EtOH until complete exhaustion. The extract was concentrated under reduced pressure, mixed with distilled H2O and defatted with CHCl3 to produce a CHCl3 fraction, and then subjected to solvent fractionation with n-butanol to produce an n-butanol fraction. The n-butanol fraction was subjected to a silica gel column using CHCl3CMeOH gradient mixtures followed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The isolated compounds were identified using one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance as well as mass spectroscopy. Molecular docking studies have been implemented to identify the binding pattern between ligands and target enzymes, i.e. main protease (Mpro) and spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), and compared with the currently used COVID-19 inhibitors. Molecular dynamic simulations have been performed to evaluate the dynamics and stability of proteinCligand complexes. The obtained information is then correlated with the essential structural features, and finally the structureCactivity relationship is suggested. Results: Fourteen phenolic glycosides were isolated from the methanolic extract of T. mollis Humb. and Bonpl. heartwood in addition to an iridoid, ixoside. The molecular docking study exhibited that the isolated compounds have a higher binding affinity toward the active site of Mpro and the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 binding site of spike protein RBD. The phenylpropanoids have higher inhibitory action with higher binding energy toward SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease as compared to spike protein RBD. Among all the isolated compounds, isoverbascoside (10) exhibited the most potent dual interaction with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease and spike protein RBD with high binding energy of ? 8.8 and ? 7.2 kcal/mol, respectively. This showed better potency than the currently used Mpro and spikeCprotein inhibitors. Conclusion: Our study is the first report on the potential inhibitory action of phenylpropanoids for SARS-CoV-2 protease and spike protein. It also correlates between the reported antiviral activities of some isolated compounds with their potential inhibitory action for COVID-19 viral proteins. Our results on T. mollis extract constituents could help in the discovery of a promising repurposable drug candidate that could contribute to the development of an effective therapy for COVID-19.","output":"Phenolics from the heartwood of Tecoma mollis as potential inhibitors of COVID-19 virus main protease and spike proteins: An In silico study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lynxacarus radovskyi is of uncommon occurrence and there are few reports in the state of Esprito Santo, Southeastern Brazil.

The toxicity of metabolites is predicted by a new random forest regression model and is available for over one hundred fungal species. Further, for major fungal pathogens, metabolic networks from the KEGG database were enriched with data of toxicity and regulatory effort for each enzyme to support identification of targets. We determined several toxic intermediates in fungal-specific pathways like amino acid synthesis, nitrogen and sulfur assimilation, and the glyoxylate bypass. For the latter, we show experimentally that growth of the pathogen Candida albicans is inhibited when the detoxifying enzymes Mls1 and Hbr2 are deleted and toxic glyoxylate accumulates in the cell.

We showed that RSV infection enhanced the expression of a series of ISGs, including oligoadenylate synthetase 2, IFITM1 (IFN-induced transmembrane protein 1) and myxovirus resistance 2. Our results also showed that the IFITM proteins potently inhibited RSV infection mainly by interfering with both virus entry and the subsequent replication steps, but not the attachment process. The antiviral effect of IFITM3 was not affected by ubiquitination modification. Furthermore, knocking down the endogenous and IFN-induced expression of IFITM1 and 3 facilitated RSV infection. Expression of the IFITM proteins was found to delay the phosphorylation of IFN regulatory factor 3 through interfering with the detection of viral RNA by MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5) and RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I).

Clinician interpretation can result in under-reporting; therefore, the value of patient self-reporting has been recognized. The National Cancer Institute has developed a Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) for direct patient AE reporting. A nonrandomized prospective cohort feasibility study aimed to explore the compliance and acceptability of an electronic (Internet or telephone) system for collecting patient self-reported AEs and quality of life (QOL). METHODS Oncology patients undergoing treatment (chemotherapy, targeted agents, hormone therapy, radiotherapy, and/or surgery) at 2 hospitals were sent automated weekly reminders to complete PRO-CTCAE once a week and QOL (for a maximum of 12 weeks). Patients had to speak/understand English and have access to the Internet or a touch-tone telephone. Primary outcome was compliance (proportion of expected questionnaires), and recruitment rate, attrition, and patient/staff feedback were also explored. RESULTS Of 520 patients, 249 consented (47.9%)-mean age was 62 years, 51% were male, and 70% were married-and 230 remained on the study at week 12. PRO-CTCAE was completed at 2,301 (74.9%) of 3,074 timepoints and QOL at 749 (79.1%) of 947 timepoints. Individual weekly/once every 4 weeks compliance reduced over time but was more than 60% throughout. Of 230 patients, 106 (46.1%) completed 13 or more PRO-CTCAE, and 136 (59.1%) of 230 patients completed 4 QOL questionnaires. Most were completed on the Internet (82.3%; mean age, 60.8 years), which was quicker, but older patients preferred the telephone option (mean age, 70.0 years).

The United States has no national policy, leaving states to independently implement public health guidelines that are predicated on a sustained decline in COVID-19 cases. Operationalization of sustained decline varies by state and county. Existing models of COVID-19 transmission rely on parameters such as case estimates or R(0) and are dependent on intensive data collection efforts. Static statistical models do not capture all of the relevant dynamics required to measure sustained declines. Moreover, existing COVID-19 models use data that are subject to significant measurement error and contamination. OBJECTIVE: This study will generate novel metrics of speed, acceleration, jerk, and 7-day lag in the speed of COVID-19 transmission using state government tallies of SARS-CoV-2 infections, including state-level dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infections. This study provides the prototype for a global surveillance system to inform public health practice, including novel standardized metrics of COVID-19 transmission, for use in combination with traditional surveillance tools. METHODS: Dynamic panel data models were estimated with the Arellano-Bond estimator using the generalized method of moments. This statistical technique allows for the control of a variety of deficiencies in the existing data. Tests of the validity of the model and statistical techniques were applied. RESULTS: The statistical approach was validated based on the regression results, which determined recent changes in the pattern of infection. During the weeks of August 17-23 and August 24-30, 2020, there were substantial regional differences in the evolution of the US pandemic. Census regions 1 and 2 were relatively quiet with a small but significant persistence effect that remained relatively unchanged from the prior 2 weeks. Census region 3 was sensitive to the number of tests administered, with a high constant rate of cases. A weekly special analysis showed that these results were driven by states with a high number of positive test reports from universities. Census region 4 had a high constant number of cases and a significantly increased persistence effect during the week of August 24-30. This change represents an increase in the transmission model R value for that week and is consistent with a re-emergence of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Reopening the United States comes with three certainties: (1) the social end of the pandemic and reopening are going to occur before the medical end even while the pandemic is growing. We need improved standardized surveillance techniques to inform leaders when it is safe to open sections of the country; (2) varying public health policies and guidelines unnecessarily result in varying degrees of transmission and outbreaks; and (3) even those states most successful in containing the pandemic continue to see a small but constant stream of new cases daily.","output":"Dynamic Panel Surveillance of COVID-19 Transmission in the United States to Inform Health Policy: Observational Statistical Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study includes three patients with various peripheral neuropathies after contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, treated both conservatively and surgically.

However, specific treatment for HPeV3 infection is currently unavailable. The application of antisense technology, such as peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), to viral infection has opened a new era of therapeutics. The aim of this study is to develop PNAs inhibiting HPeV3 gene expression in an in vitro model. METHODS: We designed four PNAs that target domains I, J (base and head of domain J structure), and K of an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) region within the 5 untranslated region of HPeV3. The IRES region is needed for the cap-independent translation. The PNAs were conjugated to cell-penetrating peptide (RXR)(4)XB (R = L-arginine, X = 6-aminohexanoic acid, B = -alanine). LLC-MK2 cells were treated with 0.1C10M of each PNA or water-containing growth medium for 4h. The cells were then infected with HPeV3 at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 for 1h. The infected cells were incubated for 7 days at 37oC in 5% CO(2). Extracellular levels of HPeV3 RNA were measured by real-time PCR on days 0 and 7. RESULTS: Without any treatment, an extracellular level of HPeV3 RNA increased to 8.2  10(6) copies/L on day 7. When the cells were treated with 10M of PNA targeting the domain I of IRES, an extracellular level of HPeV3 RNA was suppressed to 4.7  10(4) copies/L (?99%) on day 7. Using the same PNA with lower concentrations, 1 M and 0.1 M of the PNA suppressed 24% and 0% of extracellular levels of HPeV3 RNA, respectively, which demonstrated the effect is dose-dependent. In contrast, 10M of PNAs targeting domain J (base), J (head), and K suppressed 94%, 92%, and 20% of extracellular levels of HPeV3 RNA, respectively, compared with control. CONCLUSION: The PNA-(RXR)(4)XB targeting the domain I of IRES suppressed extracellular levels of HPeV3 RNA in an in vitro model in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, PNA treatment may be a therapeutic candidate for HPeV3-infected patients. This novel therapy could target other HPeV genotypes given that the target sequence used in this study is identical to those of other clinically significant HPeVs.

A combined inability to control viral replication and exacerbated inflammatory immune activation in elderly patients causes irreparable immune-mediated tissue pathology in response to infection. Key to these responses are type I, II, and III interferons (IFNs), which are involved in inducing an antiviral response, as well as controlling and suppressing inflammation and immunopathology. IFNs support monocyte/macrophage-stimulated immune responses that clear infection and promote their immunosuppressive functions that prevent excess inflammation and immune-mediated pathology. The timing and magnitude of IFN responses to infection are critical towards their immunoregulatory functions and ability to prevent immunopathology. Aging is associated with multiple defects in the ability of macrophages and dendritic cells to produce IFNs in response to viral infection, leading to a dysregulation of inflammatory immune responses. Understanding the implications of aging on IFN-regulated inflammation will give critical insights on how to treat and prevent severe infection in vulnerable individuals. In this review, we describe the causes of impaired IFN production in aging, and the evidence to suggest that these impairments impact the regulation of the innate and adaptive immune response to infection, thereby causing disease pathology.","output":"Aging and Interferons: Impacts on Inflammation and Viral Disease Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the international level, the enormous demand to manage the COVID-19 pandemic has posed a challenge both in the provision of personnel and in supplies and sanitary material There is no precedent or publication related to the management and leadership of nursing services in Spain within the emergency plan for the COVID-19 pandemic This article describes the experience of the Hospital Clinico de Barcelona in the current extraordinary circumstances that undoubtedly constitute a nursing management of enormous magnitude and unprecedented due to the high number of people affected and the extraordinary risk of healthcare personnel Following national and international guidelines to alleviate the pandemic, protect health and prevent the spread of the outbreak The ability to work as a team, emotional management and respect for organizational decisions have made it possible to face the challenges that the pandemic has put in place and that the Nursing Department can lead in a calm and orderly manner the different actions to perform Lastly, it will be necessary to continue with an in-depth analysis of the situation and of the actions carried out in order to identify the areas for improvement as well as to evaluate the overall nature of the process","output":"[management and Leadership of Nursing Services in the Emergency Plan for the Pandemic Covid-19: the Experience of the Clinic Hospital of Barcelona]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly became a global pandemic This study aimed to investigate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) -associated epidemiology and clinical outcomes in Bangladesh in order to understand the future course of the COVID-19 pandemic and develop approaches to prevention A cross-sectional study based on retrospective interviews was conducted on 1021 individuals with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted in six different hospitals in Bangladesh and who recovered 4 weeks before the interview date Of the 1021 patients, 111 (10 9%) were asymptomatic and the other 910 (89 1%) were symptomatic Higher prevalence of COVID-19 was found in the male population (75%), in cohorts with B-positive blood group (36 3%) and in the 31-40 years age group Common symptoms observed in our study participants were fever (72 4%), cough (55 9%), loss of taste (40 7%) and body ache (40%);whereas among the biochemical parameters, neutrophil count (46 4%), D-dimer (46 1%) and ferritin (37 9%) levels were elevated Among the recovered individuals, short-term outcomes including pains and aches (31 8%), weakened attention span (24 4%) and anxiety or depression (23 1%) were also significantly prevalent in the symptomatic cases with comorbidities Our study showed that in Bangladesh, adult males aged between 31 and 40 years were more vulnerable to developing COVID-19 It also indicated a rising trend of asymptomatic cases as the pandemic progressed As a consequence, deployment of interventions to curb further spread of community infection is necessary to avoid grave outcomes of COVID-19 in Bangladesh","output":"A multi-centre, cross-sectional study on coronavirus disease 2019 in Bangladesh: clinical epidemiology and short-term outcomes in recovered individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COronaVIrus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the critical need to focus on its impact on the mental health of Healthcare Workers (HCWs) involved in the response to this emergency.

Discovering an effective treatment for this disease, particularly in severe cases, has become the subject of intense scientific investigation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This study was conducted as a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial. Fifty-nine patients with severe COVID-19 infection who did not respond to initial treatments were randomly assigned into two groups. One group received IVIg (human)-four vials daily for 3 days (in addition to initial treatment), while the other group received a placebo. Patients' demographic, clinical, and select laboratory test results, as well as the occurrence of in-hospital mortality, were recorded. RESULTS: Among total study subjects, 30 patients received IVIg and 29 patients received a placebo. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory tests were not statistically different (P > 0.05) between the two groups. The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly lower in the IVIg group compared to the control group (6 [20.0%] vs. 14 [48.3%], respectively; P = 0.022). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that administration of IVIg did indeed have a significant impact on mortality rate (aOR = 0.003 [95% CI: 0.001-0.815]; P = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the administration of IVIg in patients with severe COVID-19 infection who did not respond to initial treatment could improve their clinical outcome and significantly reduce mortality rate.

However, few integrated models exist within management and organization scholarship to guide practice. In response, our focus aims to unpack how organizations can become healing spaces. This paper offers a holistic definition of healing as the foundation for a new conceptual model of organizations as healing spaces. Drawing upon literature from clinical psychology, social psychology, and political science, we identify four perspectives that address healing in organizational contexts: (1) restorative justice, (2) posttraumatic growth, (3) relational cultural theory, and (4) dignity. These healing modalities represent prominent views of how healing can be achieved at the individual, dyadic, organizational, and societal levels. Synthesizing and building on these perspectives, we develop a typology that illustrates three ways organizations can function as healing spaces  Emergent, Endeavoring, and Exemplifying  representing a range of opportunities for how organizations can better respond to suffering. These spaces of healing are differentiated across seven dimensions, including source of harm, recipients of healing, facilitators of healing, focus of healing, length and strength of organizational attention, process of healing, and activators or enablers of healing. This research contributes to organizational healing research and to nascent social justice discussions in the management literature by exploring a range of opportunities for how organizations can better respond to suffering and substantively contribute to remedying harm from systematic bias against marginalized groups via healing.","output":"Cultivating Organizations as Healing Spaces: A Typology for Responding to Suffering and Advancing Social Justice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Instruction in implicit bias is becoming prevalent across the spectrum of medical training. Little education exists for preclinical students, and guidance for faculty to facilitate such education is minimal. To address these gaps, we designed and delivered a single session for incoming first-year medical students and developed a facilitator training program. METHODS: One faculty member delivered a 1-hour, multimedia, interactive lecture to all first-year medical students. Students subsequently met in small groups with trained facilitators. Activities included reflection, guided debriefing, and strategy identification to become aware of when they might be making an assumption causing them to jump to a conclusion about someone. The program evaluation consisted of aggregated student strategies and facilitator feedback during postsession debriefs, both analyzed through thematic analysis. RESULTS: We delivered instruction to 1,098 students. Student strategies resulted in three themes: (1) humility, (2) reflection, and (3) partnering. The postsession debriefs uncovered opportunities to enhance the session. Lessons learned included presenting material to an entire class at once, allowing students to engage in dynamic discussion in the small groups, eliminating anonymous polling in the small groups, and highlighting management of implicit bias as essential to professional development. DISCUSSION: Our instructional design enabled first-year medical students to identify at least one strategy to use when implicit biases are activated. The large-group session was deliverable by one faculty member, and volunteers successfully facilitated small-group sessions after only one training session, making this model a feasible innovation to reach an entire medical school class at the same time.","output":"How Assumptions and Preferences Can Affect Patient Care: An Introduction to Implicit Bias for First-Year Medical Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Aeolian wall lizard Podarcis raffonei is an island endemic that survives only on three tiny islets, and on the Capo Grosso peninsula of the Vulcano island, thus is among the European vertebrates with the smallest range and one of the most threatened by extinction. This species is declining due to competition and hybridization with the non-native lizard Podarcis siculus, but a regular monitoring program is lacking. Here we assessed the size and status of the Capo Grosso population of P. raffonei on Vulcano. In September 2015 we captured 30 individuals showing the typical brown phenotype of P. raffonei, while one single male showed a green phenotype, apparently intermediate between P. raffonei and the non-native Podarcis siculus. In May 2017, only 47% of 131 individuals showed the typical brown phenotype (P. raffonei-like) and 53% showed the green phenotype (P. siculus-like). Based on N-mixture models and removal sampling the estimated size of the Capo Grosso population was of 800C1300 individuals in 2017, being similar to 2015; available data suggest that the total range of the species could be as small as 2 ha. The frequency of individuals with the typical P. raffonei phenotype dramatically dropped between two samplings with a parallel increase of individuals displaying the green phenotype. Observation on outdoor captive-bred individuals demonstrates plasticity for colouration in P. raffonei individuals from Capo Grosso, with several individuals showing the typical brown pattern in September 2017 and a green pattern in March 2021.

Although numerous studies have reported that neurodegeneration and subsequent cognitive impairments are involved in neuroinflammation, relationship between psychological disturbance and neuroinflammation with aging (neuroinflammaging) remains unclear.

Microglial inflammatory responses to a subsequent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge were significantly enhanced in male SAMP8 mice relative to normal aging senescence-accelerated mouse resistant 1 (SAMR1) mice at 17 weeks, but not 8 weeks of age. LPS injection also significantly increased brain and systemic inflammation in SAMP8 mice at 17 weeks. In a battery of behavioral tests, SAMP8 mice at 17 weeks, but not 8 weeks, exhibited anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and circadian rhythm disruption. Taken together, SAMP8 mice at 17 weeks possess a brain microenvironment in which it is easier to trigger neuroinflammatory priming; this may lead to an emergence of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and circadian rhythm disruption.

With access to these data, the authors extend that work and support a definite construct for auditory processing disorder (APD). The goal here is to examine MAPA-2 reliability and validity (construct, content, and concurrent). Evidence for the APD construct is further buttressed by measures of sensitivity and specificity. Results of MAPA-2 testing on children diagnosed with learning disability (LD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and specific language impairment (SLI) are included. Method Normative data (previously published as the MAPA-2) allowing derivation of these findings included a representative sample of 748 children (53% girls) ages 7-14 years tested by 54 speech-language pathologists and audiologists in 27 U.S. states. The authors examined diagnostic accuracy based on the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (2005) criteria (index test) for confirmed cases of APD. The index was also used to identify listening problems for three other diagnostic categories (LD, ADHD, and SLI). Validated questionnaire responses from parents and school personnel allowed incorporation of functional measures widely supported in APD diagnosis but unavailable with other normative and sensitivity/specificity studies. Results Reliability and validity were both satisfactory, and diagnostic accuracy for an APD group of 18 (28% female) compared to the remaining typical group of 625 yielded 89% sensitivity and 82% specificity. The remaining three groups (LD, ADHD, and SLI), where comorbidity was expected to be about 50%, had APD-type listening problems with a prevalence ranging from 52% to 65%. Conclusions Current results provide important evidence for the construct of APD. The MAPA-2 can be administered by an audiologist or speech-language pathologist.

While prior work has leveraged abrupt shifts in single policies to examine the effects of state policy on birth outcomes, we examined a holistic measure that captures political polarisation. METHODS: Data were drawn from national birth certificates for 2003-2017 (N=56 770 470). Outcomes included preterm birth, low birth weight, small-for-gestational age and other perinatal health measures. The primary exposure was a composite index of right-left state policy orientation, generated from historical data on 135 state policies. Multivariable regressions were used to estimate the association between state policy orientation and each outcome, adjusting for relevant covariates. RESULTS: Compared with infants born in states with right-leaning policy orientations, those born in left-leaning states had lower odds of adverse birth outcomes (eg, low birth weight: OR 0.95 (0.93, 0.97), preterm birth: OR 0.94 (0.92, 0.95)). Subgroup analyses revealed stronger associations for US-born and White mothers. With the inclusion of state fixed effects, left-leaning policy orientation was no longer associated with lower odds of adverse birth outcomes. Models were otherwise robust to alternative specifications. CONCLUSION: While left-leaning state policy orientation has protective associations with a range of birth outcomes, the associations may be explained by stable characteristics of states, at least during the study period. Future studies should examine state policy orientation in association with other health outcomes and study periods.","output":"Association of US state policy orientation with adverse birth outcomes: a longitudinal analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using survey data from the Japan Finance Corporation, we investigate whether formal or informal support contributes to the performance of new start-up enterprises. We apply ordinary least squares (OLS) and quantile regression to explain the achievement rate of monthly sales. The results of the OLS estimation suggest that formal support has negative effects on the achievement rate, whereas informal support has positive effects. From the results of the quantile regression analysis, the estimated coefficients by quantiles indicate that high-performing enterprises are not affected significantly by formal and informal supports in positive or negative directions, whereas low-performing enterprises are affected strongly in positive or negative directions. These results imply that encouraging the start-ups through formal/informal supports has negative/positive effects on achieving their expected performance. Although it is difficult to predict whether entrepreneurs will perform well before they start an enterprise, informal support has little effect on high-performing enterprises.","output":"Formal and informal support and the performance of new start-ups: a quantile regression analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recommender systems have significantly developed in recent years in parallel with the witnessed advancements in both internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Accordingly, as a consequence of IoT and AI, multiple forms of data are incorporated in these systems, e.g. social, implicit, local and personal information, which can help in improving recommender systems' performance and widen their applicability to traverse different disciplines. On the other side, energy efficiency in the building sector is becoming a hot research topic, in which recommender systems play a major role by promoting energy saving behavior and reducing carbon emissions. However, the deployment of the recommendation frameworks in buildings still needs more investigations to identify the current challenges and issues, where their solutions are the keys to enable the pervasiveness of research findings, and therefore, ensure a large-scale adoption of this technology. Accordingly, this paper presents, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first timely and comprehensive reference for energy-efficiency recommendation systems through (i) surveying existing recommender systems for energy saving in buildings; (ii) discussing their evolution; (iii) providing an original taxonomy of these systems based on specified criteria, including the nature of the recommender engine, its objective, computing platforms, evaluation metrics and incentive measures; and (iv) conducting an in-depth, critical analysis to identify their limitations and unsolved issues. The derived challenges and areas of future implementation could effectively guide the energy research community to improve the energy-efficiency in buildings and reduce the cost of developed recommender systems-based solutions.","output":"A survey of recommender systems for energy efficiency in buildings: Principles, challenges and prospects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the corona virus around the world has spurred travel restrictions and community lockdowns to manage the transmission of infection. In the Philippines, with a large population of overseas Filipino contract workers (OFWs), as well as foreign workers in the local online gaming industry and visitors from nearby countries, the first reported cases were from a Chinese couple visiting the country in mid-January 2020. Three months on, by mid-March, the COVID-19 cases in the Philippines had reached its first 100, before it exploded to the present 178,022 cases (as of August 20, 2020). Here, we report a genomic survey of six (6) whole genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus collected from COVID-19 patients seen at the Philippine General Hospital, the major referral hospital for COVID-19 cases in Metro Manila at about the time the Philippines had over a hundred cases. Analysis of commonly observed variants did not reveal a clear pattern of the virus evolving towards a more infectious and severe strain. When combined with other available viral sequences from the Philippines and from GISAID, phylogenomic analysis reveal that the sequenced Philippine isolates can be classified into three primary groups based on collection dates and possible infection sources: (1) January samples collected in the early phases of the pandemic that are closely associated with isolates from Wuhan, China; (2) March samples that are mainly linked to the M/V Diamond Princess Cruise Ship outbreak; and (3) June samples that clustered with European isolates, one of which already harbor the globally prevalent D614G mutation which initially circulated in Europe. The presence of community-acquired viral transmission amidst compulsory and strict quarantine protocols, particularly for repatriated Filipino workers, highlights the need for a refinement of the quarantine, testing, and tracing strategies currently being implemented to adapt to the current pandemic situation.","output":"ANALYSIS OF SARS-COV-2 GENOME SEQUENCES FROM THE PHILIPPINES: GENETIC SURVEILLANCE AND TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data on SARS-CoV-2 detection in lesional skin is controversial.1-8 We report a PCR-proven COVID-19 patient with a chilblain-like SARS-CoV-2 positive skin lesion.

It would be desirable to rapidly characterize such outbreaks and develop accurate projections of their duration and cumulative size even when limited preliminary data are available. Here we develop a mathematical model to aid public health authorities in tracking the expansion and contraction of outbreaks with explicit representation of factors (other than population immunity) that may slow epidemic growth. METHODOLOGY: The Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (IDEA) model is a parsimonious function that uses the basic reproduction number R(0), along with a discounting factor to project the growth of outbreaks using only basic epidemiological information (e.g., daily incidence counts). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Compared to simulated data, IDEA provides highly accurate estimates of total size and duration for a given outbreak when R(0) is low or moderate, and also identifies turning points or new waves. When tested with an outbreak of pandemic influenza A (H1N1), the model generates estimated incidence at the i+1(th) serial interval using data from the i(th) serial interval within an average of 20% of actual incidence. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: This model for communicable disease outbreaks provides rapid assessments of outbreak growth and public health interventions.

Maternal COVID-19 antibody was detected 2 weeks after positive molecular testing. Antibodies were never detected on cord blood samples from two intrauterine fetal cord blood samples as well as neonatal cord blood at the time of delivery. Conclusion This case demonstrates a lack of passive immunity of COVID-19 antibodies from a positive pregnant woman to her fetus, neither in utero nor at the time of birth. Further studies are needed to understand if passage of antibodies can occur and if that can confer passive immunity in the newborn. Key Points: Passive immunity should not be assumed in COVID-19 infection in pregnancy. Isoimmunization may impair passive immunity of certain antibodies.

Some questions required a scaled response (for example, a five point scale ranging from very dissatisfied to very satisfied);other questions required a free-text response.The online link to both surveys was sent by email to all clinicians in the assessment team. Clinicians were asked to complete a survey for every child for whom they were case coordinator, for any autism assessment started between 1.4.20 to 30.9.20. The clinician was asked to email the parent/carer survey online link to the parents/carers of each child.Responses of both clinician and parent/carer surveys were analysed.ResultsThere were 37 clinician responses, ten parent/carer responses and two CYP responses.The ethnic spread of parents/carers matched that of the local population. 76% of parents/carers had English as their first language.Three out of 37 parents/carers (8%) did not agree to having a remote assessment. The part of the assessment most often carried out remotely was the parent interview (30 out of 37 cases) followed by the assessment feedback (28 out of 37 cases).A diagnostic conclusion was reached in 94% assessments. There were technological issues in 16% assessments.90% parents/carers were very satisfied with assessment process. 90C100% parents/carers were comfortable with video technology and said it was easy to carry out assessments tasks remotely.Parents/carers described being pleased that their childs assessment could proceed without delay due to social distancing. Parents/carers and CYP respondents described being more relaxed in their own home while being assessed. Others described avoiding the inconvenience of travelling to the clinic.However, when asked, If you could choose again, would you choose remote or face-to-face?, families were split 50/50.ConclusionsThis study provides evidence that remote autism assessments had a high level of diagnostic conclusiveness with little technological difficulty. There was a high level of parental satisfaction. However, parents are split as to whether they would choose remote assessments over face-to-face if given the choice again.In future, parents/carers may be offered a choice over some remote aspects of autism assessments.

Supported by its respiratory transmissibility, even by people infected without symptomatic disease, this coronavirus soon began to rapidly spread worldwide. BACKGROUND: Many countries have implemented different infection control and containment strategies due to ongoing community transmission. In this context, contact tracing as well as adequate testing and consequent quarantining of high-risk contacts play leading roles in containing the virus by interrupting infection chains. This approach is especially important in the hospital setting where contacts often cannot be avoided and physical distance is usually not possible. Furthermore, health care workers (HCWs) usually have contact with a variety of vulnerable people, making it essential to identify infections among hospital employees as soon as possible to interrupt the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the facility. Several electronic tools for contact tracing, such as specific software or mobile phone apps, are available for the public health sector. In contrast, contact tracing in hospitals often has to be carried out without helpful electronic tools, and an enormous amount of human resources is typically required. AIM: For rapid contact tracing and effective infection control and management measures for HCWs in hospitals, adapted technical solutions are needed. METHODS: In this study, we report the development of our containment strategy to a web-based contact tracing and rapid point-of-care-testing workflow.

Although mobile communication devices played a crucial role in online learning among quarantined university students, the potential smartphone addition problems, negative health behaviors, and psychological symptoms need considerable attention. This study examined the relationship of problematic smartphone use (PSU), sleep quality, and daytime fatigue among medical students. Methods: A web-based survey was conducted in six polyclinic hospitals in Beijing between February and May 2020. 1016 participants (26.01  2.46 years, 65.16% female) completed self-report measurements including Short Version Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS-SV), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), and Subjective Fatigue Scale (FS). Spearman correlation coefficients and multiple regression models were used to analyze the association among PSU, sleep quality, and daytime fatigue. We used structural equation modeling to test the mediating effect of sleep quality between PSU and daytime fatigue. Results: 49.70% of the participants had PSU. Significant positive correlations were found among SAS-SV, AIS, and FS scores (r = 0.35C0.61, P(S) < 0.001). Subjects with PSU were more likely to report sleep disturbance ( = 1.07, P < 0.001, OR = 2.91, 95%CI = 2.17C3.91), physical fatigue ( = 1.16, P < 0.001, OR = 3.18, 95%CI = 2.45C4.15), and mental fatigue ( = 0.88, P < 0.001, OR = 2.42, 95%CI = 1.86C3.14). The indirect effect of PSU on physical fatigue and mental fatigue mediated by sleep quality accounted for 50.03 and 45.43% of the total effect, respectively.

Over its 41-year existence, 21 persons exposed to highly hazardous infectious diseases were admitted to the Slammer, but none ever contracted the disease to which they had been exposed. Owing, in part, to this underutilization, some questioned the utility of HLCC units. This concern notwithstanding, Emory University and the University of Nebraska opened HLCC units in civilian academic medical centers in 2004 and 2005, respectively. These units, distinct from conventional infectious disease isolation wards found in most major medical centers, proved their worth during the West African Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak of 2014C2015.

We used population-weighted multivariable-adjusted multi-nomial logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for the associations between mental health (of depression, anxiety, and loneliness, each) and self-reported increased alcohol consumption (vs. no change in consumption). One in ten adults (717/6548;11%) reported an increase in their alcohol consumption in the past week compared to their usual pre-COVID-19 drinking.

The length of intensive care and the duration of these supportive therapies are clinically relevant outcomes. From the statistical perspective, these quantities are challenging to estimate due to episodes being time-dependent and potentially multiple, as well as being determined by the competing, terminal events of discharge alive and death. METHODS: We used multistate models to study COVID-19 patients' time-dependent progress and provide a statistical framework to estimate hazard rates and transition probabilities. These estimates can then be used to quantify average sojourn times of clinically important states such as intensive care and invasive ventilation. We have made two real data sets of COVID-19 patients (n = 24* and n = 53**) and the corresponding statistical code publically available. RESULTS: The expected lengths of intensive care unit (ICU) stay at day 28 for the two cohorts were 15.05* and 19.62** days, while expected durations of mechanical ventilation were 7.97* and 9.85** days. Predicted mortality stood at 51%* and 15%**. Patients mechanically ventilated at the start of the example studies had a longer expected duration of ventilation (12.25*, 14.57** days) compared to patients non-ventilated (4.34*, 1.41** days) after 28 days. Furthermore, initially ventilated patients had a higher risk of death (54%* and 20%** vs. 48%* and 6%**) after 4 weeks. These results are further illustrated in stacked probability plots for the two groups from time zero, as well as for the entire cohort which depicts the predicted proportions of the patients in each state over follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The multistate approach gives important insights into the progress of COVID-19 patients in terms of ventilation duration, length of ICU stay, and mortality. In addition to avoiding frequent pitfalls in survival analysis, the methodology enables active cases to be analyzed by allowing for censoring. The stacked probability plots provide extensive information in a concise manner that can be easily conveyed to decision makers regarding healthcare capacities.

The Government of Bangladesh adopted the WHO recommended Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI)-strategy in 1998 for outpatient management of pneumonia, which was scaled-up nationally by 2014. This paper reports the service availability and readiness related to IMCI-based pneumonia management in Bangladesh. We conducted a secondary analysis of the Bangladesh Health Facility Survey-2017, which was conducted with a nationally representative sample including all administrative divisions and types of health facilities. We limited our analysis to District Hospitals (DHs), Maternal and Child Welfare Centres (MCWCs), Upazila (sub-district) Health Complexes (UHCs), and Union Health and Family Welfare Centres (UH&FWCs), which are mandated to provide IMCI services. Readiness was reported based on 10 items identified by national experts as essential for pneumonia management. RESULTS: More than 90% of DHs and UHCs, and three-fourths of UH&FWCs and MCWCs provide IMCI-based pneumonia management services. Less than two-third of the staff had ever received IMCI-based pneumonia training. Only one-third of the facilities had a functional ARI timer or a watch able to record seconds on the day of the visit. Pulse oximetry was available in 27% of the district hospitals, 18% of the UHCs and none of the UH&FWCs. Although more than 80% of the facilities had amoxicillin syrup or dispersible tablets, only 16% had injectable gentamicin. IMCI service registers were not available in nearly one-third of the facilities and monthly reporting forms were not available in around 10% of the facilities. Only 18% of facilities had a high-readiness (score 8C10), whereas 20% had a low-readiness (score 0C4). The readiness was significantly poorer among rural and lower level facilities (p < 0.001). Seventy-two percent of the UHCs had availability of one of any of the four oxygen sources (oxygen concentrators, filled oxygen cylinder with flowmeter, filled oxygen cylinder without flowmeter, and oxygen distribution system) followed by DHs (66%) and MCWCs (59%). CONCLUSION: There are substantial gaps in the readiness related to IMCI-based pneumonia management in public health facilities in Bangladesh. Since pneumonia remains a major cause of child death nationally, Bangladesh should make a substantial effort in programme planning, implementation and monitoring to address these critical gaps to ensure better provision of essential care for children suffering from pneumonia.

We present both near\\\\term and long\\\\term policy solutions. Seven near\\\\term policy recommendations include requiring the uniform public reporting of COVID\\\\19 cases in all LTSS settings; identifying and supporting unpaid caregivers; bolstering protections for the direct care workforce; increasing coordination between public health departments and LTSS agencies and providers; enhancing collaboration and communication across health, LTSS, and public health systems; further reducing barriers to telehealth in LTSS; and providing incentives to care for vulnerable populations. Long\\\\term reform should focus on comprehensive workforce development, comprehensive LTSS financing reform, and the creation of an age\\\\friendly public health system. CONTEXT: The heavy toll of COVID\\\\19 brings the failings of the long\\\\term services and supports (LTSS) system in the United States into sharp focus. Although these are not new problems, the pandemic has exacerbated and amplified their impact to a point that they are impossible to ignore. The primary blame for the high rates of COVID\\\\19 infections and deaths has been assigned to formal LTSS care settings, specifically nursing homes. Yet other systemic problems have been unearthed during this pandemic: the failure to coordinate the US public health system at the federal level and the effects of long\\\\term disinvestment and neglect of state\\\\ and local\\\\level public health programs. Together these failures have contributed to an inability to coordinate with the LTSS system and to act early to protect residents and staff in the LTSS care settings that are hotspots for infection, spread, and serious negative health outcomes. METHODS: We analyze several impacts of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on the US LTSS system and policy arrangements. The economic toll on state budgets has been multifaceted, and the pandemic has had a direct impact on Medicaid, the primary funder of LTSS, which in turn has further exacerbated the states fiscal problems. Both the inequalities across race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status as well as the increased burden on unpaid caregivers are clear. So too is the need to better integrate LTSS with the health, social care, and public health systems. FINDINGS: We propose seven near\\\\term actions that US policymakers could take: implementing a uniform public reporting of COVID\\\\19 cases in LTSS settings; identifying and supporting unpaid caregivers; bolstering support for the direct care workforce; increasing coordination between public health departments and LTSS agencies and providers; enhancing collaboration and communication across health, LTSS, and public health systems; further reducing the barriers to telehealth in LTSS; and providing incentives to care for our most vulnerable populations. Our analysis also demonstrates that our nation requires comprehensive reform to build the LTSS system we need through comprehensive workforce development, universal coverage through comprehensive financing reform, and the creation of an age\\\\friendly public health system. CONCLUSIONS: COVID\\\\19 has exposed the many deficits of the US LTSS system and made clear the interdependence of LTSS with public health. Policymakers have an opportunity to address these failings through a substantive reform of the LTSS system and increased collaboration with public health agencies and leaders. The opportunity for reform is now.","output":"COVID\\\\19: The Time for Collaboration Between Long\\\\Term Services and Supports, Health Care Systems, and Public Health Is Now"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"If the current rate of infection are to be better managed, and future waves of infection kept at bay, it is absolutely necessary that the conditions and mechanisms of exposure to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) be better understood, as well as the downstream severe or lethal clinical complications. While the identification of notable comorbidities has now helped to define broad risk groups, the idiosyncratic responses of individual patients can generate unexpected clinical deterioration that is difficult to predict from initial clinical features. Thus, physicians caring for patients with COVID-19 face clinical dilemmas on a daily basis. The ability to decipher individual predispositions to SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe illness, in light of variations in host immunological and inflammatory responses, in particular as a result of genetic variations, would be of great benefit in infection management. To this end, this work associates the description of COVID-19 clinical complications, comorbidities, sequelae, and environmental and genetic factors. We also give examples of underlying genomic susceptibility to COVID-19, especially with regard to the newly reported link between the disease and the unbalanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. As a consequence, we propose that the host/genetic factors associated with COVID-19 call for precision medicine in its treatment.

Emerging evidence suggests that patients with a cancer diagnosis are three times more likely to die from COVID-19 compared to non-cancer patients. Due to these observed risks, it is critical that emerging COVID-19 therapies demonstrate safety and efficacy among patients with cancer. AIM: This study sought to examine reporting and representation of patients with cancer among published COVID-19 treatment-related research studies. METHODS AND RESULTS: All published COVID-19 treatment-related clinical research studies published from March 1 to August 20, 2020 recruiting from North America and Europe were identified. The date published, study design, therapeutics studied, and study population were evaluated. Of the 343 studies identified through initial search and researcher knowledge, 55 (16%) reported on COVID-19 treatments. Twenty-one COVID-19 therapeutic studies (n = 15, prospective; n = 6, retrospective) that recruited from the United States and Europe were identified. Among these studies, eight (38%) reported on the number of trial participants with a cancer diagnosis in the publication and two (10%) specified tumor type. Four of the studies (19%) did not collect cancer history. Among studies where cancer history was available, patients with a cancer diagnosis participated at a proportion higher than overall cancer prevalence and greater than the known proportion of COVID-19 patients with cancer. CONCLUSION: This study observed that cancer history was not uniformly collected or reported among published COVID-19 therapeutic studies. Among reported publications, we observed that patients with a cancer diagnosis were generally overrepresented. However, patients with a cancer diagnosis were notably underrepresented in outpatient COVID-19 therapeutic studies.","output":"Examining reporting and representation of patients with cancer in COVID-19 clinical trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine the psychosocial factors influencing community adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) to limit the spread of COVID-19. Using data from 990 respondents in communities across Nigeria, we examine the correlation of health behaviors and socioeconomic indicators. We conduct logistic regression to estimate the relationship between mask wearing as a health-seeking NPI with demographic and socioeconomic variables. We estimate separate models in the sensitivity robustness checks with other NPIs and control for differences across sex, age, education, number in household, and the presence of a student in the respondents household. A crucial finding is that health-seeking NPI behaviors are statistically significantly affected in different ways by the menu of socioeconomic indicators. The control for age, sex, education, and household size indicates that there is intersectionality of how these factors influence specific mitigation practices. We find that women are more likely to engage in mask wearing, hand washing, and use of hand sanitizers and tissues than men, and the provision of palliatives and access to family supplies significantly enhances community mitigation. Palliatives and access to family supplies enhance most health-seeking behaviors. The implication for pandemic mitigation policy is that minimizing incidence rates requires having responsive initiatives such as information updates on pandemic progression.","output":"Examining Psychosocial Factors and Community Mitigation Practices to Limit the Spread of COVID-19: Evidence from Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and risk factors for acute cardiac injury (ACI) and acute kidney injury (AKI), and then investigate their effect on severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1249 patients with COVID-19 were included in this retrospective study. Predictors of ACI and AKI were investigated. Multivariable-logistic regression models were used to determine the association of ACI (or AKI) with severity and mortality. RESULTS: Median age of patients was 36 years and 61.9% were male. ACI and AKI were observed in 53 (4.2%) and 91 (7.3%) of patients, respectively. Patients with age > 60 years, chronic heart disease, decreased lymphocyte and increased CRP, PCT, and ESR on hospital admission, and Lopinavir/Ritonavir use showed higher odds of ACI.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of the 8-week lockdown on endurance capacity of elite male handball players. METHODS Ten male athletes (1928 cm and 966 kg) from the first German handball league participated in the study. The effects of training on shuttle run tests between period 1 (P1: preseason to mid-season) and period 2 (P2: mid-season to time after lockdown) were compared. The maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) was assessed using an incremental exercise test (IET) (July 2019 and May 2020). RESULTS During the COVID-19 lockdown, the athletes completed an instructed home-based strength and endurance program (52/48). The training effects were found to be reduced after the 8-weeks of COVID-19 lockdown (period 2) as compared to period 1 (mean difference 249248 m, p=0.005). There was no significant difference in the running distance (2358430 m vs. 2400362 m, respectively, p=0.70) after the lockdown as compared to the pre-seasonal performance. VO2max (46.65.1 vs. 49.47.0 ml/kg/min, respectively, p=0.12) and the power output (3.130.36 vs. 3.130.43 W/kg, respectively, p=1.0) also did not differ between preseason and after COVID-19 lockdown. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 lockdown led to a reduction in endurance capacity of elite handball players without team training, despite a home-based strength and endurance program. Supervision of individual home-based training is highly recommended to avoid inadequate implementation of the training.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on endurance capacity of elite handball players."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiac rehabilitation programs support the health, wellness, and recovery of patients with cardiovascular conditions.

SUMMARY OF REVIEW We searched seven databases from January 1980 to September 2019 for articles reporting malignant tumors and myeloproliferative neoplasms diagnosed after an ischemic stroke (PROSPERO protocol: CRD42019132455). We screened 15,400 records and included 51 articles. The pooled cumulative incidence of cancer within one year after an ischemic stroke was 13.6 per thousand (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.6-24.8), higher in studies focusing on cryptogenic stroke (62.0 per thousand; 95% CI, 13.6-139.3 vs 9.6 per thousand; 95% CI, 4.0-17.3; p = 0.02) and those reporting cancer screening (39.2 per thousand; 95% CI, 16.4-70.6 vs 7.2 per thousand; 95% CI, 2.5-14.1; p = 0.003). Incidence of cancer after stroke was generally higher compared to people without stroke. Most cases were diagnosed within the first few months after stroke. Several predictors of cancer were identified, namely older age, smoking, and involvement of multiple vascular territories as well as elevated C-reactive protein and d-dimers. CONCLUSIONS The frequency of incident cancer after an ischemic stroke is low, but higher in cryptogenic stroke and after cancer screening. Several predictors may increase the yield of cancer screening after an ischemic stroke. The pooled incidence of post-stroke cancer is likely underestimated, and larger studies with systematic assessment of cancer after stroke are needed to produce more precise and valid estimates.","output":"Frequency and predictors of occult cancer in ischemic stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) 21 and 23 are recently identified hormones regulating metabolism of glucose, lipid, phosphate and vitamin D.

With the escalating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on society in the United States and around the world, the CDC has become one of the focal points of public discussion. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the topics and their overarching themes emerging from the public COVID-19-related discussion about the CDC on Twitter and to further provide insight into public's concerns, focus of attention, perception of the CDC's current performance, and expectations from the CDC. METHODS: Tweets were downloaded from a large-scale COVID-19 Twitter chatter data set from March 11, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, to August 14, 2020. We used R (The R Foundation) to clean the tweets and retain tweets that contained any of five specific keywords-cdc, CDC, centers for disease control and prevention, CDCgov, and cdcgov-while eliminating all 91 tweets posted by the CDC itself. The final data set included in the analysis consisted of 290,764 unique tweets from 152,314 different users. We used R to perform the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm for topic modeling. RESULTS: The Twitter data generated 16 topics that the public linked to the CDC when they talked about COVID-19. Among the topics, the most discussed was COVID-19 death counts, accounting for 12.16% (n=35,347) of the total 290,764 tweets in the analysis, followed by general opinions about the credibility of the CDC and other authorities and the CDC's COVID-19 guidelines, with over 20,000 tweets for each.

The reference standard for the quantification of antibodies capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 is the plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT). However, given that it is a laboratory-developed assay, validation is crucial in order to ensure sufficient specificity and intra- and interassay precision. In addition, a multitude of other serological assays have been developed, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry-based assays, luciferase-based lentiviral pseudotype assays, and commercially available human ACE2 receptor-blocking antibody tests, which offer practical advantages in the evaluation of the protective humoral response against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we validated a SARS-CoV-2 PRNT to assess both 50% and 90% neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 according to guidelines outlined by the World Health Organization. Upon validation, the reference-standard PRNT demonstrated excellent specificity and both intra- and interassay precision. Using the validated assay as a reference standard, we characterized the neutralizing antibody response in specimens from patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Finally, we conducted a small-scale multilaboratory comparison of alternate SARS-CoV-2 PRNTs and surrogate neutralization tests. These assays demonstrated substantial to perfect interrater agreement with the reference-standard PRNT and offer useful alternatives to assess humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, has infected over 246 million people and led to over 5 million deaths as of October 2021. With the approval of several efficacious COVID-19 vaccines, methods to evaluate protective immune responses will be crucial for the understanding of long-term immunity in the rapidly growing vaccinated population. The PRNT, which quantifies SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies, is used widely as a reference standard to validate new platforms but has not undergone substantial validation to ensure excellent inter- and intraassay precision and specificity. Our work is significant, as it describes the thorough validation of a PRNT, which we then used as a reference standard for the comparison of several alternative serological methods to measure SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies. These assays demonstrated excellent agreement with the reference-standard PRNT and include high-throughput platforms, which can greatly enhance capacity to assess both natural and vaccine-induced protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Evaluating Humoral Immunity against SARS-CoV-2: Validation of a Plaque-Reduction Neutralization Test and a Multilaboratory Comparison of Conventional and Surrogate Neutralization Assays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA viruses are responsible for many zoonotic diseases that post great challenges for public health.

Deep Learning tools are often referred to as black boxes because humans cannot interpret how or why a model is classifying an image into a particular class. This problem is addressed by testing VisionPro Deep Learning with two settings, first, by selecting the entire image as the Region of Interest (ROI), and second, by segmenting the lungs in the first step, and then doing the classification step on the segmented lungs only, instead of using the entire image. VisionPro Deep Learning results: on the entire image as the ROI it achieves an overall F score of 94.0%, and on the segmented lungs, it gets an F score of 95.3%, which is better than COVID-Net and other state-of-the-art open-source Deep Learning models.","output":"Identification of Images of COVID-19 from Chest X-rays Using Deep Learning: Comparing COGNEX VisionPro Deep Learning 1.0?

While they can directly influence enteric virus infections, there is also an increasing appreciation for the role of microbiota-derived metabolites in regulating virus infections. Because metabolites diffuse across the intestinal epithelium and enter circulation, they can influence host response to pathogens at extraintestinal sites. In this review, we summarize the effects of three types of microbiota-derived metabolites on virus infections. While short-chain fatty acids serve to regulate the extent of inflammation associated with viral infections, the flavonoid desaminotyrosine and bile acids generally regulate interferon responses. A common theme that emerges is that microbiota-derived metabolites can have proviral and antiviral effects depending on the virus in question. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which microbiota-derived metabolites impact viral infections and the highly conditional nature of these responses should pave the way to developing novel rational antivirals.","output":"The influence of microbiota-derived metabolites on viral infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has recently been authorized for use in older patients. The objective of this single-center study was to evaluate 2-year weight loss in patients 60 years compared with younger matched patients undergoing RYGB. Secondary aims were to record complications and the resolution of comorbidities in a 2-year follow-up. METHODS Of 722 patients with at least 2 years follow-up data, 48 elderly patients were matched with 92 young (<40 years) and 96 middle-aged (40-59 year) patients, according to sex, baseline body mass index, and date of surgery. Weight loss, remission of comorbidities, death, and early (30-day) and 2-year complication rates were compared. RESULTS There were three deaths in the elderly group and none in the other groups. The early complication rate was not significantly different in the elderly group (17.8 %) compared with the young (11.5 %, p = 0.637) and middle-aged (13.7 %, p = 1.000) groups. The 2-year complication rates were not significantly different in the elderly group (9.3 %) compared with the young (23.5 %, p = 0.107) and middle-aged (13.2 %, p = 1.000) groups. The 2-year weight loss was lower in the elderly group (31.8  7.2 %; p < 0.001) than in the young group (38.3  6.9 %) but was not significantly different from that in the middle-aged group (34.4  8.0 %; p = 0.145). Remission rates for diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea were lower in the elderly than in the two younger groups. CONCLUSION After bariatric surgery, major weight loss was observed in patients older than 60, but remission of metabolic comorbidities was less marked than in younger subjects.","output":"Gastric Bypass in Older Patients: Complications, Weight Loss, and Resolution of Comorbidities at 2 Years in a Matched Controlled Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to have a tremendous impact on patients and healthcare systems around the world In the fight against this novel disease, there is a pressing need for rapid and effective screening tools to identify patients infected with COVID-19, and to this end CT imaging has been proposed as one of the key screening methods which may be used as a complement to RT-PCR testing, particularly in situations where patients undergo routine CT scans for non-COVID-19 related reasons, patients have worsening respiratory status or developing complications that require expedited care, or patients are suspected to be COVID-19-positive but have negative RT-PCR test results Early studies on CT-based screening have reported abnormalities in chest CT images which are characteristic of COVID-19 infection, but these abnormalities may be difficult to distinguish from abnormalities caused by other lung conditions Motivated by this, in this study we introduce COVIDNet-CT, a deep convolutional neural network architecture that is tailored for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images via a machine-driven design exploration approach Additionally, we introduce COVIDx-CT, a benchmark CT image dataset derived from CT imaging data collected by the China National Center for Bioinformation comprising 104,009 images across 1,489 patient cases Furthermore, in the interest of reliability and transparency, we leverage an explainability-driven performance validation strategy to investigate the decision-making behavior of COVIDNet-CT, and in doing so ensure that COVIDNet-CT makes predictions based on relevant indicators in CT images Both COVIDNet-CT and the COVIDx-CT dataset are available to the general public in an open-source and open access manner as part of the COVID-Net initiative While COVIDNet-CT is not yet a production-ready screening solution, we hope that releasing the model and dataset will encourage researchers, clinicians, and citizen data scientists alike to leverage and build upon them","output":"COVIDNet-CT: A Tailored Deep Convolutional Neural Network Design for Detection of COVID-19 Cases From Chest CT Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bilateral renal infarction is an extremely rare condition with only few cases reported in the literature.

Infection by the SARS-CoV-2 increases the risk for systematic multi-organ complications and venous, arterial thromboembolism. The need for an effective vaccine to combat the pandemic prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve a nationwide distribution of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine manufactured by Johnson & Johnson (J&J). The use of the vaccine was halted after reported cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and thrombocytopenia among recipients. Researchers have postulated these rare occurrences as potentially immune-triggered responses associated with complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Thrombotic complications and thrombocytopenia increase the risk for blood clot growth due to the inflammation of immune complexes by pro-thrombotic activation of anti-platelet antibodies. A 52-year-old man presented to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe dyspnea. He required bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) for supplemental oxygen therapy. Endotracheal intubation was performed due to his worsened respiratory deterioration. Lab results suggested respiratory failure due to decreased partial pressure of oxygen (pO(2)) and increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)). Findings of elevated D\\\\dimer levels with decreased fibrinogen and thrombocytopenia with prolonged prothrombin clotting time were consistent for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Chest radiography displayed moderate to heavy bilateral airspace consolidations, consistent with multifocal pneumonia suspicious for COVID-19. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) revealed a mildly enlarged right ventricle and interventricular septum consistent for right heart strain due to a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE) that extended into the main pulmonary lobar segmental arteries bilaterally. The patient was transferred to a higher-level (tertiary) care for radiology intervention to remove the pulmonary embolism found on his lungs. This patient presented with severe dyspnea secondary to massive PE and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) due to SARS-CoV2 infection following the administration of the J&J vaccine. Bilateral thrombus opacities and pulmonary emboli are consistent among COVID-19 patients by intravascular coagulation with increased prothrombin time and D-dimer concentration with a low platelet count. Adverse emboli growths with increased D-dimer and thrombocytopenia strikes a similarity in recipients of the AstraZeneca vaccine due to vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). Administrative use of the J&J vaccine resumed in May 2021. The FDA's reassurance stemmed from their conclusive findings that the vaccine's benefits far outweigh these rare developments, which account for less than 0.01% of the total recipient population. Nevertheless, a further detailed analysis must be conducted on the adverse thrombotic manifestations following adenoviral-based COVID-19 vaccines (J&J, AstraZeneca) compared to mRNA-based vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer) to assess causality with higher specificity.","output":"A COVID-Positive 52-Year-Old Man Presented With Venous Thromboembolism and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation Following Johnson & Johnson Vaccination: A Case-Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Colistin is an important antibiotic currently used to manage infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens in both humans and livestock animals. A new mobile colistin-resistance (mcr-9) gene was recently discovered; this discovery highlighted the need for rigorous monitoring of bacterial resistance against colistin. Salmonella is one of the major pathogens responsible for foodborne illnesses; however, there is minimal information regarding the presence of mcr genes in foodborne Salmonella strains. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of mcr genes among 178 Salmonella strains isolated from chicken meat in Korea. Antimicrobial susceptibility was measured using the broth microdilution method. Bioinformatics characterization of colistin-resistant strains and genetic environment of the mcr-9 gene were analyzed using next-generation sequencing. Transferability of the mcr-9 carrying colistin-resistant Salmonella strain was tested using broth-mating conjugation. Thirteen of the 178 Salmonella isolates showed colistin resistance, but only one strain, Salmonella Dessau ST14 (KUFSE-SAL043) from a traditional chicken market in Korea, carried an mcr family gene, mcr-9. This strain also carried other acquired antimicrobial resistance genes such as blaTEM-1B, qnrS1, and aac(6')-Iaa. Only the IncX1 plasmid replicon type was detected in this strain. In the strain KUFSE-SAL043, the mcr-9 gene was located between two insertion sequences, IS903B and IS26, followed by the downstream regulatory genes qseB-like and qseC-like, which were located between IS1R and &#916;IS1R. Conjugation tests revealed that the mcr-9 gene was successfully transferred to Escherichia coli J53 at a mean frequency of 2.03  10-7. This is the first report of a transferable mcr-9 gene in Salmonella isolated from chicken meat in Korea, highlighting the possibility of transfer of colistin resistance. Therefore, the wide use of colistin should be reconsidered, and a One Health perspective should be adopted to monitor the antimicrobial resistance of Enterobacteriaceae strains in humans, livestock, and the environment.","output":"Emergence of Transferable mcr-9 Gene-Carrying Colistin-Resistant Salmonella enterica Dessau ST14 Isolated from Retail Chicken Meat in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic at the beginning of 2020 forced many countries to implement social distancing policies such as the suspension of activities and gathering. Taiwan is the leading country which took active epidemic prevention measures in local communities, including closing the community centers and programs for older adults. Older adults with chronic health conditions are particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic because they have disproportionally been affected by it. This study examined the associations between community environment and COVID-19 related stress of community-dwelling older adults with disabilities. Data were collected from a sample of 547 community-dwelling older adults aged 65 and over with disabilities in Taiwan between April and July, 2020. Multiple Regression Analysis was applied to test the hypothesized relationships. The analytic results suggested that: First, participants who were younger and with better cognitive functioning had higher levels of COVID-19 related stress. Second, as the confirmed case number dropped by month, participants interviewed in the later months expressed lower levels of COVID-19 related stress. Third, older adults who perceived more obstacles in their environment reported higher levels of COVID-19 related stress. In conclusion, although restrictions during the pandemic is inevitable to secure the safety of the public, programs should be designed for older adults with disabilities to remove the obstacles and to make information, policies and services more accessible in the communities to mitigate their COVID-19 related stress.","output":"Community environment and COVID-19 related stress among older adults with disabilities in Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Lung Cancer TYPE: Fellow Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), is a system of lymphoid tissue found within various organs that plays a role in regulating local immunity. As this tissue contains T, B, and plasma cells, it is the potential site for the development of lymphoma. MALT lymphomas are a form of B-cell extranodal lymphoma that can originate from marginal zone lymphocytes within the lung, referred to as pulmonary marginal zone lymphoma (PMZL). CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 42-year-old female referred to our clinic for evaluation of pulmonary nodules and mediastinal adenopathy. She had a one year history of Sjogren's syndrome. At that time she had no pulmonary or B symptoms. To evaluate her mediastinal adenopathy, she was referred for endobronchial ultrasound where pathologic evaluation revealed only a polymorphous lymphoid population and was negative for malignancy. She had several endobronchial hypervascular and polypoid nodules within the mainstem airways. Pathology from these nodules demonstrated an atypical lymphoid infiltrate, but was unable to be characterized any further.Given ongoing concern for a lymphoproliferative process, she was referred for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Pathology from her left upper and lower lobar wedge resections demonstrated follicular bronchiolitis. Biopsy of a pleural nodule demonstrated a lymphoproliferative process concerning for a low-grade B-cell neoplasm, thought to be extranodal PMZL. She was referred to oncology where PET/FDG demonstrated hypermetabolic multi-station adenopathy suggesting stage IV disease. Given her asymptomatic nature and anticipated indolent course, it was decided to defer chemotherapy pending resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: MALT lymphoma can develop in response to continuous antigen stimulation, as is seen in Sjogren's syndrome or tobacco use. Radiographic features of MALT lymphoma are numerous, including consolidations, nodules, and masses being the most frequent patterns observed in ~50% of patients. Endobronchial lesions as observed in this patient occur in ~85% of cases. PET/FDG imaging commonly demonstrates mild uptake within identifiable lesions. It has a very favorable prognosis with an overall 5-year survival of 90% due to its indolent nature and excellent response rate to chemoimmunotherapy, typically combination Bendamustine and Rituximab. CONCLUSIONS: MALT lymphoma is an uncommon neoplasm that can occur due to chronic antigen stimulation, especially in patients with Sjogren's syndrome. It has numerous radiographic features, the most common being endobronchial lesions. When given these clinical features, establishing a diagnosis is of utmost importance due to the excellent response rate to therapy and favorable long-term prognosis.

We also share insights into the striking similarities between cancer and antigenically variable pathogens and suggest that any successful vaccine against either should demonstrate a similar property: efficient induction of a diverse pool of immune cells equipped to prevent immune escape. Hence, to confront antigenic variability directly, we have employed our innovative vaccine concept, Variable Epitope Libraries, composed of large combinatorial libraries of heavily mutated epitopes, as a universal vaccine platform.

Research in mental health has associated sleep pathologies with depression. However, the gold standard for sleep assessment, polysomnography (PSG), is not suitable for long-term, continuous monitoring of daily sleep, and methods such as sleep diaries rely on subjective recall, which is qualitative and inaccurate. Wearable devices, on the other hand, provide a low-cost and convenient means to monitor sleep in home settings. OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this study was to devise and extract sleep features from data collected using a wearable device and analyze their associations with depressive symptom severity and sleep quality as measured by the self-assessed Patient Health Questionnaire 8-item (PHQ-8). METHODS: Daily sleep data were collected passively by Fitbit wristband devices, and depressive symptom severity was self-reported every 2 weeks by the PHQ-8. The data used in this paper included 2812 PHQ-8 records from 368 participants recruited from 3 study sites in the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. We extracted 18 sleep features from Fitbit data that describe participant sleep in the following 5 aspects: sleep architecture, sleep stability, sleep quality, insomnia, and hypersomnia. Linear mixed regression models were used to explore associations between sleep features and depressive symptom severity. The z score was used to evaluate the significance of the coefficient of each feature. RESULTS: We tested our models on the entire dataset and separately on the data of 3 different study sites. We identified 14 sleep features that were significantly (P<.05) associated with the PHQ-8 score on the entire dataset, among them awake time percentage (z=5.45, P<.001), awakening times (z=5.53, P<.001), insomnia (z=4.55, P<.001), mean sleep offset time (z=6.19, P<.001), and hypersomnia (z=5.30, P<.001) were the top 5 features ranked by z score statistics. Associations between sleep features and PHQ-8 scores varied across different sites, possibly due to differences in the populations. We observed that many of our findings were consistent with previous studies, which used other measurements to assess sleep, such as PSG and sleep questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that several derived sleep features extracted from consumer wearable devices show potential for the remote measurement of sleep as biomarkers of depression in real-world settings. These findings may provide the basis for the development of clinical tools to passively monitor disease state and trajectory, with minimal burden on the participant.","output":"Relationship Between Major Depression Symptom Severity and Sleep Collected Using a Wristband Wearable Device: Multicenter Longitudinal Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected almost every aspect of healthcare, including research.

BACKGROUND: Despite the importance of HH in reducing nosocomial infection, few empirical studies have quantitatively investigated the impacts of unit shape and size, and the resulted visibility and accessibility on HH, due to the lack of consistent methods to measure and evaluate visibility. METHODS: The research was developed as a cross-sectional comparative study of two nursing units (Units A and B) with similar patient acuity and nursing care model but different shape and layout. The study applied quantitative research methods including visibility and accessibility analysis using space syntax, 1-week on-site observation, and secondary data analysis on HH compliance rates. RESULTS: Results indicate that the unit with higher visibility and accessibility is associated with higher HH frequencies. Unit B has significantly higher visibility of HSDs, p < .001, t(60) = 4.615, and significantly higher frequency of HH activity occurrences, 5.17% versus 1.52%; p < .001, t(16.750) = 5.332, than Unit A, even though Unit B has lower HSD to bed ratio (0.708:1 vs. 1.375:1). The linear regression models also demonstrate that visibility and accessibility of HSDs are significant predictors of HH behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this exploratory study identified the importance of visibility of HSDs to improve the chances of HH.

This occurred under serum-free defined, but not serum-supplemented, growth conditions. The importance of neurons in establishing infections in mixed cultures was confirmed by immunocytochemical and electron microscopic studies. Glia, although more abundant than neurons in these cultures, were less frequently infected during the initial 48 h postinoculation. The two glial lineages present in mixed telencephalic cultures were separated into type-1 astrocytes and oligodendrocyte-type-2 astrocyte (O-2A) lineage cells and individually assessed for their ability to support virus growth. Infection could not be established in type-1 astrocytes regardless of the culture conditions employed, consistent with our previous study (S. Beushausen and S. Dales, Virology 141:89-101, 1985). In contrast, infections could be initiated in selected O-2A lineage cells grown in serum-free medium. Virus multiplication was however significantly reduced by preconditioning the medium with mixed telencephalic or enriched type-1 astrocyte cultures, suggesting that intercellular interactions mediated by soluble factor(s) can influence the infectious process in O-2A lineage cells. This presumption was supported by eliciting similar effects with basic fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, two central nervous system cytokines known to control O-2A differentiation. The presence of these cytokines, which synergistically block O-2A cells from differentiating into oligodendrocytes was correlated with specific and reversible resistance to JHM virus (JHMV) infection. These data, combined with our finding that accelerated terminal differentiation of the oligodendrocyte phenotype confers resistance to JHMV (Beushausen and Dales, Virology, 1985), suggest that the permissiveness of O-2A cells for JHMV is restricted to a discrete developmental stage.","output":"Infection by coronavirus JHM of rat neurons and oligodendrocyte-type-2 astrocyte lineage cells during distinct developmental stages."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mussels are widely used to monitor trace element pollution, but the role of their sex and sexual maturation in the element accumulation was not comprehensively studied and the number of elements under consideration never exceeded three dozen. In this work, concentrations of 67 elements in different tissues of females and males of the Mediterranean mussel are determined. Statistically significant differences are obtained in the element composition of analogous tissues of mussel males and females and in gonads of the same sex at different sexual maturation stages. The significantly higher concentrations of some elements found in gonads of females (Mn, Zn, As) and males (P) at most of the sexual maturation stages suggest essentiality of these elements in the reproduction. Elements exhibit several accumulation patterns in gonads during the ripening, with the most general one being the accumulation after spawning. Indications of a new phenomenon of circulation of most elements in gonads over the reproductive cycle are obtained, with the element concentrations decreasing at the first two stages and increasing at the posterior stages. Principal component analysis shows that the differences in the element accumulation are mainly due to the element uptake pathways and sexual differentiation. The most important identified factors determining the decrease in concentrations of tissue elements are their redistribution over mussel's body, biomass dilution, sequestration, and release with gametes. Five detected non-overlapping clusters of the non-normalized element concentrations in the pooled mussel tissues are associated with macroelements, two groups of trace elements, and two groups of ultratrace elements.","output":"Sex- and sexual maturation-related aspects of the element accumulation in soft tissues of the bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis Lam. collected off coasts of Sevastopol (southwestern Crimea, Black Sea)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obesity and obesogenic comorbidities have been associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and mortality. However, the mechanism of such correlations requires an in-depth understanding. Overnutrition/excess serum amino acid profile during obesity has been linked with inflammation and reprogramming of translational machinery through hyperactivation of amino acid sensor mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is exploited by SARS-CoV-2 for its replication. Conversely, we have shown that the activation of general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2)-dependent amino acid starvation sensing pathway suppresses intestinal inflammation by inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1?). While activation of GCN2 has shown to mitigate susceptibility to dengue infection, GCN2 deficiency increases viremia and inflammation-associated pathologies. These findings reveal that the amino acid sensing pathway plays a significant role in controlling inflammation and viral infections. The current fact is that obesity/excess amino acids/mTOR activation aggravates COVID-19, and it might be possible that activation of amino acid starvation sensor GCN2 has an opposite effect. This article focuses on the amino acid sensing pathways through which host cells sense the availability of amino acids and reprogram the host translation machinery to mount an effective antiviral response.

The novelty of the methodology consists in the transformation of services at the time of the introduction or removal of coronavirus-bound pandemic restrictions. At the same time, the distribution of risks on the range of modified tourist services, namely the risks from possible termination of tourist travel, as well as those from a non-disposal of the offered tourist products, is achieved. The combination of the tourist services disposal at different stages of the trip in the form of a directed graph of tourist services as a part of a tourist product is presented. The main incentive for the implementation of the offered methodology is to maintain the income of manufacturers and suppliers of tourism services and to satisfy consumers by expanding possible offers. The use of combinatorics of the offered services in the state space, their implementation at different moments of iterations, their application with the synchronization of the financial flows throughput allows to reduce risks in the tourist product acquisition and its further disposal.

This study aims to observe the influence of an inclusive leadership style on psychological distress while assessing the mediating role of psychological safety. It uses the theoretical lens of job demands-resources theory and the theory of shattered assumptions to develop and test hypotheses.

Bovine blood and nasal swab samples collected on FTA cards were extracted using the commercially available GenSolve kit with a minor modification. The call rate and concordance of genotypes from each sample were compared to those obtained from whole blood samples extracted by standard PCI extraction. FINDINGS An ANOVA analysis indicated no significant difference (P > 0.72) in BovineSNP50 genotype call rate between DNA extracted from FTA cards by the GenSolve kit or extracted from whole blood by PCI. Two sample t-tests demonstrated that the DNA extracted from the FTA cards produced genotype call and concordance rates that were not different to those produced by assaying DNA samples extracted by PCI from whole blood. CONCLUSION We conclude that DNA extracted from FTA cards by the GenSolve kit is of sufficiently high quality to produce results comparable to those obtained from DNA extracted from whole blood when assayed by the Illumina iSelect technology. Additionally, we validate the use of nasal swabs as an alternative to venous blood or buccal samples from animal subjects for reliably producing high quality genotypes on this platform.","output":"Assessment of DNA extracted from FTA cards for use on the Illumina iSelect BeadChip."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a worldwide challenge in the field of neurosurgery, there is no effective treatment method for pediatric skull defects repair in clinic.

An ideal material for pediatric cranioplasty should fulfill the requirements of achieving complete closure, good osseointegration, biodegradability and conformability, sufficient cerebral protection and optimal aesthetic, and functional restoration of calvaria. Biomimetic mineralized collagen-based bone material is a kind of material that simulates the microstructural unit of natural bone on the nanometer scale. Because of its high osteogenic activity, it is widely used in repair of all kinds of bone defects.

Several reports from around the world have identified obesity and severe obesity as one of the strongest risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. Moreover, countries with greater obesity prevalence have a higher morbidity and mortality risk of developing serious outcomes from COVID-19. The understanding of how this increased susceptibility of the people with obesity to develop severe forms of the SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs is crucial for implementing appropriate public health and therapeutic strategies to avoid COVID-19 severe symptoms and complications in people living with obesity. We hypothesize here that increased ACE2 expression in adipose tissue displayed by people with obesity may increase SARS-CoV-2 infection and accessibility to this tissue. Individuals with obesity have increased white adipose tissue, which may act as a reservoir for a more extensive viral spread with increased shedding, immune activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine amplification. Here we discuss how obesity is related to a pro-inflammatory and metabolic dysregulation, increased SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry in adipose tissue and induction of hypercoagulopathy, leading people with obesity to develop severe forms of COVID-19 and also death. Taken together, it may be crucial to better explore the role of visceral adipose tissue in the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and investigate the potential therapeutic effect of using specific target anti-inflammatories (canakinumab or anakinra for IL-1? inhibition; anti-IL-6 antibodies for IL-6 inhibition), anticoagulant or anti-diabetic drugs in COVID-19 treatment of people with obesity.

In particular, in motor training applications, wearable and portable devices can be employed for movements recognition and monitoring of the associated brain signals. In this context, it is essential to minimize the monitoring setup and the amount of data to collect, process, and share. In this paper, we address this challenge for a monitoring system that includes high-dimensional EEG and EMG data for hand movements classification. We fuse EEG and EMG into the magnitude squared coherence (MSC) signal, from which we extracted features using different algorithms (one from the authors) to solve binary classification problems. Finally, we propose a mapping-and-aggregating strategy to increase the interpretability of the machine learning results. The proposed approach provides very low mis-classification errors ( < 0. 1 ), with very few and stable MSC features ( < 10% of the initial set of available features). Furthermore, we identified a common pattern across algorithms and classification problems, i.e., the activation of the centro-parietal brain areas and arm s muscles in 8  80 Hz, in line with previous literature.

Therefore, the majority of patients in whom conservative management (including cautery) has failed are admitted. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our management has shifted towards a more outpatient centred approach. METHOD: A single centre retrospective study was undertaken of all epistaxis patients managed by the ENT team at our centre over a five-month period from 1(st) January to 31(st) May 2020. The first 10 weeks (Pre-COVID-19) were managed using pre-existing guidelines. The following 10 weeks (COVID-19) were managed using the new COVID-19 standard operating procedures which aimed to minimise inpatient admissions. RESULTS: 142 patients, with similar demographic data, were seen across the 5-month period. There were significantly more patients aged over 65 presenting in the COVID-19 group (p = 0.04). There was a significantly increased use of local haemostatic agents (Nasopore ? and Surgiflo ?) and decreased use of nasal packing in the COVID-19 group. There were significantly fewer admissions (p < 0.0005) in the COVID-19 group, but similar rates of representation, length of stay and morbidity.

Systematic searches were performed in multiple databases through April 8th, 2021. Reports in all languages including randomized clinical trials (RCTs), comparative observational studies, and case series/case reports were included. Random effects model was used to pool outcomes from RCTs and comparative observational studies. Outcome measures included all-cause mortality, serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs, pulmonary function, laboratory and imaging findings. A total of 413 patients were identified from 25 studies, which included 8 controlled trials (3 RCTs), 5 comparative observational studies, (n=300) and 17 case-series/case reports (n=113). The patients age was 60.5 years (mean), 33.7% were women. When compared with the control group, MSC cell therapy was associated with reduction in all-cause mortality (RR=0.31, 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.75, I2=0.0%; 3 RCTs and 5 comparative observational studies, 300 patients), reduction in SAEs (IRR=0.36, 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.90, I2=0.0%; 3 RCTs and 2 comparative studies, n=219), no significant difference in AE rate. A sub-group with pulmonary function studies suggested improvement in patients receiving MSC. These findings support the potential for MSC cell therapy to decrease all-cause mortality, reduce SAEs, and improve pulmonary function compared to conventional care.

DESIGN: Phase III, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial. SETTING: 34 centres in France, December 2017 to March 2019. PARTICIPANTS: 1222 adults (>50 years) requiring major non-cardiac surgery with an expected duration of more than 90 minutes. The anticipated time frame for recruitment was 24 months. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised to receive either dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg immediately after the surgical procedure, and on day 1) or placebo. Randomisation was stratified on the two prespecified criteria of cancer and thoracic procedure. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of postoperative complications or all cause mortality within 14 days after surgery, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population (at least one treatment administered). RESULTS: Of the 1222 participants who underwent randomisation, 1184 (96.9%) were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. 14 days after surgery, 101 of 595 participants (17.0%) in the dexamethasone group and 117 of 589 (19.9%) in the placebo group had complications or died (adjusted odds ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 1.08; P=0.15). In the stratum of participants who underwent non-thoracic surgery (n=1038), the primary outcome occurred in 69 of 520 participants (13.3%) in the dexamethasone group and 93 of 518 (18%) in the placebo group (adjusted odds ratio 0.70, 0.50 to 0.99).

Physical exercise, together with diet, is a milestone in its management and rehabilitation, although there is still a debate on intensity and duration of training. Anaerobic threshold (AT) is a broad term often used either as ventilatory threshold or as lactate threshold, respectively, detected by respiratory ventilation and/or respiratory gases (VCO2 and VO2), and by blood lactic acid. AIMS AND METHODOLOGY: This review outlines the role of AT and of the different variations of growth hormone and catecholamine, in subjects with obesity vs normal weight individuals below and beyond AT, during a progressive increase in exercise training. We present a re-evaluation of the effects of physical activity on body mass and metabolism of individuals with obesity in light of potential benefits and pitfalls during COVID-19 pandemic. Comparison of a training program at moderate-intensity exercise (< AT) with training performed at moderate intensity (< AT) plus a final bout of high-intensity (> AT) exercise at the end of the aerobic session will be discussed. RESULTS: Based on our data and considerations, a tailored strategy for individuals with obesity concerning the most appropriate intensity of training in the context of rehabilitation is proposed, with special regard to potential benefits of work program above AT. CONCLUSION: Adding bouts of exercise above AT may improve lactic acid and H+ disposal and improve growth hormone. Long-term aerobic exercise may improve leptin reduction. In this way, the propensity of subjects with obesity to encounter a serious prognosis of COVID-19 may be counteracted and the systemic and cardiorespiratory sequelae that may ensue after COVID-19, can be overcome.

RESULTS A total of 78 patients' datasets were analysed (12 patients were excluded due to non-compliance). Based on steps performed they were divided into quartiles; 1 (low physical activity) to 4 (high physical activity). There were no significant differences in age, smoking history, COPD, BMI, percentage predicted FEV1 and KCO and cardiovascular risk factors between the groups. There were significantly fewer total complications in quartiles 3 and 4 (high physical activity) compared to quartiles 1 and 2 (low physical activity) (8 vs 22; P = .01).

Gordon's syndrome is a form of secondary hypertension that can arise due to a number of possible mutations in key genes that encode proteins in a pathway containing the With No Lysine [K] (WNK) and its downstream target kinases, SPS/Ste20-related proline-alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress responsive kinase 1 (OSR1). This pathway regulates the activity of the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC), which is responsible for NaCl reabsorption in the distal nephron. Therefore, mutations in genes encoding proteins that regulate the NCC proteins disrupt ion homeostasis and cause hypertension by increasing NaCl reabsorption. Thiazide diuretics are currently the main treatment option for Gordon's syndrome.

The root cause of this strong trade-off relationship is high product demand variability. To mitigate the issue and reduce the cost of operating perishable inventory systems, some grocery stores utilize an opaque selling scheme: selling an anonymous product whose brand or exact specification is shielded from customers at the time of sale. The use of opaque products has now become a popular means to reduce shortage/wastage at grocery stores. However, there has been little discussion of the effectiveness of opaque schemes applied to perishable inventory systems. In this paper, we propose an opaque scheme based on the balancing policy on demand, which tries to average out orders for products. We confirm both analytically and numerically that this opaque scheme effectively reduces product demand variability, thereby reducing both shortage and wastage for perishable inventory systems under a base-stock policy. We also present an analytical formula that reveals insights into the opaque scheme: The ratio between the opaque proportion and the coefficient of variation of product demands plays a key role to determine the effectiveness of our opaque scheme. Furthermore, we provide a rule of thumb to find the threshold opaque scheme parameters needed to achieve the maximum total cost savings for perishable inventory systems. We hope that many retailers selling perishables (e.g., fresh produce and baked goods) find the opaque scheme useful, implement it, and contribute to the reduction of the food wastage.","output":"An opaque selling scheme to reduce shortage and wastage in perishable inventory systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging the international system and the regional order in which the European Union (EU) aims to re-define its role in global health.

Liquor retailers, including both private and government-run retailers, have been designated as essential services in all jurisdictions, operating under an evolving set of rules. From a public health perspective, keeping liquor retailers open during pandemic-related lockdown restrictions is a delicate decision which poses new risks and considerations about the best strategy for minimizing alcohol-related harms.

The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of a physical education program (PEP) on locomotor, object control skills, and pre-literacy cognitive functions in a wide population of preschoolers and verify whether weight status could influence these abilities. In the context of the Training-to-Health Project, a sample of 1,029 preschoolers was recruited in kindergartens from the urban area of Palermo (Italy). Their gross motor and pre-literacy skills were tested before (PRE) and after (POST) following 16 weeks (2 h/week) of a PEP, which included ludic-motor activities aimed at developing body awareness and fundamental motor and perceptual-sensory skills. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed to assess the skills before and after the intervention and to evaluate the effect of different categories of weight status on the examined variables. Regression analyses were conducted to confirm the hypothesized interrelationship between motor and pre-literacy skills in the considered sample. Both locomotor/object control and pre-literacy skills were significantly higher in children after the PEP (p < 0.05). We found 23% of overweight children and no significant difference between weight status classes in both PRE and POST PEP groups. In the POST group, higher locomotor and object control skills were mostly associated with better pre-literacy skills. This study shows that PEP was effective in improving both motor and pre-literacy skills in preschoolers independently from age and gender, while weight status did not affect these skills suggesting that this program can be administrated indifferently in children with different categories of weight status. Therefore, PEP could be a decisive education strategy to enhance motor and cognitive learning in preschool children and to achieve successful academic outcomes.","output":"Effectiveness of a Physical Education Program on the Motor and Pre-literacy Skills of Preschoolers From the Training-To-Health Project: A Focus on Weight Status"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In nursing education, virtual simulations are used to augment in-person simulation and prepare and supplement students for clinical placements.

ULs can cause excessive bleeding, pain and infertility1, and are a common cause of hysterectomy2. They emerge through at least three distinct genetic drivers: mutations in MED12 or FH, or genomic rearrangement of HMGA23. Here we created genome-wide datasets, using DNA, RNA, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and HiC chromatin immunoprecipitation (HiChIP) sequencing of primary tissues to profoundly understand the genesis of UL. We identified somatic mutations in genes encoding six members of the SRCAP histone-loading complex4, and found that germline mutations in the SRCAP members YEATS4 and ZNHIT1 predispose women to UL. Tumours bearing these mutations showed defective deposition of the histone variant H2A.Z. In ULs, H2A.Z occupancy correlated positively with chromatin accessibility and gene expression, and negatively with DNA methylation, but these correlations were weak in tumours bearing SRCAP complex mutations. In these tumours, open chromatin emerged at transcription start sites where H2A.Z was lost, which was associated with upregulation of genes. Furthermore, YEATS4 defects were associated with abnormal upregulation of bivalent embryonic stem cell genes, as previously shown in mice5. Our work describes a potential mechanism of tumorigenesis-epigenetic instability caused by deficient H2A.Z deposition-and suggests that ULs arise through an aberrant differentiation program driven by deranged chromatin, emanating from a small number of mutually exclusive driver mutations.","output":"Deficient H2A.Z deposition is associated with genesis of uterine leiomyoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, reliable prediction plays an important role in policymaking. The classical infectious disease model SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) is a compact yet simplistic temporal model.

In this paper, we combine SEIR and RNN on a graph structure to develop a hybrid spatio-temporal model to achieve both accuracy and efficiency in training and forecasting. We introduce two features on the graph structure: node feature (local temporal infection trend) and edge feature (geographic neighbor effect). For node feature, we derive a discrete recursion (called I-equation) from SEIR so that gradient descend method applies readily to its optimization. For edge feature, we design an RNN model to capture the neighboring effect and regularize the landscape of loss function so that local minima are effective and robust for prediction. The resulting hybrid model (called IeRNN) improves the prediction accuracy on state-level COVID-19 new case data from the US, out-performing standard temporal models (RNN, SEIR, and ARIMA) in 1-day and 7-day ahead forecasting.

However, people are reluctant to take the initiative to seek mental health services because of the uneven distribution of resources and stigmatization. Thus, mobile apps are considered an effective way to eliminate these obstacles and improve mental health awareness. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the quality, function, privacy measures, and evidence-based and professional background of multipurpose mental health apps in Chinese commercial app stores. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on iOS and Android platforms in China to identify multipurpose mental health apps. Two independent reviewers evaluated the identified mobile apps using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS). Each app was downloaded, and the general characteristics, privacy and security measures, development background, and functional characteristics of each app were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 40 apps were analyzed, of which 35 (87.5%) were developed by companies and 33 (82.5%) provided links to access the privacy policy; 21 (52.5%) apps did not mention the involvement of relevant professionals or the guidance of a scientific basis in the app development process. The main built-in functions of these apps include psychological education (38/40, 95%), self-assessment (34/40, 85%), and counseling (33/40, 82.5%). The overall quality average MARS score of the 40 apps was 3.54 (SD 0.39), and the total score was between 2.96 and 4.30.

In our model, viruses exhibit variable binding to cells, with better infection and replication countered by a stronger immune response and a high rate of mutation. By varying host conditions (permissivity to viral entry T and immune clearance intensity A) for large numbers of cells and viruses, we study the dynamics of how viral populations evolve from initial infection to steady state and obtain a phase diagram of the range of cell and viral responses. We find three distinct replicative strategies corresponding to three physiological classes of viral infections: acute, chronic, and opportunistic. We show similarities between our findings and the behavior of real viral infections such as common flu, hepatitis, and SARS-CoV-2019. The phases associated with the three strategies are separated by a phase transition of primarily first order, in addition to a crossover region. Our simulations also reveal a wide range of physical phenomena, including metastable states, periodicity, and glassy dynamics. Lastly, our results suggest that the resolution of acute viral disease in patients whose immunity cannot be boosted can only be achieved by significant inhibition of viral infection and replication. Author summary Virus, in particular RNA viruses, often produce offspring with slightly altered genetic composition. This process occurs both across host populations and within a single host over time. Here, we study the interactions of viruses with cells inside a host over time. In our model, the viruses encounter host cell defenses characterized by two parameters: permissivity to viral entry T and immune response A). The viruses then mutate upon reproduction, eventually resulting in a distribution of related viral types termed a quasi-species distribution. Across varying host conditions (T, A), three distinct viral quasi-species types emerge over time, corresponding to three classes of viral infections: acute, chronic and opportunistic. We interpret these results in terms of real viral types such as common flu, hepatitis, and also SARS-CoV-2019. Analysis of viral of viral mutant populations over a wide range of permissivity and immunity, for large numbers of cells and viruses, reveals phase transitions that separate the three classes of viruses, both in the infection-cycle dynamics and at steady state. We believe that such a multiscale approach for the study of within-host viral infections, spanning individual proteins to collections of cells, can provide insight into developing more effective therapies for viral disease.","output":"Modeling the dynamics of within-host viral infection and evolution predicts quasispecies distributions and phase boundaries separating distinct classes of infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is now identified in almost all countries in the world, with poorer regions being particularly more disadvantaged to efficiently mitigate the impacts of the pandemic.

We therefore investigated the variability of predialysis concentrations of uremic toxins over time. METHODS Prospectively collected predialysis serum samples of the midweek session of week 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 16 were analyzed for a panel of uremic toxins in stable chronic HD patients (N = 18) while maintaining dialyzer type and dialysis mode during the study period. RESULTS Concentrations of the analyzed uremic toxins varied substantially between individuals, but also within stable HD patients (intra-patient variability). For urea, creatinine, beta-2-microglobulin, and some protein-bound uremic toxins, Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was higher than 0.7. However, for phosphorus, uric acid, symmetric and asymmetric dimethylarginine, and the protein-bound toxins hippuric acid and indoxyl sulfate, ICC values were below 0.7, implying a concentration variability within the individual patient even exceeding 65% of the observed inter-patient variability. CONCLUSION Intra-patient variability may affect the interpretation of the association between a single concentration of certain uremic toxins and outcomes.

Study Design and Methods This study examined the systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics, ventilation, and gas exchange in 10 post-COVID-19 patients without cardio-pulmonary disease during invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing (iCPET) and compared the results to 10 age- and sex matched controls. These data were then used to define potential reasons for exertional limitation in the post-COVID-19 cohort. Results Post-COVID-19 patients exhibited markedly reduced peak exercise aerobic capacity (VO2) compared to controls (7011%predicted vs. 13145%predicted; p<0.0001). This reduction in peak VO2 was associated with impaired systemic oxygen extraction (i.e., narrow CaVO2/CaO2) compared to controls (0.490.1 vs. 0.780.1, p<0.0001) despite a preserved peak cardiac index (7.83.1 vs. 8.42.3 L/min, p>0.05). Additionally, post-COVID-19 patients demonstrated greater ventilatory inefficiency (i.e., abnormal VE/VCO2 slope: 355 vs. 275, p=0.01) compared to controls without an increase in dead space ventilation. Interpretation Post-COVID-19 patients without cardiopulmonary disease demonstrate a marked reduction in peak VO2 from a peripheral rather than a central cardiac limit along with an exaggerated hyper-ventilatory response during exercise.","output":"Persistent Exertional Intolerance after COVID-19: Insights from Invasive Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2017 and 2019 general elections showed a strong bedrock of Labour support among the working age population and particularly the under thirties.

Therefore, this study collected data from 322 employees working in manufacturing and service sectors through \\"Google Forms\\" during COVID-19. The respondents were contacted through LinkedIn platform between January and July 2021. Findings This study noted that when employees working in high-power distance cultures perceive their leaders/supervisors as abusive, they avoid confrontation and engage in silent behavior, which positively affects their KH behavior. However, employees with a high level of psychological ownership are less likely to respond to their abusive supervisors through silence because such employees feel a greater sense of belongingness and prefer to benefit their organization. Research limitations/implications This study used a cross-sectional design that restricts causality. However, the findings of this study suggest management to focus on leadership style to minimize KH at the workplace.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We queried the FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for all reported symptoms following the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines as of February 12th, 2021. All urologic symptoms were isolated and the reported adverse events associated with each symptom were reviewed. RESULTS: Out of 15,785 adverse event reports, only 0.7% (113) described urologic symptoms. A total of 156 urologic symptoms were described amongst the 113 adverse event reports. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was responsible for 61% of these reports and the Moderna vaccine was responsible for 39%. These symptoms were grouped into five different categories: Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (n = 34, 22%), Hematuria (n = 22, 14%), Urinary Infection (n = 41, 26%), Skin and/or Soft Tissue (n = 16, 10%), and Other (n = 43, 28%). The median age of the patients reporting urologic symptoms was 63 years (IQR 44-79, Range: 19-96) and 54% of the patients were female. CONCLUSION: Urologic symptoms reported after COVID-19 vaccination are extremely rare.

The effectiveness and usefulness of this therapy have been demonstrated for more than a quarter of a century. However, a documented survival benefit has not yet been demonstrable in a large, multicenter, randomized and controlled trial. Following the findings derived from a large sepsis clinical trial with PMX in North America, a new trial is ongoing to determine if PMX has a long-term survival benefit when administered to septic patients. Another approach to support a survival benefit from intervention with PMX is to utilize a detailed analysis available from a large clinical data base. The endotoxin adsorption capacity of PMX columns in vitro and the effectiveness of PMX columns can be further demonstrable in animal models. The capability of PMX and details of its mechanism of action to intervene in the sepsis cascade and impede organ dysfunction in septic patients is not fully understood. The surface antigen expression in monocytes and neutrophils are improved after PMX therapy. Immunomodulatory effects as a result of endotoxin removal and/or other mechanisms of action have been suggested. These effects and other potential immune effects may explain some of the improved effects upon organ dysfunction of sepsis and septic shock patients.

The key to success lies in the availability and accessibility of essential medicines. Pushed by developing countries and international nongovernmental organizations, the conflicts regarding public access to essential medicines and protection of patented drugs have gained global attention. This chapter briefly introduces the history of the global response to the above challenges, beginning with the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement through the adoption of the Doha declaration and the protocol amending the World Trade Organizations (WTO) agreement on TRIPS. Then, it discusses the practice of compulsory licenses in both developing and developed countries and describes the huge market demand for generic drugs against infectious disease in developing countries. Finally, the chapter describes the capacity of generic drug production in major developing countries, such as India and China, as well as the roles of these countries in providing generic drugs to patients at home and to other developing countries. History has repeated itself many times due to a continued lack of essential medicines; the initial epidemic of infectious disease in developing countries has become pandemic, spreading throughout the globe. Therefore, any efforts taken by developing countries to increase access to essential medicines against infectious disease are beneficial to people in both developing and developed countries. The developing countries with the capacity and experience to develop generic drugs for public use should learn from each other and collaborate in the research, production, and distribution of generic drugs under the rights granted by the WTO agreement. Developed countries and big pharmaceutical companies should be allies rather than opponents for the ultimate goal of health promotion for all of mankind.","output":"A Practical Way to Improve Access to Essential Medicines Against Major Infectious Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 such as lockdowns and closures of borders are disrupting the supply of agri-food products to markets and consumers.

MVC-COV1901 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine consisting of recombinant prefusion stabilized spike protein S-2P adjuvanted with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide. We explored the effectiveness of MVC-COV1901 against the VoCs. METHODS: Serum samples were taken from rats and phase 1 clinical trial human subjects immunized with a low, medium, or high dose of MVC-COV1901. The neutralizing titers of serum antibodies were assayed with pseudoviruses coated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein of the wild-type (WT), D614G, Alpha, or Beta variants. RESULTS: Rats vaccinated twice with vaccine containing high doses of antigen retained high levels of neutralization activity against the Beta variant, albeit with a slight reduction compared to WT. After the third dose, neutralizing titers against the Beta variant were noticeably enhanced regardless of the amount of antigen used for immunization. In humans, vaccinated phase 1 subjects still showed appreciable neutralization abilities against the D614G, Alpha, and Beta variants, although neutralizing titers were significantly reduced against the Beta variant. CONCLUSIONS: Two doses of MVC-COV1901 were able to elicit neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants with an overall tendency of inducing higher immune response at a higher dose level. The neutralizing titers to the Beta variant in rats and humans were lower than those for WT and the Alpha variant. An additional third dose in rats was able to partially compensate for the reduction in neutralization against the Beta variant.

Ministers' work frequently puts them in close contact with diverse groups, and therefore at higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, but this is not specific to Africa. This paper discusses five non-mutually exclusive hypotheses for the Africa-specific trend, involving comorbidity, poorly resourced healthcare and possible restrictions in accessing out-of-country health facilities, the underreporting of cases, and, later, the disproportionate impact of the so-called 'South African' variant (501Y.V2). The paper then turns its attention to the public health and political implications of the trend. While governments have measures in place to cope with the sudden loss of top officials, the COVID-19-related deaths have been associated with substantial changes in public health policy in cases where the response to the pandemic had initially been contested or minimal. Ministerial deaths may also result in a reconfiguration of political leadership, but we do not expect a wave of younger and more gender representative replacements. Rather, we speculate that a disconnect may emerge between the top leadership and the public, with junior ministers filling the void and in so doing putting themselves more at risk of infection.

Objectives: To scale up and adapt FICare to make it suitable in level IIIC NICUs, which care for extreme prematurity and other complex medical or surgical neonatal conditions. Materials and Methods: Step 1 was the creation of the FICare implementation team (FICare-IT) and baseline analysis of current procedures for critical care to identify needs, wishes, and requirements; we aimed for protocol elaboration tailored to our cultural, architectural, and clinical context (March 2017 to April 2018). Step 2 as a dissemination strategy by FICare-IT acting as primary trainers and mentors to ensure the education of 90% of nursing staff (May 2018 to July 2018). Step 3 involved piloting and evaluation with the aim to refine the procedure (July 2018 to December 2020). Results: A rigorous but flexible protocol was edited. The FICare educational manual included two curricula: for healthcare professionals/staff (Training the trainers) and for families (Education of caregivers), the latter being categorized in two intervention levels (basic and advanced), depending on the infant care needs and parent's decision. In total, 76 families and 91 infants (74.7% preterm; 18.7% complex surgery; 6.6% others) were enrolled in the pilot. No differences in acceptance rate (overall 86.4%) or in the number of infant-family dyads in the program per month were observed when considering the pre- and post-Covid-19 pandemic periods. All families, except for one who dropped out of the program, completed the agreed individualized training. Mothers spent more time in NICU than fathers (p < 0.05); uninterrupted time spent by mothers in NICU was longer during the pre-pandemic period (p < 0.01). Observed time to reach proficiency by task was within the expected time in 70% of the program contents. The parents revealed educational manuals, workshops, and cot-side teaching sessions as essential for their training, and 100% said they would accept entry into the FICare program again. Conclusions: The principles of the FICare model are suitable for all levels of care in NICUs.

Aim To map serum signatures of hospitalized symptomatic patients, positive or negative to SARS-CoV-2. Methods Patients (n = 64) admitted to Anhembi Field Municipal Hospital, a hospital set up for initial care to patients with moderate symptoms, were analyzed being discriminated in positive (n = 32) or negative patients. Age and gender were matched to ensure homogeneity in the basal metabolic rates. Three Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data set were recorded on Bruker AVANCE III 600 MHz spectrometer for serum samples analyzed in MetaboAnalyst 5.0 software platform. Results and discussion The mean age of groups was 54.92 12.41 and 54.30 12.15, for positive and negative patients, divided in 16 female and 16 male. The ethnicity was 56.2% vs 46.8% caucasian, 34.3% mixed race in both groups, and 9.3% 12.5% vs black in positive and negative groups, respectively. BMI was 24 6.93 vs 33.5 7.85 in comparison to positive and negative patients, respectively. In both groups 50% of patients presented alveolar infiltrate. Although the groups were not paired by comorbidities, they were homogeneous ensuring that the metabolic variation is due to COVID-19 as similar percentage of patients with arterial hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia. Clinical symptoms were also remarkably similar between the groups in relation to: fever, dry cough, dyspnea and myalgia. The Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) performed onto noesy1d data discriminated positively from negative patients. Also, it covered lower variance. Combining NMR techniques, it was possible to depict the main metabolites that distinguished the COVID-19 signatures. Alanine, glucose, cholesterol, and glutamine were increased, and lactate decreased in COVID-19.

However, the SFDA setting faces an effect bottleneck due to the absence of source data and target supervised information, as evidenced by the limited performance gains of newest SFDA methods. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce a more practical scenario called active source free domain adaptation (ASFDA) that permits actively selecting a few target data to be labeled by experts. To achieve that, we first find that those satisfying the properties of neighbor-chaotic, individual-different, and target-like are the best points to select, and we define them as the minimum happy (MH) points. We then propose minimum happy points learning (MHPL) to actively explore and exploit MH points. We design three unique strategies: neighbor ambient uncertainty, neighbor diversity relaxation, and one-shot querying, to explore the MH points. Further, to fully exploit MH points in the learning process, we design a neighbor focal loss that assigns the weighted neighbor purity to the cross-entropy loss of MH points to make the model focus more on them. Extensive experiments verify that MHPL remarkably exceeds the various types of baselines and achieves significant performance gains at a small cost of labeling.","output":"Active Source Free Domain Adaptation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has impacted the lives of people worldwide since being declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.

We found an association between both stress and anxiety and increased alcohol use, where twins with higher levels of stress and anxiety were more likely to report an increase in alcohol consumption. The associations were small and confounded by between-family factors and demographic characteristics. However, there was no significant difference in stress or anxiety levels between non-drinkers and those who reported no change in alcohol use.

Protein promiscuity has two broadly different types of footprint in drug design. The first is relaxed specificity of binding sites for substrates, inhibitors, effectors or cofactors. The second involves protein-protein interactions of regulatory processes such as signal transduction and transcription, and here protein intrinsic disorder plays an important role. Both viruses and host cells exploit intrinsic disorder for their survival, as do the design and discovery programs for antivirals. Drug action, strictly speaking, always relies upon promiscuous activity, with drug promiscuity enlarging its scope. Drug repurposing searches for additional promiscuity on the part of both the drug and the target in the host. Understanding the subtle nuances of these promiscuities is critical in the design of novel and more effective antivirals.","output":"Drugs, host proteins and viral proteins: how their promiscuities shape antiviral design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 850 million people worldwide1 and an estimated one in 10 adult Australians (2.4 million people).2 At the bottom of the 'CKD iceberg', one in three adult Australians is at risk of CKD.2 At the tip of the iceberg, over 26,000 Australians are currently receiving kidney replacement therapy with dialysis or transplantation.3 The burden of kidney disease is particularly high in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, with critical gaps in access to kidney care, particularly transplantation.4 There is much more to be done to address the burden of CKD in our community, as outlined in a recently published national strategy.5 Thankfully, Australians have been mostly spared the large additional burden of significant kidney failure due to COVID-19 that will have long-term implications for kidney disease care in other countries.6 In April 2021, AJGP focused on chronic kidney disease management.

Up to now, effective antiviral treatment against COVID-19 is not available. Therefore, throughout virus infections, a thorough clarification of the virus-host immune system interactions will be most probably helpful to encounter these challenges. Emerging evidence suggests that just like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 primarily suppresses the innate immune system, enabling its stable propagation during the early stage of infection. Consequently, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines have been increasing during infection progression associated with severe lung pathology. It is imperative to consider hyper inflammation in vaccine designing, as vaccine-induced immune responses must have a protective role against infection without leading to immunopathology. Among the front-line responders to viral infections, Natural Killer (NK) cells have immense therapeutic potential, forming a bridge between innate and adaptive responses. A subset of NK cells exhibits putatively increased effector functions against viruses following pathogen-specific and immunization. Memory NK cells have higher cytotoxicity and effector activity, compared with the conventional NK cells. As a pioneering strategy, prompt accumulation and long\\\\term maintenance of these memory NK cells could be an efficacious viral treatment. According to the high prevalence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection in the world, it remains to be determined whether HCMV adaptive NK cells could play a protective role against this new emerging virus. In addition, the new adaptive-like KIR+NKG2C+ NK cell subset (the adaptive-like lung tissue residue [tr]NK cell) in the context of the respiratory infection at this site could specifically exhibit the expansion upon COVID-19. Another aspect of NK cells we should note, utilizing modified NK cells such as allogeneic off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells as a state-of-the-art strategy for the treatment of COVID-19. In this line, we speculate introducing NKG2C into chimeric antigen receptors in NK cells might be a potential approach in future viral immunotherapy for emerging viruses. In this contribution, we will briefly discuss the current status and future perspective of NK cells, which provide to successfully exploit NK cell-mediated antiviral activity that may offer important new tools in COVID-19 treatment.","output":"Harnessing Memory NK Cell to Protect Against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in 13 049 survivors of suspected or confirmed COVID-19, from the UK general population, as a function of severity and hospital admission status.

While non-infectious toward mammals, many plant virus nanoparticles are recognized by the immune system and act as potent adjuvants, both in the classical setting of vaccination and cancer immunotherapy. In the context of cancer immunotherapy, we have demonstrated potent efficacy of plant virus, particularly cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) when applied intratumorally;CPMV signals through and activates multiple toll-like receptors, which primes a potent innate immune activation leading to reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment from an immunosuppressed to immune-activated state. Data in mouse models of melanoma, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, glioma, and breast cancer demonstrate potent efficacy through priming of the innate immune system leading to adaptive and systemic anti-tumor immunity and most importantly immune memory. Efficacy was also replicated in canine patients with melanoma. Given the promise of the plant virus nanotechnology as an adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy, we also have begun to utilize the technology as a vaccination platform for the generation of COVID-19 vaccine candidates. We formulated multivalent COVID-19 vaccine candidates using plant virus nanoparticles displaying SARS-CoV-2 S protein peptide B cell epitopes. The plant virus nanoparticle confers efficient lymphatic trafficking and targeting of antigen-presenting cells;the adjuvant properties of the nanotechnology lead to robust antibody levels against the target, S protein. While other vaccine candidates have advanced through clinical testing, our approach has unique advantages: The high thermal and pH stability of the plant virus nanotechnology alleviates cold chain requirements;further, the stability of the platform technology enables its integration into vaccine delivery devices such as microneedle patches that can be shipped globally and be self-administered.

This study aimed to determine the impact of self-selected music on student performance during a remote online assessment and to identify factors important for constructing ideal assessment environments. Methods: Final year students were randomized to complete a voluntary remote online 2-hour care plan test. Those randomized to music were required to play self-selected music during the assessment and those randomized to non-music were asked not to play music. Prior to the assessment, perceived stress and resilience were measured. Performance between groups was compared and associations between stress, resilience, and performance determined. A post-survey identified music preferences/acceptability, and factors identified for ideal remote assessment environments. Results: A total of 79 students completed the study (n=40 music, n=39 non-music). The median assessment score in the music group was 90% (range 58 to 99%) and 88% (range 58 to 99%) in the non-music group (not significant). No associations were found between scores and perceived stress or resilience. The majority of students randomized to music (62.5%) found it helpful. Thirteen categories of factors were identified to contribute to an ideal remote assessment environment with the most common being lighting, location, quietness, distractions, and seating/set-up.

In cultured epithelial cells, they are released in a polarized fashion; depending on the virus and cell type, they are sorted preferentially either to the apical domain or to the basolateral plasma membrane domain. In this study, we investigated the role of the coronavirus spike protein, because of its prominent position in the virion the prime sorting candidate, in the directionality of virus release. Three independent approaches were taken. (i) The inhibition of N glycosylation by tunicamycin resulted in the synthesis of spikeless virions. The absence of spikes, however, did not influence the polarity in the release of virions. Thus, murine hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) was still secreted from the basolateral membranes of mTAL and LMR cells and from the apical sides of MDCK(MHVR) cells, whereas transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was still released from the apical surfaces of LMR cells. (ii) Spikeless virions were also studied by using the MHV-A59 temperature-sensitive mutant Albany 18. When these virions were produced in infected LMR and MDCK(MHVR) cells at the nonpermissive temperature, they were again preferentially released from basolateral and apical membranes, respectively. (iii) We recently demonstrated that coronavirus-like particles resembling normal virions were assembled and released when the envelope proteins M and E were coexpressed in cells (H. Vennema, G.-J. Godeke, J. W. A. Rossen, W. F. Voorhout, M. C. Horzinek, D.-J. E. Opstelten, and P. J. M. Rottier, EMBO J. 15:2020-2028, 1996). The spikeless particles produced in mTAL cells by using recombinant Semliki Forest viruses to express these two genes of MHV-A59 were specifically released from basolateral membranes, i.e., with the same polarity as that of wild-type MHV-A59. Our results thus consistently demonstrate that the spike protein is not involved in the directional sorting of coronaviruses in epithelial cells. In addition, our observations with tunicamycin show that contrary to the results with some secretory proteins, the N-linked oligosaccharides present on the viral M proteins of coronaviruses such as TGEV also play no role in viral sorting.

One of the ICT areas, namely non-immersive virtual reality (NIVR), has become a noticeable tool to help ASD children in their social training. It provides extensive virtual interaction, a safe environment, and is affordable. An NIVR application is developed to assist the intervention on ASD children. However, the whole experiences of the training need to be validated to conclude its effectiveness. Methods: A case study was employed as the research method. An evaluation of NIVR application using multiple sources of evidence was guided by Kirkpatrick Model of Evaluation (KME) which was executed via questionnaires, pre- and post-test. The main objectives of this research were to evaluate level 1 and 2 of KME. The target for Level 1 is to assess the reactions to the NIVR application. Level 2 is to gauge the knowledge, confidence, or mindset of participants. Level 2 covers the evaluation prior to the training (pre-test) and after the training (post-test). Results: On average the ASD children had good experiences and were able to improve their social skills with the NIVR application. Therefore, the combination of serious game, analytics and specific VR type provides good data assessment, facilitate comfortable training, and can be an effective intervention for children with ASD. Conclusion: The positive trend on both levels shows that the application has a good potential to be used in ASD training. The results could be improved in a higher number of participants. Currently, only a limited number of research participants could be obtained due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Reaction and Learning Evaluation of a Non-immersive Virtual Reality Application for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Antiplatelet therapy prevents saphenous vein graft (SVG) occlusion and improves outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). However, the optimal postoperative antiplatelet regimen remains unclear. The goal of the Ticagrelor Antiplatelet Therapy to Reduce Graft Events and Thrombosis (TARGET) trial was to assess whether early postoperative ticagrelor reduces SVG occlusion compared to conventional aspirin therapy. METHODS In this multi-center double-blind randomized trial, 250 patients who had CABG with SVG were randomized to receive either aspirin 81 mg twice daily or ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily. The primary outcome was SVG occlusion at 1 year. RESULTS Altogether, 123 patients were randomized to aspirin and 127 received ticagrelor. One-year graft assessment was performed in 202 patients (80.8%), examining 588 grafts, yielding an overall graft occlusion rate of 10.9%. The primary outcome, SVG occlusion at 1 year, did not significantly differ between the two groups (17.4% vs. 13.2%, aspirin vs. ticagrelor, p = .30). The incidence of vein grafts with any disease (stenosis or occlusion) did not significantly differ between the groups (21.5% vs. 22.3%, aspirin vs. ticagrelor, p = .90), and the number of patients with vein graft disease did not significantly differ between the groups (29.4% vs. 28.0%, aspirin vs. ticagrelor, p = .88). Freedom from major adverse cardiovascular events at 1 year was similar between the groups (p = .60). CONCLUSIONS Compared to conventional aspirin therapy, ticagrelor did not significantly reduce vein graft occlusion 1 year after CABG.

In this report, we will focus on a management model covering the two phases of the COVID-19 emergency, namely lockdown-phase I and post-lockdown-phase II. METHODS: The following steps were taken in the two phases: workload during visits and radiotherapy planning, use of dedicated routes, measures for triage areas, management of suspected and positive COVID-19 cases, personal protective equipment, hospital environments and intra-institutional meetings and tumor board management. Due to the guidelines set out by the Ministry of Health, oncological follow-up visits were interrupted during the lockdown-phase I; consequently, we set about contacting patients by telephone, with laboratory and instrumental exams being viewed via telematics. During the post-lockdown-phase II, the oncological follow-up clinic reopened, with two shifts operating daily. RESULTS: By comparing our radiotherapy activity from March 9 to May 4 2019 with the same period in 2020 during full phase I of the COVID-19 emergency, similar results were achieved. First radiotherapy visits, Simulation Computed Tomography and Linear Accelerator treatments amounted to 123, 137 and 151 in 2019 compared with 121, 135 and 170 in 2020 respectively. There were no cases of COVID-19 positivity recorded either in patients or in healthcare professionals, who were all negative to the swab tests performed. CONCLUSION: During both phases of the COVID-19 emergency, the planned model used in our own experience guaranteed both continuity in radiotherapy treatments whilst neither reducing workload nor interrupting treatment and, as such, it ensured the safety of cancer patients, hospital environments and staff.","output":"COVID-19 and radiation oncology: the experience of a two-phase plan within a single institution in central Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cleaning is one of the fundamental tasks with prime importance given in our day-to-day life.

However, data on outcomes of COVID\\\\19 among people with pre\\\\existing diagnosis of heart failure (HF) have not been studied in sufficient detail. We aimed to perform detailed characterization of the association of pre\\\\existing HF with COVID\\\\19 outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective cohort study based on Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data comparing 30 day mortality and hospital admission rates after COVID\\\\19 diagnosis among Veterans with and without pre\\\\existing diagnosis of HF. Cox\\\\regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) with adjustment for covariates. Among 31 051 veterans (97% male) with COVID\\\\19, 6148 had pre\\\\existing diagnosis of HF. The mean (SD) age of patients with HF was 70 (13) whereas the mean (SD) age of patients without HF was 57 (17). Within the HF group with available data on left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), 1844 patients (63.4%) had an EF of >45%, and 1063 patients (36.6%) had an EF of 45%. Patients in the HF cohort had higher 30 day mortality (5.4% vs. 1.5%) and admission (18.5% vs. 8.4%) rates after diagnosis of COVID\\\\19. After adjustment for age, sex, and race, HRs (95% CIs) for 30 day mortality and for 30 day hospital admissions were 1.87 (1.61C2.17) and 1.79 (1.66C1.93), respectively.

Patients without COVID-19 symptoms and isolated musculoskeletal injuries were redirected to the OAU. METHODS: We prospectively reviewed patients throughput during the peak of the global pandemic (7 May 2020 to 7 June 2020) and compared with our historic service provision (7 May 2019 to 7 June 2019). The Mann-Whitney and Fisher Exact tests were used to test the statistical significance of data. RESULTS: A total of 1,147 patients were seen, with peak attendances between 11am and 2pm; 96% of all referrals were seen within 4h. The majority of patients were seen by orthopaedic registrars (52%) and nurse practitioners (44%). The majority of patients suffered from sprains and strains (39%), followed by fractures (22%) and wounds (20%); 73% of patients were discharged on the same day, 15% given follow up, 8% underwent surgery and 3% were admitted but did not undergo surgery. Our volume of trauma admissions and theatre cases decreased by 22% and 17%, respectively (p=0.058; 0.139). There was a significant reduction of virtual fracture clinic referrals after reconfiguration of services (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rapid implementation of a specialist OAU during a pandemic can provide early definitive trauma care while exceeding national waiting time standards. The fall in trauma attendances was lower than anticipated.

Based on animal studies, it has been proposed that central sensitization associated to nociception (maladaptive plasticity) and plasticity related to the sensorimotor learning (adaptive plasticity) share similar neural mechanisms and compete with each other. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether experimental tonic pain influences motor learning (acquisition and next-day retention) of a new locomotor task. Thirty healthy human subjects performed a locomotor adaptation task (perturbing force field applied to the ankle during swing using a robotized orthosis) on 2 consecutive days. Learning was assessed using kinematic measures (peak and mean absolute plantarflexion errors) and electromyographic (EMG) activity. Half of the participants performed the locomotor adaptation task with pain on Day 1 (capsaicin cream around the ankle), while the task was performed pain-free for all subjects on Day 2 to assess retention. Pain had no significant effect on baseline gait parameters nor on performance during the locomotor adaptation task (for either kinematic or EMG measures) on Day 1. Despite this apparently normal motor acquisition, pain-free Day 2 performance was markedly and significantly impaired in the Pain group, indicating that pain during training had an impact on the retention of motor memories (interfering with consolidation and/or retrieval). These results suggest that the same motor rehabilitation intervention could be less effective if administered in the presence of pain.","output":"Tonic pain experienced during locomotor training impairs retention despite normal performance during acquisition."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review presents state-of-the-art knowledge and identifies knowledge gaps for future research in the area of exercise-associated modifications of infection susceptibility. Regular moderate-intensity exercise is believed to have beneficial effects on immune health through lowering inflammation intensity and reducing susceptibility to respiratory infections. However, strenuous exercise, as performed by professional athletes, may promote infection: in about half of athletes presenting respiratory symptoms, no causative pathogen can be identified. Acute bouts of exercise enhance the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, which may induce infection-like respiratory symptoms. Relatively few studies have assessed the influence of regularly-repeated exercise on the immune response and systemic inflammation compared to the effects of acute exercise. Additionally, ambient and environmental conditions may modify the systemic inflammatory response and infection susceptibility, particularly in outdoor athletes. Both acute and chronic regular exercise influence humoral and cellular immune response mechanisms, resulting in decreased specific and non-specific response in competitive athletes. The most promising areas of further research in exercise immunology include detailed immunological characterization of infection-prone and infection-resistant athletes, examining the efficacy of nutritional and pharmaceutical interventions as countermeasures to infection symptoms, and determining the influence of various exercise loads on susceptibility to infections with respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

The Gallups tracking poll findings from 9/16/2020 to 9/29/2020 showed that 63% of Americans would be agreeable to being vaccinated if an FDA-approved vaccine were available to them at no cost. A survey conducted in France from March to July 2020 to determine COVID-19 vaccine acceptance specifically amongst health care workers (HCW) revealed that 75% of their HCWs intended to be vaccinated. Our literature search however did not yield studies assessing the acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine amongst HCWs, specifically in the United States. The aim of this study was to determine COVID-19 vaccination rates amongst HCWs within a single hospital, any differences between HCWs acceptability of the vaccine, and which factors were most important in their decision-making. Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study of HCWs at Ascension Macomb-Oakland Hospital was conducted in February 2021 C March 2021 soon after vaccines became available at the hospital. A SurveyMonkey was mass-distributed by email to HCWs including doctors, nurses, administrators, pharmacists, technicians, and secretaries. Any HCW that was over the age of 18 years of age was eligible to participate. A series of 15 questions were asked in a multiple choice and scale format. Result: A total of 574 out of the 2900 HCWs completed the survey. Of these, 487 (84.8%) either accepted or intended to get vaccinated within the next 3 months. 62 (10.8%) would decline the vaccine over the next 3 months and 25 (4.4%) remained undecided. The mean age of respondents was 45. The majority of surveys were completed by females (75.7%). The mean age of HCWs willing to accept the vaccine was greater compared to those who declined the vaccine (40 years of age vs 46 years of age). There was a higher proportion of Democrats willing to accept the vaccine than those who declined the vaccine (27% vs 9.8%). The most important factors for those that decided to take the vaccine were protection of their own health;protection of health of patients, family, or friends;and trust in the science. The most important factors in those that either declined or were undecided about the vaccine were concern for safety profile and side effects of vaccine, uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine, and the accelerated development of the vaccine. Conclusions: As one of the nations hotspots for the highest rates of positive COVID-19 cases and deaths, a survey to assess acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine showed that a majority of HCWs had either taken or planned to take the vaccine. HCWs background in science and the proximity and frequency in which they work with COVID-19+ patients were felt to account for the difference in vaccination rates between the general public and HCWs.","output":"72 Perceptions of the COVID-19 Vaccine Amongst Health Care Workers in a Southeast Michigan Hospital: A Cross-Sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dit nummer was al klaar en vormgegeven toen de pleuris uitbrak rondom het coronavirus en alle scholen en kinderopvang moesten sluiten.

It is usually processed through a biomethanation digester and the end product is the post-methanated distillery effluent (PMDE). Research have shown that PMDE released by molasses-based distilleries is a hazardous effluent that can cause harm to the biota and the environment; it contains elevated amount of total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS) and excess levels of persistent organic compounds (POPs), heavy metals, phenolic compounds, and salts. The practice of wastewater reuse for irrigation in many water scarce countries necessitates the proper treatment of PMDE before it is discharged into receiving water. Convention methods have been in practice for decades, but innovative technologies are needed to enhance the efficiency of PMDE treatment.

In this study, a greenhouse experiment was conducted to explore the tolerance capacities of B. papyrifera and its phytoremediation potential in the HM-contaminated soil. The results indicated that B. papyrifera could effectively decrease malondialdehyde (MDA) content by enhancing the antioxidant enzyme activities along with the cultivation in the HM-contaminated soil. Significant (p < 0.05) negative relationships were found between MDA content and superoxide dismutase (r = -0.620) and catalase activities (r = -0.702) in B. papyrifera leaves. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy analysis indicated that the main functional groups in B. papyrifera roots were slightly influenced by HMs, and organic acids, carbohydrates, protein, and amino acids might bind with HMs in plant roots to alleviate the adverse effect of HMs on plants growth. Meanwhile, B. papyrifera had great potential used for the phytoextraction of Cd and Zn in HM-contaminated soil. The maximum total Cd and Zn accumulation amount in B. papyrifera shoots could attach to 2.26 and 66.8 mgpot-1, respectively.

Empirical study is urgently needed to reliably assess the causal effects of mobility restriction. Methods Our study applied the difference-in-difference (DID) model to assess declines of population mobility at the city level, and used the log-log regression model to examine the effects of population mobility declines on the disease spread measured by cumulative or new cases of COVID-19 over time, after adjusting for confounders. Results The DID model showed that a continual expansion of the relative declines over time in 2020. After four weeks, population mobility declined by 54.81% (interquartile ranges, -65.50% to -43.56%). The accrued population mobility declines were associated with significant reduction of cumulative COVID-19 cases throughout six weeks (i.e., 1% decline of population mobility was associated with 0.72% (95%CI 0.50% to 0.93%) reduce of cumulative cases for one week, 1.42% two weeks, 1.69% three weeks, 1.72% four weeks,1.64% five weeks and 1.52% six weeks). The impact on weekly new cases seemed greater in the first four weeks, but faded thereafter. The effects on cumulative cases differed by cities of different population sizes, with greater effects seen in larger cities. Conclusion Persistent population mobility restrictions are well deserved. However, a change in the degree of mobility restriction may be warranted over time, particularly after several weeks of rigorous mobility restriction. Implementation of mobility restrictions in major cities with large population sizes may be even more important.","output":"Quantifying the impacts of human mobility restriction on the spread of COVID-19: an empirical analysis from 344 cities of China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The benefits of preoperative intravenous (IV) iron treatment in cardiac surgery patients with preoperative anaemia or iron deficiency have not been well-established. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effects of treating preoperative anaemia or iron deficiency with IV iron in adult cardiac surgery patients. METHODS: We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval Systems Online and Excerpta Medica Database for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing IV iron to oral iron or no iron. We performed title and abstract, full-text screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment independently and in duplicate. We pooled data using a random effects model and evaluated the overall quality of evidence. RESULTS: We identified 4 RCTs and 7 observational studies. Pooled data from observational studies suggested a benefit of IV iron compared to no iron on mortality [relative risk 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23-0.65; P < 0.001, very low quality], units transfused per patient (mean difference -1.22, 95% CI -1.85 to -0.60; P < 0.001, very low quality), renal injury (relative risk 0.50, 95% CI 0.36-0.69; P < 0.001, very low quality) and hospital length of stay (mean difference -4.24 days, 95% CI -6.86 to -1.63; P = 0.001, very low quality). Pooled data from RCTs demonstrated a reduction in the number of patients transfused with IV iron compared to oral or no iron (relative risk 0.81, 95% CI 0.70-0.94; P = 0.005, moderate quality). The pooled estimates of effect from RCTs for mortality, hospital length of stay, units transfused per patient and renal injury were consistent in direction with observational studies.

The authors describe the two different formats and advantages such as access to multiple speakers on diverse, innovative topics and decreased financial burdens to the host program. However, the authors do acknowledge some disadvantages from lack of face-to-face social interaction/networking and the need to consider time-zone differences. Both new programs were embraced by trainees at the authors' own institution and residents/medical students across the United States and Canada and around the world.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a prognostic model to predict and identify high-risk patients for CHD among snorers with uncontrolled hypertension. METHODS: Records from 1,822 snorers with uncontrolled hypertension were randomly divided into a training set (n = 1,275, 70%) and validation set (n = 547, 30%). Predictors for CHD were extracted to construct a nomogram model based on multivariate Cox regression analysis. We performed a single-split verification and 1,000 bootstraps resampling internal validation to assess the discrimination and consistency of the prediction model using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration plots. Based on the linear predictors, a risk classifier for CHD could be set. RESULTS: Age, waist circumference (WC), and high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C and LDL-C) were extracted as the predictors to generate this nomogram model. The C-index was 0.720 (95% confidence interval 0.663C0.777) in the derivation cohort and 0.703 (0.630C0.776) in the validation cohort. The AUC was 0.757 (0.626C0.887), 0.739 (0.647C0.831), and 0.732 (0.665C0.799) in the training set and 0.689 (0.542C0.837), 0.701 (0.606C0.796), and 0.712 (0.615C0.808) in the validation set at 3, 5, and 8 years, respectively. The calibration plots showed acceptable consistency between the probability of CHD-free survival and the observed CHD-free survival in the training and validation sets. A total of more than 134 points in the nomogram can be used in the identification of high-risk patients for CHD among snorers with uncontrolled hypertension. CONCLUSION: We developed a CHD risk prediction model in snorers with uncontrolled hypertension, which includes age, WC, HDL-C, and LDL-C, and can help clinicians with early and quick identification of patients with a high risk for CHD.","output":"Development and Validation of a Prognostic Model to Predict High-Risk Patients for Coronary Heart Disease in Snorers With Uncontrolled Hypertension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In the beginning of January 2020, new unknown virus pneumonia cases started to emerge in local hospitals in Wuhan, China.

Telehealth visit completion rates were compared by patient characteristics using the chi-square test and t-test. We used zip code data to generate latitude- and longitude-based maps of the range and density of service delivery. Patient cases highlighting challenges and opportunities for adolescent telehealth were summarized. RESULTS: Between March 16 and April 15, 2020, 392 telehealth visits were scheduled in 331 unique patients, with an 82% appointment completion rate. Video visits were conducted for eating disorders (39%), contraception/menstrual disorders (22%), gender-affirming care (17%), general adolescent medicine (15%), HIV treatment (6%), and substance abuse (1%). The majority of telehealth patients were female Caucasian minors with private insurance. There were no significant differences in telehealth visit completion rates by age, sex, gender, or insurance. Patients coded as non-white (African-American, Asian, or other) in the EHR had lower visit completion rates than white patients (p = .003).

Such a narrow molecular focus raises the specter of viral immune evasion as a potential failure mode for these biomedical interventions. With the emergence of new strains of SARS-CoV-2 with altered transmissibility and immune evasion potential, a critical question is this: how easily can the virus escape neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) targeting the spike RBD? To answer this question, we combined an analysis of the RBD structure-function with an evolutionary modeling framework. Our structure-function analysis revealed that epitopes for RBD-targeting nAbs overlap one another substantially and can be evaded by escape mutants with ACE2 affinities comparable to the wild type, that are observed in sequence surveillance data and infect cells in vitro. This suggests that the fitness cost of nAb-evading mutations is low. We then used evolutionary modeling to predict the frequency of immune escape before and after the widespread presence of nAbs due to vaccines, passive immunization or natural immunity. Our modeling suggests that SARS-CoV-2 mutants with one or two mildly deleterious mutations are expected to exist in high numbers due to neutral genetic variation, and consequently resistance to vaccines or other prophylactics that rely on one or two antibodies for protection can develop quickly -and repeatedly- under positive selection. Predicted resistance timelines are comparable to those of the decay kinetics of nAbs raised against vaccinal or natural antigens, raising a second potential mechanism for loss of immunity in the population. Strategies for viral elimination should therefore be diversified across molecular targets and therapeutic modalities.","output":"Risk of rapid evolutionary escape from biomedical interventions targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Many digital health technologies capable of atrial fibrillation (AF) detection are directly available to patients.

Although many concerns about it have been highlighted, its impact on children and adolescents has scarcely been examined. The purpose of this study was to explore behavioral consequences and coping strategies related to the pandemic among families in Italy, by focusing on developmental ages from the caregivers' perspective, 3 weeks into quarantine. An exploratory cross-sectional online survey was conducted over 14 days. Google Forms was employed to conduct the survey. Demographic variables and pre-existing Psychological Weaknesses (PsW) were asked. Adults' sleep difficulties (SleepScore) and coping strategies during quarantine were assessed. Behavioral changes related to quarantine of both subjects completing the form (COVIDStress) and their children (when present) were questioned. Of the 6,871 respondents, we selected 6,800 valid questionnaires; 3,245 declared children aged under 18 years of age (caregivers). PsWs were recognizable in 64.9% among non-caregivers and in 61.5% of caregivers, with a mean PsW score of 1.42  1.26 and 1.30  1.25 over 3 points, respectively. The 95.5% of the non-caregivers and the 96.5% of caregivers presented behavioral changes with a mean COVIDStress of 3.85  1.82 and 4.09  1.79 over 8, respectively (p<0.001). Sleep difficulties were present in the 61.6% of the non-caregivers and in the 64.4% of the caregivers (p < 0.001), who showed higher SleepScores (2.41  1.26 against 2.57  1.38 points over 6, p < 0.001). COVIDStress (and SleepScore) strongly correlated with PsW (p < 0.001). Caregivers observed behavioral changes in their children in the 64.3% of the <6 years old and in 72.5% of 6C18 years old. Caregivers' discomfort related to quarantine (COVIDStress, SleepScore) was strongly associated to behavioral changes in both age groups of <6 and 6C18 (p < 0.001). Presence of caregivers' coping strategies was less associated to behavioral changes in the <6 sample (p = 0.001) but not in the 6C18 (p = 0.06). The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted families in Italy with regard to behavioral changes, especially in high-risk categories with PsWs and caregivers, especially the ones with children aged <6 years. While coping strategies functioned as protective factors, a wide array of stress symptoms had implications for children's and adolescents' behaviors.

Many peculiarities arise in dealing with outpatient and inpatient dialysis patients, patients with chronic kidney disease, or kidney transplantation. We conducted this first nationwide survey in German dialysis facilities to map the situation in May 2020, to explore the feasibility of the hygiene recommendations, and to identify changes in non-dialysis CKD-patient treatment. Methods A cross-sectional voluntary online questionnaire survey with 65 items was distributed by email using the mailing list of the DGfN as the scientific association for Nephrology, the Verband Deutscher Nierenzentren (DN) as the association of German dialysis facilities in private practice, and the Kuratorium fr Dialyse und Nierentransplantation (KfH), the largest non-profit dialysis service provider in Germany. The target population was nephrologists in dialysis facilities. 382 participants took part in the survey. Results The majority of centers were able to treat SARS-CoV-2- infected dialysis patients or had agreements with other centers to transfer these patients. Until mid-May 42% already treated SARS-CoV-2 infected dialysis Patients. Compliance with the hygiene recommendations is considered high among employees and patients. Nevertheless 18% of the facilities reported infected staff, which in 55% of the cases were presumably work-related. Changes in the area of deployment of employees who belong to the risk group pressurize personnel situation in the dialysis facilities, as well as sickness-related absences or quarantine orders by the health authorities. Perspectively a majority expects economic losses (82%), shortage of safety equipment (53%) and staff (74%), respectively. Conclusion The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had a significant impact on the care of patients with chronic kidney disease, but there were no obvious deficits in care. This is probably due to the high degree of cooperation among dialysis provider and comprehensive recommendations of nephrologists societies.","output":"Impact of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on the Treatment and Care of Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease in Germany: Results of a Nationwide Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal and psychosocial problems have tended to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire (CMDQ), ProFitMap-Neck questionnaire, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Upper Extremity Functional Index (UEFI) were used to evaluate musculoskeletal problems; the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used to evaluate anxiety and depression, respectively; and the Work-Life Balance Scale (WLBS) was used to evaluate how well individuals achieve this balance. Information about before online education, during online education, and after training was obtained with the assessments. After the first assessment, telerehabilitation, which involved presentations and brochures, was applied to 18 participants willing to participate in the training. RESULTS: The ProFitMap, UEFI, and WLBS scores during the online education decreased significantly, while the scores of the CMDQ, ODI, BDI, and BAI during the online education increased significantly compared to the pre-online education scores (pa<a0.05). In addition, the total CMDQ, ProFitMap, and ODI scores improved significantly after the training (pa<a0.05). CONCLUSION: Musculoskeletal and psychosocial problems increased in teachers during online education. Preventive telerehabilitation methods will be beneficial for individuals who do not have access to face-to-face physiotherapy.","output":"The musculoskeletal problems and psychosocial status of teachers giving online education during the COVID-19 pandemic and preventive telerehabilitation for musculoskeletal problems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dysregulation of the immune response plays an important role in the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A cytokine storm, which is a phenomenon associated with uncontrolled production of large amounts of cytokines, very often affects patients with COVID-19. Elevated activity of chemotactic cytokines, called chemokines, can lead to serious consequences. CXCL10 has an ability to activate its receptor CXCR3, predominantly expressed on macrophages, T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and B cells. So, it has been suggested that the chemokine CXCL10, through CXCR3, is associated with inflammatory diseases and may be involved in the development of COVID-19. Therefore, in this review paper, we focus on the role of CXCL10 overactivity in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. We performed an extensive literature search for our investigation using the MEDLINE/PubMed database. Increased concentrations of CXCL10 were observed in COVID-19. Elevated levels of CXCL10 were reported to be associated with a severe course and disease progression. Published studies revealed that CXCL10 may be a very good predictive biomarker of patient outcome in COVID-19, and that markedly elevated CXCL10 levels are connected with ARDS and neurological complications. It has been observed that an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 leads to inhibition of cytokine storm, as well as reduction of CXCL10 concentrations. It seems that modulation of the CXCL10CCXCR3 axis may be an effective therapeutic target of COVID-19. This review describes the potential role of CXCL10 in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, as well as its potential immuneCtherapeutic significance. However, future studies should aim to confirm the prognostic, clinical, and therapeutic role of CXCL10 in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"What Is Currently Known about the Role of CXCL10 in SARS-CoV-2 Infection?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of standard procedures for the diagnosis of osteoporosis and assessment of fracture risk significantly decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, while the incidence of fragility fractures was mostly unaltered.

This article investigates the perceived impact of COVID-19 on the continuation of locally available services for addressing opioid use disorder (OUD). Methods: A national survey of US LHDs was conducted from November to December 2020. The survey asked key personnel in LHDs about the availability of OUD services in their jurisdiction, and how COVID-19 impacted such availability (i.e., whether terminated or continued at a reduced, the same, or an increased level after the arrival of COVID-19). Proportions for each impact category were estimated for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery services. Logistic regression tested for rural-urban and regional differences in perceived service impact. Results: An 11.4% (214 out of 1873) response rate was attained. Of the returned surveys, 187 were used in the analysis. Reported terminations were generally low, especially for treatment services. School-based prevention initiatives had the highest termination rate (17.2%, 95% CI = 11.4-25.1%). Prevention services had the highest proportions for continuing at a reduced level, except for recovery mutual help programs (53.9%, 95% CI = 45.2-62.4%). LHDs reported continuing services at an increased level at a higher frequency than terminating. Notably, 72.2% (95% CI = 62.7-80.0%) continued telehealth/telemedicine options for OUD at an increased level, and 23.8% (95% CI = 17.8-31.1%) and 10.0% (95% CI = 5.7-16.7%) reported doing the same for naloxone distribution and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), respectively. More harm reduction services were continued at the same versus at a reduced level. Service continuation differed little between rural-urban LHDs or by region. Conclusions: The impacts of COVID-19 on OUD service availability in LHD jurisdictions may depend on the specific area of opioid response while the long-term consequences of these changes remain unknown.","output":"Perceived impact of COVID-19 on prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery services for opioid use disorder: National survey of local health departments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Face masks or coverings are effective at reducing airborne infection rates, yet pandemic mitigation measures, including wearing face coverings, have been suggested to contribute to reductions in quality of life and poorer mental health.

In this context, we launched a study to analyze the epidemiological characteristics and the socio-economic impact of the spring outbreak in the population. METHOD: We conducted an online survey of the participants of the CARTaGENE population-based cohort, composed of middle-aged and older adults. We collected information on socio-demographic, lifestyle, health condition, COVID-19 related symptoms and COVID-19 testing. We studied the association between these factors and two outcomes: the status of having been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and the status of having received a positive test. These associations were measured with univariate and multivariate analyses using a hybrid tree-based regression model. RESULTS: Among the 8,129 respondents from the CARTaGENE cohort, 649 were tested for COVID-19 and 41 were positive. Medical workers and individuals having a contact with a COVID-19 patient had the highest probabilities of being tested (32% and 42.4%, respectively) and of being positive (17.2% and 13.0%, respectively) among those tested. Approximately 8% of the participants declared that they have experienced at least one of the four COVID-19 related symptoms chosen by the Public Health authorities (fever, cough, dyspnea, anosmia) but were not tested. Results from the tree-based model analyses adjusted on exposure factors showed that the combination of dyspnea, dry cough and fever was highly associated with being tested whereas anosmia, fever, and headache were the most discriminant factors for having a positive test among those tested. During the spring outbreak, more than one third of the participants have experienced a decrease in access to health services. There were gender and age differences in the socio-economic and emotional impacts of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: We have shown some discrepancies between the symptoms associated with being tested and being positive. In particular, the anosmia is a major discriminant symptom for positivity whereas ear-nose-throat symptoms seem not to be COVID-19 related. The results also emphasize the need of increasing the accessibility of testing for the general population.

This study focusses on the viewpoint of the orthopedic residents to the paradigm shift in clinical care as well as the academic activities. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was created in an online survey generator and was sent through e-mail to 227 orthopedic residents of seven tertiary care centres in North India. The questionnaire was divided into three sections, academic activity section, mental health section, and clinical activity section. There were a total of 44 single answer questions with answers according to the increasing difficulty at present situation compared to a previous time before the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 158 questionnaires were filled by 107 junior residents (67.7%) and 51 senior residents (32.3%). 49 residents (31%) were quarantined and three became positive for COVID-19. Although all of them knew about necessary precautions, personal protective equipment was difficult to avail at times. Increased difficulty in recruiting new patients for research (48.9%) and conducting prospective research (48.7%) was observed. The online-based learning process was reported to be easier (44.2%) by most of the residents. Routine clinical work in the operating room, out-patient department, and inpatient department was found to be difficult according to the majority of the residents along with the anxiety of contracting the infection. CONCLUSION: There are unique opportunities for improvement of residency programs during these times of uncertainty and the findings of this study can help the universities as well as program chairs to develop a robust program that can outlive this pandemic.

This chapter explains that the family Coronaviridae is included with the families Arteriviridae and Roniviridae in the order nidovirales; viruses in these three families share a distinctive replication strategy. The genus Coronavirus contains a substantial number of pathogens of mammals and birds that individually cause a remarkable variety of diseases, including pneumonia, reproductive disease, enteritis, polyserositis, sialodacryoadenitis, hepatitis, encephalomyelitis, nephritis, and various other disorders. The genus Coronavirus can be subdivided into at least three cluster groups on the basis of genetic and serologic properties, with subgroups in two of these. Group 1a includes transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine, porcine respiratory coronavirus, canine coronavirus, feline enteric coronavirus, ferret and mink coronaviruses, and spotted hyena coronavirus.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of high-resolution contrast enhanced 3D time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiography using new generation 3 T imaging technology to provide detailed visualization of CN VI anatomy, particularly within the cavernous sinus and petroclival regions. METHODS Two neuroradiologists conducted bilateral evaluation of CN VI visibility in 23 patients for nerve segments located in the petroclival segment (dural cave and Dorello's canal), and three divisions of the cavernous sinus. All images were collected using contrast enhanced TOF MR angiography using a new generation 3 T machine. RESULTS Of the CN VI segments assessed, average visibility of CN VI was best achieved in Dorello's canal. Overall visibility of CN VI within the regions inspected was best achieved in the axial view, with the exception of the dural cave, which was best assessed using the coronal view. We also identified strong agreement in assessment of nerve visibility between the two reviewers. We also identified a putative CN6 duplication and a small schwannoma, highlighting the fidelity of our approach. CONCLUSION Contrast enhanced 3D TOF MR angiography can visualize CN VI anatomy, particularly within the petrocavernosal region and cavernous sinus with simultaneous visualization of arterial and venous structures. This cannot be easily achieved using traditional MRI techniques.

Inadequate LBP control has consequences on the mental and physical health of patients. Thus, acquiring new information on LBP mechanism would increase the available therapeutic tools. Resveratrol is a natural compound with many beneficial effects. In this study, we investigated the role of resveratrol on behavioral changes, inflammation and oxidative stress induced by LBP. Ten microliters of Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) was injected in the lumbar intervertebral disk of Sprague Dawley rats to induce degeneration, and resveratrol was administered daily. Behavioral analyses were performed on day zero, three, five and seven, and the animals were sacrificed to evaluate the molecular pathways involved. Resveratrol administration alleviated hyperalgesia, motor disfunction and allodynia. Resveratrol administration significantly reduced the loss of notochordal cells and degenerative changes in the intervertebral disk. From the molecular point of view, resveratrol reduced the 5th/6th lumbar (L5-6) spinal activation of the WNT pathway, reducing the expression of WNT3a and cysteine-rich domain frizzled (FZ)8 and the accumulation of cytosolic and nuclear -catenin. Moreover, resveratrol reduced the levels of TNF- and IL-18 that are target genes strictly downstream of the WNT/-catenin pathway. It also showed important anti-inflammatory activities by reducing the activation of the NFkB pathway, the expression of iNOS and COX-2, and the levels of PGE2 in the lumbar spinal cord. Moreover, resveratrol reduced the oxidative stress associated with inflammation and pain, as shown by the observed reduced lipid peroxidation and increased GSH, SOD, and CAT activities. Therefore, resveratrol administration controlled the WNT/-catenin pathway and the related inflammatory and oxidative alterations, thus alleviating the behavioral changes induced by LBP.","output":"Resveratrol Inhibition of the WNT/-Catenin Pathway following Discogenic Low Back Pain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Initial COVID-19 containment in the United States focused on limiting mobility, including school and workplace closures. However, these interventions have had enormous societal and economic costs. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of an alternative control strategy, test-trace-quarantine: routine testing of primarily symptomatic individuals, tracing and testing their known contacts, and placing their contacts in quarantine. We perform this analysis using Covasim, an open-source agent-based model, which has been calibrated to detailed demographic, mobility, and epidemiological data for the Seattle region from January through June 2020. With current levels of mask use and schools remaining closed, we find that high but achievable levels of testing and tracing are sufficient to maintain epidemic control even under a return to full workplace and community mobility and with low vaccine coverage. The easing of mobility restrictions in June 2020 and subsequent scale-up of testing and tracing programs through September provided real-world validation of our predictions. Although we show that test-trace-quarantine can control the epidemic in both theory and practice, its success is contingent on high testing and tracing rates, high quarantine compliance, relatively short testing and tracing delays, and moderate to high mask use.

In the current emergency phase, the problem of infections in residential structures for the elderly is taking on considerable importance in relation to the significant prevalence rates of COVID-19. SAFETY IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES: Prevention and control measures for SARS-CoV-2 infection in nursing homes should be planned before a possible outbreak of COVID-19 occurs and should be intensified during any exacerbation of the same. Each facility should identify a properly trained contact person-also external-for the prevention and control of infections, who can refer to a multidisciplinary support committee and who is in close contact with the local health authorities. The contact person should collaborate with professionals in order to prepare a prevention and intervention plan that considers national provisions and scientific evidence, the requirements for reporting patients with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, the indications for the management of suspected, probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Adequate risk management in residential structures implies the establishment of a coordination committee with dedicated staff, the implementation of a surveillance program for the rapid recognition of the outbreaks, the identification of suitable premises and equipment, the application of universal precautions, the adaptation of care plans to reduce the possibility of contagion among residents, the protection of operators and staff training initiatives.","output":"Expanding frontiers of risk management: care safety in nursing home during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Massive screening campaigns for SARS-CoV-2 are currently carried out throughout the world, relying on reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) following nasopharyngeal swabbing performed by a healthcare professional. Yet, due to the apprehension of pain induced by nasopharyngeal probing, poor adhesion to those screening campaigns can be observed. To enhance voluntary participation and to avoid unnecessary exposition to SARS-CoV-2, self-swabbing could be proposed. To date, no data have been published concerning pain induced by conventional- or self-swabbing. Thus, the primary objective of the present study was to evaluate pain induced with the conventional swabbing method and compare it to self-swabbing. Secondary objectives focused on swabbing-induced discomfort and acceptability of the two methods. METHODS The study was conducted in Clermont-Ferrand medical school (France). Overall, 190 students were randomised into 2 groups and experienced either self- or conventional-swabbing. Each subject had to rate pain, discomfort and acceptability of such swabbing on a 0-10 numeric rating scale. RESULTS No significant difference was found between the two methods. Mean pain level was 2.51.9, 28% rating pain as 4/10. Discomfort was 4.82.2, 66% indicating significant (4/10) discomfort. Higher pain and discomfort were associated with female sex. Acceptability was 8/10 for 89.0% of the subjects and all would have accepted to undergo a new test with the same technique if necessary. CONCLUSION Both conventional and self-swabbing induce low levels of pain for most young healthy volunteers whereas discomfort is very frequent.

The objective of this study was to quantify and describe US adults who delayed dental care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional responses collected from a nationally representative and long-running panel survey of US adults conducted in late May and early June 2020 (response rate = 70%). The survey included questions about dental care delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, purpose of the delayed dental visits, timing of future dental visits, and demographic information. Pearsons chi-square tests were used to determine if rates of delayed dental care varied by subgroup. A multivariable regression model, adjusted for age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, census division, and rurality, was estimated to predict the odds of reporting delayed dental care. RESULTS: Nearly half of respondents (46.7%) reported delaying going to the dentist or receiving dental care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among adults who reported delaying dental care due to the pandemic, 74.7% reported delaying a checkup, 12.4% reported delaying care to address something that was bothering them, and 10.5% reported delaying care to get planned treatment. About 44.4% of adults reported that they planned to visit the dentist within the next 3 mo. In the multivariable regression model, only living in an urban (vs. rural) area was associated with significantly higher odds of delayed dental care due to the pandemic (odds ratio: 1.5; 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 2.1). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of US adults reported delaying dental care due to the COVID-19 pandemic during the spring of 2020.

Some articles have reported acute pancreatitis in adult patients due to COVID-19 infection. To our knowledge this is the first report of acute hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis in children associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 7-year-old girl with congenital immunodeficiency was referred to the intensive care (ICU) unit with acute respiratory distress syndrome. She required mechanical ventilation (MV) due to pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 (chest CT with lower lung ground-glass opacities). SARS-CoV-2 infection was laboratory confirmed. Following a 49-day stay in the ICU, due to the clinical and radiological signs of acute abdomen and to the rapid deterioration in the clinical status, an indication to proceed an urgent surgerical intervention was made. Intra-operatively an adhesiolysis with blunt dissection of the of gastrocolic ligament was performed, then followed by debridement of the necrotic pancreas (more than 1?2 of the pancreas was damaged). Continuous lavage and drainage were placed. During the post-operative period, patient required aggressive MV and insulin therapy for persistent hyperglycemia. The CT scans reported a necrosis of the pancreas and we observed amylase and lipase elevation in the peritoneal lavage sample. Despite active intensive therapy, the patient's condition did not improve and she died 38 days after laparotomy as a result of multi-organ failure. CONCLUSION: The mechanism for the development of acute haemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis in the COVID-19 positive patients is unclear; perhaps it is due to a direct cytopathic effect from the COVID-19 virus, or due to the ACE2 expression in pancreas.","output":"Lethal hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis in a child with congenital immunodeficiency and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants. Biomarkers of disease severity might help in clinical management. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical predictiveness of NW-LDH, NW-caspase 3/7, and NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 ratio in bronchiolitis. METHODS: Previously healthy children less than 24 months of age with bronchiolitis were recruited from the Texas Children's emergency room and intensive care unit from October 2010 to April 2011. Demographic, clinical information, and NW samples were obtained at enrollment. NW samples were analyzed for respiratory viruses, caspase 3/7, and LDH. RESULTS: A viral pathogen was detected in 916% of 131 children, with the most common being respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus. A single infection was found in 618% of subjects and co-infection in 298%. Children admitted to ICU had significantly higher NW-LDH than children sent home from the ER or admitted to the general floor (P = 002). Children infected with RSV had the highest NW-LDH concentration (P = 003) compared with other viral infections. NW-LDH and NW-caspase were significantly correlated (r = 077, P < 00001). The univariate models showed NW-LDH and NW-LDH/NW- caspase 3/7 ratio were directly associated with hospitalization. Mutivariate regression analyses suggested a complex interaction between the biomarkers, demographics, and disposition. CONCLUSIONS: NW-LDH, NW-caspase 3/7 and NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 ratio and their interactions with demographic factors are predictive of bronchiolitis severity and can help distinguish children requiring ICU-level care from those admitted to the general floor, or discharged home from the emergency center.","output":"Lactate dehydrogenase and caspase activity in nasopharyngeal secretions are predictors of bronchiolitis severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this communication, we would like to share our experience in managing TORS patients during COVID-19 pandemic.

The rapid spread of the disease coupled with the lack of specific registered drugs for its treatment pose a great challenge that necessitate the development of therapeutic agents from a variety of sources. In this study, we employed an in-silico method to screen natural compounds with a view to identify inhibitors of the human transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2). The activity of this enzyme is essential for viral access into the host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). Inhibiting the activity of this enzyme is therefore highly crucial for preventing viral fusion with ACE-2 thus shielding SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. 3D model of TMPRSS2 was constructed using I-TASSER, refined by GalaxyRefine, validated by Ramachandran plot server and overall model quality was checked by ProSA. 95 natural compounds from microalgae were virtually screened against the modeled protein that led to the identification 17 best leads capable of binding to TMPRSS2 with a good binding score comparable, greater or a bit lower than that of the standard inhibitor (camostat). Physicochemical properties, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) and toxicity analysis revealed top 4 compounds including the reference drug with good pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles.

Every year the Dutch foundation Studiekeuze123 sends out a survey (the NSE) to collect data on service quality regarding education at HEIs in the Netherlands. We used the 2019 NSE-data from the only e-learning university in the Netherlands, the Open Universiteit (OUNL), containing a sample of 1287 students. PLS-SEM was used to analyze a conceptual model in order to understand the service quality factors that promote students level of satisfaction and willingness to recommend the HEI. Overall, the findings reveal that the quality of the NSE is sufficient to be used for performance analysis. Nine out of twelve service components taken into account for the OUNL are found statistically significant affecting students satisfaction and willingness to recommend. The results help HEIs promoting and managing students perceptions of the quality of education and support students in their decision making process. Since many HEIs had to make a transition from onsite to online education within a short period of time, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, service quality became a major concern for HEIs. As online learning systems are expected to stay, analyzing the service quality of the OUNL as a reputed online HEI can help other HEIs getting their online learning systems on track.","output":"Measuring service quality at an online university: using PLS-SEM with archival data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: There has been a great concern that the COVID-19 pandemic has interfered with burn care. The feeling has been that resources have been shifted to treating the COVID patients and that shelter-in-place requirements have reduced the risks for burn injury. The ABA and other organizations have sent biweekly surveys in order to determine how the pandemic has interfered with burn care. Despite these concerns, we seemed very busy. METHODS: The inpatient data was collected in our adult and pediatric burn centers between January 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic there was an increase in burn admissions in both adult and pediatric centers. At the same time there were 1270 COVID-19 adult admissions and 4 COVID-positive admissions at the pediatric center. In the adult center, there was increase from 414 total admissions from fiscal year 2019 (7/2018-6/2019) of 414 to 495 for fiscal year 2020 (7/2019-6/2020). The average daily census also increased from 18.33 to 18.36 during the same period. The monthly number of burn admissions increased from 38.5/month for the last six months of 2019 to 44/month for the first six months of 2020. The admission rate continued in July (41) and August (47). In the first 8 months of 2020, there were 356 admissions with a mean TBSA of 11.3%. There were many large burns admitted in late summer. The mean TBSA of the 12 bed ICU on September 11, 2020 was 60.6% (range 25C85%). In the pediatric unit, there were 174 admissions through July 2020, a 6% increase from the preceding same period. There was a 6% decrease in burn reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a significant burden of COVID-19 patients, burn admissions also increased at the same time. There was no evidence that shelter-in-place requirements changed the risk for burn injuries. Resources for critical care needs should not be siphoned away from burn centers during pandemics. Risky behaviors leading to burns do not go away despite new health crises.","output":"42 COVID-19 Slowdown?

Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a type I IFN response in vitro and in moderate cases of COVID-19. In vitro stimulation of type I IFN expression and signaling in human airway epithelial cells is associated with activation of canonical transcriptions factors, and SARS-CoV-2 is unable to inhibit exogenous induction of these responses.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was used as the main tool to measure efficiency and effectiveness among fifteen (15) major private hospitals in Greece. Audited financial statement data were analyzed as a basis for the assessment of their performance. An input oriented model was applied due to the fact that assets and employee expenses are more likely to be under the control of management in private hospitals, compared to revenues and CFFO. The latter were used as outputs that represent measures of effectiveness and efficiency respectively which secure sustainability. We opted for the Variable Return to Scale (VRS) version of DEA (in connection with the CRS one), since hospital are systems extremely depended on the human capital and the knowledge management, as a means of creating value and are characterized by non-linear dynamics. Findings: The great majority of the hospitals in the sample exhibit increasing and decreasing returns scale. Inefficiencies found to emanate from a non-optimal scale of the hospitals rather, than from management's lack of capability to transform inputs to outputs. Practical Implications: The study aspires to frame options and help management to make informed choices that promote sustainable development of the private sector, which are also applicable to the public one. It is essential for public authorities to judge the meaningful performance of the private hospitals, to administer accordingly the level of its subsidies through public insurance funds, the claw back and rebate policies in a period of fiscal austerity and act accordingly to attract or deter the inflow of scalable private funds in healthcare to promote human wellbeing.

Vitamin D (VD) and its metabolites have been used as a palliative treatment for chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases from ancient times. In the current study, some molecular aspects of the potential effects of VD against COVID-19 side-effects have been discussed. An arguable role in autophagy or apoptosis control has been suggested for VD through calcium signaling at the mitochondrial and ER levels. 1,25(OH)2D3 is also an immunomodulator that affects the development of B-cells, T-cells, and NK cells in both innate and acquired immunity. The production of some anti-microbial molecules such as defensins and cathelicidins is also stimulated by VD. The overexpression of glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase, and down-regulation of NADPH oxidase are induced by VD to reduce the oxidative stress. Moreover, the multi-organ failure due to a cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV2 in COVID-19 may be prevented by the immunomodulatory effects of VD. It can also downregulate the renin-angiotensin system which has a protective role against cardiovascular complications induced by COVID-19. Given the many experimental and molecular evidences due to the potential protective effects of VD on the prevention of the COVID-19-induced morbidities, a VD supplementation is suggested to prevent the lethal side-effects of the infection. It is particularly recommended in VD-deficient patients or those at greater risk of serious or critical effects of COVID-19, including the elderly, and patients with pre-existing chronic diseases, especially those in nursing homes, care facilities, and hospitals.","output":"Vitamin D can be effective on the prevention of COVID-19 complications: A narrative review on molecular aspects."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In February 2019, California (CA) experienced its first C. auris outbreak in Orange County (OC). The CA Department of Public Health (CDPH) and OC with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mounted a successful containment response; by November 2019, cases were limited to low-level spread in OC long-term acute care hospitals (LTACH). In May 2020, C. auris cases began to surge in OC, followed by extensive spread in six other southern CA local health jurisdictions (LHJ). CDPH with LHJ and CDC, initiated an aggressive, interjurisdictional containment response. METHODS: We carried out response and preventive point prevalence surveys (PPS), onsite infection prevention and control (IPC) assessments, and in-service trainings at outbreak and interconnected hospitals and skilled nursing facilities in six LHJ. Other regional activities included: epidemiologic investigation, contact and discharge tracking and screening; increasing laboratory testing capacity; screening patients admitted to and from LTACH; statewide healthcare facility (HCF) education and outreach; sending regional outbreak HCF lists to all HCF; and biweekly state-LHJ coordination calls. The Antibiotic Resistance (AR) Lab Network supported testing. RESULTS: From May 2020May 2021, we conducted screening at 226 HCF, and identified 1192 cases at 93 HCF, mostly through screening (n=1109, 93%) and at LTACH (n=906, 76%); we identified 113 (10%) cases at ACH, including 35 (31%) in COVID-19-burdened units. Cases peaked in August 2020 (n=93) and February 2021 (n=191) and have since declined, with C. auris resurgence mirroring COVID-19 incidence. We conducted 98 onsite IPC assessments, and identified multiple, improper IPC practices which had been implemented in response to COVID-19, including double-gloving and -gowning, extended use of gowns and gloves outside patient rooms, and cohorting according to COVID-19 status only.

If COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, why is COPD not the leading risk factor for contracting COVID-19? The same odd phenomenon was also observed with other pathogenic human coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but not other respiratory viral infections such as influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses. One commonly proposed reason for the low COPD rates among COVID-19 patients is the usage of inhaled corticosteroids or bronchodilators that may protect against COVID-19. However, another possible reason not discussed elsewhere is that lungs in a diseased state may not be conducive for the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to establish COVID-19. For one, COPD causes mucous plugging in large and small airways, which may hinder SARS-CoV-2 from reaching deeper parts of the lungs (i.e., alveoli). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 may only localize to the upper respiratory tract of persons with COPD, causing mild or asymptomatic infections requiring no hospital attention. Even if SARS-CoV-2 reaches the alveoli, cells therein are probably under a heavy burden of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and extensively damaged where it may not support efficient viral replication. As a result, limited SARS-CoV-2 virions would be produced in diseased lungs, preventing the development of COVID-19.","output":"Diseased lungs may hinder COVID-19 development: A possible reason for the low prevalence of COPD in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND For nasotracheal intubation, the nasal pathway between the inferior turbinate and hard palate (lower pathway) is preferred for patient safety. However, selecting the lower pathway can be challenging because passage of the tube through the nasal pathway is usually performed blindly. OBJECTIVES We investigated whether facing the bevel of the tracheal tube in the cephalad direction of the patient could help in advancing the tracheal tube through the lower pathway during nasotracheal intubation. DESIGN A randomised, blinded trial. SETTING SMG-SNU Boramae Medical Center, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea from January 2019 to March 2020. PATIENTS Sixty-eight adult patients undergoing oromaxillary surgeries were enrolled in this study. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly allocated to undergo nasotracheal intubation with the bevel of the tube facing the cephalad direction (intervention group) or to the left (conventional group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The effects of bevel direction on the pathway of the tube in the nasal cavity, and the incidence of epistaxis were evaluated by fibreoptic bronchoscopy. RESULTS The success rate of the tracheal tube passing through the lower pathway was significantly higher in the intervention group than the conventional group (79.4 vs. 55.9%, relative risk 1.421, 95% CI 1.007 to 2.005, P = 0.038).

Since March 2020, there was a decline in the number of reports of norovirus and Campylobacter recorded by Englands national laboratory surveillance system. The aim is to estimate and compare the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on norovirus and Campylobacter surveillance data in England. METHODS: We utilised two quasi-experimental approaches based on a generalised linear model for sequential count data. The first approach estimates overall impact and the second approach focuses on the impact of specific elements of the pandemic response (COVID-19 diagnostic testing and control measures). The following time series (27, 2015C43, 2020) were used: weekly laboratory-confirmed norovirus and Campylobacter reports, air temperature, conducted Sars-CoV-2 tests and Index of COVID-19 control measures stringency. RESULTS: The period of Sars-CoV-2 emergence and subsequent sustained transmission was associated with persistent reductions in norovirus laboratory reports (p = 0.001), whereas the reductions were more pronounced during pandemic emergence and later recovered for Campylobacter (p = 0.075). The total estimated reduction was 47% - 79% for norovirus (12C43, 2020). The total reduction varied by time for Campylobacter, e.g. 19% - 33% in April, 1% - 7% in August. CONCLUSION: Laboratory reporting of norovirus was more adversely impacted than Campylobacter by the COVID-19 pandemic. This may be partially explained by a comparatively stronger effect of behavioural interventions on norovirus transmission and a relatively greater reduction in norovirus testing capacity.

SETTING: International survey of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes. PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare professionals working in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes worldwide. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportion of programmes that continued providing exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation and which technologies had been used to deliver home-based cardiac rehabilitation. RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty eligible responses were received; 89.7% were from the UK. Approximately half (49.3%) of respondents reported that cardiac rehabilitation programmes were suspended due to COVID-19.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May-June 2020 with a sample of 645, recruited from 26 hospitals across Nepal. We conducted telephone interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire related to KAP regarding COVID-19. T-test and one-way ANOVA was conducted to determine group differences for socio-demographic variables. Linear regression and correlational analysis were performed to identify associated factors and measure strength and direction of relationships. Results: Overall mean scores for knowledge, attitude and practice were 11.6 (SD 4.5), 2.7 (SD 1.8), and 9.9 (SD 1.93) respectively, but differed by socio-demographic characteristics. Positive but weak linear correlations were observed between knowledge-practice (r = 0.19, p < 0.01) and attitude-practice (r = 0.08, p < 0.05).

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the effectivity of a program of control and prevention of COVID-19 in an academic general hospital in Spain. METHODS: We captured the number of COVID-19 cases and the type of contact that occurred in hospitalized patients and healthcare personnel (HCP). To evaluate the impact of the continuous use of a surgical mask among HCP, the number of patients with COVID-19 HAIs and accumulated incidence of HCP with COVID-19 was compared between the preintervention and intervention periods. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-two patients with COVID-19 have been admitted to the hospital. Seven of them had an HAI origin (6 in the preintervention period and 1 in the intervention period). One hundred forty-two HCP were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Of them, 22 (15.5%) were attributed to healthcare (2 in the emergency department and none in the critical care departments), and 120 (84.5%) were attributed to social relations in the workplace or during their non-work-related personal interactions. The accumulated incidence during the preintervention period was 22.3 for every 1000 HCP and 8.2 for every 1000 HCP during the intervention period.

Methods: Review of PubMed-published articles assessing COVID-19 RDTs complemented with Instructions for Use (IFU) of products. Results: In total 47 articles on two COVID-19 Ag RDTs and 54 COVID-19 Ab RDTs and IFUs of 20 COVID-19 Ab RDTs were retrieved. Only five COVID-19 Ab RDTs (9.3%) were assessed with capillary blood sampling at the point-of-care; none of the studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Sampling: Challenges for COVID-19 Ag RDTs include nasopharyngeal sampling (technique, biosafety) and sample stability; for COVID-19 Ab RDTs equivalence of whole blood vs. plasma/serum needs further validation (assessed for only eight (14.8%) products). Sensitivity-Specificity: sensitivity of COVID-19 Ag and Ab RDTs depend on viral load (antigen) and timeframe (antibody), respectively; COVID-19 Ab tests have lower sensitivity compared to laboratory test platforms and the kinetics of IgM and IgG are very similar. Reported specificity was high but has not yet been assessed against tropical pathogens. Kit configuration: For COVID-19 Ag RDTs, flocked swabs should be added to the kit; for COVID-19 Ab RDTs, finger prick sampling materials, transfer devices, and controls should be added (currently only supplied in 15, 5, and 1/20 products). Usability and Robustness: some COVID-19 Ab RDTs showed high proportions of faint lines (>40%) or invalid results (>20%).

However, how these AI tools or deep learning algorithms reach such a decision and which are the most influential features derived from these neural networks with typically deep layers are not clear. The aim of this study is to propose and develop XAI strategies for COVID-19 classification models with an investigation of comparison. The results demonstrate promising quantification and qualitative visualisations that can further enhance the clinician's understanding and decision making with more granular information from the results given by the learned XAI models. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Explainable AI for COVID-19 CT Classifiers: An initial comparison study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs), enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses, are a group of viruses that cause infections in the human respiratory tract, which can be characterized clinically from mild to fatal. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible. The global spread of COVID-19 can be described as the worst pandemic in humanity in the last century. To date, COVID-19 has infected more than 3,000,000 people worldwide and killed more than 200,000 people. All age groups can be infected from the virus, but more serious symptoms that can possibly result in death are observed in older people and those with underlying medical conditions such as cardiovascular and pulmonary disease. Novel data report more severe symptoms and even a negative prognosis for the obese patients. A growing body of evidence connects obesity with COVID-19 and a number of mechanisms from immune system activity attenuation to chronic inflammation are implicated. Lipid peroxidation creates reactive lipid aldehydes which in a patient with metabolic disorder and COVID-19 will affect its prognosis. Finally, pregnancy-associated obesity needs to be studied further in connection to COVID-19 as this infection could pose high risk both to pregnant women and the fetus.","output":"Obesity - a risk factor for increased COVID-19 prevalence, severity and lethality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An in\\\\depth characterization of the incidence, morphology, and onset of COVID\\\\19\\\\vaccines cutaneous adverse reactions is currently lacking.

DESIGN: Single-centre, retrospective, observational study. PATIENTS: COVID-19 patients undergoing rehabilitation (24 April to 24 May 2020). METHODS: All COVID-19 inpatients undergoing rehabilitation in the general ward were assessed. Data were collected on age, sex, physical ability, rehabilitation modality (remote/direct), need for intubation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, degree of pneumonia, oxygen therapy from the start of rehabilitation, D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels, and rehabilitation-related complications. Activities of daily living were measured using the Barthel Index. RESULTS: Out of a total of 43 patients, 14 were initially provided with remote rehabilitation and 29 with direct rehabilitation. Four patients were switched from direct to remote rehabilitation during the study, thus at the end of the study there were 18 in the remote rehabilitation group and 25 in the direct rehabilitation group. Patients in remote rehabilitation were significantly younger than those in direct rehabilitation. Of 12 patients who required intubation, 3 were given remote rehabilitation. One extracorporeal membrane oxygenation survivor underwent direct rehabilitation. All patients on remote rehabilitation were discharged home or to a hotel. Twelve out of 29 patients were transferred to a rehabilitation hospital due to delayed recovery of activities of daily living. No serious adverse events occurred.

UBCv1 was expressed as an early expression protein that accumulates throughout the course of infection. This versatile protein, bound several types of polyubiquitin chains and its catalytic domain was required for enzymatic activity. High throughput mass spectrometry analysis in combination with a screening of an alveolar macrophage library was used to identify and characterize novel UBCv1-host interactors.

The aim of this study was to examine typologies regarding how consistently parents apply energy-balance related behavior rules, and the association between these typologies and socio-demographic characteristics, energy balance-related behaviors among school age children, and the prevalence of being overweight. METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, we had access to a database managed by a Municipal Health Service Department in the Netherlands. In total, 4,865 parents with children 4C12 years of age participated in this survey and completed a standardized questionnaire. Parents classified their consistency of applying rules as strict, indulgent, or no rules. Typologies were identified using latent class analyses. We used regression analyses to examine how the typologies differed with respect to the covariates socio-demographic characteristics, childrens energy balance-related behaviors, and weight status. RESULTS: We identified four stable, distinct parental typologies with respect to applying dietary and sedentary behavior rules. Overall, we found that parents who apply overall strict EBRB rules had the highest level of education and that their children practiced healthier behaviors compared to the children of parents in the other three classes. In addition, we found that parents who apply indulgent dietary rules and no sedentary rules had the lowest level of education and the highest percentage of non-Caucasians; in addition, their children 8C12 years of age had the highest likelihood of being overweight compared to children of parents with no dietary rules. CONCLUSIONS: Parents consistency in applying rules regarding dietary and sedentary behaviors was associated with parents level of education and ethnic background, as well as with childrens dietary and sedentary behaviors and their likelihood of becoming overweight. Our results may contribute to helping make healthcare professionals aware that children of parents who do not apply sedentary behavior rules are more likely to become overweight, as well as the importance of encouraging parents to apply strict dietary and sedentary behavior rules.

Twenty-four-hour ILV on noncontrast computed tomography has greater availability and potentially allows earlier estimation of functional outcome. We aimed to assess lesion growth 24 hours after stroke onset and compare the associations of 24-hour and 1-week ILV with functional outcome. METHODS We included 228 patients from MR CLEAN trial (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands), who received noncontrast computed tomography at 24-hour and 1-week follow-up on which ILV was measured. Relative and absolute lesion growth was determined. Logistic regression models were constructed either including the 24-hour or including the 1-week ILV. Ordinal and dichotomous (0-2 and 3-6) modified Rankin scale scores were, respectively, used as primary and secondary outcome measures. RESULTS Median ILV was 42 mL (interquartile range, 21-95 mL) and 64 mL (interquartile range: 30-120 mL) at 24 hours and 1 week, respectively. Relative lesion growth exceeding 30% occurred in 121 patients (53%) and absolute lesion growth exceeding 20 mL occurred in 83 patients (36%). Both the 24-hour and 1-week ILVs were similarly significantly associated with functional outcome (both P<0.001). In the logistic analyses, the areas under the curve of the receiver-operator characteristic curves were similar: 0.85 (95% confidence interval, 0.80-0.90) and 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.82-0.91) for including the 24-hour and 1-week ILV, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Growth of ILV is common 24-hour poststroke onset. Nevertheless, the 24-hour ILV proved to be a valuable secondary outcome measure as it is equally strongly associated with functional outcome as the 1-week ILV.

Care should be taken to avoid anchoring bias and ensure all bacterial coinfections are diagnosed and treated in patients with COVID-19. CASE REPORT: A 49-year-old male with no past medical history developed abdominal pain, diarrhea and cough on April 4, 2020. He tested positive for SARS-CoV 2 on April 6th given there were several people at his work that had recently contracted coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Over the next week he developed progressive fever, cough, anosmia, ageusia and then dyspnea with exertion which prompted him to seek medical care. Shortly after admission, he became more febrile, tachycardic and hypoxic requiring oxygen supplementation via high-flow nasal cannula. His oxygen requirements continued to worsen, and he was transferred to the ICU and intubated. His procalcitonin was elevated at 8.99 and he was started on empiric broad spectrum antibiotics. Tracheal aspirate was tested via PCR and returned positive for Legionella pneumophila. He also tested positive for Legionella urinary antigen. He received hydroxychloroquine for 7 days, IV doxycycline for 10 days, ceftriaxone for 6 days and piperacillin-tazobactam for 2 days. He gradually improved and was successfully weaned off supplemental oxygen. He was discharged after a 10-day hospital stay with minimal respiratory symptoms. DISCUSSION: Among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, Legionella bacterial coinfection appears to be rare. In a systematic review published in July 2020, Rawson et al reported that only 8% (62/806) of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were diagnosed with a bacterial pneumonia coinfection and found only one patient who had COVID-19 and Legionella. However, it has been reported that there may be an increased risk of Legionella infections during the COVID-19 pandemic due to water systems being used less often because of lockdown orders. In September 2020, De Giglio et al reported that a large Italian hospital found a significant increase in Legionella pneumophila isolates on routine water system testing in two of three wards which had been closed for over a month due to emergency reorganization. It remains important to keep Legionella bacterial co-infection on the differential when treating COVID-19 since it may require a longer treatment regimen than what is recommended for treating standard community acquired pneumonia. In addition, the pandemic response has the potential to increase the risk of legionella infections secondary to stagnant water systems in lockdowns.","output":"When Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia Isn't Enough: A Rare Case of Bacterial Coinfection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protein-mediated membrane fusion is a highly regulated biological process essential for cellular and organismal functions and infection by enveloped viruses.

The authors state that their observations might be due to the effects of nicotine. We believe that the lower number of hospitalized smokers than expected, if confirmed by further studies, can be due to the higher concentration of deposited energy of alpha particles emitted from radionuclides such as Po-210 in cigarette tobacco. The anti-inflammatory effects of localized radiation energy deposition of alpha particles as well as the effect of low doses of radiation on reducing the risk of thrombosis, are possibly involved in the lower number of hospitalized smokers than expected.","output":"Why Do Some Reports Claim that the Number of COVID-19 Hospitalized Smokers is Smaller than Expected?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prior qualitative research conducted among stroke survivors to explore the potential benefits and challenges of participating in tai chi exercise during stroke recovery is limited to those without depression.

Improvements in diagnostic techniques, including the increasing clinical use of respiratory viral PCR panels (vPCR), have markedly advanced our understanding of the contributions of NIV to the influenza season. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all vPCR results from one hospital system, collected between October 1, 2016 and March 7, 2017, including inpatient and outpatient samples was performed. 2,047 vPCR tests were reviewed; after removing those with undetermined results and internal control samples, 1,924 were analyzed. Data points abstracted included detection and identification of virus, and date of detection. We compared the total and monthly rates of NIV with IV, throughout the study period. RESULTS: Of 1,924 vPCR results, 985 (51%) were positive for a respiratory virus. Of these, 302 (31%) were IV, and 683 (69%) were NIV. For every month studied, the ratio of NIV to IV exceeded 50%, including the height of the season. The most commonly detected viruses were Influenza A (30%), Rhino/Enterovirus (24%), RSV (19%), Coronavirus OC43 (7%) and Metapneumovirus (5%). The peak influenza incidence temporally coincided with the national peak months of January and February. The NIV incidence paralleled the trend in IV incidence, dominated by Rhino/Enterovirus and RSV, but without a specific virus driving the trend. CONCLUSION: Non-influenza respiratory viruses cause substantial viral RI during the winter months. Many viral syndromes during the height of influenza season have traditionally been attributed to IV, including influenza-like-illness (ILI); however, these can now be better characterized using patient-specific vPCR panels, leading to improved understanding of NIV epidemiology. Even during the period of highest IV incidence, NIV infections were more common than IV. Understanding the high prevalence of NIV infections may improve the judicious use of both antibiotics and antivirals. There may also be a role for refinement of ILI, including best practices for diagnosis and treatment. DISCLOSURES: All Authors: No reported disclosures.","output":"2518.

Very few clinical studies in Qatar focused on gut microbiome. This study aimed to assess the awareness of healthcare professionals, scientists, and the general public on the role of gut microbiota in health and diseases and, more specifically, in disorders of the gutCbrain axis such as neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) or gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. It also aimed to evaluate the readiness of the population to engage in clinical trials involving dietary interventions or fecal transplants. Methods: A total of 156 participants were recruited to answer questionnairesfrom healthcare professionals and scientists (HSs; n = 44) and the general public (n = 112). Participants from the general public self-reported their diagnosis of NDDsautism or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (n = 36)or GI diseases or disorders (n = 18) or as having none of them (n = 58). Two questionnaires for HSs and for the general public were distributed, and basic descriptive and statistical analyses were conducted using the Fisher's exact test. Results: Among the participating HSs, 95% admitted that they had minimum to no knowledge on the role of gut microbes in health and diseases, and only 15.9% felt that their peers were knowledgeable about it. Nevertheless, 97.7% of HSs thought that gut microbiota should be considered when devising treatment plans as 79.1% believed that gut dysbiosis is involved in the pathogenesis of diseases. For the general public, 54% stated that they have read about studies on the potential benefits of microbes in the prevention, treatment, and management of diseases, with a higher proportion of them belonging to the GI group (p = 0.0523). The GI group was also more aware of the existence of the use of fecal transplants for treating their condition (p = 0.01935). Awareness was also reflected in participants attempts to engage in dietary changes, as 40% tried a dietary intervention, which has noticeably changed their or their child's symptoms. This study reported a highly significant association between being exposed to multiple antibiotic courses before three years of age and being part of the NDD group (p = 0.0003). Public readiness to engage in interventions that target the gut microbiome, such as intensive dietary interventions or even fecal transplants, was perceived by HSs to be lower than what was stated by the public, with 87.96% of public being ready to engage in intensive dietary interventions and 66.98% in fecal transplants. Conclusion: The study revealed that the role of gut microbes in health and diseases, and especially through the gutCbrain axis, is still unclear in both the scientific community and general public. While acknowledging the importance of gut microbes, the lack of information regarding the link between lifestyle and gut microbes is considered to hold the public in the precontemplation/contemplation stages of the transtheoretical model of behavioral change. An interdisciplinary approach to new knowledge produced by microbiome studies is needed to run awareness campaigns and continue professional development activities on the benefits of lifestyle-based modulation of gut microbiome, thus engaging the general public in lifestyle changes and facilitating clinical research in human microbiome investigations in Qatar.","output":"Targeting the gut microbiome: A brief report on the awareness, practice, and readiness to engage in clinical interventions in Qatar"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: On August 4, 2020, a massive explosion hit Lebanons capital city, Beirut. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of the Beirut blast on the COVID-19 situation in the country. SUBJECT AND METHODS: Data on COVID-19 were retrieved from the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health (LMOPH), where all the COVID-19 positive cases were reported. The study was divided into two periods, considering the incubation period of the COVID-19 virus: (July 27CAugust 9, 2020) and (August 10C23, 2020). Information obtained included daily number of cases, tests, deaths, hospitalized patients, intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and mode of acquisition (local vs. expat). Daily positivity rates were reported per 100 tests. An independent sample t-test and a Joinpoint regression analysis were used to determine significance. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 201,010 tests were conducted during our studied period, with 8993 positive cases, constituting a total positivity rate of 4.5 per 100 tests. Case fatality rate over the studied period was 0.8%. The positivity rate of the period prior to August 10, 2020, was 2.7 per 100 tests, significantly less than that of the period following the explosion, which was 6.4 per 100 tests (p < 0.001). During our studied period, daily positivity rates were significantly increasing at a slope of 0.29 (p < 0.001). A significant increase in slope was noted on August 13, 2020 (p < 0.001). The number of hospitalized patients increased from 139 patients on July 27 to 266 on August 23, 2020, and that of ICU patients increased from 36 to 75. CONCLUSION: The port of Beirut explosion resulted in a significant increase in the daily number of positive COVID-19 cases.

We also examine how patterns of change across racial/ethnic groups vary by age and sex. ResultsCovid-19 death rates in 2020 were highest in the Hispanic community whereas Black individuals had the largest increase in all-cause mortality between 2019 and 2020. Increases in mortality from heart disease, diabetes, and external causes of death accounted for the adverse trend in all-cause mortality within the Black population. Percentage increases in all-cause mortality were similar for men and women and for ages 25-64 and 65+ for Black and White populations, but increases were greatest for working-aged men among the Hispanic population.

Objective tools to measure fruit and vegetable consumption without relying on self-report present the opportunity to do this with less respondent burden and bias. A promising tool for quantifying fruit and vegetable consumption via proxy is skin carotenoids as measured by reflection spectroscopy through a device called the Veggie Meter(?). To assess whether the Veggie Meter(?) is able to detect changes in skin carotenoids as a proxy for fruit and vegetable consumption in a low-income school setting, skin carotenoid measurements were collected at three time points, along with student level demographics, anthropometric measurements, and nutrition knowledge. A secondary goal of this study was to refine the protocol to be used based on researcher observations. Repeated measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons indicate that there was a significant difference in VM scores over the course of the study (F(2, 68) = 6.63, p = 0.002), with an increase in skin carotenoids from Fall 2018 to Spring 2019 (p = 0.005). This increase was sustained over the summer months when measured in Fall 2019. Changes to the protocol included the addition of a hand cleaning step and using the non-dominant ring finger for data collection.

A framework to incorporate uncertainty in patient-specific model predictions for decision support is presented. A0Dlumped parameter mode lincluding the left ventricle, astenotic valve and systemic circulatory system has been developed, based on models published earlier. The Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)isused to optimize model input parameters to fit measured data pre-intervention. After optimization, the valve treatment is simulated by significantly reducing valve resistance. Uncertain model parameters are then propagated using a polynomial chaos expansion approach. To test the proposed framework, three in silico test cases are developed with clinically feasible measurements. Quality and availability of simulated measured patient data are decreased in each case. The UKF approach is compared to a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approach, a well-known approach in modelling predictions with uncertainty. Both methods show increased confidence intervals as measurement quality decreases. By considering three in silico test-cases we incorporate optimization uncertainty in model predictions and is faster and the MCMC approach, although it is more sensitive to noise in flow measurements.

However, there are concerns about its safety and efficacy because of higher complexity and the need for strong guide catheter support. Methods and Results We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies published through November 2018 reporting the outcomes of RA versus femoral access in CTO percutaneous coronary intervention. Outcomes included major bleeding, access-site complications, in-hospital major adverse events, and technical success. Nine observational studies with 10 590 patients (10 617 lesions) were included in the meta-analysis. CTO lesions attempted using RA had lower Japan-CTO score (2.31.2 versus 2.51.3; P<0.001). Use of RA was associated with similar technical success (78.7% versus 78.5%; odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.94-1.31; P=0.24; I2=23%), lower risk of access-site complications (0.73% versus 1.79%; odds ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.22-0.51; P<0.001; I2=0%) and major bleeding (0.18% versus 0.9%; odds ratio, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.10-0.45; P<0.001; I2=0%), and similar risk of in-hospital adverse events and in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.12-1.07; P=0.07; I2=0%) as compared to femoral access.

The purpose of this study was to investigate trends in exposure to adult orthopaedic surgical procedures and analyze the impact of the 2013 update in ACGME case logging expectations. METHODS: A retrospective review of ACGME case log data was conducted for adult orthopaedic procedures performed by graduating orthopaedic surgery residents from 2012 to 2020. Trends in the number of cases logged and the case share by anatomical location were investigated. Linear regression analysis was performed to analyze changes in case number over the 9-year period. RESULTS: For all surgical categories, there was stability in the average case number per resident from 2012 to 2013, followed by a precipitous decrease from 2013 to 2014. From 2014 to 2020, there has been a gradual increase in case number for all categories except other musculoskeletal (MSK), resulting in a total 46% recovery since the 2014 decline. Concomitant with the decline, there was a relative increase in pelvis/hip and femur/knee procedures and decrease in shoulder, other MSK, and spine procedures. From 2014 to 2020, shoulder, humerus/elbow, pelvis/hip, leg/ankle, foot/toes, and spine cases have gradually accounted for a larger proportion of total cases while femur/knee and other MSK cases have accounted for less. CONCLUSIONS: The 2013 update in ACGME case logging expectations was associated with a significant decrease in case number. This is likely a reflection of residents correctly entering 1 primary Current Procedural Terminology code for each surgical case.

Moringa oleifera seeds (MOS), traditionally used as an antidiabetic food and traditional medicine in tropical Asia and Africa, have exhibited potential effects in improving IR. To systematically explore the pharmacological mechanism of the anti-IR effects of MOS, we adopted a network pharmacology approach at the molecular level. METHODS: By incorporating compound screening and target prediction, a feasible compound-target-pathway network pharmacology model was established to systematically predict the potential active components and mechanisms of the anti-IR effects of MOS. Biological methods were then used to verify the results of the network pharmacology analysis. RESULTS: Our comprehensive systematic approach successfully identified 32 bioactive compounds in MOS and 44 potential targets of these compounds related to IR, as well as 37 potential pathways related to IR. Moreover, the network pharmacology analysis revealed that glycosidic isothiocyanates and glycosidic benzylamines were the major active components that improved IR by acting on key targets, such as SRC, PTPN1, and CASP3, which were involved in inflammatory responses and insulin-related pathways. Further biological research demonstrated that the anti-IR effects of MOS were mediated by increasing glucose uptake and modulating the expression of SRC and PTPN1. CONCLUSION: Our study successfully predicts the active ingredients and potential targets of MOS for improving IR and helps to illustrate mechanism of action at a systemic level. This study not only provides new insights into the chemical basis and pharmacology of MOS but also demonstrates a feasible method for discovering potential drugs from traditional medicines.","output":"Integrated Network Pharmacology Analysis and Experimental Validation to Reveal the Mechanism of Anti-Insulin Resistance Effects of Moringa oleifera Seeds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Serum D-dimer levels, as well as other biomarkers related to coagulation, are significantly elevated during severe community acquired pneumonia.

Over the past two decades, the concept of communication has significantly evolved given the introduction of multimedia digital technologies, which have enabled people to communicate without necessarily their physical presence. During the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual mobility (or virtual communication) played a crucial role in ensuring communications between people in different contexts of social life, growing in few months to previously unforeseeable levels and demonstrating that it can substitute physical movements in many occasions. A smart management of mobility that combines the ability to virtually communicate and the use of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to support physical mobility, can therefore strongly influence people's choice to move or not, and how. Starting from the analysis of physical mobility and virtual communications trends before and during the health emergency in Italy, this paper analyses the relationships between these two forms of communication, evaluating how virtual communication affected the different segments of Italian mobility during the pandemic and how it will affect the way people move in the post COVID-19 period. A SWOT analysis of virtual mobility is performed for each communication segment, with the aim of highlighting its pros and cons, but also future opportunities and possible threats. Some policy indications are also provided in relation to different mobility segments, governance levels (urban, regional and national) and congestion/pollution scenarios, highlighting how virtual mobility can help regulate physical movements, with the ultimate goal of pursuing a safe, sustainable, effective, efficient and connected mobility.","output":"Physical mobility and virtual communication in Italy: trends, analytical relationships and policies for the post COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS Participation is a key health outcome; however little is known specifically about how to measure participation of infants and toddlers.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of integrated treatment of chronic HCV infection among PWID. METHODS AND FINDINGS: INTRO-HCV is a multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial. Participants recruited from opioid agonist therapy (OAT) and community care clinics in Norway over 2017 to 2019 were randomly 1:1 assigned to the 2 treatment approaches. Integrated treatment was delivered by multidisciplinary teams at opioid agonist treatment clinics or community care centers (CCCs) for people with substance use disorders. This included on-site testing for HCV, liver fibrosis assessment, counseling, treatment, and posttreatment follow-up. Standard treatment was delivered in hospital outpatient clinics. Oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) medications were administered in both arms. The study was not completely blinded. The primary outcomes were time-to-treatment initiation and sustained virologic response (SVR), defined as undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after treatment completion, analyzed with intention to treat, and presented as hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. Among 298 included participants, 150 were randomized to standard treatment, of which 116/150 (77%) initiated treatment, with 108/150 (72%) initiating within 1 year of referral. Among those 148 randomized to integrated care, 145/148 (98%) initiated treatment, with 141/148 (95%) initiating within 1 year of referral. The HR for the time to initiating treatment in the integrated arm was 2.2 (1.7 to 2.9) compared to standard treatment. SVR was confirmed in 123 (85% of initiated/83% of all) for integrated treatment compared to 96 (83% of initiated/64% of all) for the standard treatment (OR among treated: 1.5 [0.8 to 2.9], among all: 2.8 [1.6 to 4.8]). No severe adverse events were linked to the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Integrated treatment for HCV in PWID was superior to standard treatment in terms of time-to-treatment initiation, and subsequently, more people achieved SVR. Among those who initiated treatment, the SVR rates were comparable. Scaling up of integrated treatment models could be an important tool for elimination of HCV.

Volatile organic compounds produced during respiratory infections can cause specific scent imprints, which can be detected by trained dogs with a high rate of precision. METHODS: Eight detection dogs were trained for 1 week to detect saliva or tracheobronchial secretions of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in a randomised, double-blinded and controlled study. RESULTS: The dogs were able to discriminate between samples of infected (positive) and non-infected (negative) individuals with average diagnostic sensitivity of 82.63% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 82.02-83.24%) and specificity of 96.35% (95% CI: 96.31-96.39%).

The sudden outbreak of the pandemic has exposed the legal preparedness, or lack thereof, of governments to reduce and contain its drastic impact. Strong legislative measures play a crucial role in any epidemic or pandemic situation. In this situation, the Indian Government has requested all state governments to invoke the Epidemic Disease Act (EDA) of 1897 to address the COVID\\\\19 emergency. The Central Government has also used the powers provided in the Disaster Management Act (DMA) of 2005. As the country is facing its first major health emergency since independence, the existing legislative measures to deal with a COVID\\\\19 like situation are lacking and require certain amendments to address such situations in the future. This paper aims to present the current constitutional and legislative response to health emergencies in India and attempts to identify gray areas in the statutory provisions. Based on the analysis, this paper suggests several recommendations for amending current legislation and suggests the promulgation of comprehensive public health law. This paper is largely based on primary sources such as the EDA and the DMA, regulations, guidelines, rules issued by the public authorities and court cases related to health and health emergencies along with secondary resources such as newspaper articles and published papers.","output":"COVID\\\\19 and the legislative response in India: The need for a comprehensive health care law"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has serious social, economic and health consequences. Particularly in these times, it is important to maintain individual health. Therefore, it is important to take part in routine health checkups. Consequently, our objective was to describe the frequency and to identify the determinants of postponed routine health checkups. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from the nationally representative online-survey COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring in Germany (COSMO) was used (wave 17; July 2020). METHODS: In sum, 974 individuals were included in our analytical sample (average age was 45.9 years, SD: 16.5, 18C74 years). Postponed routine health checkups (yes or no) since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed. RESULTS: More than 16% of the individuals reported postponed routine health checkups in the past few months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, individuals aged 30C49 years had postponed health checkups (21%). The probability of postponed health checkups was positively associated with the presence of chronic diseases (odds ratio [OR]: 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15C2.47), higher affect regarding COVID-19 (OR: 1.44, 95%-CI: 1.16C1.78), and higher presumed severity of COVID-19 (OR: 1.17, 95%-CI: 1.01C1.35), whereas the outcome measure was not associated with socioeconomic factors. Data showed that a sizeable part (about one of six individuals) of the population reported postponed routine health checkups due to the COVID-19 pandemic between March and July 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Postponed checkups should not be neglected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals at risk for postponed health checkups should be appropriately addressed.","output":"Factors associated with postponed health checkups during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 has increased stress, fear, and anxiety for many people. At the same time, social isolation restrictions have disrupted most in-person mental health services. Many mental health providers are adapting to the crisis by utilizing telemental health. However, the literature is scant about how to most effectively utilize telemental health practices with refugee clients, many of whom do not speak English and require an interpreter, may have limited technological proficiency or access, and/or have additional case management needs and coordination as part of their treatment plan. The purpose of this study is to understand how mental health clinicians and case workers at a refugee-serving mental health clinic are successfully shifting their face-to-face practice to telemental health, the obstacles they encounter, and what resources they have found to be helpful. Two main themes emerged from the data: (1) refugee mental health providers display initiative and flexibility in their adaptation to telemental health and (2) providers reported numerous obstacles to effective telemental health, including client barriers, tech barriers, communication issues, and the challenge of reading nonverbal cues virtually. By better understanding telemental health when working with refugees, clinical social workers will be more effective in meeting the needs of a population with significant mental health needs and limited mental healthcare access.","output":"Telemental Health Use and Refugee Mental Health Providers Following COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The estimation of phylogenetic trees for individual genes or multi-locus datasets is a basic part of considerable biological research.

Pneumococcal disease is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in adults and children worldwide. The severity of St. pneumoniae diseases determines their high socio-economic significance. Aims  estimate the burden of pneumococcal infection and vaccination coverage in the Russian Federation. Methods. The data was obtained from federal statistical surveillance system. The information obtained was analyzed using descriptive statistics methods. Results. The annual incidence of community-acquired pneumonia in Russia was 491.7/100 000 in 2011C2019. It ranges from 359.8/100 000 among adults of working age to 1505.4/100 000 among children 1C2 years old. The upward trend of incidence is observed throughout the period, most expressive among school-age children (7C17 years old). Total 29.2% of all pneumonia have an identified etiology. 94% of pneumonia with known etiology are bacterial (incidence 142.5/100 000). 8.4% among it are pneumococcal (12.6/100 000). Pneumonia accounts for more than half of all deaths from respiratory diseases among children under five years (57%, mortality 3.7/100 000) and 34% among elderly. The death rate from pneumonia in 2009-2018 tends to decrease. In 2018, 25.5 thousand deaths from pneumonia were registered (17.5/100 000). The highest mortality rate is observed among children under one year old (14.0 /100 000) and elderly (41.2 /100 000). There is a downward trend (annual decline 2.4%) in incidence of acute otitis media among the entire population. The highest level is in children under 14. The incidence was 2612.6/100 000 in 2018, 670 thousand cases was observed. The incidence of bacterial meningitis is 1.4/100 000. Every year 2C3 thousand cases are registered, 43C52% of which are among children (3.04/100 000, maximally in children under one year old, 13.2/100 000). The level of vaccination against pneumococcal infection is increasing annually, but the proportion of children who have received a completed course of vaccination remains insufficient (64.6% in 2019). Coverage among the adult population was 2.3% (3.8% among those over 60). The main contingents of vaccinated adults are conscripts (coverage 67.4%) and people with chronic lung diseases (coverage 15.1%). Conclusions. The socio-economic and epidemiological burden of diseases associated with pneumococcal infection in Russia remains high. Accurate assessment of morbidity and mortality rates caused by St. pneumoniae diseases is not possible due to the insufficient level of their ethological identification. Further efforts are required to achieve a high level of herd immunity against pneumococcal infection through vaccine prevention, especially today, during COVID-19 pandemic. ? 2021 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina.

Compared with the standard indicators, our results are much more chronologically disaggregated and up-to-date and, therefore, can inform the current debate on the appropriate policy response to the pandemic. Unsurprisingly, we find that nations that experienced the most severe initial outbreaks also grappled with the hardest economic recessions. However, we detect diffused signs of recovery, with economic activity in most European countries returning to its pre-pandemic level by August 2020. Furthermore, we show how delaying intervention or pursuing 'herd immunity' are not successful strategies, since they increase both economic disruption and mortality. The most effective short-run strategy to minimize the impact of the pandemic appears to be the introduction of early and relatively less stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions.","output":"Real-time tracking of the economic impact of COVID-19: insights from the first wave of the pandemic across Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The polysaccharide from Morinda citrifolia fermentation liquor was extracted by hot water method.

Thirteen countries implemented lockdown measures, two countries (Sweden, Iceland) not. As output parameters, we studied herd immunity level and time of formation. Comparison of these parameters was used as an indicator of effectiveness / ineffectiveness of lockdown measures. In the absence of a medical vaccine, herd immunity may be regarded as a factor of population adaptation to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2, the viral pathogen causing COVID-19 disease (SARS-CoV-2), and hence COVID-19 spreading stop. We demonstrated that there is no significant difference between lockdown and no-lockdown modes of COVID-19 containment, in terms of both herd immunity level and the time of achieving its maximum. The rationale for personal and business lockdowns may be found in the avoidance of healthcare system overburdening.

Because factors influencing its occurrence are largely unknown, this study addresses a potential relationship between thrombus histology and clot stability. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighty-five patients with anterior circulation stroke treated with thrombectomy were included in this retrospective study. The number and location of emboli after retrieving the primary thrombus, the number of maneuvers, and TICI scores were evaluated. H&E and neutrophil elastase staining of retrieved clots was performed, and semiquantitative measurements of thrombus components were correlated with procedural parameters. RESULTS An inverse correlation between maneuvers required for thrombus retrieval and the number of distal and intermediate emboli was observed (Spearman r, -0.23; P = .032). Younger patients were at higher risk for periprocedural thrombus fragmentation (Spearman r, -0.23; P = .032). Bridging thrombolysis tended to be associated with fewer maneuvers (2 vs 3, P = .054) but more emboli (1 vs 0, P = .067). While no consistent correlation between procedural parameters and red/white blood cells and fibrin-/platelet fractions could be found, higher amounts of neutrophil elastase-positive cells within the thrombus were independently associated with the occurrence of multiple emboli (adjusted OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.1-19.7; P = .041) and lower rates of complete recanalization (adjusted OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9; P = .050). CONCLUSIONS Younger age, easy-to-retrieve thrombi, and bridging thrombolysis may be risk factors for periprocedural thrombus fragmentation. Findings from standard histologic stains did not provide insight into thrombectomy-relevant thrombus stability. However, higher neutrophil levels in the thrombus tissue were related to an increased risk of periprocedural thrombus fragmentation. This observation aligns with the proposed thrombolytic capacity of neutrophil elastase and points to its potential clinical relevance in the context of stroke thrombectomy.","output":"Risk of Thrombus Fragmentation during Endovascular Stroke Treatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has catalysed what may soon become a permanent digital transition in the domains of work, education, medicine, and leisure.

The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize the longitudinal literature that describes these associations. METHODS Six electronic databases were searched for articles published through March 2018. Eligible articles were published in the English language, peer-reviewed, and had prospective cohort study designs. Articles eligible for inclusion examined positive and negative parenting practices of parents and/or guardians when study subjects were between 0 and 9 years of age, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and internalizing symptoms when subjects were between 10 and 19 years of age. Heterogeneity of included articles precluded meta-analysis: findings were reported narratively. RESULTS 4558 references were screened for inclusion, and 19 articles met eligibility criteria and were included for review. Ten articles examined positive parenting practices, and four demonstrated statistically significant associations between positive parenting practices and lower risk of adolescent depression, anxiety, and/or internalizing symptoms. Fifteen articles examined negative parenting practices, and five demonstrated significant associations between negative parenting practices and higher risk of adolescent depression, anxiety, and/or internalizing symptoms. CONCLUSION This review demonstrates that the evidence base supporting longitudinal associations between parenting practices in childhood and adolescent symptoms of depression, anxiety, and internalizing problems is inconsistent.

Neutrophil recruitment in response to PVM infection was diminished five-fold in IFN receptor gene-deleted mice, although neutrophils from IFNR -/- mice expressed transcripts for the CCL3 receptor, CCR1 and responded functionally to CCL3 ex vivo. Similarly, in the absence of PVM infection, CCL3 overexpression alone could not elicit neutrophil recruitment in the absence of IFN. Interestingly, although supplemental IFN restored neutrophil recruitment and resulted in a sustained weight loss among CCL3-overexpressing IFN -/- mice, CCL3-mediated neutrophil recruitment alone did not result in the pulmonary edema or respiratory failure characteristic of severe viral infection, suggesting that CCL3 and IFN- together are sufficient to promote neutrophil recruitment but not pathologic activation.

There is an immediate need for a simple, rapid, early and sensitive point-of-care testing for COVID-19 disease. However, current testing approaches do not meet such need. Recently, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based detection methods have received substantial attention for nucleic acid-based molecular testing due to their simplicity, high sensitivity and specificity. This review explores the various CRISPR-based COVID-19 detection methods and related diagnostic devices. As with any emerging technology, CRISPR/Cas-based nucleic acid testing methods have several challenges that must be overcome for practical applications in clinics and hospitals. More importantly, these detection methods are not limited to COVID-19 but can be applied to detect any type of pathogen, virus, and fungi that may threaten humans, agriculture, and food industries in resource-limited settings. CRISPR/Cas-based detection methods have the potential to become simpler, more reliable, more affordable, and faster in the near future, which is highly important for achieving point-of-care diagnostics.","output":"CRISPR-Based COVID-19 Testing: Toward Next-Generation Point-of-Care Diagnostics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High antibody titers have been found to correlate with the severity of COVID-19 disease.

Anthropogenic activity led to high coastal sea waters pollution, eutrophy, and endangered the seas self-purification capabilities. The total quarantine introduced on the Black Sea coast of the Krasnodar territory associated with the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 pandemic led to a decrease in anthropogenic pressure on coastal ecosystems and provided a unique opportunity to trace the dynamics of the most important hydrochemical indicators of coastal waters in the Tuapse district. The study aimed to characterize the impact of quarantine measures against the coronavirus on the state of coastal waters in the eastern part of the Russian Black Sea. For this, we identified and characterized the hydrochemical indicators and determined the effect of quarantine measures on their dynamics. The study used the standardized methods. The results obtained showed that a decrease in the recreational stress led to a proportional decrease in the pollutants supply to coastal sea waters;with the recreational stress resumption the concentrations of mobile pollutants tended to increase;a proportional relationship was established between biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5 ) and the ammonium nitrogen (NH4+ ) concentration;the nitrates (NO3C ) concentration, in the seawater did not depend on the recreational stress degree. In particular, a proportional increase in NH4+ concentration and BOD5 in seawater was detected: in the third quarter of 2019 the concentration of NH4+ and BOD5 amounted to 3.0 mg/dm3 and 8.5 mg/dm3, and 3.8 mg/dm3 and 7.5 mg/dm3 in the fourth quarter, respectively;in the 2020 samples, a decrease in the NH4+ concentration to 0.8 mg/dm3 in the third and to 1.2 mg/dm3 in the fourth quarter led to a proportional decrease in BOD5 4.5 mg/dm3 and 3.9 mg/dm3, respectively. Thus, it was shown that the quarantine measures were shown to have a positive effect on the processes of self-purification of coastal sea waters in recreational zones. ? 2021, Russian Geographical Society.

This down-regulation has been thought to predominantly function at the level of the messenger (m)RNA, post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). Recently, the discovery that siRNAs can function to suppress a genes expression at the level of transcription, i.e., transcriptional gene silencing (TGS), has created a major paradigm shift in mammalian RNAi. These recent findings significantly broaden the role RNA, specifically siRNAs and potentially microRNAs, plays in the regulation of gene expression as well as the breadth of potential siRNA target sites. Indeed, the specificity and simplicity of design makes the use of siRNAs to target and suppress virtually any gene or gene promoter of interest a realized technology. Furthermore, since siRNAs are a small nucleic acid reagent, they are unlikely to elicit an immune response, making them a theoretically good future therapeutic.

This article aims to present the different steps implemented by the French Addictovigilance network in collaboration with the French Health authorities from March to May 2020, including monitoring of potential harmful events, and scientific communication. The first events were identified through the continuity of the networking between the French addictovigilance centres and their partners: community pharmacies, general practitioners, specialized structures and emergency wards. As soon as the lockdown began, first cases of overdoses (lethal or not) were reported with opioids, mainly with methadone, and other opioids (heroin, oxycodone, tramadol or antitussive codeine). Lockdown-related noteworthy events consisted in clinical cases or other relevant information for which lockdown clearly played an important role : among the many substances identified at least once, pregabalin, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine and nitrous oxide were the most significant in terms of prevalence, seriousness or particularly specific to the lockdown context. Despite significant decrease in the activity and travel limited to vital needs, community pharmacies continued to identify falsified prescriptions in this period, highlighting an increase in suspicious requests for pregabalin, codeine and tramadol. In parallel, the French addictovigilance network continued its communications efforts in the period, issuing a newsletter on tramadol, a press release on methadone and naloxone, and participating in the COVID-19 frequently asked questions (FAQs) of the French Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutic website (https://sfpt-fr.org/covid19 ).

In this form of therapy, patients T-cells are modified by various genetic techniques to express a new receptor that identifies and kills the cancer cells. With increasing use, they present with distinct immune mediated side effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity, and prolonged cytopenia. While our understanding of CRS and other immune side-effects has increased, prolonged cytopenia post CAR-T infusion remains under-recognized and under-reported. With the focus on prolonged cytopenia in this review, we aim to summarize findings of various clinical trials, postulated mechanisms, and clinical interventions to risk-stratify and manage this clinical entity. ABSTRACT: Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy has emerged as an efficacious and life extending treatment modality with high response rates and durable remissions in patients with relapsed and refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), follicular lymphoma, and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) as well as in other diseases. Prolonged or recurrent cytopenias after CAR-T therapy have increasingly been reported at varying rates, and the pathogenesis of this complication is not yet well-understood but is likely contributed to by multiple factors. Current studies reported are primarily retrospective, heterogeneous in terms of CAR-Ts used and diseases treated, non-uniform in definitions of cytopenias and durations for end points, and vary in terms of recommended management. Prospective studies and correlative laboratory studies investigating the pathophysiology of prolonged cytopenias will enhance our understanding of this phenomenon. This review summarizes knowledge of these cytopenias to date.","output":"Cytopenia after CAR-T Cell TherapyA Brief Review of a Complex Problem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article analyzes the specific and critical role of trust in scientists for both the support for and compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We exploit large-scale, longitudinal, and representative surveys for twelve countries over the period from March to December 2020, and we complement the analysis with experimental data. We find that trust in scientists is the key driving force behind individual support for and compliance with NPIs, and for favorable attitudes towards vaccination. The effect of trust in government is more ambiguous and tends to diminish support for and compliance with NPIs in countries where the recommendations from scientists and the government were not aligned. Trust in others also has seemingly paradoxical effects: in countries where social trust is high, the support for NPIs is low due to higher expectations that others will voluntary social distance. Our individual-level longitudinal data also allows us to evaluate the effects of within-person changes in trust over the pandemic: we show that trust levels, and in particular trust in scientists, have changed dramatically for individuals and within countries, with important subsequent effects on compliant behavior and support for NPIs.

Methods: We investigated the clinical outcomes (length of hospital stay, COVID-19 disease severity based on published criteria, and mortality) of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized from 21 healthcare systems across 6 countries. Leveraging a unique federated multinational network in which electronic health records data are curated by local clinicians and informatics experts, we categorized patients according to the presence of central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS) diagnoses during COVID-19 hospitalization. We further identified comorbidities preceding hospitalization for COVID-19 up to 12 months. Each healthcare system locally performed covariate-adjusted survival analysis using Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the association between neurologic status and time to discharge, severe COVID-19 disease, and death. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis on locally generated results to estimate the risk of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with concurrent neurological diagnoses during COVID-19 hospitalization versus those with no neurological condition (NNC). Findings: We analyzed 87,869 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from January 2020 until September 2021, 13,518 (15%) with at least one CNS diagnosis, and 2,461 (3%) with at least one PNS diagnosis. The CNS group had longer hospital stay (median of 12 days), greater risk of severe disease, and higher risk of mortality than the NNC group. The PNS group also had longer hospital stay, but a similar risk of severe disease and lower risk of mortality than the NNC group. Patients with CNS diagnoses had a greater burden of pre-existing comorbidities, including neurologic conditions, when compared to the NNC group.

MethodsWe used data for all inpatient hospital admissions in England in CYP aged 0-17 between March 1st 2015 to Feb 28th 2021, linked to paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, and mortality data. We examined associations between PICU admission and death by sociodemographic factors and comorbidities within COVID-19 and PIMS-TS admissions. We calculated odds ratios and predicted probability of PICU admission using generalized estimation equations, and compared these between COVID-19, PIMS-TS, other admissions in 2020/21, all admissions in 2019/20, and admissions due to influenza in 20219/20. Analyses of deaths were descriptive due to low numbers. FindingsWithin COVID-19, there were 6,338 hospital admissions, 259 PICU admissions and 8 deaths. Within PIMS-TS there were 712 hospital admissions 312 PICU admissions and <5 deaths. Males were 52.8% of COVID-19 admissions (similar to other causes of admission), but were 63.5% of PIMS-TS admissions. CYP aged 10-17 were 35.6 and 29% of COVID-19 and PIMS-TS admissions respectively, higher than in all admission and influenza admissions in 2019/20. In multivariable models, odds of PICU admission were: increased amongst neonates and decreased amongst 15-17 compared with 1-4 year olds with COVID-19, increased in older CYP and females with PIMS-TS, and increased for Black compared with White ethnicity in COVID-19 and PIMS-TS. Odds of PICU admission with COVID-19 were increased for CYP with any comorbidity and were highest for CYP with multiple medical problems. Increases in risk of PICU admission associated with comorbidities showed similar patterns for COVID-19 and all admissions in 2019/20 and influenza admissions in 2019/20, but were greater for COVID-19. Interpreting associations with comorbidities within PIMS-TS was complex due to the multisystem nature of the disease. InterpretationCYP were at very low risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19 or PIMS-TS. PICU admission due to PIMS-TS was associated with older non-white CYP. Patterns of vulnerability for severe COVID-19 appear to magnify background risk factors for serious illness in CYP. Evidence before this studyWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies investigating risk factors associated with severe disease among children and young people admitted with COVID-19 and PIMS-TS, [Harwood, R et al. 2021 (submission to the Lancet linked with this paper)]. We identified 81 studies. Infants were found to have increased odds of PICU admission compared with 1-4, but there were no associations by sex. Other factors associated with PICU admission included number of co-morbid conditions, with neurological, cardiac and gastrointestinal associated with the greatest risk. Low numbers of serious SARS-CoV-2 infections or deaths amongst CYP limit these analyses, yet national studies of CYP have not yet been published. Importantly, we found these studies did not take into account background risks for severe illness in CYP who are known to be vulnerable before the pandemic. What this study addsThis is the first population base study of risk factors for severe disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection in CYP in England. We analyse all admissions to hospital amongst 0-17 year olds nationally between 2015-2021 linked to multiple other health datasets. We explore how socioeconomic factors and co-morbidities are associated with Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) admission and death amongst CYP admitted with COVID-19 and PIMS-TS, and compare this with other causes for admission during the pandemic and in the year prior. As CYP with PIMS-TS are highly likely to require hospitalization, we were able to analyse total national cases of the condition during 2020/21. We found extremely low numbers of CYP required PICU or died as a result of SARS-CoV-2 in the first pandemic year. CYP admitted due to COVID-19 disease were older and more likely to be non-white with pre-existing conditions, similar to patterns seen in adults. Patterns of associations between comorbidities and risk of PICU admission amongst COVID-19 were similar to those seen for all admissions and influenza admissions in the year prior to the pandemic. However, the increase in risk associated with comorbidities for COVID-19 admissions were greater than in these cohorts. We found most cases of PIMS-TS were amongst non-white male adolescents without previous hospital admissions. Interpreting associations between comorbidities and PICU admission for PIMS-TS was complicated by the multi-system nature of the disease. Implications of all the available evidenceCYP with most vulnerable to COVID-19 were also those most at risk of prior to the pandemic due to other illnesses such as influenza, although COVID-19 appears to amplify this risk profile. It is important to consider this context when advising parents and carers regarding the risk posed by COVID-19, considering potential harms to CYP as a result of shielding precautions.","output":"Risk factors for intensive care admission and death amongst children and young people admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and PIMS-TS in England during the first pandemic year"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) epidemic has created an unprecedented medical and economic crisis all over the world.

Its goal during a pandemic was to keep patients from seeking unnecessary in-person care from emergency departments and urgent care clinics, especially when dental practices were closed or limited to providing essential urgent and emergency oral health care. METHODS The Adams School of Dentistry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, developed the Carolina Dentistry Virtual Oral Health Care Helpline using a quality improvement framework with faculty and staff member feedback. The process included establishing infrastructure (phone, video, protocols, referrals, documentation), personnel (scheduling, training, calibration), and internal and external communication. The authors collected retrospective information for descriptive evaluation of the first month's operations. RESULTS There were 337 telephone calls answered, of which 65 (19%) were administrative and 272 (81%) were related to dental concerns. Dental pain (54%) was the most prevalent reason for calling. Triage and Providers referred 107 of 175 callers (61%) to the school's urgent care center. Of the 79 callers who received teleconsultations from virtual providers, 33 (42%) did not require additional follow-up, and 7 (9%) needed a follow-up phone call. Overall, 4 people were referred to community clinics, and 4 were referred to the emergency department. CONCLUSIONS The Helpline was launched quickly and improved through quality improvement cycles, and it provided a needed community dental service.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review on disinfectants to decontaminate N95 FFRs using Embase, Medline, Global Health, Google Scholar, WHO feed, and MedRxiv. Two reviewers independently determined study eligibility and extracted predefined data fields.

Residual hydrogen peroxide levels following decontamination were within safe limits. More than one decontamination cycle of vaporized H(2)O(2) may be possible but further information is required on how multiple cycles would affect FFR fit in a real world setting before the upper limit can be established.

To achieve this goal, an analytical descriptive method was applied within a sample of 784 university students affiliated to the University of Constantine 2, during the university year (2020 - 2021). To collect data, an updated questionnaire was adapted from a study (Ravi, William, Aixiu, and Kenneth 2015) which was based on the theory of interactive distance by Zhang. The study found that the results of the teaching operation were average for the students, whether in terms of teaching their goals, learning or being satisfied with the lessons offered by the teaching staff. This is due to poor interaction with the learning environment, which witnessed a lack of communication between the student and the teacher, a poor structure of the lessons that did not take into account the learning patterns, and the little distance learning experience that did not allow the university to control it, despite the good online learning readiness of the students. The study urges educators to give more attention to the dimensions of distance education, which witnessed major imbalances in the previous experience, by intensifying electronic interaction between students and teachers. It also recommends more attention to the structure of lessons through the development of a graphic charter and a unified structure which will be adopted by the university whenever preparing and presenting lessons.

Calls to strengthen the UK House of Commons as a democratic actor and leader on gender equality should attend to it as a co-professional organisational settingthat is, not as a unitary actor but composed of different categories and demographics of staff. The gendered terms of arrangements that structure the relationships between these actors are important, not only for a just everyday working life but for legislative outcomes too. This chapter offers some final reflections on the books contributionsnotably how feminist discursive institutionalist approaches combined with parliamentary ethnography makes for a compelling lens to explore gender and power in parliaments. Drawing on the empirical chapters, the chapter considers five possibilities for parliamentary reform, conceiving of agency as identity-contingent. Although the chapter highlights possibilities for endogenous change, it considers how COVID-19 might affect institutional reform in the UK House of Commons. Overall, this book contributes one discussion towards the broader international feminist project to re-future parliamentary democracy.","output":"Beneath Mainstream Approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Statement of purposePreventing opioid misuse and opioid use disorder (OUD) is necessary given the opioid epidemic Prevention programs for adolescents/young adults are needed to alter risk trajectories We developed interventions using telemedicine (synchronous video conference) and a patient portal-like messaging system to address risk factors for opioid misuse/OUD among young Emergency Department (ED) patients Our presentation describes these promising interventions and their feasibility and acceptability Methods/ApproachIn Spring 2020, N = 40 ED patients ages 16C30 who were at risk for opioid misuse/OUD enrolled in a pilot trial involving screening/baseline assessments, motivational interviewing-based remote interventions (baseline telemedicine brief intervention [BI], 1-month of portal messaging), and a 1-month follow-up Before COVID-19, N = 10 enrolled in the ED (in-person cohort: IPC);during COVID-19, N = 30 recent ED patients enrolled via phone recruitment (remote cohort: RC) Feasibility data are presented by cohort;acceptability data are combined ResultsAmong the N=40, the sample had a mean age of 22 9 years Gender was: 70% female, 5% non-conforming, 25% male Race was: 75% White, 15% Black/African American, and 10% other racial identities;17 5% were Hispanic/Latinx Regarding feasibility, eligibility rates were similar (IPC: 17%, RC: 15%);consenting rates differed (IPC: 100%, RC: 56%), likely due to the RCs telephone approach Portal engagement increased from the IPC (60%) to the RC (93%), possibly due to addressing technical difficulties and IPC user feedback BI and portal satisfaction were high (M = 9 3 on a 1C10 scale and M = 8 5, respectively) Interventions exceeded motivational interviewing fidelity thresholds (adapted for portal messaging) Follow-up rates were high (IPC: 80%, RC: 93%) SignificancePreventing opioid misuse is critical to avoiding escalation of opioid use and overdoses, and emergency department patients are at increased risk This study demonstrates the feasibility and acceptability of these intervention approaches via telemedicine for preventing future injuries","output":"0024 Feasibility and acceptability of telemedicine and patient portal interventions to prevent opioid misuse in adolescents and young adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper reports the design, development, and testing of a novel, yet simple and low-cost portable device for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2.

In this review, we present Nitazoxanide a US-FDA approved antiprotozoal drug, as one such promising candidate. Nitazoxanide which is reported to exert broad-spectrum antiviral activity against various viral infections, revealed good in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture assays, suggesting potential for repurposing in COVID-19. Furthermore, nitazoxanide displays the potential to boost host innate immune responses and thereby tackle the life-threatening cytokine storm. Possibilities of improving lung, as well as multiple organ damage and providing value addition to COVID-19 patients with comorbidities, are other important facets of the drug. The review juxtaposes the role of nitazoxanide in fighting COVID-19 pathogenesis at multiple levels highlighting the great promise the drug exhibits.

PURPOSE We searched for particular clinical characteristics before STN-DBS linked to on-state axial problems after surgery. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed baseline motor, emotional and cognitive features from PD patients with early axial symptoms (within 4 years after STN-DBS) and late axial symptoms (after 4 years). We also considered a group of PD patients without axial symptoms for at least 4 years after surgery. RESULTS At baseline, early-axial PD patients (n = 28) had a higher on-state Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (15.0  5.6 to 11.6  6.2, p = 0.020), higher axial score (2.4  1.8 to 0.7  1.0, p < 0.001) and worse dopaminergic response (0.62  0.12 to 0.70  0.11, p = 0.005), than non-axial PD patients (n = 51). Early-axial PD patients had short-term recall impairment, not seen in non-axial PD (36.3  7.6 to 40.3  9.3, p = 0.041). These variables were similar between late-axial PD (n = 18) and non-axial PD, but late-axial PD showed worse frontal dysfunction.

Since there has been only limited research on how social presence can influence food consumption experience, this study aimed to determine whether differing means of social presence could influence sensory and emotional responses to consumed meals. A total of 56 participants, comprised of 28 co-habiting pairs, ate meal samples on 3 separate days under 3 different commensality conditions: (1) physically together (physical commensality), (2) virtually together (digital commensality), and (3) alone (eating alone). The participants, under the three commensality conditions, rated attribute intensities and acceptance of meal samples and also self-reported emotional responses to the meals. The results demonstrated that participants liked physical commensality the most, followed by digital commensality, with the eating alone condition least liked. While the participants liked the meals under the physical commensality condition more than under the eating alone condition, there was no significant difference in overall meal liking between the physical and digital commensality conditions. Commensality conditions also induced variation in meal-evoked emotional profiles, with the physical and digital commensality conditions more associated with positive valence-related emotions. Differing commensality conditions resulted in variation in the duration of meal consumption, with the shortest eating duration occurring under the eating alone condition. In conclusion, this study emphasizes the great potential for improving eating environments by incorporating technological enhancement into commensality, especially when physical commensality is impossible.","output":"Power of presence: Effects of physical or digital commensality on consumer perception and acceptance of meals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cellular membrane-derived nanoparticles, particularly of red blood cells (RBCs), represent an emerging class of drug delivery systems. The lack of nucleus and organelles in these cells makes them easy to process and empty out intracellular contents. The empty vesicle membranes can then be either used as a coating on nanoparticles or can be reassembled into a nanovesicle. Engineered RBCs membrane has unique ability to retain its lipid bilayer architecture with host's proteins during top-down approach, thus allowing it to form stable nanoformulations mimicking RBCs stealth properties. In addition, its core-shell structure allows loading of different drug molecules, and its surface chemistry can be manipulated by facile conjugation with ligands on the shell. The remarkable ability of RBCs membrane to fuse with membranes of other cells enables the formation of hybrid nanovesicles. In this review, we highlight the biomedical applications of such vesicles and discuss the potential challenges related to its clinical translation. Although nano-RBCs retain much of the host's proteins, which may give an edge over synthetic nanoparticles in terms of lower immunogenicity, its production at industrial level is more challenging.

However, surgery in the acute phase of COVID-19 is associated with worse postoperative outcomes and an increased risk of mortality. We report a case of a patient with COVID-19 who developed intestinal perforation that was treated acutely with antibiotics and delayed surgical intervention. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 79-year-old man with COVID-19 was treated with remdesivir and dexamethasone, and his respiratory symptoms and hypoxia improved. However, abdominal symptoms developed, and intestinal perforation occurred. As the nasopharyngeal swab PCR test was positive for SARS-CoV-2, conservative treatment with tazobactam/piperacillin was started to avoid surgery in the acute phase of COVID-19. An intraperitoneal abscess was confirmed on follow-up computed tomography. Emergent laparoscopic lavage and drainage, and transverse colon stoma construction were performed with medical staff using full personal protective equipment. Bacterial culture from the ascites detected Escherichia coli and Bacteroides. The SARS-CoV-2 PCR test of the ascites sample was negative. No infection was observed in the medical staff. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 has been associated with a higher perioperative risk and postoperative mortality. There has also been a report of ascitic fluid testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR, suggesting the possibility of intraoperative aerosolization. Avoiding surgical treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 may reduce deaths from perioperative complications. CONCLUSION: Our case suggests that in acute COVID-19 lung infection, careful observation and delayed surgical treatment could prevent worsening of the COVID-19 and reduce the risk of infection to the medical staff.","output":"Successful laparoscopic lavage and drainage for intestinal perforation in a patient with COVID-19: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neutrophils perform critical functions in the innate response to infection, including through the production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) - web-like DNA structures which are extruded from neutrophils upon activation.

Here we show that NETs, through their protein component histones, directly activate T cells and specifically enhance Th17 cell differentiation.

Using monthly data for the first time in this literature, we find that corruption and other weaker institutions lower stock returns during the period 1995-2014. However, interaction effects show interesting mixed results: Bureaucratic quality can mitigate the ill effects of corruption and increase returns by reducing red tape, whereas corruption distorts law and order and lowers stock returns.

The present study aimed to examine the mediating roles of coping, psychological flexibility and prosociality in the impacts of perceived illness threats toward COVID-19 on mental health. METHOD: Five-hundred and fourteen Hong Kong citizens (18 years or above) completed an online survey to measure illness perceptions toward COVID-19, coping, psychological flexibility, prosociality, and mental health, together with their socio-demographic variables. Structural equation modelling was used to explore the explanatory model that was the best-fit to illustrate the relationships between these constructs. RESULTS: Serial mediation structural equation model showed that only psychological flexibility (unstandardised beta coefficient, ? = - 0.12, 95% CI [- 0.20, - 0.02], p = 0.031) and prosociality (unstandardised ? = 0.04, 95% CI [0.01, 0.08], p = 0.001) fully mediated the relationship between illness perceptions toward COVID-19 and mental health. In addition, psychological flexibility exerted a direct effect on prosociality (standardised ? = 0.22, 95% CI [0.12, 0.32], p < 0.001).

Material and methods: Two-hundred fifty-six sera from 101 patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive RTCPCR) and 50 control sera were tested for IgM/IgG using the NG-Test IgM-IgG COVID all-in-one assay. The seroconversion dynamic was assessed by symptom onset and day of RTCPCR diagnosis. Results: Among the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, positive IgG and/or IgM result was observed for 67.3% of patients (68/101), including 17 (16.8%) already positive at the day of RTCPCR, and 51 (50.5%) with observable seroconversion, and 32.7% (33/101) remained negative as subsequent sampling was not possible (patient discharge or death). The sensitivity increased with the delay between onset of symptoms and sampling, going from 29.1%, 78.2% and 86.5% for the time periods of 0-9-, 10-14- and >14-days after the onset of symptoms, respectively. Cumulative sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value and Negative Predictive Value were 97.0%, 100%, 100% and 96.2%, respectively 15-days after the onset of symptoms. No difference in seroconversion delay was observed regardless of whether patients received ventilation. Conclusions: The NG-test is a bedside serological assay that could serve as a complementary source of diagnostic information to RTCPCR and chest imaging. It may also be useful to monitor immunological status of medical and non-medical workers during the ongoing pandemic, and the general population after social distancing measures have eased.","output":"Rapid Determination of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a bedside, point-of-Care, serological test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Portuguese-speaking immigrants are a growing underserved population in the Unites States who experience high levels of psychological distress and increased vulnerability to mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety. Current evidence shows that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are effective to promote physical and mental health among educated English speakers; nonetheless, the lack of diversity in the mindfulness literature is a considerable limitation. To our knowledge, the feasibility and acceptability of MBIs among Portuguese-speaking immigrants have not yet been investigated. Methods: This single-arm pilot study (N = 30) explored the feasibility, acceptability, and cultural aspects of Mindfulness Training for Primary Care (MTPC)-Portuguese among Portuguese-speaking immigrants in the Boston area. MTPC is an 8-week, primary care-adapted, referral-based, insurance-reimbursable, trauma-informed MBI that is fully integrated into a healthcare system. The study also examined intervention preliminary effectiveness on mental health outcomes (depression and anxiety symptoms) and self-regulation (emotional regulation, mindfulness, self-compassion, interoceptive awareness), and initiation of health behavior was explored. Results: Primary care providers referred 129 patients from 2018 to 2020. Main DSM-5 primary diagnoses were depression (76.3%) and anxiety disorders (6.7%). Participants (N = 30) attended a mean of 6.1 (SD 1.92) sessions and reported a mean of 213.7 (SD = 124.3) min of practice per week. All survey finishers would recommend the program to a friend, found the program helpful, and rated the overall program as very good or excellent, and 93% would participate again, with satisfaction mean scores between 4.6 and 5 (Likert scale 0C5). Participants and group leaders provided feedback to refine MTPC-Portuguese culturally responsiveness regarding materials language, settings, time, food, and community building. Patients exhibited reductions in depression (d = 0.67; p < 0.001) and anxiety (d = 0.48; p = 0.011) symptoms, as well as enhanced emotional regulation (d = 0.45; p = 0.009), and among survey finishers, 50% initiated health behavior change through action plan initiation. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that MTPC-Portuguese is feasible, acceptable, and culturally appropriate among Portuguese-speaking patients in the Boston area. Furthermore, the intervention might potentially decrease depression and anxiety symptoms, facilitate health behavior change, and improve emotional regulation. MTPC-Portuguese investigation with larger samples in controlled studies is warranted to support its dissemination and implementation in the healthcare system.

The Wen Bing formulas, such as Yin-Qiao-San and Sang-Ju-Yin, are still first-line herbal therapies in combating variant influenza virus. To continue our study on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between Wen Bing formulas and oseltamivir (OS), the first-line western drug for the treatment of influenza, further interactions between OS and the eight single herbs and their relevant marker components from Wen Bing formulas were investigated in the current study. AIM OF STUDY: To establish an in-vitro screening platform for investigation of the potential anti-influenza herbs/herbal components that may have pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions with OS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To screen potential inhibition on OS hydrolysis, 1 g/mL of OS is incubated with herbs/herbal components in diluted rat plasma, microsomes and human recombinant carboxylesterase 1(hCE1) under optimized conditions. MDCK-WT and MDCK-MDR1 cell lines are utilized to identify potential modification on P-gp mediated transport of OS by herbs/herbal components. Caco-2 cells with and without Gly-Sar inhibition are performed to study the uptake of OS via PEPT1 transporters. Modification on OAT3 mediated transport is verified by the uptake of OS on HEK293-MOCK/HEK293-OAT3 cells. Anti-virus effects were evaluated using plaque reduction assay on H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Potential pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between OS (30 mg/kg) and the selected herb, Radix Scutellariae (RS), at 300C600 mg/kg were carried out on rats. All samples are analyzed by an LC/MS/MS method for the contents of OS and OSA. A mechanistic PK model was developed to interpret the HDI between OS and RS in rats. RESULTS: Our developed platform was successfully applied to screen the eight herbal extracts and their ten marker components on metabolic inhibition of OS and modification of OS transport mediated by P-gp, OAT3 and PEPT1. Results from six in-vitro experiments were analyzed after converting raw data from each experiment to corresponding fold-change (FC) values, based on which Radix Scutellariae (RS) were selected to have the most HDI potential with OS. By analyzing the plasma and urine pharmacokinetic data after co-administration of OS with a standardized RS extract in rats using an integrated population pharmacokinetics model, it is suggested that RS could inhibit OS hydrolysis during absorption and increase the absorbed fraction of OS, which leads to the increased ratio of OS concentration versus that of OSA in both rat plasma and urine. Never the less, the anti-virus effects of 2.5 h post-dose rat plasma were not influenced by co-administration of OS with RS. CONCLUSION: A six-dimension in-vitro screening platform has been developed and successfully applied to find RS as a potential herb that would influence the co-administrated OS in rats. Although co-administered RS could inhibit OS hydrolysis during absorption and increase the absorbed fraction of OS, which lead to the increased ratio of OS concentration versus that of OSA in both rat plasma and urine, the anti-virus effect of OS was not influenced by co-administered RS.","output":"Evaluation of potential herb-drug interactions between oseltamivir and commonly used anti-influenza Chinese medicinal herbs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Este trabalho objetivou comparar a qualidade microbiolgica e higienicossanitria de sanduches comercializados por restaurantes do tipo fast food, franqueados e n?o-franqueados.

In response, this study aimed to explore what constitutes childrens wellbeing through their drawings and discussions. Ninety-one seven and eight-year old children from two primary schools in areas of relatively high deprivation in eastern England participated in this study. We identified indicators of wellbeing that were made explicit in childrens drawings, such as the need for safety, happiness and positive relationships, but also indicators that remained rather implicit, such as the environment and nature. The drawings in particular illustrated that childrens perceptions of wellbeing were subject to the affordances of their favourite spaces for emotional, mental physical and material wellbeing. Access to nature and outdoor spaces was interconnected with all these affordances. We analysed these findings through the theoretical lenses of positive psychology, self-actualisation, social mentality and the human-nature relationship. We argue that making nature explicit, and restoring the interconnectedness between the arts and nature in the current literature, should be a key priority for future research and practice on childrens wellbeing indicators.","output":"Making Nature Explicit in Childrens Drawings of Wellbeing and Happy Spaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 may not only manifest as pneumonia (COVID\\\\19) but also in other organs, including the brain (neuro\\\\COVID).

Part of this includes patients skipping well-child visits to reduce risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus. Published estimates of the duration of whole-body aluminum (Al) toxicity from vaccines in infants from birth to six months indicate that CDC's recommended vaccination schedule leads to unacceptably long periods of time in which infants are in aluminum toxicity (as measured by %AlumTox). METHODS: We utilize these established clearance and accumulation models to calculate expected per-body-weight whole-body toxicity of aluminum from vaccines considering for children of all ages under CDC's Catch-Up schedule from birth to ten years, assuming social distancing for 6 months. Our updated Pediatric Dose Limit (PDL) model assumes a linear improvement in renal function from birth to two years. RESULTS: Our results indicate that due diligence in considering alternative spacing and use of non-aluminum containing vaccines when possible will reduce whole body toxicity and may reduce risk of morbidity associated with exposure to aluminum. CONCLUSIONS: While reduction or elimination of aluminum exposure from all sources is always a good idea, our results indicate that careful consideration of expected aluminum exposures during regular and Catch-Up vaccination is found to be especially important for infants and children below 2 years of age.

Mental health providers have struggled to keep up with demand, while some pediatric practices face insolvency due to reduced demand for pediatric sick visits. We quantify these changes in a pediatric hospital system and describe opportunities for child and adolescent psychiatrists to engage with pediatrician colleagues in the new pediatric healthcare landscape. Methods: Visit data from a large metropolitan childrens hospital for the periods March 2020 to February 2021 and March 2019 to February 2020 were compared, and key stakeholders were interviewed. Results: Pediatric outpatient visits declined by 28.3% (p < 0.001), and emergency department visits decreased by 45.6% (p < 0.001). Outpatient child and adolescent psychiatry visits increased by 23% (p = 0.002). Decreased demand for pediatric care resulted in underemployment of general pediatricians.

In Indonesia, a country with an over-burdened healthcare system, individuals could use self-tests for SARS-CoV-2 to determine their COVID-19 status. To assess the acceptability of SARS-CoV-2 self-testing among the general population in Indonesia, a cross-sectional, population-based survey was conducted in mid-2021 in Jakarta and the provinces of Banten and North Sulawesi. MethodsThis was a survey that approached respondents in >600 randomly selected street-points in the three study geographies. A 35-item questionnaire was used to collect data on key variables, such as willingness to use and to pay for a SARS-CoV-2 self-test and likely actions following a positive result. Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed. ResultsOf 630 respondents, (318 were female), 14% knew about COVID-19 self-testing, while 62.7% agreed with the concept of people being able to self-test at home, unassisted, for COVID-19. If self-tests were available in Indonesia, >60% of respondents would use them if they felt it necessary and would undertake regular self-testing e.g., weekly if recommended. Upon receiving a positive self-test result, most respondents would communicate it (86.03%), request post-test counseling (80.79%), self-isolate (97.46%), and/or warn their close contacts (n=570, 90.48%).

A representative sample of 1359 dietitians from all the Brazilian regions answered the questionnaire-mostly female (92.5%), Catholic (52.9%), from 25 to 39 years old (58.4%), with a partner (63.8%), and with no children (58%). Most of the participants continue working during the pandemic period (83.8%), but they did not have SARS-COV-2 (96%), nor did their family members (80.7%). The wellbeing at work before SARS-COV-2 was 3.88  0.71, statistically different (p < 0.05) from during the pandemic, with the wellbeing of 3.71  0.78. Wellbeing at work was higher before the pandemic for all the analyzed variables. Analyzing variables separately before and during the pandemic, dietitians with partners, children and a Ph.D. presented higher scores for wellbeing at work. Professionals receiving more than five times the minimum wage have higher scores. During the pandemic, better wellbeing was observed for dietitians working remotely.","output":"Wellbeing at Work before and during the SARS-COV-2 Pandemic: A Brazilian Nationwide Study among Dietitians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is an effective and cheap treatment for diarrheal disease; globally, one of the leading causes of death in children under five. The World Health Organization launched a global campaign to improve ORT coverage in 1978, with activities such as educational campaigns, training health workers and the creation of designate programming. Despite these efforts, ORT coverage remains relatively low. The objective of this systematic review is to identify the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of oral rehydration therapy in low and middle-income countries. METHODS: A comprehensive search strategy comprised of relevant subject headings and keywords was executed in 5 databases including OVID Medline, OVID Embase, OVID HealthStar, Web of Science and Scopus. Eligible studies underwent quality assessment, and a directed content analysis approach to data extraction was conducted and aligned to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to facilitate narrative synthesis. RESULTS: The search identified 1570 citations and following removal of duplicates as well as screening according to our inclusion/exclusion criteria, 55 articles were eligible for inclusion in the review. Twenty-three countries were represented in this review, with India, Bangladesh, Egypt, Nigeria, and South Africa having the most representation of available studies. Study dates ranged from 1981 to 2020. Overarching thematic areas spanning the barriers and facilitators that were identified included: availability and accessibility, knowledge, partnership engagement, and design and acceptability. CONCLUSION: A systematic review of studies on implementation of ORT in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) highlights key activities that facilitate the development of successful implementation that include: (1) availability and accessibility of ORT, (2) awareness and education among communities, (3) strong partnership engagement strategies, and (4) adaptable design to enhance acceptability. The barriers and facilitators identified under the CIFR domains can be used to build knowledge on how to adapt ORT to national and local settings and contribute to a better understanding on the implementation and use of ORT in LMICs. The prospects for scaling and sustaining ORT (after years of low use) will increase if implementation research informs local applications, and implementers engage appropriate stakeholders and test assumptions around localized theories of change from interventions to expected outcomes. REGISTRATION: A protocol for this systematic review was developed and uploaded onto the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews database (Registration number: CRD420201695).","output":"Barriers and facilitators to implementation of oral rehydration therapy in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which was initially reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan has now spread unprecedented all over the world, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).

To compare perioperative outcomes for LPN with SRBS with those for LPN with conventional polyglactin suture, with specific attention to warm ischaemia time, blood loss and need for postoperative bleeding interventions. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients who underwent LPN between June 2007 and October 2010 were identified through an Institutional Review Board approved registry of oncological patients. Before July 2009, parenchymal repair after tumour excision was performed using absorbable polyglactin suture (Group 1), and subsequently, using SRBS (Group 2). Demographic, clinical, intraoperative and postoperative outcomes were compared for each group. RESULTS LPN was performed in 49 patients in Group 1 and 29 in Group 2. Baseline demographic and clinical features, estimated blood loss, and transfusion and embolization rates were statistically similar for the cohorts. Mean warm ischaemia time (SD) was significantly shorter for the SRBS group (26.4  8.3 vs 32.8  7.9; P= 0.0013). Bleeding requiring intervention (open conversion or transfusion  embolization) was more common for Group 1 (9/49, 18.4% vs 1/29, 3.4%; P= 0.06). CONCLUSIONS The use of SRBS for parenchymal repair during LPN in humans is safe and is associated with a significant reduction in warm ischaemia time. SRBS use during LPN may also reduce rates of clinically significant bleeding.

METHODS: The Aichi Medical Association performed a comprehensive survey of pediatric anaphylaxis cases aged under 15 years from 87 secondary and 25 tertiary emergency care hospitals in Aichi Prefecture (population 7.5 million), Japan. RESULTS: Between April 2016 and March 2020, 3423 cases of anaphylaxis were identified. Food items were the most frequent trigger (73%), followed by exercise after food ingestion (4.3%), and drugs (2.2%). Egg (19%) and milk (17%) specifically were the most frequent among food triggers, while the largest proportional increase was observed in tree nuts from 6.0% in 2017 to 15% in 2019. Overall, 1647 (48%) cases were admitted to the hospital, of which 26 (0.8%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Drug-induced anaphylaxis was associated with the highest admission rate (71%). Of the 2493 food-induced anaphylaxis cases, 1107 (44%) were treated with adrenaline. Among them, 343 cases included previously prescribed adrenaline auto-injectors (AAI), with 225 (66%) usages prior to hospital arrival. There was no significant difference in the admission rate between the cases in which AAIs were used and those with adrenaline administered in the hospital (68% and 72%, respectively).

DATA SOURCES A MEDLINE search (1996-March 2000) was performed to identify relevant primary and review articles. References from these articles were also reviewed if deemed important. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION English-language primary and review articles focusing on the treatment and prevention of acute otitis media (AOM) were included. Studies focusing exclusively on OM with effusion or serous OM and chronic suppurative OM were excluded. Information regarding prevention and drug therapy was reviewed, with an emphasis placed on advances made in the last two years. DATA SYNTHESIS Recently, an expert panel of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended use of only three of 16 systemic antibiotics approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of AOM: amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and ceftriaxone. Controversy exists over the importance of key selection factors used by the expert panel in determining which antibiotics to recommend in a two-step treatment algorithm, that is, in vitro data, pharmacodynamic profiles, and necessity for coverage of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae at all steps of empiric treatment. Additional antibiotic and patient selection factors useful for individualizing therapy include clinical efficacy, adverse effects, frequency and duration of administration, taste, cost, comorbid infections, and ramifications should bacterial resistance develop to the chosen antibiotic. Presumed or past patient/caregiver adherence (especially when antibiotic failure has occurred) is also paramount in selecting antibiotic therapy. A three-step treatment algorithm for refractory AOM that employs amoxicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (depending on the prior dose of and adherence to amoxicillin therapy), and ceftriaxone or tympanocentesis at steps 1, 2, and 3, respectively, appears rational and cost-effective. The recent upsurge in antimicrobial resistance is highlighted, and recommendations are presented for the treatment of AOM and prevention of recurrent otitis media (rAOM). CONCLUSIONS Amoxicillin remains the antibiotic of choice for initial empiric treatment of AOM, although the traditional dosage should be increased in patients at risk for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae. In cases refractory to high-dose amoxicillin, TMP/SMX should be prescribed if adherence to prior therapy seemed good or complete, or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate if adherence was incomplete or questionable. Ceftriaxone should be reserved as third-line treatment. The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae emphasizes the importance of alternative medical approaches for the prevention of OM, as well as judicious antibiotic use in established cases. Removal of modifiable risk factors should be first-line therapy for prevention of rAOM. We support the use of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine per guidelines for prevention of rAOM from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with consideration given to influenza vaccine for cases of rAOM that historically worsen during the flu season. Sulfisoxazole prophylaxis should be reserved for children who are immunocompromised, have concurrent disease states exacerbated by AOM, or meet the criteria of rAOM despite conjugate pneumococcal and influenza vaccination. Therapy should be intermittent, beginning at the first sign of an upper respiratory infection, and should continue for 10 days. The invasive nature and risks of anesthesia relegate myringotomy, tympanostomy tubes, and adenoidectomy to last-line therapies for rAOM.","output":"treatment and prevention of otitis media."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This article analyzed gender differences in professional advancement following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic based on data from open-source software developers in 37 countries. Background: Men and women may have been affected differently from the social distancing measures implemented to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. Given that men and women tend to work in different jobs and that they have been unequally involved in childcare duties, school and workplace closings may have impacted men's and women's professional lives unequally. Method: We analyzed original data from the world's largest social coding community, GitHub. We first estimated a Holt-Winters forecast model to compare the predicted and the observed average weekly productivity of a random sample of male and female developers (N=177,480) during the first lockdown period in 2020. To explain the crosscountry variation in the gendered effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on software developers' productivity, we estimated two-way fixed effects models with different lockdown measures as predictors - school and workplace closures, in particular. Results: In most countries, both male and female developers were, on average, more productive than predicted, and productivity increased for both genders with increasing lockdown stringency. When examining the effects of the most relevant types of lockdown measures separately, we found that stay-at-home restrictions increased both men's and women's productivity and that workplace closures also increased the number of weekly contributions on average - but for women, only when schools were open. Conclusion: Having found gender differences in the effect of workplace closures contingent on school and daycare closures within a population that is relatively young and unlikely to have children (software developers), we conclude that the Covid-19 pandemic may indeed have contributed to increased gender inequalities in professional advancement.","output":"Has Covid-19 increased gender inequalities in professional advancement?

METHODS The survey was disseminated via email to all NZ psychiatrists registered with the Royal Australia and NZ College of Psychiatry and promoted by snowballing methods to reach non-members. RESULTS There were similar (moderate) levels of understanding of the Act, compared to other health professionals. Psychiatrists show similar levels of support for assisted dying as other health professionals (55% and 47%, respectively), however psychiatrists are significantly less likely to be willing to provide assisted dying services than other health professionals. Concerns were raised regarding the challenges faced by psychiatrists and need for more clarity around the psychiatrist's role. CONCLUSIONS Few NZ psychiatrists were willing to be involved with the Act. There was a perceived lack of information around a psychiatrist's role, responsibilities and legal protections.

With so much uncertainty about the future of travel, the transportation sector needs to move rapidly to shape the nature of public transit and shared mobility services during the COVID-19 recovery period. Consequently, the University of California Institute of Transportation Studies (UC ITS) and the Transportation Research Boards (TRB) Executive Committee launched a scenario planning exercise from June to September 2020 involving 36 transportation experts. The exercise resulted in a series of policy options and research directions across three timeframes (i.e., within 12 months, one to three years, four to six years) that could guide the recovery of the public transit and shared mobility industries. This report offers several key takeaways. First, external forces beyond COVID-19 (e.g., economy, political will, etc.) will significantly drive the future of public transit and shared mobility and determine the effectiveness and feasibility of any policy strategies. Second, while public transit and shared mobility face a dire future in the short run, steps can be taken immediately to reduce the effects of the current crisis, while also laying the groundwork for more sustainable transportation in the future beyond COVID-19. Actions taken to only address the current crisis will not prepare public transit and shared mobility for the future. Finally, future policies and actions will not be effective without in-depth analysis and development. Research and lessons learned from demonstration and pilot projects will be critical for crafting policies, identifying all positive and negative outcomes, and shaping actions toward a future transportation system that is more resilient, socially equitable, and environmentally friendly.","output":"Future of Public Transit and Shared Mobility: Scenario Planning for COVID-19 Recovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Although the laparoscopic approach for perforated appendicitis is commonly performed, there is some controversy over its use because of postoperative complications. These may be associated with various types of disease entities, from gangrenous change to diffuse peritonitis with abscess formation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety and benefits of the laparoscopic approach for perforated appendicitis, including cases complicated by abscess, compared to open. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 1747 patients underwent treatment for appendicitis over a period of 3 years. The diagnosis of perforated appendicitis was made by radiology, operative finding, and pathology. Of our five attending surgeons, three performed open surgery for perforated appendicitis, while two performed laparoscopy. RESULTS There were 474 patients (27%) with perforated appendicitis without abscess (156 underwent laparoscopy, 318 underwent open) and 113 patients (6.4%) with perforated appendicitis and abscess (44 underwent laparoscopy, 69 underwent open). The duration for resumption of diet and hospital stay was shorter in the laparoscopy group than in the open group. There were no significant differences in postoperative complications between patients who had no abscess with laparoscopy and those with open: 5 intra-abdominal abscesses and 10 wound infections versus 11 intra-abdominal abscesses and 25 wound infections (P = 0.88, 0.12), and between patients who had abscesses with laparoscopy and those with open: 4 intra-abdominal abscesses and 3 wound infections versus 6 intra-abdominal abscesses and 6 wound infections (P = 0.94, 0.72).

Telemedicine is a key component of ACP pathways. AIMS: Telephone consultations for new referrals (as part of a pilot ACP pathway for chronic pain) were trialled to try (a) improve efficiency of outpatient clinics, (b) expedite assessment/treatment, and (c) reduce the number of face-to-face attendances. An audit of this activity was undertaken. METHODS: The 100 longest waiting new referrals were identified. Over a 9-month period patients were contacted via telephone, undergoing an initial assessment. Treatment plans were initiated and outcomes ( 1) were documented. RESULTS: Average length of time on waiting list was 35.37 months. 40% patients were discharged with advice back to referrer, 8% were referred for diagnostics/imaging, 32% were offered pharmacological management, 30% were scheduled for interventional management, 9% were referred for further MDT assessment/treatment, 4% were referred directly for a pain management programme (PMP), 6% were referred for assessment by other specialist services, 9% were brought in for face-to-face consultation in our pain management OPD, 2% were uncontactable, and 1% had died before assessment could be made. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine as part of ACP represents an opportunity to improve speed of access to care, reducing the number of patients and time spent on waiting lists.

Our laboratory demonstrated the presence of circulating exosomes with lung self-antigens (Collagen-V and K- Tubulin) and donor HLA in lung transplant recipients (LTxRs) undergoing rejection. Since respiratory viral infections (RVI) is a risk factor for development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) post lung transplant, we postulated that RVI can lead to induction of exosomes with self-antigens containing viral DNA/RNA capable of activating innate immune signaling via cGAS/STING and RIG1 pathways, a mechanism leading to immune activation resulting in CLAD. Methods: Exosomes were isolated using ultracentrifugation. Size (50-200nm) was determined using nanosight. DNA and RNA were isolated using kits and quantified on the Nanodrop. Libraries were generated using Kapa Biosystem's library kit. The raw Illumina 2x150bp pair-end reads were checked on FastQC and were aligned to the human and viral genome build from CHIPseeker Database. Validation was done using antibodies and primers for respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus. To determine the role of exosomes to induce cell signaling and endoplasmic stress (ER), airway epithelial cells (KCC266), and Hep2 cells were incubated with exosomes from LTxRs with RVI or stable. Results: Viral nucleic acid sequences were noted in higher levels in exosomes from LTxRs with RVI in comparison to stable. Comparison with human genome identified the presence of DNA sequences specific to defensins, GTPase, apoptotic cleavage, and NMDA receptor in RVI LTxRs. Further, we identified upregulation of proteins associated with cGAS/STING and RIG1 (MAVS, MDA5, IFN) and ER stress (PERK, ATF4 and BiP) in KCC266 and Hep2 cells incubated with exosomes from LTxRs with RVI, but not stable. In contrast, exosomes from stable LTxRs had 91 sequences for MAP kinase and cell death signaling pathways. Conclusion: We conclude that LTxRs diagnosed with RVI leads to induction of circulating exosomes having unique viral nucleic acid sequences capable of inducing signaling and ER stress. This can lead to activate innate immune signaling via cGAS/STING and RIG1 pathways resulting in immune responses to viral and donor antigens resulting in CLAD.","output":"Circulating Exosomes from Human Lung Transplant Recipients Having Respiratory Viral Infections Contain Nucleic Acids and Activate Signaling Pathways CGAS/STING and RIG-1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organisation (WHO) announced the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) it as a pandemic on March 11th, 2020 The pandemic has brought havoc global","output":"The ASEANa?s Responses to COVID-19: A Policy Sciences Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This rapid expert consultation responds to a request from the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) concerning the implementation of crisis standards of care (CSC) in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

The nonstructural B19 protein NS1 acts as a transactivator triggering signaling cascades that eventually lead to activation of interleukin 6 (IL-6). We examined the impact of NS1 on modulation of STAT signaling in human endothelial cells (HMEC-1). The NS1 sequences were identified from B19 DNA isolated from the myocardia of patients with fatal iCMP. B19 infection as well as NS1 overexpression in HMEC-1 cells produced a significant upregulation in the phosphorylation of both tyrosine(705) and serine(727) STAT3 (P < 0.05). The increased STAT3 phosphorylation was accompanied by dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding of pSTAT3. In contrast, NS1 expression did not result in increased STAT1 activation. Notably, the expression levels of the negative regulators of STAT activation, SOCS1 and SOCS3, were not altered by NS1. However, the level of PIAS3 was upregulated in NS1-expressing HMEC-1 cells. Analysis of the transcriptional activation of target genes revealed that NS1-induced STAT3 signaling was associated with upregulation of genes involved in immune response (e.g., the IFNAR1 and IL-2 genes) and downregulation of genes associated with viral defense (e.g., the OAS1 and TYK2 genes). Our results demonstrate that B19 NS1 modulates the STAT/PIAS pathway. The NS1-induced upregulation of STAT3/PIAS3 in the absence of STAT1 phosphorylation and the lack of SOCS1/SOCS3 activation may contribute to the mechanisms by which B19 evades the immune response and establishes persistent infection in human endothelial cells. Thus, NS1 may play a critical role in the mechanism of viral pathogenesis in B19-associated iCMP.","output":"Human parvovirus B19 NS1 protein modulates inflammatory signaling by activation of STAT3/PIAS3 in human endothelial cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 10 April 2020, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights adopted a detailed resolution providing guidance for States concerning the respect of human rights during the unprecedented global health emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic Resolution 1/2020 sets standards and recommendations for the American States to adhere to when adopting measures to address this health emergency within their jurisdictions The present commentary offers a reflection upon some of the most important aspects of such resolution ? 2021 Australian Journal of Human Rights","output":"Protecting human rights in the Americas amid a pandemic: a reflection on resolution 1/2020 of the Inter-American Commission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the daily activities performed by children from 6 to 12 years of age incomplete and analyze children's behavior during social distancing in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic METHODS: Cross-sectional study with children in a learning stage living in Brazil The data were collected via online form Fisher's exact test was applied to analyze the association of categorical variables with child behavior;when significant, it was used the odds ratio It was considered results considered statistically significant those presenting values of p &lt; 0 05 RESULTS: Data from 530 children were analyzed: 50 3% female, 71 3% from the Southeast Region, 73% in fulltime social distancing, 52% presented anxiety, which was significantly associated with changes in sleep and appetite CONCLUSION: The results indicate the need for parents/caretakers to stimulate moments for the child to express themselves, not minimizing their feelings and providing emotional support to mitigate the negative impact of these feelings on the child's mental and physical health","output":"Child behavior during the social distancing in the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Macaques are a commonly used model for studying immunity to human viruses, including for studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. However, it is unknown whether macaque antibody responses resemble the response in humans. To answer this question, we employed a phage-based deep mutational scanning approach (Phage-DMS) to compare which linear epitopes are targeted on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in convalescent humans, convalescent (re-infected) rhesus macaques, mRNA-vaccinated humans, and repRNA-vaccinated pigtail macaques. We also used Phage-DMS to determine antibody escape pathways within each epitope, enabling a granular comparison of antibody binding specificities at the locus level. Overall, we identified some common epitope targets in both macaques and humans, including in the fusion peptide (FP) and stem helix-heptad repeat 2 (SH-H) regions. Differences between groups included a response to epitopes in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) in vaccinated humans but not vaccinated macaques, as well as recognition of a CTD epitope and epitopes flanking the FP in convalescent macaques but not convalescent humans. There was also considerable variability in the escape pathways among individuals within each group. Sera from convalescent macaques showed the least variability in escape overall and converged on a common response with vaccinated humans in the SH-H epitope region, suggesting highly similar antibodies were elicited. Collectively, these findings suggest that the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in macaques shares many features with humans, but with substantial differences in the recognition of certain epitopes and considerable individual variability in antibody escape profiles, suggesting a diverse repertoire of antibodies that can respond to major epitopes in both humans and macaques. Differences in macaque species and exposure type may also contribute to these findings.","output":"Detailed analysis of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and infection in macaques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Typhoid toxin is secreted by the typhoid fever-causing bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and has tropism for immune cells and brain endothelial cells.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to close contacts in different settings. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Close contacts of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Guangzhou, China. PARTICIPANTS: 3410 close contacts of 391 index cases were traced between 13 January and 6 March 2020. Data on the setting of the exposure, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing, and clinical characteristics of index and secondary cases were collected. Measurement: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases were confirmed by guidelines issued by China. Secondary attack rates in different settings were calculated. RESULTS: Among 3410 close contacts, 127 (3.7% [95% CI, 3.1% to 4.4%]) were secondarily infected. Of these 127 persons, 8 (6.3% [CI, 2.1% to 10.5%]) were asymptomatic. Of the 119 symptomatic cases, 20 (16.8%) were defined as mild, 87 (73.1%) as moderate, and 12 (10.1%) as severe or critical. Compared with the household setting (10.3%), the secondary attack rate was lower for exposures in healthcare settings (1.0%; odds ratio [OR], 0.09 [CI, 0.04 to 0.20]) and on public transportation (0.1%; OR, 0.01 [CI, 0.00 to 0.08]). The secondary attack rate increased with the severity of index cases, from 0.3% (CI, 0.0 to 1.0%) for asymptomatic to 3.3% (CI, 1.8% to 4.8%) for mild, 5.6% (CI, 4.4% to 6.8%) for moderate, and 6.2% (CI, 3.2% to 9.1%) for severe or critical cases. Index cases with expectoration were associated with higher risk for secondary infection (13.6% vs. 3.0% for index cases without expectoration; OR, 4.81 [CI, 3.35 to 6.93]).

Such semi-quantitative scoring system, namely Brixia score, is applied in serial monitoring of such patients, showing significant prognostic value, in one of the hospitals that experienced one of the highest pandemic peaks in Italy. To solve such a challenging visual task, we adopt a weakly supervised learning strategy structured to handle different tasks (segmentation, spatial alignment, and score estimation) trained with a \\"from-the-part-to-the-whole\\" procedure involving different datasets. In particular, we exploit a clinical dataset of almost 5,000 CXR annotated images collected in the same hospital. Our BS-Net demonstrates self-attentive behavior and a high degree of accuracy in all processing stages. Through inter-rater agreement tests and a gold standard comparison, we show that our solution outperforms single human annotators in rating accuracy and consistency, thus supporting the possibility of using this tool in contexts of computer-assisted monitoring. Highly resolved (super-pixel level) explainability maps are also generated, with an original technique, to visually help the understanding of the network activity on the lung areas. We also consider other scores proposed in literature and provide a comparison with a recently proposed non-specific approach. We eventually test the performance robustness of our model on an assorted public COVID-19 dataset, for which we also provide Brixia score annotations, observing good direct generalization and fine-tuning capabilities that highlight the portability of BS-Net in other clinical settings.

As a kind of data that can represent urban spatial form, night-time light data has been widely used in the extraction of urban built-up areas. As one of the geographic open-source big data, point of interest (POI) data has a high spatial coupling with night-time light data, so researchers are beginning to explore the fusion of the two data in order to achieve more accurate extraction of urban built-up areas. However, the current research methods and theoretical applications of the fusion of POI data and night-time light data are still insufficient compared with the dramatically changing urban built-up areas, which needed to be further supplemented and deepened. This study proposes a new method to fuse POI data and night-time light data. The results before and after data fusion are compared, and the accuracy of urban built-up area extracted by different data and methods is analysed.

Major crop yields are projected to decrease in low-latitude regions due to anthropogenic climate change, making tropical and sub-tropical food systems particularly vulnerable to climate shocks. Increased cultivation of breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis), often categorized as a neglected and underutilized species (NUS), has been suggested as an agricultural adaptation pathway for food insecure tropical and subtropical regions, due to its potential to enhance climate resilience and overall sustainability of low-latitude agricultural systems. To better understand breadfruits cultivation suitability and geographic range in current and future climates, we employ a diverse set of observations and models to delineate the current climatically viable breadfruit range and assess the climatically viable breadfruit range in the future (2061-2080) under stabilization and high emission scenarios. We find that the area of suitable breadfruit range within the tropics and subtropics is projected to decrease ~4.4% in the stabilization scenario and ~4.5% in the high emission scenario. In Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, yield quality and consistency show minimal decreases under the high emission scenario, with increases in total suitable area under both scenarios. In contrast, in Latin America and the Caribbean, the current range of breadfruit suitability is projected to contract ~10.1-11.5% (stabilization-high emission). Present and future model suitability outputs suggest that opportunities to successfully expand breadfruit cultivation over the next several decades exist in sub-Saharan Africa, where food insecurity is coincidentally high. However, in all regions, high emission scenario conditions reduce the overall consistency and quality of breadfruit yields compared to the stabilization scenario.

Both methods are promising tools to unravel the underlying pathophysiology of glomerular diseases. This review provides an overview of the technical challenges that should be addressed when designing single-cell transcriptomics experiments that focus on glomerulopathies. The isolation of glomerular cells from core needle biopsies for single-cell transcriptomics remains difficult and depends upon five major factors. First, core needle biopsies generate little tissue material and several samples are required to identify glomerular cells. Second, both fresh and frozen tissue samples may yield glomerular cells, although every experimental pipeline has different (dis)advantages. Third, enrichment for glomerular cells in human tissue prior to single-cell analysis is challenging as no effective standardized pipelines are available. Fourth, the current warm cell dissociation protocols may damage glomerular cells and induce transcriptional artefacts, which can be minimized by using cold dissociation techniques at a cost of less efficient cell dissociation. Finally, snRNA-seq methods may be superior to scRNA-seq in isolating glomerular cells, although its efficacy on core needle biopsies remains to be proven. The field of single-cell omics is rapidly evolving and the integration of these techniques in multi-omics assays will undoubtedly create new insights in the complex pathophysiology of glomerular diseases.","output":"Current Methodological Challenges of Single-Cell and Single-Nucleus RNA-Sequencing in Glomerular Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"South Korea's reluctant response to the U S Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) strategy so far has failed to send a clear-cut signal to regional countries Despite upholding multilateralism as the cornerstone of its middle power diplomacy, South Korea has not worked in line with Indo-Pacific second-size powers given Seoul's relatively vague response to the Indo-Pacific structure With foreign policy shifts from Trump to Biden, South Korea may be well-positioned to communicate its policies with a more nuanced response to the Indo-Pacific To leverage Seoul's middle power standing and its commitment to multilateralism, the Moon Jae-in administration can be expected to reflect on clearer definitions of what 'Indo-Pacific' means and come up with a more comprehensive understanding of multilateral cooperation in the region so as not to mistake 'Indo-Pacific' for its security connotation As for South Korea, pursuing a three-headed strategy, for example, continuing to position itself in the Indo-Pacific region as a balancer, enhancing ties with like-minded middle powers, and deepening the South Korea-ASEAN relationship, could accommodate Seoul's interests and concerns amid the U S CChina strategic competition and the COVID-19 pandemic [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Pacific Review is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Bolstering middle power standing: South Korea's response to U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy from Trump to Biden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Structuring patient and practice data into episodes formed the foundation of the earliest evidence base of family medicine. We aim to make patients' narratives part of the evidence base for family medicine by incorporating coded and structured information on the patient's reason to visit the family physician (FP) and adding the patient's personal and contextual characteristics to routine registration data. This documentation allows studies of relations between morbidity and elements of the patient story, providing more insight into the range of problems presented to primary care and in the patient-centeredness applied by FPs. METHODS The Dutch Practice-Based Research Network (PBRN), named FaMe-Net, is the world's oldest PBRN. Seven Dutch family practices provide regular primary care and participate in the PBRN. It contains all morbidity data of the approximately 40,000 listed patients (308,000 patient-years and 2.2 million encounters from 2005 until 2019). All information belonging to 1 health problem is ordered in 1 episode. Morbidity (diagnoses), reasons for encounter (RFE), and interventions are coded according to the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC-2). Registration occurs within the electronic health record (EHR), specially designed to facilitate the extensive registration for the PBRN. Since 2016, the network expanded routine registration with the duration of symptoms and coded personal and contextual characteristics (eg, country of birth, level of education, family history, traumatic events) obtained through the self-reported 'context survey' of listed patients. These data are added to the EHR. Registered data are extracted from the EHR and processed for scientific research.We present data on the differences in RFEs of the most prominent symptoms of COVID-19 between 2019 and 2020; the relation between the diagnosis of pneumonia and presentation of the symptom 'cough,' and how personal determinants influence the chances of final diagnoses. Lastly, we show the relation of self-reported abuse with patient's contact frequency and psychosocial problems. RESULTS Prompt introduction of registration rules brought insight into COVID-19-related symptoms early in the pandemic. In March 2020, symptoms related to COVID-19 were presented more often than in March 2019. Chronic conditions and prevention showed a collapsing contact frequency. Telephone, email, and video consultations increased from 31% to 53%.Episodes of pneumonia most frequently started with the RFE 'cough.' A combination of 'cough' and 'fever' as RFE increases the likelihood of pneumonia, as does cough in the presence of comorbid COPD among older men. The prevalence of pneumonia is higher among patients with low socioeconomic status. DISCUSSION The Dutch PBRN FaMe-Net has started to add elements of patients' narratives and context to decades of morbidity registration, creating options for a scientific approach to primary care's core values. Assumptions of 'pre/post chances' of the final diagnosis, already existing implicitly in FPs minds, can be elaborated and quantified by investigating the associations between multiple registered variables, including parts of patients' 'stories.' This way, we aim to make visible what is intuitively already known by FPs.","output":"Purposeful Incorporation of Patient Narratives in the Medical Record in the Netherlands."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How to effectively prevent the diffusion of infectious disease has become an intriguing topic in the field of public hygienics. To be noted that, for the non-periodic infectious diseases, many people hope to obtain the vaccine of epidemics in time to be inoculated, rather than at the end of the epidemic. However, the vaccine may fail as a result of invalid storage, transportation and usage, and then vaccinated individuals may become re-susceptible and be infected again during the outbreak. To this end, we build a new framework that considers the imperfect vaccination during the one cycle of infectious disease within the spatially structured and heterogeneous population. Meanwhile, we propose a new vaccination update rule: myopic update rule, which is only based on one focal players own perception regarding the disease outbreak, and one susceptible individual makes a decision to adopt the vaccine just by comparing the perceived payoffs vaccination with the perceived ones of being infected. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations are performed to demonstrate the imperfect vaccination behavior under the myopic update rule in the spatially structured and heterogeneous population. The results indicate that healthy individuals are often willing to inoculate the vaccine under the myopic update rule, which can stop the infectious disease from being spread, in particular, it is found that the vaccine efficacy influences the fraction of vaccinated individuals much more than the relative cost of vaccination on the regular lattice, Meanwhile, vaccine efficacy is more sensitive on the heterogeneous scale-free network. Current results are helpful to further analyze and model the choice of vaccination strategy during the disease outbreaks.","output":"Role of vaccine efficacy in the vaccination behavior under myopic update rule on complex networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considered to have immunostimulating activity, echinacea is a widely used phytomedicinal for treatment of the common cold and upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs).

MethodsWe studied an age/sex-stratified random 10% sample of the Swedish population on 1 Jan 2020, followed for AESI outcomes during 1 year, as the COVID-19 pandemic emerged and developed, before the start of vaccinations. We selected and defined the following outcomes based on information from regulatory authorities, large-scale adverse events initiatives and previous studies: aseptic meningitis, febrile seizure, Kawasaki syndrome, MISC, post-infectious arthritis, arthritis, myocarditis, ARDS, myocardial infarction, stroke, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, kidney failure, liver failure, erythema multiforme, disseminated intravascular coagulation, autoimmune thyroiditis, and appendicitis. We calculated incidence rates stratified by age, sex and time period (quarters of 2020), and classified them using Council of International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) categories: very common, common, uncommon, rare, or very rare. ResultsWe included 972,723 study subjects, representing the Swedish national population on 1 Jan 2020. We found that AESI incidence rates vary greatly by age and in some cases sex. Several common AESIs showed expected increase with age, while some (e.g. appendicitis, aseptic meningitis, autoimmune thyroiditis, Kawasaki syndrome and MISC) were more common in young people, and others exhibited a flatter age pattern (e.g. myocarditis, DIC and erythema multiforme). Consequently, the CIOMS classification for AESIs varied widely according to age. Considerable variability was suggested for some AESI rates across the 4 quarters of 2020, potentially related to pandemic waves, seasonal variation, healthcare system overload or other healthcare delivery effects.

The aim of this project is to capture the effect of COVID-19 on the volume of surgery and adaptations to the surgical care of patients at a breast centre in BC. METHODS: All proven or suspected breast cancer cases treated with surgery between March 16, 2019 and April 30, 2019 and March 16, 2020 and April 30, 2020 through the Providence Breast Centre were included in this review. The date ranges in 2020 mark the early COVID-19 pandemic period in BC and the large shift in operating room access during this time. RESULTS: In 2019, 99 patients underwent surgery for proven breast cancer and 30 patients for suspected breast cancer. In 2020, 162 patients underwent surgery for breast cancer and 34 for suspected breast cancer. Wait times from core biopsy to surgery and surgery to oncology consultation were improved in 2020 with a reduction of core biopsy to surgery time from 58 to 28 days for patients seen during the pandemic.

METHODS: As part of a European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) taskforce, a systematic literature search was conducted from January 2019 to 11 December 2020. Two reviewers independently identified eligible studies according to the Population, Intervention, Comparator and Outcome framework and extracted data on efficacy and safety of immunomodulatory agents used therapeutically in SARS-CoV-2 infection at any stage. The risk of bias was assessed with validated tools. RESULTS: Of the 60 372 records, 401 articles were eligible for inclusion. Studies were at variable risk of bias. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were available for the following drugs: hydroxychloroquine (n=12), glucocorticoids (n=6), tocilizumab (n=4), convalescent plasma (n=4), interferon beta (n=2), intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) (n=2) and n=1 each for anakinra, baricitinib, colchicine, leflunomide, ruxolitinib, interferon kappa and vilobelimab. Glucocorticoids were able to reduce mortality in specific subsets of patients, while conflicting data were available about tocilizumab. Hydroxychloroquine was not beneficial at any disease stage, one RCT with anakinra was negative, one RCT with baricitinib+remdesivir was positive, and individual trials on some other compounds provided interesting, although preliminary, results. CONCLUSION: Although there is emerging evidence about immunomodulatory therapies for the management of COVID-19, conclusive data are scarce with some conflicting data. Since glucocorticoids seem to improve survival in some subsets of patients, RCTs comparing glucocorticoids alone versus glucocorticoids plus anticytokine/immunomodulatory treatment are warranted.

In the present systematic review, we aimed to investigate the recent studies of MO in CMD and its possible mechanism of action. We systematically searched from three databases and summarized the data. This review includes a total of 108 papers in nonclinical studies and clinical trials of MO in cardiometabolic-related disorders. Moringa oleifera, extracts or isolated compound, exerts its effect on CMD through its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory actions resulting in the modulation in glucose and lipid metabolism and the preservation of target organ damage. Several studies supported the beneficial effect of MO in regulating the gut microbiome, which generates the diversity of gut microbiota and reduces the number of harmful bacteria in the caecum. Molecular actions that have been studied include the suppression of NF-kB translocation, upregulation of the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway, stimulation of total antioxidant capacity by reducing PKC activation, and inhibiting the Nox4 protein expression and several other proposed mechanisms.

Methods In an outbreak study (cohort 1), we performed FMS and NPS for 21 consecutive days after diagnosis on six healthcare workers who were screened positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a second hospitalised cohort (cohort 2), we performed FMS on 47 patients within 24 hours of a positive diagnosis. COVID-19 severity was graded according to WHO recommendations. Findings In cohort 1, SARS-COV-2 was detected by FMS in 10/40 (25%) samples (4/6 individuals), with no correlation between NPS and FMS RNA signals. All samples were negative by day 14 post diagnosis. Sustained FMS positivity with higher viral RNA signals showed a trend towards disease severity. In cohort 2, 19/47 (40%) individuals exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA extending over five orders of magnitude. FMS positive participants were older (positive: median age [IQR] 71 [61-84] vs negative: 61 [45-73], p=0.04) with more comorbidities (positive: 2 [1-3] vs negative: 1 [0-2], p<0.001) and have active cough (positive: 68% vs negative: 24%, p=0.003) and breathlessness (positive: 74% vs negative: 32%, p=0.005) during sampling, compared to FMS negative patients.

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was the etiologic agent of this disease, and responsible of the current pandemic of COVID-19. Accumulated evidence on placental features is based most on case-reports and small case-series, with differing results. METHODS: We gathered a cohort of 29 infected pregnant mothers who delivered 32 newborns, and had placentas available for pathologic examination. Placentas were compared with a control group. RESULTS: Of the 29 mothers, clinical and radiological features were similar to what was already described in COVID-19. Pregnancy modified some analytical parameters. One of the mothers succumbed to the disease. Of the 32 newborns, 1 developed an early infection, with positive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at 48 h of life, with an initial RT-PCR negative. SARS-CoV-2 presence was assessed on placental tissue with immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, both were negative. All newborns had good clinical outcomes. No differences in morphological placental findings were found among both groups. CONCLUSION: Lack of statistically significant differences among case and control groups suggest that placentas from SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers represent a cohort of normal placentas only submitted because of maternal SARS-CoV-2 status.

By July 2021, the incidence was 19,9 million cases and 556.000 deaths. Recent studies suggest that patients with MPN have higher infection and death rates than the general population. Older age and comorbidities are risk factors for severe COVID-19 in CML and MPN. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and clinical evolution of COVID-19 in a cohort of CML and MPN Brazilian patients. Methods This is a prospective, observational, ongoing study. All patients signed informed consent and answered two structured questionnaires within a six months interval. The questionnaire included questions about patient's behavior during pandemic, symptoms, contacts, COVID-19 infection, and vaccination data in the last six months. In addition, demographic data, CML and NMP treatment, comorbidities, laboratory tests, COVID severity, and outcome were collected from the medical records. Results From September 2020 to July 2021, 370 patients answered the first questionnaire, and 153 answered the second: 225 with CML and 145 with MPN (45% essential thrombocythemia, 27.6%, polycythemia vera, 23% myelofibrosis, and 4.8% not classified). In the CML population, the median age was 56 (19-90). Most were receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors (88,5%) and 26 (11,5%) no treatment, in treatment-free remission (TFR). 80% of the patients were practicing social distancing, and 30% had at least one family member or close contact diagnosed with COVID-19. Comorbidities: hypertension (35%), diabetes (14%), pulmonary disease (6%), cardiac disease (16%), renal disease (7%), other (18%). A total of 28/225 (12.4%) patients had confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis (by serology or PCR), while 10 were suspect. The median age was 47 years, 68% were male, and 41% were not respecting social distancing. Thirty-five percent had comorbidities: 25% hypertension; 68% had a history of close contact with an infected person. One patient was in the accelerated phase, and 27 were in the chronic phase; 4 had a complete cytogenetic response, 13 major molecular response (MMR), 3 MR4.0, and 7 MR4.5. COVID-19 was mild/moderate in 27 and in severe in one case, resulting in death. This patient was a male, 71-year-old, with hypertension, in MMR with nilotinib. At COVID-19 onset, 16 pts were receiving imatinib, five dasatinib; five nilotinib e 2 were in TFR. There was one reinfection, in a 54 years old male patient, with no comorbidities. To date, 84 (37%) patients (pts) have received vaccines against COVID-19: 32 CORONAVAC (Sinovac/Butantan), 51 ChAdOx1nCov-19-Covishield (Astrazeneca/Oxford), and one BNT162 (Pfizer). All COVID-19 cases occurred before vaccination. Among the 145 MPN pts, the median age was 67 years (29-90), and 86% had comorbidities (52% hypertension, 17.5% diabetes, and 13% cardiac diseases). Social distancing was 83%. Nine out of 145 (6.2%) had confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, and 3% suspect. The median age of these pts was 43 years (28-80). Seven patients had ET and 2 PV. Seven were female. Four pts received Hydroxyurea (HU) and aspirin, four aspirin, one HU, and one no treatment. There were seven mild and two moderate cases requiring hospitalization, none requiring oxygen or mechanical ventilation, none with thrombosis. Two COVID cases occurred after the first dose of vaccines (CORONAVAC and Covishield). In the whole MPN group, 11% have received two doses (57% CORONAVAC, 40% Covishield, and 3.6% BNT 162). Conclusions COVID-19 cases occurred more frequently in younger patients. COVID-19 incidence was higher in the CML than in the MPN population, probably because MPN patients were less exposed, and the older pts were the first to receive vaccines. The impact of the vaccination on the prevention of new cases will be evaluated during the follow-up. Disclosures Bortolini: Novartis: Speakers Bureau.

We examined the efficacy of administration of highly neutralizing COVID-19 convalescent plasma (hn-plasmas) and such plasma-derived IgG administration using the Syrian hamster COVID-19 model. Two hn-plasmas, which were in the best 1% of 340 neutralizing activity-determined convalescent plasmas, were intraperitoneally administered to SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, resulting in a significant reduction of viral titers in lungs by up to 32-fold compared to the viral titers in hamsters receiving control nonneutralizing plasma, while with two moderately neutralizing plasmas (mn-plasmas) administered, viral titer reduction was by up to 6-fold. IgG fractions purified from the two hn-plasmas also reduced viral titers in lungs more than those from the two mn-plasmas. The severity of lung lesions seen in hamsters receiving hn-plasmas was minimal to moderate as assessed using microcomputerized tomography, which histological examination confirmed. Western blotting revealed that all four COVID-19 convalescent plasmas variably contained antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 components, including the receptor-binding domain and S1 domain. The present data strongly suggest that administering potent neutralizing activity-confirmed COVID-19 convalescent plasmas would be efficacious in treating patients with COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Convalescent plasmas obtained from patients who recovered from a specific infection have been used as agents to treat other patients infected with the very pathogen. To treat using convalescent plasmas, despite that more than 10 randomized controlled clinical trials have been conducted and more than 100 studies are currently ongoing, the effects of convalescent plasma against COVID-19 remained uncertain. On the other hand, certain COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to reduce the clinical COVID-19 onset by 94 to 95%, for which the elicited SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies are apparently directly responsible. Here, we demonstrate that highly neutralizing effect-confirmed convalescent plasmas significantly reduce the viral titers in the lung of SARS-CoV-2-infected Syrian hamsters and block the development of virally induced lung lesions. The present data provide a proof of concept that the presence of highly neutralizing antibody in COVID-19 convalescent plasmas is directly responsible for the reduction of viral replication and support the use of highly neutralizing antibody-containing plasmas in COVID-19 therapy with convalescent plasmas.","output":"Highly Neutralizing COVID-19 Convalescent Plasmas Potently Block SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Pneumonia in Syrian Hamsters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies conducted on mithuns at the National Research Centre on Mithun, and mithuns found in free-ranging conditions in Nagaland, India, revealed that the overall prevalence of antibodies to coronavirus was 80% (95% confidence interval [CI] 77-83) when detected by a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Hitherto, no polymorphisms of this gene have been described. The aim of this study was to reveal variation of the ICOSL gene in normal individuals. All eight exons, except exon 1, were sequenced with flanking introns in 10 healthy blood donors. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and two length polymorphisms were found. One of the SNPs was found in the coding regions of the gene. The base involved was located in exon 3 and caused a conservative amino acid change from valine (GTT) to isoleucine (ATT).

METHODS Patients with lesions >4 cm and <18 cm were enrolled in this nonrandomized, prospective, multicenter trial that evaluated the Protg EverFlex Self-Expanding Peripheral Stent System (Covidien, Plymouth, Minn). The study's primary end points were the 30-day major adverse event rate and duplex ultrasound-assessed patency at 1 year. These were compared with published performance goals. A preplanned analysis was conducted for the primary effectiveness end points at 1 year. Follow-up, including history, ankle-brachial index, patient-reported outcomes, duplex ultrasound assessment, and radiographs, is planned through 3 years. There was core laboratory review of angiograms, ultrasound scans, and plain radiographs. A subgroup of patients was studied with graded treadmill testing. RESULTS The study enrolled 287 patients (66% male; mean age, 68 years) with stenotic, restenotic, or occluded lesions of the SFA at 44 investigational sites in the United States and Europe. Systemic comorbidities included hypertension (88%), hyperlipidemia (86%), diabetes (43%), and prior SFA intervention (41%). The mean lesion length measured by the core laboratory was 89 mm. The mean normal-to-normal lesion length measured by sites was 110 mm. A total of 303 stents were implanted, and 95% of patients received a single stent. No major adverse events occurred at 30 days. At 1 year, primary outcome of duplex ultrasound stent patency was 67.7% in evaluable patients, and among 1-year secondary outcomes, the mean ankle-brachial index increased by 0.25. Walking Improvement Questionnaire scores improved in pain by 33.7, distance by 37.1, speed by 18.6, and stair climbing by 24.7.

In total, 254 patients were transferred with ongoing CPR, including automated chest compression, of which 30 showed or developed ROSC after admission. Following hospital admission predefined in- and exclusion criteria for eCPR were checked; in the remaining 224, 126 were considered as eligible for eCPR. State of the art postresuscitation therapy was applied and prognostication of neurological outcome was performed according to a standardized protocol. Eighteen patients survived, with a good neurological outcome (cerebral performance category (CPC) 1 or 2) in 15 patients. Compared to non-survivors survivors had significantly shorter time between collaps and start of eCPR (58 min (IQR 12C85) vs. 90 min (IQR 74C114), p = 0.01), lower lactate levels on admission (95 mg/dL (IQR 44C130) vs. 143 mg/dL (IQR 111C178), p < 0.05), and less severe acidosis on admission (pH 7.2 (IQR 7.15C7.4) vs. 7.0 (IQR6.9C7.2), p < 0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis identified latency to eCPR and low pH as independent predictors for mortality. CONCLUSION: An eCPR program can be life-saving for a subset of individuals with refractory circulatory arrest, with time to initiation of eCPR being a main determinant of survival.","output":"Establishment of an extracorporeal cardio-pulmonary resuscitation program in Berlin C outcomes of 254 patients with refractory circulatory arrest"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Continued waves, new variants, and limited vaccine deployment mean that SARS-CoV-2 tests remain vital to constrain the COVID-19 pandemic. Affordable, point-of-care (PoC) tests allow rapid screening in non-medical settings. Reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is an appealing approach. A crucial step is to optimize testing in low/medium resource settings. Here, we optimized RT-LAMP for SARS-CoV-2 and human {beta} actin, and tested clinical samples in multiple countries. TTTT linker primers did not improve performance, and while guanidine hydrochloride, betaine and/or Igepal-CA-630 enhanced detection of synthetic RNA, only the latter two improved direct assays on nasopharygeal samples. With extracted clinical RNA, a 20 min RT-LAMP assay was essentially as sensitive as RT-PCR. With raw Canadian nasopharygeal samples, sensitivity was 100% (95% CI: 67.6% - 100%) for those with RT-qPCR Ct values [] 25, and 80% (95% CI: 58.4% - 91.9%) for those with 25 > Ct [] 27.2. Highly infectious, high titer cases were also detected in Colombian and Ecuadorian labs. We further demonstrate the utility of replacing thermocyclers with a portable PoC device (FluoroPLUM). These combined PoC molecular and hardware tools may help to limit community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Multicenter international assessment of a SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP test for point of care clinical application"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and its need for social distancing as a response have the potential to increase the experience of loneliness in the population, with an associated increase in symptoms of mental disorders As the world has largely adapted to remote platforms for employment, socializing, and health service delivery, the degree to which virtual opportunities for social engagement may offset the impact of limited in-person interactions on mental health functioning is unknown This column offers preliminary data from an ongoing experience sampling study of the prevalence, course, and impact of loneliness on mental health in a community adult sample living under social distancing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic Initial findings aggregated across all experience sampling reports showed negative associations between virtual social contact (via text, phone, or videoconferencing) and feelings of loneliness, while in-person interactions appeared to have no impact on loneliness In addition, respondents reported frequent instances of negative effects on physical and mental health, including disruptions in sleep and recurring suicidal ideation While further analyses are needed, these findings are consistent with similar emerging reports showing increased rates of mental health concerns during periods of social distancing Possible avenues for addressing these concerns using remote interventions are explored (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"COVID-19: Preliminary data on the impact of social distancing on loneliness and mental health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, the authors present the utilization of laboratory-based Learning at the University of Parma and its integration with DigiLab4U (Open Digital Laboratory for You). At the University of Parma, the course of AUTO-ID in production and logistics from the very beginning has exploited the lab-based learning to convey practical skills gained in RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) Laboratory to the students through a hands-on laboratory. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent measures taken by the Italian government, the very same method could not be used anymore during the spring semester of the year 2020. To solve the issue a batch experiment method has been adopted, where the parameters were set by students and the experiment was carried out by a researcher. During the experiments, the researchers gather raw data and send it back to the students. Having these data, the students were able to perform the data analysis. To give the students the possibility to better understand the environment of the laboratory, pictures, and videos of the experiment performance have been supplied too. To complete the batch experiment, a tutorial has also been provided with the details of the software set up and the components used. The total remotization of RFID Laboratory is scheduled for late 2021. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Batch Experiment: A Fruitful Way of Combining Hands-On Laboratory and E-Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we examine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on global economic activity, the stock market, and the energy sector considering the sizable damaging impacts in these crucial aspects. Our results, based on the structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model for the data from 21 January 2020, to 26 February 2021, indicate that the COVID-19 cases significantly and negatively impact all the endogenous variables such as Baltic dry index (BDI), MSCI world index (MSCI), and MSCI world energy index (MSCIE). Our results also reveal that of the three variables, the stock markets indices (MSCI and MSCIE) are comparatively more affected by COVID-19 cases. The findings imply that the stock markets are more sensitive to the COVID-19 pandemic than the real economy. The results further indicate that of the three variables, the MSCIE index is the most affected by COVID-19 due to two factors: one is the dwindling power consumption caused by COVID-19 and the other is the decline in oil price because of the RussiaCOPEC price war. Our findings enhance the understanding of the spillover impacts of the global health crisis on economic activity, the stock market, and the energy sector. Moreover, our study offers insights for policymakers and governments into the relationship dynamics of COVID-19 that would help them be more cautious in taking preventive measures against the health crisis to save the economy, the stock market, and the energy sector from falling into a more deepened crisis.","output":"Spillovers of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Impact on Global Economic Activity, the Stock Market, and the Energy Sector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human aromatase is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, involved in steroid hormones biosynthesis. In particular, it converts androgen into estrogens being therefore responsible for the correct sex steroids balance. Due to its capacity in producing estrogens it has also been considered as a promising target for breast cancer therapy. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (R264C and R264H) have been shown to alter aromatase activity and they have been associated to an increased or decreased risk for estrogen-dependent pathologies. Here, the effect of these mutations on the protein dynamics is investigated by UV/FTIR and time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. H/D exchange rates were measured by FTIR for the three proteins in the ligand-free, substrate- and inhibitor-bound forms and the data indicate that the wild-type enzyme undergoes a conformational change leading to a more compact tertiary structure upon substrate or inhibitor binding. Indeed, the H/D exchange rates are decreased when a ligand is present. In the variants, the exchange rates in the ligand-free and Cbound forms are similar, indicating that a structural change is lacking, despite the single amino acid substitution is located in the peripheral shell of the protein molecule. Moreover, the fluorescence lifetimes data show that the quenching effect on tryptophan-224 observed upon ligand binding in the wild-type, is absent in both variants. Since this residue is located in the catalytic pocket, these findings suggest that substrate entrance and/or retention in the active site is partially compromised in both mutants. A contact network analysis demonstrates that the protein structure is organized in two main clusters, whose connectivity is altered by ligand binding, especially in correspondence of helix-G, where the amino acid substitutions occur. Our findings demonstrate that SNPs resulting in mutations on aromatase surface modify the protein flexibility that is required for substrate binding and catalysis. The cluster analysis provides a rationale for such effect, suggesting helix G as a possible target for aromatase inhibition.","output":"Polymorphism on human aromatase affects protein dynamics and substrate binding: spectroscopic evidence"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:O}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(D,[["render",P]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"doctor/50.md","filePath":"doctor/50.md"}'),V={name:"doctor/50.md"},z=Object.assign(V,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(R)]))}});export{E as __pageData,z as default};
