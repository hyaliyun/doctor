Until now, their analysis has mainly focused on next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, this technique is expensive and requires sophisticated equipment, long processing times, and highly qualified technical personnel with experience in bioinformatics. To contribute to the analysis of variants of interest and variants of concern, increase the diagnostic capacity, and process samples to carry out genomic surveillance, we propose a quick and easy methodology to apply, based on Sanger sequencing of three gene fragments that code for protein Spike. Methods: Fifteen positive samples for SARS-CoV-2 with Ct<25 were sequenced by Sanger and NGS methodologies. The data obtained were analyzed on the Nextstrain and PANGO Lineages platforms. Results: Both methodologies allowed the identification of the variants of interest reported by the WHO. Two samples were identified as Alpha, three Gamma, one Delta, three Mu, one Omicron, and five strains were close to the initial Wuhan-Hu-1 virus isolate. According to in silico analysis, key mutations can also be detected to identify and classify other variants not evaluated in the study. Conclusion: The different SARS-CoV-2 lineages of interest and concern are classified quickly, agilely, and reliably with the Sanger sequencing methodology.","output":"Validacin de una nueva estrategia para la identificacin de variantes de SARS-CoV-2 mediante secuenciacin del gen Espiga por Sanger"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To examine variation in employment and economic outcomes before, during, and after the great recession by disability and mental health status. Methods: Using a sample of adults in the 1999 to 2016 National Health Interview Survey (N = 419,336), we examined changes in labor force and economic outcomes by mental health and physical disability status. We employed difference-in-differences analyses to determine whether the changes in these outcomes during and after the recession for each comparison group (those with moderate mental illness, serious psychiatric disability, or physical disability) were significantly different from the changes for persons with neither a mental illness nor a disability. Findings: While the recession impacted all groups, those with mental illnesses or physical disabilities were hardest hit. Persons with disabilities were disadvantaged on all outcomes at each period, but persons with mental illnesses were the most disadvantaged. Unemployment, poverty, and use of food stamps increased for all groups, but the increase was greatest for persons with mental health problems who also saw a more substantial decline in wage income. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: The effects of the recession persist well after the recovery period. Practitioners should be aware that although most persons with mental illnesses want to work, they face significant barriers to employment. Following economic shocks such as those brought on by the current coronavirus pandemic, interventions should focus on people who are the most vulnerable, especially those with mental health problems. Renewed focus on employment for people with mental disorders is important.

The protein microarray was used to test Newcastle disease virus (NDV), infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), AIV positive and negative sera. The results indicated that the protein microarray could hybridize specifically with antibodies against AIV with strong signals and without cross-hybridization. Moreover, 76 field serum samples were detected by microarray, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and hemagglutination inhibition test (HI). The positive rate was 92.1% (70/76), 93.4% (71/76) and 89.4% (68/76) by protein microarray, ELISA and HI test, respectively. Compared with ELISA, the microarray showed 100% (20/20) agreement ratio in chicken and 98.2% (55/56) in ornamental bird.

Current practices surrounding post-operative care involve admission and routine esophagogram prior to discharge. This study aims to establish the safety and feasibility of same-day discharge following POEM. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data for patients who underwent POEM between November 2013 and June 2019 at a single institution in Ontario, Canada. Patients were discharged home on the same day with controlled pain, when tolerating clear fluids. Patients were admitted if clinically indicated. Esophagography was initially a systematic practice prior to discharge, but later only performed when clinically indicated. Emergency department visits and hospital admissions within 90 days were assessed. RESULTS: In total, 90 patients underwent a successful POEM procedure. A total of 72 patients (79.1%) were discharged on the same day, 14 patients (15.4%) were discharged home the following day, and 5 patients (5.5%) experienced longer admissions to hospital. One POEM was unsuccessful. 22 (24.2%) patients had adverse events, leading to 8 (8.8%) unplanned admissions, with one patient requiring prolonged admission for esophageal leak, identified clinically. Fifty-three patients underwent routine esophagography while part of our protocol, with no identified leak, which prompted our change in practice to only perform esophagography when clinically indicated. In the 90-day post-procedure, ten patients visited the emergency department, of which seven were re-admitted, five for POEM-related issues. Our mean Eckhardt score at 2 weeks was 2.1 from 7.2 preoperatively. CONCLUSION: This study establishes that same-day discharge is both safe and feasible following POEM and suggests that esophagography should be performed only when clinically indicated. This represents a shift from the routine practice of admission and imaging for patients undergoing POEM, encouraging the transition to outpatient POEM procedures.","output":"Same-day discharge is safe and feasible following POEM surgery for esophageal motility disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: When exposed to evaluative situations, up to 40% of students develop test anxiety, reflected, namely, by extensive worry, intrusive thoughts, and physiological arousal. Though the negative influence of test anxiety on later school performance is well documented, the role of students' initial achievement in the development of later test anxiety is less clear. AIMS AND SAMPLE: To better capture the nature of the relations between prior mathematics and language arts achievement and later test anxiety across genders, this study examined linear and curvilinear relationships among 1,569 French-speaking Canadian students followed across the transition to secondary school, a critical period for test anxiety. METHODS: Students completed a questionnaire at the beginning and the end of the first year of secondary school, and schools provided us with students grades at the end of 6th grade and the fall of 7th grade. RESULTS: Multilevel regression analyses showed that only mathematics achievement at the end of elementary school predicted test anxiety at the beginning of secondary school. In secondary school, beginning-of-year achievement in both mathematics and language arts predicted test anxiety at the end of this same year, but different patterns were observed for boys and girls. CONCLUSIONS: Because nonlinear relations were observed at each timepoint, low achievers may not be the only group of students who are at greater risk of developing high levels of test anxiety. Therefore, interventions targeting students with different achievement profiles might help to reduce test anxiety and facilitate the transition to secondary school.","output":"Relations between prior school performance and later test anxiety during the transition to secondary school"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A global pandemic due to COVID-19 emerged in November 2019 and hit France in early March 2020.

Various physical distancing interventions were introduced to flatten the epidemic curve and reduce the disease burden. We evaluated the impacts of policy stringency and residents compliance on time-varying reproduction number in 17 countries. METHODS: Data were from WHO reports of local transmission (February 28 to April 8, 2020) in Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, the UK, US and Vietnam. Earlier local transmission data where available from press releases were added for Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan starting January 28, 2020. COVID-19 policy responses were from the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker with 17 indicators. Changes in peoples behaviors were from Googles COVID-19 community mobility reports and Apple Maps mobility trends reports. We estimated the daily time-varying reproduction number (Rt) by country. 0-, 7- and 14-day lagged effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions and changes in human mobility on Rt were estimated by linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Rt initially surged rapidly, then declined gradually depending on policy stringency. The highest mean policy stringency scores were for Italy (69.97) and South Korea (61.00). Variations in stringency scores were higher in Europe, the US and Australia than in Asia. The human mobility reduction was greater in countries with strict policies (median stringency score > = 50). In terms of immediate (0-day lag) effects, Rt reductions were found for workplace-closure, limited-gathering, and stay-at-home policies. At a 7-day lag, Rt reductions were found for workplace closure, restrictions on gatherings, stay-at-home requirements, international travel controls, contact tracing and reducing walking around. At a 14-day lag, Rt reductions were found for restrictions on gatherings, less visiting and staying in parks, and reduced walking around.

Many gregarious tropical species are shifting poleward under current ocean warming, creating novel species and social interactions with local temperate taxa. However, how the dynamics of these novel shoals might be altered by future ocean warming and acidification remains untested. Here we evaluate how novel species interactions, ocean acidification and warming affect shoaling dynamics, motor lateralization and boldness of range-extending tropical and co-shoaling temperate fishes under controlled laboratory conditions. Fishes were exposed to 1 of 12 treatments (combinations of three temperature levels, two pCO2 levels and two shoal type levels: mixed species or temperate only) for 38 days. Lateralization (a measure of asymmetric expression of cognitive function in group coordination and predator escape) of tropical and temperate species was right-side biased under present-day conditions, but side bias significantly diminished in tropical and temperate fishes under ocean acidification. Ocean acidification also decreased shoal cohesion irrespective of shoaling type, with mixed-species shoals showing significantly lower cohesion than temperate-only shoals irrespective of climate stressors. Tropical fish became bolder under ocean acidification (after 4 weeks), and temperate fish became bolder with increasing temperature, while ocean acidification dampened temperate fish boldness. Our findings highlight the direct effect of climate stressors on fish behaviour and the interplay with the indirect effects of novel species interactions. Because strong shoal cohesion and lateralization are key determinants of species fitness, their degradation under ocean warming and acidification could adversely affect species performance in novel assemblages in a future ocean, and might slow down tropical species range extensions.","output":"Ocean warming and acidification degrade shoaling performance and lateralization of novel tropical-temperate fish shoals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A J-shaped relationship of body mass index (BMI) with severe periodontitis has been reported.

Anthropometric indexes included BMI, waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR). The severity of localized periodontitis was defined as healthy (n = 42), Stage I (initial) (n = 228), and Stage II/III (moderate/severe) (n = 55) according to the 2017 Periodontal Diseases Classification. Smooth curve fitting and multiple logistic regression analyses adjusting for age, sex, betel nut consumption, and smoking were used to determine the threshold effect between various anthropometric and the risk of localized Stage II/III periodontitis. RESULTS: In the spline smoothing plot, the turning points for BMI, WC, and WHtR were 26.1 kg/m2 , 90.0 cm, and 0.50, respectively, and a J-shaped relationship was found for BMI (the likelihood ratio test, P <0.001). In the multiple logistic regressions, BMI &#8805;27.0 kg/m2 , WC &#8805;90.0 cm and WHtR &#8805;0.50 were associated with higher risk of localized Stage II/III periodontitis than their counterparts (24.0 to 26.9 kg/m2 for BMI) (odds ratios [OR] and 95% confidence intervals: 4.16 [1.39 to 12.49], 2.65 [1.01 to 7.11], and 2.95 [1.20 to 7.24], respectively; all P values <0.05).

This has resulted in an increase in the relative proportion of vivax malaria and is an important obstacle in the achievement of global malaria elimination by 2030. The main objective of this study was to explore the current policies guiding the treatment plans on vivax malaria, and the factors affecting the implementation of radical cure in South/South East Asian and Asian Pacific countries. METHODS: This was a qualitative study among respondents who represented national malaria control programmes (NMCPs) or had a role and influence in the national malaria policies. 33 respondents from 17 countries in South/South East Asia and Asia Pacific participated in interviews between October 15 and December 15, 2020. Semi-structured interviews were conducted virtually except for two face to face interviews and audio-recorded. Transcribed audio-records underwent thematic analysis using QSR NVivo. RESULTS: Policies against vivax malaria were underprioritized, compared with the focus on falciparum malaria and, in particular, drug resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains. Despite the familiarity with primaquine (PQ) as the essential treatment to achieve the radical cure, the respondents contested the need for G6PD testing. Optional G6PD testing was reported to have poor adherence. The fear of adverse events led health workers to hesitate prescribing PQ. In countries where G6PD was mandatory, respondents experienced frequent stockouts of G6PD rapid diagnostic kits in peripheral health facilities, which was compounded by a short shelf life of these tests. These challenges were echoed across participating countries to various degrees. Most respondents agreed that a shorter treatment regimen, such as single dose tafenoquine could resolve these problems but mandatory G6PD testing will be needed. The recommendation of shorter regimens including tafenoquine or high dose PQ requires operational evidence demonstrating the robust performance of point of care G6PD tests (biosensors). CONCLUSION: There was sparse implementation and low adherence to the radical cure in South/South East Asian and Asian pacific countries. Shorter treatment regimens with appropriate point of care quantitative G6PD tests may resolve the current challenges. Operational evidence on point of care quantitative G6PD tests that includes the feasibility of integrating such tests into the radical cure regimen are critical to ensure its implementation.

OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study is to confirm the effect of patellofemoral contact mechanics after craniolateral and caudolateral transposition of tibial tuberosity in normal canine hindlimbs. METHODS Craniolateral and caudolateral transposition of tibial tuberosity was performed in 5 specimens, respectively. The pressure was measured in the specimen before TTT, and then in the same specimen after TTT. In this process, data was obtained in 10 specimens. The measurement results were output as visualization data through the manufacturer's software and numerical data through spreadsheet. Based on these 2 data and the anatomical structure of the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) surface, whole measurement area was analysed by dividing into medial, lateral and central area. RESULTS In craniolateralization of tibial tuberosity, total, medial, central contact pressure was decreased and lateral contact pressure was not statistically changed lateral contact pressure than normal PFJ. In caudolateralization of tibial tuberosity, total, lateral contact pressure was increased and medial contact pressure was not statistically changed than normal PFJ. Although not statistically significant changed, central contact pressure in caudolateralization of tibial tuberosity was increased in all 5 specimens.

COVID-19 patients showed a distinct metabolic serum profile, including changes typical for severe dyslipidemia and a deeply altered metabolic status compared to healthy controls. Specifically, VLDL parameters, IDL particles, large-sized LDL particles, and the ApoB100/ApoA1 ratio were significantly increased, whereas HDL fractions were decreased. Moreover, a similarly perturbed profile was apparent, even when compared to other ICU patients suffering from cardiogenic shock, highlighting the impact of COVID-19 especially on lipid metabolism and energy status. COVID-19 patients were separated with an AUROC of 1.0 when compared to both healthy controls and cardiogenic shock patients. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive individuals without acute COVID-19 did not show a significantly perturbed metabolic profile compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls, but SARS-CoV-2 antibody-titers correlated significantly with metabolic parameters, including levels of glycine, ApoA2, and small-sized LDL and HDL subfractions.

Engineered sensitivity to protease activity is particularly desirable because proteases are critical biomarkers in cancer, infectious disease, inflammatory disorders, and so forth. Herein, we developed and characterized a set of peptide-linked cyanine conjugates for dual-modal detection of protease activity via photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence imaging. The peptide-dye conjugates were designed to undergo contact quenching via intramolecular dimerization and contained n dyes (n = 2, 3, or 4) with n - 1 cleavable peptide substrates. The absorption peaks of the conjugates were blue-shifted 50 nm relative to the free dye and had quenched fluorescence. This effect was sensitive to solvent polarity and could be reversed by solvent switching from water to dimethyl sulfoxide. Employing trypsin as a model protease, we observed a 2.5-fold recovery of the peak absorbance, 330-4600-fold fluorescent enhancement, and picomolar detection limits following proteolysis. The dimer probe was further characterized for PA activation. Proteolysis released single dye-peptide fragments that produced a 5-fold PA enhancement through the increased absorption at 680 nm with nanomolar sensitivity to trypsin. The peptide substrate could also be tuned for protease selectivity; as a proof-of-concept, we detected the main protease (Mpro) associated with the viral replication in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Last, the activated probe was imaged subcutaneously in mice and signal was linearly correlated to the cleaved probe.

The crop originated in the Andes, and while a great diversity of potato persists, some landraces have been lost. Local communities and the genebank of the International Potato Center (CIP) partnered to re-establish some of these landraces in situ by supplying clean seed potatoes to farmers. Over time, the genebank formalized a repatriation program of potato landraces. Repatriation is the process of returning native germplasm back to its place of origin, allowing a dynamic exchange between ex situ and in situ conditions. So far, no comprehensive description of CIPs repatriation program, the changes it induced, nor its benefits, has been carried out. METHODS: We addressed this research gap by analyzing CIP genebank distribution data for repatriated accessions, conducting structured interviews with experts of the repatriation program, and applying duration and benefit analyses to a survey dataset of 301 households. RESULTS: Between 1997 and 2020, 14,950 samples, representing 1519 accessions, were distributed to 135 communities in Peru. While most households (56%) abandoned the repatriated material by the fourth year after receiving it, the in situ survival probability of the remaining material stabilized between 36% in year 5 and 18% in year 15. Households where the plot manager was over 60 years old were more likely to grow the repatriated landraces for longer periods of times. While male plot management decreased survival times compared to female plot management, higher levels of education, labor force, wealth, food insecurity, and geographic location in the southern part of Peru were associated with greater survival times. Most farmers reported nutritional and cultural benefits as reasons for maintaining landrace material.

However, its use for pandemic preparedness in obstetrics is lacking. Management of obstetrical patients with suspected COVID-19 infection is a complex task with safety considerations for mother, fetus and healthcare workers. Implementation of new workflow algorithms to ensure safety is critical but is challenging to implement in real-time. We sought to improve pandemic preparedness by designing and deploying a high-fidelity simulation exercise involving the admission of a labouring obstetrical patient with suspected COVID-19 into a labour room, urgent transfer to the operating room and neonatal resuscitation. The creation of the simulation scenario was a multi-disciplinary effort with input from a focus group of key clinical stakeholders from within and outside of our centre to ensure clinical validity. Simulations were performed on the clinical unit during regular work hours so workflow could be observed in real-time with access to the equipment and personnel in which this clinical scenario would occur. We completed a total of 11 simulation sessions involving 42 participants. Feedback, obtained from debrief sessions and anonymous surveys, was categorized based on the human factors framework, and used as part of an iterative process to adapt, revise and improve the simulation scenario.

Our hypothesis was that multiple pandemic-related factors led to a care environment with increased mental and spiritual stress for patients and their families, leading to an increased need for adjunct services such as chaplaincy. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a single-institution retrospective chart review study that evaluated the records of 10,698 patients admitted between July 1, 2019, and January 31, 2020, or between July 1, 2020, and January 31, 2021. Our primary study outcomes included the number of chaplain consultations, the number of visits per consultation, and the time of visits between the two study cohorts. Secondary outcomes included inpatient mortality and the number of end-of-life visits. We also isolated a subgroup of patients admitted with COVID-19 and compared their outcomes with the two larger cohorts. Statistical analysis included t-test or chi-squared test, based on the variable. This study was reviewed and approved by the Brooke Army Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB ID C.2021.010e). RESULTS Fewer consults were performed during the study period affected by the SARS-COV2 pandemic (4814 vs. 5884, P-value <.01). There were fewer individual visits per consult during the study period affected by the SARS-COV2 pandemic (1.44 vs. 1.64, P-value <.01), which led to fewer overall time spent per consult (37.41 vs. 41.19 minutes, P-value <.01). The 2020 cohort (without COVID-19 cases) demonstrated a higher mortality rate than the 2019 cohort (2.8% vs. 1.9%, P-value <.01). The COVID-19 diagnosis cohort demonstrated a much higher mortality rate compared to other patients in the 2020 cohort (19.3% vs. 2.8%, P-value <.01). We demonstrated the relative need for EOL consults by presenting the ratio of EOL consults to inpatient deaths. This ratio was highest for the COVID-19 diagnosis cohort (0.76) compared to the 2020 cohort (0.50) and the 2019 cohort (0.60). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that factors related to the SARS-COV2 pandemic resulted in fewer chaplaincy consults in our inpatient setting. We did not find other reports of a change in the rate of chaplaincy consultation, but available reports suggest that many centers have had difficulty balancing the spiritual needs of patients with local exposure guidelines. Although fewer individual chaplain consults occurred during the SARS-COV2 pandemic, our chaplain service innovated by utilizing various phone, video, and web-based platforms to deliver spiritual support to our community. Our study also suggests that the patients most greatly affected by the pandemic have an increased need for spiritual support, especially at the end of life. Future studies in this subject should examine the effect of various types of chaplain services as they relate to the health and well-being of hospitalized patients.","output":"A Review of Brooke Army Medical Center Chaplaincy Service During the SARS-COV2 Pandemic: Implications for Service Structure and Patient Needs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Along with positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs, viral RNA was detectable at high concentration for >3 weeks in fecal samples from 12 mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic children with COVID-19 in Seoul, South Korea.

It has been widely used at all levels and fields of education ranging from elementary school to graduate and postgraduate studies. The aim of this study is to evaluate this teaching method compared to classical face-to-face teaching by referring to the learner's point of view. METHODS It was a prospective and descriptive cross-sectional study targeting residents in medical imaging (all levels approximately 200 people) It was based on an online questionnaire sent to all residents after attending synchronous online teaching sessions at the College of Medical Imaging and Nuclear Medicine. The assessment was done by the learners using a 5 points Likert scale. RESULTS Ninety-seven residents answered the questionnaire. Sixty percent of our learners were satisfied with this new way of teaching. 73% of the students found the logistical means suitable for this course. The main advantages noted by our residents were accessibility to sessions from any location and the ability to replay lessons later. The weaknesses put forward were the lack of interaction with the teacher compared to face-to-face teaching and the occurrence of technical problems which could sometimes hamper the smooth running of the sessions. CONCLUSION Our study allowed us to get feedback from our learners on this teaching.

Because of its ease of application and good psychometric properties, the K10 has been adapted to several cultures. The present study seeks to adapt the K10 to Brazilian Portuguese and estimate its validity evidence and reliability. METHODS: A total of 1914 individuals from the general population participated in the study (age = 34.88, SD = 13.61, 77.7% female). The adjustment indices were compared among three different measurement models proposed for the K10 through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The items properties were analyzed by Andrichs Rating Scale Model (RSM). Furthermore, evidence based on relations to other variables (depression, stress, anxiety, positive and negative affects, and satisfaction with life) was estimated. RESULTS: CFA indicated the adequacy of the bifactor model (CFI= 0.985; TLI= 0.973; SMR= 0.019; RMSEA= 0.050), composed of two specific factors (depression and anxiety) and one general factor (psychological distress), corresponding to the theoretical hypothesis. Additionally, it was observed multiple-group invariance by gender and age range. The RSM provided an understanding of the organization of the continuum represented by the psychological distress construct (items difficulty), which varied from ?0.89 to 1.00; good adjustment indexes; infit between 0.67 and 1.32; outfit between 0.68 and 1.34; and desirable reliability, = 0.87.

As indicated in the recent article posted on the US FDA website, the group testing approach for COVID-19 has received a lot of interest lately. There are two key elements in a group testing technique: (i) the pooling matrix that directs samples to be pooled into groups, and (ii) the decoding algorithm that uses the group test results to reconstruct the status of each sample. In this paper, we propose a new family of pooling matrices from packing the pencil of lines (PPoL) in a finite projective plane. We compare their performance with various pooling matrices proposed in the literature, including 2D-pooling, P-BEST, and Tapestry, using the two-stage definite defectives () decoding algorithm. By conducting extensive simulations for a range of prevalence rates up to 5%, our numerical results show that there is no pooling matrix with the lowest relative cost in the whole range of the prevalence rates. To optimize the performance, one should choose the right pooling matrix, depending on the prevalence rate. The family of PPoL matrices can dynamically adjust their column weights according to the prevalence rates and could be a better alternative than using a fixed pooling matrix.","output":"Constructions and Comparisons of Pooling Matrices for Pooled Testing of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic creates uncertainty in various aspects of peoples lives especially when they enter adulthood with more complex roles and responsibilities.

Furthermore, the R0 and CFR of the studies were quantified based on geographic location, the tests/thousand population, and the median population age of the countries where studies were conducted. The I2 statistic and the Cochran's Q test were applied to assess statistical heterogeneity among the selected studies. Forty-five studies involving R0 and thirty-four studies involving CFR were included. The pooled estimation of the R0 was 2.69 (95% CI: 2.40, 2.98), and that of the CFR was 2.67 (2.25, 3.13).

Owing to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care, the practice of NOT has generally increased by necessity and may, in a postCCOVID-19 world, change surgeons perceptions of NOT. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of NOT has increased in South Asia and whether these levels of practice would be sustained after the pandemic subsides. METHODS: A survey was conducted among pediatric surgeons regarding their position, institute, and country; the number of appendicitis cases they managed; and their mode of treatment between identical time periods in 2019 and 2020 (April 1 to August 31). The survey also directly posed the question as to whether they would continue with the COVID-19Cimposed level of NOT after the effect of the pandemic diminishes. RESULTS: A total of 134 responses were collected out of 200 (67.0%). A significant increase in the practice of NOT was observed for the entire cohort, although no effect was observed when grouped by country or institute. When grouped by position, senior physicians increased the practice of NOT the most, while junior physicians reported the least change. The data suggest that only professors would be inclined to maintain the COVID-19Clevel of NOT practice after the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Increased practice of NOT during the COVID-19 pandemic was observed in South Asia, particularly by senior surgeons. Only professors appeared inclined to consider maintaining this increased level of practice in the postCCOVID-19 world.","output":"Management of Acute Appendicitis in Children During COVID-19 and Perspectives of Pediatric Surgeons From South Asia: Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of an ongoing pandemic, with increasing deaths worldwide. To date, documentation of the histopathological features in fatal cases of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has been scarce due to sparse autopsy performance and incomplete organ sampling. We aimed to provide a clinicopathological report of severe COVID-19 cases by documenting histopathological changes and evidence of SARS-CoV-2 tissue tropism. METHODS: In this case series, patients with a positive antemortem or post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 result were considered eligible for enrolment. Post-mortem examinations were done on 14 people who died with COVID-19 at the King County Medical Examiner's Office (Seattle, WA, USA) and Snohomish County Medical Examiner's Office (Everett, WA, USA) in negative-pressure isolation suites during February and March, 2020. Clinical and laboratory data were reviewed. Tissue examination was done by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and quantitative RT-PCR. FINDINGS: The median age of our cohort was 735 years (range 42-84; IQR 675-7725). All patients had clinically significant comorbidities, the most common being hypertension, chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, and metabolic disease including diabetes and obesity. The major pulmonary finding was diffuse alveolar damage in the acute or organising phases, with five patients showing focal pulmonary microthrombi. Coronavirus-like particles were detected in the respiratory system, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract. Lymphocytic myocarditis was observed in one patient with viral RNA detected in the tissue. INTERPRETATION: The primary pathology observed in our cohort was diffuse alveolar damage, with virus located in the pneumocytes and tracheal epithelium. Microthrombi, where observed, were scarce and endotheliitis was not identified. Although other non-pulmonary organs showed susceptibility to infection, their contribution to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection requires further examination.

To determine whether cellular proteins are involved in this process, we performed UV cross-linking experiments using cytoplasmic extracts of uninfected cells and the IG (promoter) sequence between genes 6 and 7 (IG7) and the 5' untranslational region of mouse hepatitis virus genomic RNA. We demonstrated that three different cellular proteins (p70, p48, and p35/38) bound to the promoter sequence of the template RNA. Deletion analyses of the template RNA mapped the binding site of p35/38 at the consensus transcription initiation signal. In contrast, the binding of p70 and p48 was less specific. p35/38 is the same protein as the one previously identified to bind to the complementary strand of the leader RNA; its binding affinity to the leader was approximately 15 times stronger than that to IG7. Site-directed mutagenesis of the IG sequence revealed that mutations in the consensus sequence of IG7 (UCUAAUCUAAAC to UCGAAAC and GCUAAAG), which resulted in reduced subgenomic mRNA transcription, also caused correspondingly reduced levels of p35/38 binding. These results demonstrated that the extent of protein binding to the IG sequences correlated with the amounts of subgenomic mRNAs transcribed from the IG site. These studies suggest that these RNA-binding proteins are involved in coronavirus RNA transcription and may represent transcription factors.","output":"Interactions between the cytoplasmic proteins and the intergenic (promoter) sequence of mouse hepatitis virus RNA: correlation with the amounts of subgenomic mRNA transcribed."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It seems paradoxical that facts, data and science are still considered controversial despite the harrowing death of a multitude of people from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an unparalleled health care crisis of our lifetime.

The tissue tropism is determined by spike (S) protein, although the molecular bases for enteric tropism remain to be fully characterized. Both pAPN and sialic acid binding domains (aa 506C655 and 145C155, respectively) are necessary but not sufficient for enteric tract infection. Using a TGEV infectious cDNA and enteric (TGEV-SC11) or respiratory (TGEV-SPTV) isolates, encoding a full-length S protein, a set of chimeric recombinant viruses, with a sequential modification in S protein amino terminus, was engineered. In vivo tropism, either enteric, respiratory or both, was studied by inoculating three-day-old piglets and analyzing viral titers in lung and gut. The data indicated that U655>G change in S gene (S219A in S protein) was required to confer enteric tropism to a respiratory virus that already contains the pAPN and sialic acid binding domains in its S protein.

A paucity of data on PPE burn rate (PPE consumption over time) in pandemic situations exacerbated these issues as there was little historic research to indicate volumes of PPE required to care for surges in infective patients and thus plan procurement requirements. METHODS: To better understand PPE requirements for care of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in our Australian quaternary referral hospital, the number of staff-to-patient interactions in a 24-hour period for three patient groups (ward-based COVID suspect, ward-based COVID confirmed, intensive care COVID confirmed) was audited prospectively from 1(st) to 30(th) April 2020. RESULTS: The average number of staff-to-patient interactions in a 24-hour period was: 13.1  5.0 (mean  SD) for stable ward-managed COVID-19 suspect patients; 11.9  3.8 for stable ward-managed confirmed COVID-19 patients; and 30.0  5.3 for stable, mechanically ventilated, ICU-managed COVID-19 patients.

However, the rate and the reasons why physicians intend to leave have not been extensively studied yet. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the risk factors of turnover intention among physicians in emergency department. METHODS: A national cross-sectional survey was conducted from July to August 2018 in China. A total of 10 457 physicians in emergency department were investigated using a structured self-administered questionnaire, which included demographic characteristics, work-related factors, turnover intention, the Patient Health Questionnaire and Positive and Negative Affect Scale. The stepwise logistic regression analysis was applied to identify the risk factors of turnover intention among physicians. RESULTS: A total of 55.18% of the physicians in emergency department reported turnover intention in China. Turnover intention were more likely to be reported among physicians who were male (odds ratio (OR) = 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13-1.38); who perceived medical errors (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.23-1.47); who had a lower average monthly income; who provided out-of-hospital resuscitation services; who experienced physical violence (OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.26-1.54) and who reported higher score on negative affect and depressive tendency (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.05-1.08; OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.09-1.12).

However, the relationship between early introduction of fluids other than breast milk and BF outcomes has not been systematically assessed using only prospective studies that can establish temporality, which is critical for determining whether observed associations are causal. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies to assess if there is a difference in BF outcomes as a result of the introduction of: (a) milk-based prelacteals, (b) water-based prelacteals and (c) breast milk substitutes (BMS) between 4 days and 4 weeks postpartum. We searched PubMed, Lilacs, Web of Science and other repositories for original research investigating the relationship between early introduction of prelacteals and/or BMS and BF outcomes. Forty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Of the 39 prelacteal feeding studies, 27 had the prerequisite statistical information for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Findings from the meta-analysis showed a relationship between prelacteals and exclusive BF cessation (RR 1.44; 1.29-1.60) and any BF cessation (2.23; 1.63-3.06) among infants under 6 months old. Nine studies focusing on the introduction of BMS during the neonatal period identified this practice as a statistically significant risk factor for a shorter BF duration.

METHODS We surveyed international sites with pediatric stroke expertise to determine numbers of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients <18 years, numbers of incident AIS cases among children (29 days to <18 years), frequency of SARS-CoV-2 testing for children with AIS, and numbers of childhood AIS cases positive for SARS-CoV-2 June 1 to December 31, 2020. Two stroke neurologists with 1 neuroradiologist determined whether SARS-CoV-2 was the main stroke risk factor, contributory, or incidental. RESULTS Sixty-one centers from 21 countries provided AIS data. Forty-eight centers (78.7%) provided SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization data. SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed in 335/373 acute AIS cases (89.8%) compared with 99/166 (59.6%) in March to May 2020, P<0.0001.

There is a lack of data in Pakistan of the demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcome of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly those with severe illness, which we aim to assess. Methods: This is a single-centered, observational study conducted at the COVID unit of the Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Institute of Trauma in Karachi, Pakistan. A manual medical record review of patients admitted from April 24, 2020 to August 24, 2020 was conducted, and all patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) with moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 pneumonia were included. Results: Of 299 patients, the median age was 60 years (50-65). Males accounted for 221 (73.9%). Most common symptoms were shortness of breath seen in 270 (90.3%) and fever in 225 (75.3%) patients. Diabetes mellitus (51.2%) and hypertension (50.3%) were the predominant co-morbidities. COVID disease was categorized on admission as moderate in 68 (22.7%), severe in 151 (50.5%), and critical in 80 (26.8%) patients. Survival analysis was done in 252 patients, all of whom received steroids, while tocilizumab was administered to 111 (44%) patients. Hundred (39.7%) patients received non-invasive ventilation (NIV), while 57 (22.6%) were placed on mechanical ventilation. Overall, 95 (37.7%) patients died. Factors associated with mortality included older age with those above 60 years more likely to die (odds ratio [OR]: 1.925; 95% CI: 1.148-3.228; pvalue: 0.009), presence of co-morbidities (OR 1.843; 95% CI: 0.983-3.456; p value: 0.070), development of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (73 [56.2%] vs 57 [43.8%], p value: <0.001), acute kidney injury (31 [81.6%] vs 7 [18.4%], p value: <0.001), cardiac complications (12 [75%] vs 4 [25%], p value: 0.002), and sepsis (29 [87.9%] vs 4 [12.1%], p value: <0.001). Non-survivors were more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), having been placed on NIV and mechanical ventilation. Laboratory parameters at final outcome found that in non-survivors, median total leukocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were higher, while absolute lymphocyte count and platelet counts were lower which were found to be statistically significant compared to survivors.

RESULTS Twenty-two videos of LSG were submitted and 11 videos included concurrent hiatal hernia repair. Data obtained from video analysis identified variation in time to complete each step of the procedure: prestapling dissection of stomach (5-25 minutes), gastric stapling (8-20 minutes), and management of the staple line (1-25 minutes). Time required to perform a hiatal hernia repair also varied (1-26 minutes), as did the type of repair: 55% were performed with a posterior cruropexy, 27% were performed with an anterior cruropexy, and 18% were performed with both. Ten different permutations of staple heights and buttressing material were used during division of the stomach with a gastric stapler.

Here we characterized plasma IgA from 41 early convalescent COVID-19 subjects for neutralisation and Fc effector functions. We find that convalescent plasma IgA from >60% of the cohort have the capacity to inhibit the interaction between wild-type RBD and ACE2. Furthermore, a third of the cohort induced stronger IgA-mediated inhibition of RBD binding to ACE2 than IgG, when tested at equivalent concentrations. Plasma IgA and IgG from the cohort, broadly recognize similar RBD epitopes and showed similar ability to inhibit ACE2 from binding 22 of 23 different prevalent RBD proteins with single amino acid mutations. Plasma IgA was largely incapable of mediating antibody-dependent phagocytosis in comparison to plasma IgG.

METHODS This was a planned exploratory analysis of the Patient Preparedness for Pelvic Organ Prolapse Surgery study, which randomized women to standardized preoperative counseling by office visit or phone call before prolapse surgery. Inclusion criteria were the completion of the assigned counseling intervention and submission of a 7-day postoperative pain and medication diary. Multivariable logistic regression was done to assess the association between counseling method and total opioid use while controlling for variables significant on univariate analysis (surgery type and county of residence). RESULTS There were 84 participants with postoperative data (41 office, 43 phone). Median total number of 5-mg oxycodone tablets used was higher for the office group (5 [interquartile range, 0-10]) than the phone group (0 [interquartile range, 0-2], P = 0.002). On multivariable logistic regression, women who underwent phone counseling were less likely to be in the highest third of opioid use when controlling for surgery type and county of residence (odds ratio, 0.23; P = 0.012; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.72). Daily pain scores and nonopioid medication use (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and acetaminophen) were similar between groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Despite similar pain scores, women who received preoperative phone counseling before pelvic organ prolapse surgery had lower opioid utilization than those with office counseling.

Little is known about existence and structure of SVPs in top performing US hospitals. METHODS: We performed a prospective study and interviewed individuals representing SVPs from 20 US News and World Report (USNWR) Honor Roll Hospitals. Telephone interviews were recorded, transcribed, and de-identified. To allow identification of both quantitative and qualitative themes that unified or distinguished programs with SVPs from each other, a content analysis approach was used. RESULTS: Of the Top 20 UNSWR hospitals, nineteen individuals with knowledge of or involvement in SVPs were identified. One individual represented two hospital systems for the same institution. Thirteen representatives agreed to participate, 12 declined, and 5 did not respond. One individual who initially agreed to participate did not attend the interview. Among twelve representatives interviewed, 10 reported establishment of SVPs at their hospitals between 2011 and 2016. Most program representatives reported that participants sought support voluntarily. Four domains were identified in the qualitative analysis: (a) identification of need for Second Victim Program (SVP); (b) challenges to program viability; (c) structural changes following SVP creation, and (d) insights for success. Driving SVP creation was the need support medical providers following a traumatic patient event. Poor physician participation due to the stigma associated with seeking support was commonly reported as a challenge. However, acceptance of the mission of SVPs, growing recognition of the value of the program across hospital departments, and systematic safety enhancements were cited as key advantages. To ensure success, participants suggested training a variety of volunteers and incorporating SVPs within quality improvement processes. CONCLUSIONS: In this convenience sample, programs for healthcare providers that experience psychosocial or emotional trauma from clinical care were uncommon. Variation in structure, performance, and measures of success among SVPs was observed. A systematic approach to evaluating SVPs is needed to help inform institutions of how to best serve their second victims.

Italy's experience teaches that steps to limit people's movement by imposing 'red zones' need to be put in place early by carefully identifying the cities to be included within these areas of quarantine. The assessment of the relationship between the distance from an established outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection with transmission-linked cases and mortality observed in other sites could provide useful information to identify the optimal radius of red zones. METHODS: We investigated the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 cases and the distance of each Italian province from the first outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy (the city of Lodi placed in the Lombardia region). In 38 provinces of Lombardia and neighboring regions, we performed a breakpoint analysis to identify the radius of the red zone around Lodi minimizing epidemic spread and mortality in neighboring cities. RESULTS: In all Italian provinces, a non-linear relationship was found between SARS-CoV-2 cases and distance from Lodi. In an analysis including the provinces of Lombardia and neighboring regions, SARS-CoV-2 cases and mortality increased when the distance from Lodi reduced below 92 and 140 km, respectively, and such relationships were amplified by ozone (O3) pollution. CONCLUSIONS: The breakpoint analysis identifies the radius around the outbreak of Lodi minimizing the public health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 in neighboring cities.

We investigated changes in humor and sarcasm use during the COVID-19 pandemic in participants with varying anxiety and depression symptom severity, and in those with versus without psychiatric disorders. METHODS: Online data was collected from N = 661 Canadian adults during the height of COVID-19-related restrictions. Depression and anxiety symptom severity were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale. Participants were queried on current presence/absence of a psychiatric disorder, and on changes in humor and sarcasm use during compared to before the pandemic. RESULTS: Participants with any vs. no depression symptoms reported more sarcasm and humor use during the pandemic. Respondents with mild and severe vs. no anxiety symptoms reported using more sarcasm. However, those with any vs. no anxiety symptoms used less humor during the pandemic. Finally, less humor use was noted in those without vs. with a psychiatric disorder. LIMITATIONS: The use of self-report measures and a sample that may limit generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with depression symptoms used more humor and sarcasm as a potential coping strategy during COVID-19. While individuals with anxiety symptoms used more sarcasm, this was not true of humor, suggesting their decreased reliance on levity during a crisis. Humor use was greater in those with psychiatric disorders, perhaps due to self-preservation mechanisms during times of distress.

Afferent impulses that result from the stimulation of pulmonary mechano-chemoreceptors, peripheral and central chemoreceptors by inflammatory cytokines are conducted to the brainstem. Integration and processing of these input signals occur within the central nervous system, especially in the limbic system and sensorimotor cortex, and importantly feedback regulation exists between O(2), CO(2,) and blood pH. Despite the intensity of hypoxemia in COVID-19, the intensity of dyspnea sensation is inappropriate to the degree of hypoxemia in some patients (silent hypoxemia). We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 may cause neuronal damage in the corticolimbic network and subsequently alter the perception of dyspnea and the control of respiration. SARS-CoV-2 neuronal infection may change the secretion of numerous endogenous neuropeptides or neurotransmitters that distribute through large areas of the nervous system to produce cellular and perceptual effects. SARS-CoV-2 mainly enter to CNS via direct (neuronal and hematologic route) and indirect route. We theorize that SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced neuronal cell damage and may change the balance of endogenous neuropeptides or neurotransmitters that distribute through large areas of the nervous system to produce cellular and perceptual effects. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-associated neuronal damage may influence the control of respiration by interacting in neuromodulation.

However, the success of this strategy relies critically on the duration of protective immunity resulting from both natural infection and vaccination. SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits an adaptive immune response against a large breadth of viral epitopes, although the duration of the response varies with age and disease severity. Current evidence from case studies and large observational studies suggests that, consistent with research on other common respiratory viruses, a protective immunological response lasts for approximately 5C12 months from primary infection, with reinfection being more likely given an insufficiently robust primary humoral response. Markers of humoral and cell-mediated immune memory can persist over many months, and might help to mitigate against severe disease upon reinfection. Emerging data, including evidence of breakthrough infections, suggest that vaccine effectiveness might be reduced significantly against emerging variants of concern, and hence secondary vaccines will need to be developed to maintain population-level protective immunity.

The purpose of this manuscript is to introduce the largest cohort of US ankle fracture surgery patients to date with a comparison between lab-confirmed COVID-19Cpositive and COVID-19Cnegative. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of adults with ankle fracture surgery using data from the N3C database with patients undergoing surgery between March 2020 and June 2021. The database is an NIH-funded platform through which the harmonized clinical data from 46 sites is stored. Patient characteristics included body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and smoking status. Outcomes included 30-day mortality, overall mortality, surgical site infection (SSI), deep SSI, acute kidney injury, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, sepsis, time to surgery, and length of stay. COVID-19Cpositive patients were compared to COVID-19Cnegative controls to investigate perioperative outcomes during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total population of 8.4 million patient records was queried, identifying 4735 adults with ankle fracture surgery. The COVID-19Cpositive group (n=158, 3.3%) had significantly longer times to surgery (6.5  6.6 vs 5.1  5.5 days, P = .001) and longer lengths of stay (8.3  23.5 vs 4.3  7.4 days, P < .001), compared to the COVID-19Cnegative group. The COVID-19Cpositive group also had a higher rate of 30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: Patients with ankle fracture surgery had longer time to surgery and prolonged hospitalizations in COVID-19Cpositive patients compared to those who tested negative (average delay was about 1 day and increased length of hospitalization was about 4 days). Few perioperative events were observed in either group. Overall, the risks associated with COVID-19 were measurable but not substantial. Level of Evidence: Level III, retrospective cohort study.","output":"Ankle Fracture and Length of Stay in US Adult Population Using Data From the National COVID Cohort Collaborative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk for treatment-related late effects; data are lacking on how coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection impacts this cohort.

In order to further assess the distribution of hepatitis viruses in bat populations in China, we tested the presence of these hepatitis viruses in our archived bat liver samples that originated from several bat species and various geographical regions in China. METHODS: A total of 78 bat liver samples (involving two families, five genera, and 17 species of bat) were examined using nested or heminested reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) with degenerate primers. Full-length genomic sequences of two virus strains were sequenced followed by phylogenetic analyses. RESULTS: Four samples were positive for hepadnavirus, only one was positive for hepevirus, and none of the samples were positive for hepatovirus or hepacivirus. The hepadnaviruses were discovered in the horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus sinicus and Rhinolophus affinis, and the hepevirus was found in the whiskered bat Myotis davidii. The full-length genomic sequences were determined for one of the two hepadnaviruses identified in R. sinicus (designated BtHBVRs3364) and the hepevirus (designated BtHEVMd2350). A sequence identity analysis indicated that BtHBVRs3364 had the highest degree of identity with a previously reported hepadnavirus from the roundleaf bat, Hipposideros pomona, from China, and BtHEVMd2350 had the highest degree of identity with a hepevirus found in the serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus, from Germany, but it exhibited high levels of divergence at both the nucleotide and the amino acid levels. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report that the Chinese horseshoe bat and the Chinese whiskered bat have been found to carry novel hepadnaviruses and a novel hepevirus, respectively. The discovery of BtHBVRs3364 further supports the significance of host switches evolution while opposing the co-evolutionary theory associated with hepadnaviruses. According to the latest criterion of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), we hypothesize that BtHEVMd2350 represents an independent genotype within the species Orthohepevirus D of the family Hepeviridae.","output":"Detection and genome characterization of four novel bat hepadnaviruses and a hepevirus in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) are widely used for graph analysis. Specifically, in medical applications, GCNs can be used for disease prediction on a population graph, where graph nodes represent individuals and edges represent individual similarities. However, GCNs rely on a vast amount of data, which is challenging to collect for a single medical institution. In addition, a critical challenge that most medical institutions continue to face is addressing disease prediction in isolation with incomplete data information. To address these issues, Federated Learning (FL) allows isolated local institutions to collaboratively train a global model without data sharing. In this work, we propose a framework, FedNI, to leverage network inpainting and inter-institutional data via FL. Specifically, we first federatively train missing node and edge predictor using a graph generative adversarial network (GAN) to complete the missing information of local networks. Then we train a global GCN node classifier across institutions using a federated graph learning platform. The novel design enables us to build more accurate machine learning models by leveraging federated learning and also graph learning approaches. We demonstrate that our federated model outperforms local and baseline FL methods with significant margins on two public neuroimaging datasets.","output":"FedNI: Federated Graph Learning with Network Inpainting for Population-Based Disease Prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE This retrospective study aimed to determine the predictive values of the C-reactive protein (CRP)/albumin ratio (CAR), fibrinogen/albumin ratio (FAR), and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) parameters, which reflect the systemic inflammatory status, for the severity of COVID-19. METHODS A total of 188 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Among them, 118 were in the severe group, and 70 were in the non-severe group. Levels of albumin, CRP, D-dimer, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, and hemoglobin; leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts; and the FAR, CAR, and NLR were compared between the two groups. RESULTS The CAR, FAR, and NLR values were significantly higher in the severe group compared to the non-severe group. CAR, FAR, and NLR were positively correlated with leukocyte and neutrophil counts and CRP, procalcitonin, and fibrinogen levels. On the other hand, they were inversely correlated with monocyte (except for NLR) and lymphocyte counts. Receiver operator characteristic analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) for CAR, FAR, and NLR was 0.841, 0.737, and 0.802, respectively.

CEUS with Sonazoid and dynamic CT were then used to evaluate the effect of RFA. For CEUS and dynamic CT, effects were classified as follows: (1) complete ablated response with safety margin >5 mm (CRSM+); (2) complete ablated response but with safety margin <5 mm (CRSM-); (3) incomplete, residual tumor detected after treatment. RESULTS CEUS judged 33 cases as CRSM+, while dynamic CT identified 49 cases. None of these 33 cases from the CEUS group had local recurrences, while dynamic CT had 1 case. CEUS judged 49 cases as CRSM-, compared to 34 cases with dynamic CT. Of these, 9 cases of CEUS and 8 cases of dynamic CT showed local recurrences. Two cases diagnosed as 'incomplete' by CEUS and dynamic CT had recurrences within 1 year.

Herein we are reporting the case of a Caucasian male who apparently died in a workplace allegedly by a fall from height and was found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive just prior to the autopsy. The circumstances of his death required a medicolegal investigation. Gross autopsy findings included minor external injuries and focal subarachnoid hemorrhage together with ribs and sternum fractures resulting from resuscitation attempt. In addition, visceral congestion was noticed, especially visible in lungs. Traumatic findings suitable to explain sudden death were absent. However, lungs histopathology analysis revealed diffuse alveolar damage with massive capillary congestion. Pathology in other organs included myocardial fibrosis, left ventricular hypertrophy, severe generalized atherosclerosis, glomerulosclerosis, focal liver necrosis, liver microabscesses and intrahepatal cholestasis.

Poor quality face images often reduce the performance of face analysis and recognition systems. Hence, it is important to enhance the quality of face images collected in such conditions. We present a multi-task face restoration network, called Network Architecture Search for Face Enhancement (NASFE), which can enhance poor quality face images containing a single degradation (i.e. noise or blur) or multiple degradations (noise+blur+low-light). During training, NASFE uses clean face images of a person present in the degraded image to extract the identity information in terms of features for restoring the image. Furthermore, the network is guided by an identity-loss so that the identity in-formation is maintained in the restored image. Additionally, we propose a network architecture search-based fusion network in NASFE which fuses the task-specific features that are extracted using the task-specific encoders. We introduce FFT-op and deveiling operators in the fusion network to efficiently fuse the task-specific features.

Due to high transmission levels, many governments implemented social distancing and confinement measures with different levels of required compliance to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic. In several countries, these measures were effective, and it was possible to flatten the epidemic curve and control it. In others, this objective was not or has not been achieved. In far too many cities around the world, rebounds of the epidemic are occurring or, in others, plateaulike states have appeared, where high incidence rates remain constant for relatively long periods of time. Nonetheless, faced with the challenge of urgent social need to reactivate their economies, many countries have decided to lift mitigation measures at times of high incidence. In this paper, we use a mathematical model to characterize the impact of short duration transmission events within the confinement period previous but close to the epidemic peak. The model also describes the possible consequences on the disease dynamics after mitigation measures are lifted. We use Mexico City as a case study. The results show that events of high mobility may produce either a later higher peak, a long plateau with relatively constant but high incidence or the same peak as in the original baseline epidemic curve, but with a post-peak interval of slower decay. Finally, we also show the importance of carefully timing the lifting of mitigation measures. If this occurs during a period of high incidence, then the disease transmission will rapidly increase, unless the effective contact rate keeps decreasing, which will be very difficult to achieve once the population is released.","output":"Lifting mobility restrictions and the effect of superspreading events on the short-term dynamics of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: To report a case of a patient with undiagnosed endocarditis that presented as COVID-19 pneumonia. Case report: 62-year-old woman with a history of arterial hypertension, presented to the Emergency Department of General Hospital Koprivnica with fever and cough lasting for 7 days and general fatigue lasting for 3 weeks. Her vital signs were in physiologic range, while auscultatory she had a systolic murmur over the whole precordium with diffuse pulmonary crackles. Chest radiograph showed bilateral interstitial pneumonia whilst laboratory results displayed elevated inflammatory markers, cardiac troponin and D-dimers combined with mild partial respiratory insufficiency. She was admitted to an isolated COVID-19 ward where empiric antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone began in parallel with dexamethasone, dalteparin and oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. During the night of admission, she became hemodynamically unstable and fluid resuscitation in conjunction with inotropes was initiated. Emergency pulmonary CT angiography ruled out pulmonary embolism and showed bilateral ground-glass changes with pleural effusion as well as signs of venous congestion. Subsequently, COVID-19 was confirmed with the RT-PCR test. After a 10-day isolation period, she was transferred to the Cardiology Department where transthoracic echocardiography was performed. Massive vegetation on the anterior mitral leaflet that caused obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract and moderate mitral regurgitation with filiform vegetation on the aortic valve were shown. Initial antibiotic therapy was swapped to amikacin and gentamicin. Further hospital stay was complicated with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, worsening of heart failure and psychological disturbance. Indication for emergency valve replacement and transfer to the University Hospital Dubrava was indicated. Intraoperatively, massive vegetation on A1/A2 section of mitral leaflet and a smaller vegetation on ventricular side of left and noncoronary cusps of the aortic valve were visible. Both valves were replaced with mechanical valves with satisfying results and the patient was returned to the parent hospital. Coagulase-negative S. aureus susceptible to vancomycin was later verified on the mitral leaflet specimen.

We introduce biosensors aimed at detecting severe cases of COVID-19 in decentralized healthcare settings. They consist of a paper immunosensor interfaced with a smartphone. The immunosensors have been designed to generate intense colorimetric signals when the sample contains ultralow concentrations of IL-6, which has been proposed as a prognosis biomarker of COVID-19. This is achieved by combining a paper-based signal amplification mechanism with polymer-filled reservoirs for dispensing antibody-decorated nanoparticles and a bespoken app for color quantification. With this design we achieved a low limit of detection (LOD) of 10(?3) pg mL(-1) and semi-quantitative measurements in a wide dynamic range between 10(?3) and 10(2) pg mL(-1) in PBS. The assay time is under 10 min. The low LOD allowed us to dilute blood samples and detect IL-6 with an LOD of 1.3 pg mL(-1) and a dynamic range up to 10(2) pg mL(-1). Following this protocol, we were able to stratify COVID-19 patients according to different blood levels of IL-6. We also report on the detection of IL-6 in respiratory samples (bronchial aspirate, BAS) from COVID-19 patients.

Methods: This cross-sectional online survey study was conducted in Jordan during the COVID-19 outbreak in July 2020 to discuss Jordanian pharmacists awareness of safety at their workplace during the COVID-19 outbreak, their sources of information, and their predictions for COVID-19 vaccination. Results: The participants (n = 311) were all pharmacists mostly aged between 23C30 years old (45%) and female (83%). The primary source of information about COVID-19 was social networking (38.9%). Pharmacists were committed to social distancing (86.5%) and wearing masks (76.2%). They expressed levels of agreement to their role in decreasing COVID-19 spread (94.2%) and correcting false information (94.5%); they expressed levels of expectation toward concern about a second COVID-19 wave (83%) that would be more severe than the previous one (43.4%). Pharmacists expected that an influenza vaccine might be helpful in decreasing severity and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic (56.9%).

These measures aim to protect peoples health and, at the same time, impact their social lives. So far, it is little known how people evaluate those anti-Corona measures with regard to their social spheres (close family, wider family and friends, colleagues, and society). Furthermore, it is plausible that the subjective evaluation of attitudinal objects and especially severe events, like the COVID-19 pandemic and the related counter-measures, is multidimensional. Against this background, we combine the social spheres with the elements of the Theory of Planned Behavior. On the methodological basis of the Means-End Theory of Complex Cognitive Structures, we determine the perceived relevance and quality of the attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and social spheres regarding anti-Corona measures. Furthermore, the applied methodology allows the deduction of norm strategies to define the priority of securing or increasing the effectiveness of elements of anti-Corona measures. Based on the answers of 663 participants, we found that the protection from COVID-19 and its consequences (attitude) are more important to people than the practicability of anti-Corona measures in their social lives (perceived behavioral control), which, again, has a higher subjective relevance than the willingness to fulfill the expectations of others (subjective norm). Additionally, people distinguish between their close family (higher subjective relevance) and their other social spheres (lower subjective relevance). The people attribute the highest quality to the tips on hygiene, followed by the restrictions on outdoor activities and the tips for mental health. The protection and practicability of the anti-Corona measures have higher quality ratings than the willingness to fulfill the expectations of others. Based on the norm strategies, policymakers should secure the effectiveness of the current anti-Corona measures with a high priority by focusing on the protection and practicability with regard to close and wider family and friends. Increasing the effectiveness of the protection and practicability of anti-Corona measures in work and society also has a high priority. Focusing on the subjective norm should be of lower priority.","output":"How People Evaluate Anti-Corona Measures for Their Social Spheres: Attitude, Subjective Norm, and Perceived Behavioral Control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, attempts to nurture learners by educators to become more active and motivated learning experiences are getting more challenging.

Given the novelty and scale of the disease, information surrounding COVID-19 has been marked by considerable uncertainty and confusion. Although various factors have been associated with COVID-19 distress, little is known about the relations between levels of intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and anxiety symptoms and behaviors. This cross-sectional study sought to examine potential correlates and pathways between anxiety and precautionary behaviors with the two levels of IU: prospective and inhibitory. Individuals from NYC (N = 99) completed an online survey through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Findings revealed that fear of COVID-19 accounts for associations between prospective IU and greater anxiety symptoms and behaviors, whereas precaution adherence accounts for associations between prospective IU and reduced anxiety symptoms and behaviors. In addition, precaution adherence accounts for associations between inhibitory IU and greater anxiety symptoms and behaviors. The results shed light on ways in which variations in IU may be associated with anxiety symptoms and behaviors in the context of COVID-19 and future pandemic scenarios.","output":"Uncertainty in the Time of Corona: Precautionary Adherence, Fear, and Anxiety in New York City During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.345 variant carrying the E484K mutation was detected in four patients with no apparent epidemiological association from a hospital network in upstate New York.

OBJECTIVE: To address this issue, we developed the Biomedical Database Inventory (BiDI), a repository linking to biomedical databases automatically extracted from the scientific literature. BiDI provides an index of data resources and a path to access them seamlessly. METHODS: We designed an ensemble of deep learning methods to extract database mentions. To train the system, we annotated a set of 1242 articles that included mentions of database publications. Such a data set was used along with transfer learning techniques to train an ensemble of deep learning natural language processing models targeted at database publication detection. RESULTS: The system obtained an F1 score of 0.929 on database detection, showing high precision and recall values. When applying this model to the PubMed and PubMed Central databases, we identified over 10,000 unique databases. The ensemble model also extracted the weblinks to the reported databases and discarded irrelevant links. For the extraction of weblinks, the model achieved a cross-validated F1 score of 0.908. We show two use cases: one related to \\"omics\\" and the other related to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: BiDI enables access to biomedical resources over the internet and facilitates data-driven research and other scientific initiatives.

The Global Carbon Project has been producing a current-year projection of global CO(2) emissions since 2012, introducing a sub-projection for the European Union in 2018. The success of this EU projection has been variable, and in this article I explore how the projections in 2019 were made along with some of the reasons why the projections have high uncertainty and bias. About 84% of the total error in the projection of EU emissions in 2019 was because of a poor projection for coal consumption, which was a result of poor estimates of sub-annual observations, a misunderstanding of conflicting information, and poor assumptions applied to the remainder of the year. The correction of the errors identified here will go some way to improving future short-term projections of the European Union's CO(2) emissions, paving the way for a low-maintenance, operational system.","output":"Towards near real-time, monthly fossil CO(2) emissions estimates for the European Union with current-year projections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Lvolution de linfection par la COVID-19 peut se faire vers la dtresse respiratoire aigu? et au dcs du patient.

Simultaneously, the SARS-COV-2 virus has a rapid mutation phenomenon, and somegene coding regions by mutation and recombination may be related to the drug resistance of the virus. Therefore, studying the relationship between the co-infection of bacteria and fungi and the evolution of SARS-COV-2 has important guiding significance for preventing a pandemic. We found that the SARS-COV-2 virus's nsp3 protein had a CRISPR/Cas 9 (II-B)-like function by searching for conserved domains. The system could target and edit the negative-strand RNA of SARS-COV-2. We speculated that the crRNA (CRISPR RNA) produced by the CRISPR/Cas system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa carried the genetic information of the conserved domains of bacteriophages and Pseudomonas, including drug resistance. After the phage lysed the Pseudomonas, the crRNA was released and attached to the fungal spores, and then invaded the patient's cells along with the spores or hyphae. nsp3 synthesized and assembled 4Fe-4S, iron-containing molecules bound to the cas4 domain, in the mitochondria of phagocytes. The iron came from hemoglobin attacked by the SARS-COV-2 virus protein. The nsp3 protein bound the crRNA in the phagocytic cytoplasm. It targeted the negative-strand RNA of SARS-COV-2, inserting conserved domain gene fragments into the negative-strand RNA through editing and splicing. Since the Cas protein had no codon checking function, the cutting and splicing would destroy the protein-coding information in the original RNA coding region, causing mutation and recombination of the SARS-COV-2 virus genome. If crRNA carried the drug resistance gene fragments of bacteria or phage, SARS-COV-2 would have similar drug resistance. Because of the growing problem of drug resistance in COVID-19 patients, we should pay attention to preventing fungi and bacteria co-infection. Avoid the CRISPR/Cas-like system of the novel coronavirus to cause rapid mutation and recombination and increased the drug resistance problem of SARS-COV-2.","output":"COVID-19: CRISPR/Cas-like System of nsp3 Promotes the Mutant Recombination and Drug Resistance (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Even though effective drugs for treating hypertension are available, a great percentage of patients have inadequate control of their blood pressure.

Fifty-two Finnish 5th graders played a game on fractions at home during COVID-19 enforced distance learning. Flow and situational interest measures were embedded directly into the game environment. Results revealed that although flow experience and situational interest constructs share similar components, they also differ. In particular, regression analysis indicated that situational interest is mostly related to immersive aspects of flow. Moreover, learning gains achieved by playing the game and situational interest were positively related - a relation not found with flow. Although flow was not related to learning gains, it seems to be a more competence-oriented construct than situational interest as it was positively correlated with in-game performance. The design of the game successfully supported weaker students with adaptive scaffolds and in-game self-reporting measures worked well. Taken together, even though situational interest and flow share similar components, both constructs are important for multifaceted assessment of engagement in game-based learning.

This study aimed to assess the COVID-19 infection-related anxiety and coping strategies among nursing students returning to university campuses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 282 nursing students who returned to campus during the summer semester of the academic year 2019/2020. The returning students were invited to complete an online questionnaire consisting of three parts: 1) sociodemographic variables and infection-related information, 2) the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) Scale, and 3) the Brief-Coping Behavior Questionnaire (Brief-COPE). RESULTS: Of the participating students, 70.6% reported mild to severe anxiety levels. Female students and students who had fears of becoming infected with COVID-19 were found to be at higher risk of anxiety than were other students. A positive correlation was found between students anxiety levels and their dysfunctional coping strategies, which included denial, behavioral disengagement, venting, and self-blame. Students who had chosen to study nursing willingly used coping planning. Further, other sociodemographic variables and infection-related information were associated with dysfunctional and emotion-focused coping strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The participating nursing students showed significant COVID-19-related anxiety upon returning to on-campus learning.

This study evaluated the feasibility of remote HbA1c monitoring via dried blood spot (DBS) testing to support assessment of glycemic control for telemedicine visits and examined clinical and demographic characteristics associated with patient completion of DBS testing. METHODS: Providers could place orders for DBS HbA1c 3 weeks prior to telemedicine visits. Feasibility was assessed by examining DBS completion rates, time to completion, and availability of DBS results prior to telemedicine visits. Chi-square tests and Mann Whitney tests were used to assess whether completion rates were associated with participant characteristics. RESULTS: Of 303 DBS orders placed for telemedicine visits in June 2020, 162 patients completed the DBS test for a completion rate of (53.4%). Average time from collection at home to result being reported was 6.9 (3.8) days. The DBS result was available in 67.6% of patients who completed successful DBS, before the telemedicine clinic visit.

We therefore aimed to assess the effects of vaccine characteristics, information on herd immunity, and general practitioner (GP) recommendation on vaccine hesitancy in a representative working-age population in France. METHODS: In this survey experiment, adults aged 18-64 years residing in France, with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, were randomly selected from an online survey research panel in July, 2020, stratified by gender, age, education, household size, and region and area of residence to be representative of the French population. Participants completed an online questionnaire on their background and vaccination behaviour-related variables (including past vaccine compliance, risk factors for severe COVID-19, and COVID-19 perceptions and experience), and were then randomly assigned according to a full factorial design to one of three groups to receive differing information on herd immunity (>50% of adults aged 18-64 years must be immunised [either by vaccination or infection]; >50% of adults must be immunised [either by vaccination or infection]; or no information on herd immunity) and to one of two groups regarding GP recommendation of vaccination (GP recommends vaccination or expresses no opinion). Participants then completed a series of eight discrete choice tasks designed to assess vaccine acceptance or refusal based on hypothetical vaccine characteristics (efficacy [50%, 80%, 90%, or 100%], risk of serious side-effects [1 in 10a??000 or 1 in 100a??000], location of manufacture [EU, USA, or China], and place of administration [GP practice, local pharmacy, or mass vaccination centre]). Responses were analysed with a two-part model to disentangle outright vaccine refusal (irrespective of vaccine characteristics, defined as opting for no vaccination in all eight tasks) from vaccine hesitancy (acceptance depending on vaccine characteristics). FINDINGS: Survey responses were collected from 1942 working-age adults, of whom 560 (288%) opted for no vaccination in all eight tasks (outright vaccine refusal) and 1382 (712%) did not. In our model, outright vaccine refusal and vaccine hesitancy were both significantly associated with female gender, age (with an inverted U-shaped relationship), lower educational level, poor compliance with recommended vaccinations in the past, and no report of specified chronic conditions (ie, no hypertension [for vaccine hesitancy] or no chronic conditions other than hypertension [for outright vaccine refusal]). Outright vaccine refusal was also associated with a lower perceived severity of COVID-19, whereas vaccine hesitancy was lower when herd immunity benefits were communicated and in working versus non-working individuals, and those with experience of COVID-19 (had symptoms or knew someone with COVID-19). For a mass vaccination campaign involving mass vaccination centres and communication of herd immunity benefits, our model predicted outright vaccine refusal in 294% (95% CI 286-302) of the French working-age population. Predicted hesitancy was highest for vaccines manufactured in China with 50% efficacy and a 1 in 10a??000 risk of serious side-effects (vaccine acceptance 274% [268-280]), and lowest for a vaccine manufactured in the EU with 90% efficacy and a 1 in 100a??000 risk of serious side-effects (vaccine acceptance 613% [605-621]).

With the COVID-19 pandemic having impacted healthcare systems and regimes globally, the aim of this study is to understand how treatment management of knee OA patients and prescribing behavior across US healthcare professionals (HCPs) was affected, and how they adapt towards a potential new norm in treating this condition. Methods: A cross-sectional chart review survey was conducted in both Q2 2019 and Q2 2020 among US board-certified rheumatologists (rheums), orthopedic surgeons (orthos), primary care physicians with a focus in sports medicine (SM PCPs), and pain specialists, all practicing across hospital and private practices. Recruited from a large access panel, physicians were screened for duration of practice in their specialty (3-50 years) and caseload (35 or more knee OA patients personally managed, at least 10 of which must be classified as moderate-severe). Participants were asked to complete a 3-part online survey: (1) a doctor demographic questionnaire, (2) a perceptual questionnaire, assessing perception of available and upcoming OA therapies, and (3) patient record charts for the next 5 knee OA patients seen following receipt of the survey, capturing demographics and treatment history. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: The total number of sampled physicians recruited in this survey with their reported patient totals are stated in Table 1. [Formula presented] When focusing on the current prescription medication reported patients are receiving, oral medications, particularly NSAIDs, are widely used, regardless of the physician specialty. Here we see a directional increase in the proportion of reported patients deriving from sampled primary care SM PCPs from pre-COVID (Q219) to during COVID (Q220) (not statistically significantly different), whilst the same is not true for the other three secondary care sampled specialties, namely rheums, orthos and pain specialists (not statistically significantly different) - see Fig. 1. [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Conclusions: From the sample surveyed, it appears that primary care SM PCPs adopted their treatment adjustment during COVID-19 pandemic differently, by prescribing more orals while other secondary care physicians (rheums, orthos, pain specialists) focused on injection treatment for longer pain relief. Considering movement restrictions and limited elective surgeries during the pandemic, the lack of targeted treatment options for knee OA has been made more apparent. With a burgeoning pipeline, many of which are targeted therapies, it is hopeful that knee OA treaters will be less reliant on symptom remedies and can readily offer patients longer-acting pain relief or disease modifying options to combat joint deterioration.","output":"Understanding prescription behavior across healthcare professionals in treating knee osteoarthritis before and during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Clinical equipoise of carotid revascularization therapies remains controversial. We sought to determine whether adverse outcomes after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) were similar using propensity score-matched analysis of retrospective data from a large hospital discharge database. METHODS All CEA and CAS cases were identified from the 2006 to 2011 Premier Perspective Database and subjected to 1:1 propensity score matching using 33 clinical covariates associated with carotid revascularization. A primary composite end point of peri- or postoperative mortality, stroke, or acute myocardial infarction and a modified composite end point excluding acute myocardial infarction were used to compare our findings with recent prospective controlled trials. Multivariate regression and Cox-proportional hazard ratio survival analysis were performed to compare revascularization therapy outcomes. RESULTS After 1:1 propensity score matching, 24 004 (12 002 CEA and CAS) asymptomatic and 3506 (1753 CEA and CAS) symptomatic procedures were included. The risk of the primary composite end point was significantly higher after CAS than CEA in both asymptomatic (odds ratio, 1.40 [1.19-1.65]; P<0.0001) and symptomatic (odds ratio=2.31 [1.78-3.00]; P<0.0001) presentations, irrespective of age (P=0.28) or sex (P=0.35). Similar findings were observed using the modified composite end point for both asymptomatic (odds ratio, 1.49 [1.25-1.78]; P<0.0001) and symptomatic (odds ratio, 3.02 [2.25-4.07]; P<0.0001) presentations. Acute myocardial infarction risk was not significantly different between revascularization therapies, regardless of clinical presentation (P=0.71 and 0.24). CONCLUSIONS Among individuals undergoing carotid artery revascularization from a large sample of US hospitals, CAS was associated with higher risk of perioperative mortality, stroke, and unfavorable discharges compared with CEA for all ages and clinical presentations.","output":"Comparative effectiveness of carotid revascularization therapies: evidence from a National Hospital Discharge Database."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The reported incidence and fatality rate of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in patients receiving chronic dialysis are higher than in the general population. We sought to study the outcomes following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) in a single center in Brazil. METHODS Of the 522 patients on dialysis evaluated between March 1, 2020, and October 1, 2021, those presenting symptoms or with a history of close contact with COVID-19 patients were tested with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction of samples from nasopharyngeal swabs. RESULTS Of the 522 patients, 120 were positive for COVID-19 infection, of which 86% were on HD and 14% in the PD program. The incidence per 10,000 inhabitants was higher in the HD group than in the PD group (2,423.5 vs. 1,752.5). The mortality per 10,000 inhabitants (470.5 vs. 927.8) and the fatality rate (19.4 vs. 52.9%, p = 0.005) were higher in the PD group. The PD group also had a higher need for hospitalization, intensive care, and mechanical ventilation.

This research is qualitative and recorded participants feedback from the Ardabil province of Iran. The study used a purposeful sampling method and lasted from April to May 2021 to collect the data through semi-structured interviews with 45 participants based on their gender, education, employment status, and marital status. The researchers analyzed the qualitative content until the required data-target through interviews implementation. This study incorporated MAXQDA version 10 to analyze the data and followed Goba and Lincolns criteria to ensure quality research results. After analyzing the data, two main categories (internal and external barriers) and seven subcategories were obtained. The internal barriers exhibited further classified subcategories, such as mental, belief, and awareness barriers. The results indicated that external barriers included social, political, managerial, and economic barriers. The study results designated that a set of internal and external factors might cause individuals' non-compliance with health guidelines and standard SOPs in the advent of the pandemic COVID-19. Recognition of such factors, identified following the social, cultural, and political context and individuals' characteristics during the COVID-19 outbreak, can be used effectively to plan educational and management programs. As a result, elimination and eradication of obstacles and the relevant dimensions may facilitate disease control.

However, p38-targeted therapeutics have largely failed in clinical trials in part due to the ubiquitous expression and essential physiological roles of p38 activity in almost all tissues. We have previously shown that G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) stimulation activates an understudied atypical p38 pathway, through direct interaction between p38 and an essential adaptor protein TGF-? Activated Kinase 1 Binding Protein 1 (TAB1), inducing p38 autophosphorylation. There is a critical gap in our understanding of how this pathway induces inflammation, and a greater understanding of atypical p38 signaling could provide alternative therapeutic approaches. We hypothesized that the spatiotemporal regulation of atypical p38 signaling is critical for downstream signaling responses associated with pulmonary inflammation. In this work, we have developed a Forster's Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) platform of sub-cellular localized biosensors to map p38 activity. Through exploration of GPCRs known to activate atypical p38 signaling, we demonstrate that GPCRs significantly alter the dynamics of p38 activity in part through sequestration of the kinase in the cytosol. This is contrary to rapid nuclear translocation after induction of classical MKK3/6 mediated p38 signaling. This ligand-dependent bias in the spatiotemporal dynamics of p38 activity represents an under-explored mechanism for regulation of vascular inflammation. Our current studies are focused on defining how cytosolic atypical p38 modulates pulmonary inflammatory signaling. We have established a basis for further expansion of this system to differentiate cytosolic-biased GPCR signaling at the endosome and will adapt this platform of biosensors for further exploration in pulmonary vascular cells. Combined, these studies provide foundational insight into the spatiotemporal bias of TAB1-mediated p38 signaling and its modulation of vascular inflammatory disease.","output":"The Spatiotemporal Bias in Proinflammatory p38 Signaling Revealed by a Forster's Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based Platform for Mapping GPCR-induced Vascular Inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past decade, some of the world's most stable parliamentary democracies have witnessed a revival in right-wing populist political parties, movements and leaders. Although there is a growing body of theoretical and empirical literature documenting the rise of populism, there has been very little exploration of the implications for health policy of this important political development. In this article, we draw from three illustrative international cases, originating from the USA, the UK and Italy, to explore the ways in which right-wing populism influences health policy: the election of President Trump in the United States (and subsequent healthcare reforms), the United Kingdom's vote to withdraw from the European Union (Brexit), and how this has played out in the context of the UK National Health Service, and the rise of a politically aligned anti-vaccination movement in Italy. Drawing on the work of the influential socio-political theorist Ernesto Laclau, we interpret populism as a performative political act, predicated on drawing logics of equivalence (and difference) between different actors. We use this theoretical framing to explore the ways in which the recent upsurge in right-wing populism creates a specific set of barriers and challenges for access to healthcare and the health of populations.","output":"Populism and health policy: three international case studies of right-wing populist policy frames"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the moment, there are many methods of analysis and classification aimed at building the most accurate and effective mathematical models that are widely used in medicine as a decision-making tool.

Controversies remain whether the clinical presentation is due to direct organ damage by SARS-CoV-2 or secondary effects, e.g. by an overshooting immune response. SARS-CoV-2 detection in tissues by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) or electron microscopy (EM) can help answer these questions, but a comprehensive evaluation of these applications is missing. Methods We assessed publications using IHC and EM for SARS-CoV-2 detection in autopsy tissues. We systematically evaluated commercially available antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleocapsid, dsRNA, and non-structural protein Nsp3 in cultured cell lines and COVID-19 autopsy tissues. In a multicenter study, we evaluated specificity, reproducibility, and inter-observer variability of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid staining. We correlated RT-qPCR viral tissue loads with semiquantitative IHC scoring. We used qualitative and quantitative EM analyses to refine criteria for ultrastructural identification of SARS-CoV-2. Findings Publications show high variability in the detection and interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 abundance in autopsy tissues by IHC or EM. In our study, we show that IHC using antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid yields the highest sensitivity and specificity. We found a positive correlation between presence of viral proteins by IHC and RT-qPCR-determined SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load (r=-0.83, p-value <0.0001). For EM, we refined criteria for virus identification and also provide recommendations for optimized sampling and analysis. 116 of 122 publications misinterpret cellular structures as virus using EM or show only insufficient data. We provide publicly accessible digitized EM and IHC sections as a reference and for training purposes. Interpretation Since detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human autopsy tissues by IHC and EM is difficult and frequently incorrect, we propose criteria for a re-evaluation of available data and guidance for further investigations of direct organ effects by SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Assessing and improving the validity of COVID-19 autopsy studies - a multi center approach to establish essential standards for immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extension of the interval between vaccine doses for the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was introduced in the UK to accelerate population coverage with a single dose. In a study of 503 healthcare workers, we show that after priming following the first vaccine there is a marked decline in SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels, but, in contrast, a sustained T cell response to spike protein. This divergent immune profile was accompanied by robust protection from infection over this period from the circulating alpha (B.1.1.7) variant. Importantly, following the second vaccine dose, NAb levels were higher after the extended dosing interval (6-14 weeks) compared to the conventional 3-4 week regimen, accompanied by a clear enrichment of CD4+ T cells expressing IL2. These data on dynamic cellular and humoral responses indicate that extension of the dosing interval is an effective, immunogenic protocol and that antiviral T cell responses are a potential mechanism of protection.Trial Registration Details: PITCH is a sub-study of the SIREN study which is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN11041050,Funding Information: This work was funded by the UK Department of Health and Social Care as part of the PITCH (Protective Immunity from T cells to Covid-19 in Health workers) Consortium, with contributions from UKRI/NIHR through the UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium (UK-CIC), the Huo Family Foundation and The National Institute for Health Research (UKRIDHSC COVID-19 Rapid Response Rolling Call, Grant Reference Number COV19-RECPLAS).EB and PK are NIHR Senior Investigators and PK is funded by WT109965MA.

Then, deep learning technology is combined with the relevant employment concept to construct an employment training model to guide college students in employment. Besides, a questionnaire on learning effect and employment quality is designed from four perspectives: learning motivation, concentration, teaching process, and final results. The information collected through the questionnaire demonstrates that the employment quality and learning effect of male and female students are not significantly affected by gender differences. In addition, the P values of learning motivation, concentration, and teaching process are all less than 0.01, and the unstandardized coefficient of the teaching process is 0.349, which has the most significant impact on the learning effect. In short, the three factors positively affect the learning effect. Therefore, it comes to the conclusion of improving the ability and strategy of classroom employment guidance. If one wants to be successful in job hunting and career selection, it is not enough just to be competitive but also to be good at it. Being good at the competition is reflected in having good psychological quality, strength, and a good competitive state. In the job hunting and career selection competition, attention should be paid to whether the expected value is appropriate. College students should have sufficient self-awareness before preparing to submit resumes. During the interview, they should overcome emotional anxiety.

The results show that the favorable reaction path consists of five steps: nucleophilic attack, proton transfer, the formation of the C-C bond, the tautomerism of the enol intermediate, the formation of the five-membered ring, and the regeneration of the catalyst. For the process of proton transfer, the base-assisted reaction can reduce the activation free energy and make the reaction easier to occur compared with the direct proton transfer process. The formation of the C-C bond is the crucial step of stereoselectivity, in which two chiral centers and four configurations of intermediates (RR/RS/SR/SS) were generated. The free energy barriers obtained and the noncovalent interaction analysis confirm that the dominant configuration is SS, becoming the final trans-type product observed in experiment. Furthermore, through the analyses of the conceptual DFT and natural atomic charges, it is revealed that NHC acts as a double catalyst, which can not only increase the nucleophilicity of reactants by Lewis base but also activate the C-H bond and promote the proton transfer process. The understanding of the mechanism obtained in this study should be helpful to the other organic catalytic reactions with high stereoselectivity.","output":"Theoretical Insights into Enantioselective [3 + 2] Cycloaddition between Cinnamaldehyde and Cyclic N-Sulfonyl Trifluoromethylated Ketimine Catalyzed by N-Heterocyclic Carbene"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Covid-19 is today's pandemic disease and can cause the hospital crowded.

The overall incidence of definite and definite plus probable PCP in NHL patients receiving R-CHOP were 2.0 % (14/713; 95 % CI, 1.1C3.3 %) and 4.5 % (32/713; 95 % CI, 3.2C6.4 %), respectively. This corresponded to 3.8 (95 % CI, 2.2C6.4) and 8.4 (95 % CI, 5.9C11.9) per 1000 persons. Many cases of Pneumocystis pneumonia (22/32, 68.7 %) developed after administration of the fourth R-CHOP cycle. However, there was no statistical difference in Pneumocystis pneumonia prevalence between patients receiving four or more cycles of R-CHOP and fewer than. Higher absolute neutrophil count (4,742/mm(3) vs. 2,627/mm(3); p < 0.01) was associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia development at the last R-CHOP cycle, while absolute lymphocyte count at the time of NHL diagnosis was not. Contrary to expectations, Pneumocystis pneumonia is not a frequent complication of R-CHOP treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cytoreduction of R-CHOP might not be a risk factor of Pneumocystis pneumonia development. Universal prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia during R-CHOP treatment could not be strongly recommended.

However, nearly all lab-based high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 serological assays require a serum sample from venous blood draw, limiting their applications and scalability. Here, we present a method that enables large scale SARS-CoV-2 serological studies by combining self or office collection of fingerprick blood with a volumetric absorptive microsampling device (Mitra, Neoteryx, LLC) with a high-throughput electrochemiluminescence-based SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay (Roche Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics, Inc.) that is emergency use authorization (EUA) approved for use on serum samples and widely used by clinical laboratories around the world. We found that the Roche Elecsys assay has a high dynamic range that allows for accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples diluted 1:20 as well as contrived dried blood extracts. Extracts of dried blood from Mitra devices acquired in a community seroprevalence study showed near identical sensitivity and specificity in detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as compared to neat sera using predefined thresholds for each specimen type.

Early identification and treatment of these high-risk children can lead to improved mental health outcomes in this population. OBJECTIVE This study assesses the feasibility of a study protocol that compares 3 screening tools for identifying patients at a high risk of later development of acute stress disorder or PTSD among pediatric trauma patients. METHODS This pilot study compared 3 questionnaires used as screening tools for predictors of later development of PTSD in a convenience sample of pediatric trauma patients aged 7-17 years. Patients were randomized to one of 3 screening tools. Families were contacted at 30, 60, and 90-120 days postinjury to complete the Child Report of Post-Traumatic Symptoms questionnaire. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of the screening tools were compared for the diagnosis of PTSD defined using the Child Report of Post-Traumatic Symptoms questionnaire. RESULTS Of the 263 patients identified for possible enrollment, 52 patients met full inclusion criteria and agreed to participate. Only 29 (55.7%) patients completed at least one follow-up questionnaire. The prevalence of acute stress disorder and PTSD in our population was 41% (95% CI [24, 61]) and 31% (95% CI [15, 51]), respectively. CONCLUSIONS In this pilot study, we sought to determine the utility of the 3 commonly used screening instruments for measuring traumatic stress symptoms in pediatric trauma patients to predict the diagnosis of acute stress disorder or PTSD.

JHM virus, LPS and AP are all capable of inducing Ia molecules on astrocytes, however, in a pattern and kinetics distinct from recombinant rat gamma interferon (-IFN). Whereas -IFN induced Ia expression on astrocytes and all macrophages after 48 h treatment, JHM virus, LPS and AP required 4C7 days for maximal induction of Ia on astrocytes, but had little to no effect on the macrophage population. This indicates that astrocytes are uniquely reactive to components derived from infectious agents and that these components are immunoregulatory with respect to Ia expression on astrocytes. We have also attempted to determine possible mechanisms by which these agents induce astrocyte Ia and show that phorbol myristate acetate and Ca(2+) ionophore A23187 have similar effects.

Inflammation and structural damage on MRI-SIJ/MRI-spine were defined by the agreement of 2 of 3 readers (binary outcomes), and by the average of 3 readers (continuous outcomes). The effect of inflammation (MRI-SIJ/MRI-spine) on damage (MRI-SIJ/MRI-spine, respectively) was evaluated in two models: i. Baseline prediction model: effect of baseline inflammation on damage assessed at 5-year; and ii. Longitudinal model: effect of inflammation on structural damage assessed during 5 years. RESULTS 202 patients were included. Both the presence of bone marrow edema (BME) on MRI-SIJ and on MRI-spine at baseline were predictive of 5-year damage (3 fatty lesions) on MRI-SIJ [OR=4.2 (95% CI: 2.4; 7.3)] and MRI-spine [OR=10.7 (95% CI: 2.4; 49.0)], respectively, when adjusted for CRP.

Analysis of other structural outcomes (i.e. erosions) on MRI-SIJ yielded similar results. In the spine, a significant association was found for fatty lesions but not for erosions and bone spurs, which occurred infrequently over time.

We first use a qualitative comparative analysis to examine changes in respondents travel behavior and vehicle ownership after adopting TNC. We then use a random parameter logit regression analysis to investigate customers preferences between transit and TNC based on a choice experiment. We find that in both cities, TNC allows customers, including those who currently do not own a car, to either delay purchasing a car or forgo a car altogether. TNC enables customers across income levels to take trips that they otherwise would not have taken. Meanwhile, TNC substitutes for more than complementing transit. The random parameter logit analysis indicates that when choosing between TNC and transit, individuals in both cities consider waiting time and overall travel time for transit to be more burdensome than those for TNC. Bostonians perceive the time spent walking to and from transit to be less burdensome, and the time spent traveling in vehicle to be more burdensome than do Philadelphians.

For this, we outline a construction strategy that aligns messages in different languages at both the node and semantic levels. Relationships between messages are established by merging entities that are the same but are referred to in different languages. Non-English message representations are converted into English semantic space via the cross-lingual word embeddings. The resulting message graph is then uniformly encoded by a GNN model. In special cases where a lesser-spoken language needs to be detected, a novel cross-lingual knowledge distillation framework, called CLKD, exploits prior knowledge learned from similar threads in English to make up for the paucity of annotated data.

The COVID-19 pandemic may have exacerbated disparities in paediatric cancer outcomes between LMICs and HICs. The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer has identified gliomas as a common cancer that can act as a benchmark for assessing global paediatric cancer care. This study aims to ascertain the short and medium-term outcome across 17 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic by determining 30- and 90-day all-cause mortality rates for paediatric glioma patients who underwent treatment. METHOD: A multicentre, international, mixed- (retrospective and prospective), collaborative cohort study in 17 countries. Patients were recruited between March 12th 2020 and July 12th 2020. RESULTS: 129 patients were recruited with the majority being histologically diagnosed as low-grade gliomas (n = 86/118, 72.9%). Seven children had a change to their planned chemotherapy treatment because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, seven children and eleven children had a change to their planned radiotherapy treatment and surgical treatment respectively because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Five patients died within the 30-day follow-up period, with all five patients being in LMICs. A sixth child, also in a LMIC, died within the 90-day follow-up period.

RESULTS: A retrospective analysis of the files of 63 patients with COVID-19 and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 37 patients received HFNCO as initial therapy, and 26 patients were primarily treated with NIV. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of baseline characteristics, laboratory tests, arterial blood gases, PaO2/FiO2 values, and vital signs. Re-assessment after 24 h of starting treatment with either HFNCO or NIV showed significant improvement (P<0.01) in the respiratory rate, heart rate, and oxygenation parameters. The magnitude of improvement of the vital signs and oxygenation was not significantly different between patients using HFNCO or NIV. Success rate of HFNCO was 86.4%, endotracheal intubation with invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 10.81% of patients, and mortality rate was 2.7%.

METHODS: A young adult subsample (aged 18C25 years) was developed from the National Health Interview Survey, a nationally representative data set, pooling years 2016C2108. The medical vulnerability measure (yes vs. no) was developed, guided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention risk indicators. The estimates of medical vulnerability were developed for the full sample, the nonsmoking sample, and the individual risk indicators. Logistic regressions were conducted to examine differences by sex, race/ethnicity, income, and insurance. RESULTS: Medical vulnerability was 32% for the full sample and half that (16%) for the nonsmoking sample. Patterns and significance of some subgroup differences differed between the full and the nonsmoking sample. Male vulnerability was (33%) higher than female (30%; 95% CI: .7C.9) in the full sample, but lower in nonsmokers: male (14%) versus female (19%; 95% CI: 1.2C1.7). The white subgroup had higher vulnerability than Hispanic and Asian subgroups in both samplesfull sample: white (31%) versus Hispanic (24%; 95% CI: .6C.9) and Asian (18%; 95% CI: .4C.5); nonsmokers: white (17%) versus Hispanic (13%; 95% CI: .06C.9) and Asian (10%; 95% CI: .3C.8). CONCLUSIONS: Notably, lower young adult medical vulnerability within nonsmokers versus the full sample underscores the importance of smoking prevention and mitigation.","output":"Medical Vulnerability of Young Adults to Severe COVID-19 IllnessData From the National Health Interview Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The survival of cancer cells after detaching from the extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential for the metastatic cascade. The programmed cell death after detachment is known as anoikis, acting as a metastasis barrier. However, the most aggressive cancer cells escape anoikis and other cell death patterns to initiate the metastatic cascade. This study revealed the role of cell migration-inducing protein (CEMIP) in autophagy modulation and anoikis resistance during ECM detachment. CEMIP amplification during ECM detachment resulted in protective autophagy induction via a mechanism dependent on the dissociation of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)/Beclin1 complex. Additional investigation revealed that acting transcription factor 4 (ATF4) triggered CEMIP transcription and enhanced protein kinase C alpha (PKC) membrane translocation, which regulated the serine70 phosphorylation of Bcl-2, while the subsequent dissociation of the Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex led to autophagy. Therefore, CEMIP antagonization attenuated metastasis formation in vivo. In conclusion, inhibiting CEMIP-mediated protective autophagy may provide a therapeutic strategy for metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). This study delineates a novel role of CEMIP in anoikis resistance and provides new insight into seeking therapeutic strategies for metastatic PCa.","output":"ATF4/CEMIP/PKC promotes anoikis resistance by enhancing protective autophagy in prostate cancer cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our motivating application is a real-world problem: COVID-19 classification from CT imaging, for which we present an explainable Deep Learning approach based on a semi-supervised classification pipeline that employs variational autoencoders to extract efficient feature embedding.

Being an ophthalmologist himself, he has put the additional onus on us. The fact that the ocular manifestation could be the first presenting feature of novel coronavirus pneumonia should not be ignored and the possibility of spread of SARS-CoV-2 through the ocular secretions cannot be ruled out. However, with breakthroughs still evolving about this disease, the calls are now louder for closer examination on the pathogenesis of conjunctivitis associated with it. Hence, we conducted a scoping review of all available literature till date to fill in the potential gaps in currently available knowledge on ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in an attempt to establish continuity in the chain of information from December 2019 till April 2020. We also summarize a possible hypothesis on much less understood and highly debated topics on regard to the etiopathogenesis of ocular involvement in SARS-CoV-2 based on either presence or absence of ACE2 receptor in the ocular surface. Methods: We conducted a scoping review search of published and unpublished SARS-CoV-2-related English language articles from December 2019 till mid of April 2020 from the online databases. The findings were summarized using text, tables, diagrams, and flowcharts. Results: The commonest ocular manifestation in SARS-CoV-2 infection is follicular conjunctivitis and has been the first manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 3 reported cases till date. The ocular surface inoculated with the SARS-CoV-2 leads to the facilitation of the virus to the respiratory system via the lacrimal passage. RT-PCR analysis of the ocular secretions has shown the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides indicating the possibility of infection of ocular secretions. ACE2 receptors and its expression on the ocular mucosal surface are linked behind the etiopathogenesis of conjunctivitis. Conclusion: Conjunctivitis can be the presenting manifestation but may go unnoticed due to its mild nature. The ocular surface could serve as the entry gateway for the virus and ocular secretions could play a role in virus shed.

Identifying effective recruitment and retention strategies among minority groups and their subpopulations is an important research agenda. Web-based intervention approaches are becoming increasingly popular with the ubiquitous use of the internet. However, it is not completely clear which recruitment and retention strategies have been successful in web-based intervention trials targeting racial and ethnic minorities. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe lessons learned in recruiting and retaining one of the understudied ethnic minority womenKorean Americansenrolled in a web-based intervention trial and to compare our findings with the strategies reported in relevant published web-based intervention trials. METHODS: Multiple sources of data were used to address the objectives of this study, including the study teams meeting minutes, participant tracking and contact logs, survey reports, and postintervention interviews. In addition, an electronic search involving 2 databases (PubMed and CINAHL) was performed to identify published studies using web-based interventions. Qualitative analysis was then performed to identify common themes addressing recruitment and retention strategies across the trials using web-based intervention modalities. RESULTS: A total of 9 categories of recruitment and retention strategies emerged: authentic care; accommodation of time, place, and transportation; financial incentives; diversity among the study team; multiple, yet standardized modes of communication; mobilizing existing community relationships with efforts to build trust; prioritizing features of web-based intervention; combined use of web-based and direct recruitment; and self-directed web-based intervention with human support. Although all the studies included in the analysis combined multiple strategies, prioritizing features of web-based intervention or use of human support were particularly relevant for promoting recruitment and retention of racial and ethnic minorities in web-based intervention trials. CONCLUSIONS: The growing prevalence of internet use among racial and ethnic minority populations represents an excellent opportunity to design and deliver intervention programs via the internet. Future research should explore and compare successful recruitment and retention methods among race and ethnic groups for web-based interventions.

Whether COVID-19 mRNA vaccine can induce this complication in children is unknown. We aimed to assess the risk of hyper-inflammatory syndrome following COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in children. METHODS: We conducted a post-authorization national population-based surveillance using the French enhanced pharmacovigilance surveillance system for COVID-19 vaccines. All cases of suspected hyper-inflammatory syndrome following COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in 12C17-year-old children between June 15(th), 2021 and January 1(st), 2022, were reported. Cases were reviewed according to WHO criteria for MIS-C. The reporting rate of this syndrome was compared to the MIS-C rate per 1,000,000 12C17-year-old children infected by SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: Up to January 2022, 8,113,058 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine doses were administered to 4,079,234 12C17-year-old children. Among them, 12 presented a hyper-inflammatory syndrome with multisystemic involvement. Main clinical features included male predominance (10/12, 83%), cardiac involvement (10/12, 83%), digestive symptoms (10/12, 83%), coagulopathy (7/12, 58%), cytolytic hepatitis (6/12, 50%), and shock (5/12, 42%). 4/12 (33%) required intensive care unit transfer, and 3/12 (25%) hemodynamic support. All cases recovered. In eight cases, no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was found. The reporting rate was 1.5 (95%CI [0.8; 2.6]) per 1,000,000 doses injected, i.e. 2.9 (95%CI [1.5; 5.1]) per 1,000,000 12C17-year-old vaccinated children. As a comparison, 113 MIS-C (95%CI [95; 135]) occurred per 1,000,000 12C17-year-old children infected by SARS-CoV-2. INTERPRETATION: Very few cases of hyper-inflammatory syndrome with multi-organ involvement occurred following COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in 12C17-year-old children. The low reporting rate of this syndrome, compared to the rate of post-SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C in the same age-group, largely supports the vaccination in a context of an important circulation of SARS-CoV-2.

Intestinal epithelial cells are the primary target cells of TGEV. Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which is highly expressed in piglets with anemia, may play a role in TGEV infection. However, the underlying mechanism of TGEV invasion remains largely unknown. RESULTS: Our study investigated the possibility that TfR1 can serve as a receptor for TGEV infection and enables the invasion and replication of TGEV. We observed that TGEV infection promoted TfR1 internalization, clustering, and co-localization with TfR1 early in infection, while TfR1 expression was significantly down-regulated as TGEV infection proceeded. TGEV infection and replication were inhibited by occluding TfR1 with antibodies or by decreasing TfR1 expression. TGEV infection increased in TGEV-susceptible ST or IPEC-J2 cell lines and TGEV-resistant Caco-2 cells when porcine TfR1 was over-expressed. Finally, we found that the TGEV S1 protein interacts with the extracellular region of TfR1, and that pre-incubating TGEV with a protein fragment containing the extracellular region of TfR1 blocked viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that TfR1 is an additional receptor for TGEV and assists TGEV invasion and replication.

Governments are forced to define strict measures to avoid the spreading of the virus, which may further impose psychological burden for the majority of the population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychological distress in Austria during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: From 25 March to 3 April 2020, an anonymous online survey was conducted. Target group included all members of the Austrian population older than 16 years. The survey addressed the following areas (1) and sociodemographic data, (2) physical and mental health; (3) knowledge and concerns about COVID-19; (4) contact with infected people; (5) prevention efforts; (6) need for further information. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were used to assess mental health. Analyses were based on 4126 individuals (74% female, age: M = 38.68, SD = 13.36). RESULTS: 43.3% rated the psychological impact as moderate (5.6%) or severe (37.7%). 26.5% reported moderate (13.3%) to severe (13.2%) depression; 20.3% moderate (8.9%) to severe (11.4%) anxiety and 21.2% reported to suffer from moderate (10.5%) or severe stress (10.7%). Being female, higher age, lower levels of education, concern about family members, internet as main source of information, student or pupil status, poor self-rated health, and downplaying the seriousness of the problem were significantly associated with higher psychological burden. Protective factors were the possibility to work in home office, frequent (indirect) contact with family or friends, the availability of virus-specific information, confidence in the diagnosis capability, and physical activity during the crisis. CONCLUSION: This study is among the first in Europe on the psychological correlates of the COVID-19 pandemic. 37.7% of the Austrian study population reported a severe psychological impact on the event and 1 in 10 is considered to suffer from severe depression, anxiety or stress. The present findings inform about the identification of protective factors, psychologically vulnerable groups and may guide the development of psychological interventions.","output":"Psychological correlates of COVID-19 pandemic in the Austrian population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, as observed with the D614G spike protein mutant and, more recently, with B.1.1.7 (501Y.V1), B.1.351 (501Y.V2) and B.1.1.28.1 (P.1) lineages, represent a continuous threat and might lead to strains of higher infectivity and/or virulence.

In this study, a new perspective is proposed to assess the inhalation bioaccessibility of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in PM(2.5) for people with various lung health conditions. In vitro bioaccessibility (IVBA) was measured using modified epithelial lung fluids simulating the extracellular environment of patients with severe and mild lung inflammation. The average PAH IVBA in PM(2.5) of 24.5  4.52% under healthy conditions increased (p = 0.06) to 28.6  3.17% and significantly (p < 0.05) to 32.3  5.32% under mild and severe lung inflammation conditions. A mechanistic study showed that lung inflammation decreased the critical micelle concentrations of main pulmonary surfactants (i.e., from 67.8 (for dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine) and 53.3 mg/L (for bovine serum albumin) to 44.5 mg/L) and promoted the formation of micelles, which enhanced the solubilization and competitive desorption of PAHs from PM(2.5) in the lung fluids. In addition, risk assessment considering different IVBA values suggested that PAH contamination levels in PM(2.5), which were safe for healthy people, may not be acceptable for patients with lung inflammation. Because of the large number of COVID-19 infections, and the fact that some survivors of COVID-19 were observed to still show symptoms of interstitial lung inflammation, the finding here can provide important implications for both the scientific community and policy makers in addressing health risk and air pollution control during the COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"Inhalation Bioaccessibility of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in PM(2.5) under Various Lung Environments: Implications for Air Pollution Control during Coronavirus Disease-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mental health disorders are complex disorders of the nervous system characterized by a behavioral or mental pattern that causes significant distress or impairment of personal functioning.

One approach toward mitigating the medical and socio-economic effects of mental health disorders is leveraging the power of digital health technology to deploy assistive, preventative, and therapeutic solutions for people in need. We define digital mental health as any application of digital health technology for mental health assessment, support, prevention, and treatment.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the anxiety of secondary 1 and 2 students in Qubec, using data obtained before and during the pandemic. METHOD: Participants were 2990 French Canadian students in secondary 1 (grade 7) and secondary 2 (grade 8) in Qubec. Two independent samples completed the questionnaires, one sample before the pandemic (fall 2019) and one sample during the pandemic (fall 2020).

RESULTS: Results show that the pandemic has had variable impacts on the students mental health, with some of them reporting negative effects on their lives, others reporting no effect, and some reporting positive effect. However, the students surveyed during the pandemic generally reported more symptoms of generalized anxiety, and higher levels of test anxiety, fear of judgment and perfectionism than the ones surveyed before the pandemic.

Mean arterial pressure rose faster in WT male than WT female mice after Ang-[1-8] infusion. This sex difference was attenuated in ACE2 KO mice. Ang-[1-8] infusion reduced glomerular AT1R (angiotensin type 1 receptor) binding in WT female mice by 30%, and deletion of Ace2 abolished this effect.

Unfortunately, severe illness (eg, respiratory failure, compromised cardiac function, and shock) incurred by COVID-19 hinders the direct study of catecholamines in these patients, especially among those on multiple medications or those on adrenaline or noradrenaline infusions, or both. Phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) are tumours that secrete catecholamines, namely adrenaline and noradrenaline, often in excess. PPGL are well studied disease processes in which the effects of catecholamines are easily discernible and therefore their potential biochemical and physiological influences in patients with COVID-19 can be explored. Because catecholamines are expected to have a role in patients with critical illness, patients on vasopressor infusions, and patients who sustain some acute and chronic physical stresses, the challenges involved in the management of catecholamine excess states are directly relevant to the treatment of patients with COVID-19. In this Personal View, we discuss the complex interplay between catecholamines and COVID-19, and the management of catecholamine excess states, while referencing relevant insights derived from the study of PPGL.","output":"Catecholamine physiology and its implications in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the Spring of 2003, there was a huge interest in the global news media following the emergence of a new infectious disease: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). This study examines how this novel disease threat was depicted in the UK newspapers, using social representations theory and in particular existing work on social representations of HIV/AIDS and Ebola to analyse the meanings of the epidemic. It investigates the way that SARS was presented as a dangerous threat to the UK public, whilst almost immediately the threat was said to be contained using the mechanism of othering: SARS was said to be unlikely to personally affect the UK reader because the Chinese were so different to us; so other. In this sense, the SARS scare, despite the remarkable speed with which it was played out in the modern global news media, resonates with the meanings attributed to other epidemics of infectious diseases throughout history. Yet this study also highlights a number of differences in the social representations of SARS compared with earlier epidemics.

This is the first observational study to evaluate its impact on the orthopedic workload in a London level 1 trauma center (i.e., a major trauma center [MTC]) before (2019) and during (2020) the golden month post-COVID-19 lockdown. Patients and methods  We performed a longitudinal observational prevalence study of both acute orthopedic trauma referrals, operative and anesthetic casemix for the first golden month from March 17, 2020. We compared the data with the same period in 2019. Statistical analyses included median (median absolute deviation), risk and odds ratios, as well as Fishers exact test to calculate the statistical significance, set at p  0.05. Results  Acute trauma referrals in the post-COVID period were almost halved compared with 2019, with similar distribution between pediatric and adult patients, requiring a significant 19% more admissions (RR 1.3, OR 2.6, p = 0.003). Hip fractures and polytrauma cases accounted for an additional 11% of the modal number of injuries in 2020, but with 19% reduction in isolated limb injuries that were modal in 2019. Total operative cases fell by a third during the COVID-19 outbreak. There was a decrease of 14% (RR 0.85, OR 0.20, p = 0.006) in aerosol-generating anesthetic techniques used. Interpretation  The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a decline in the number of acute trauma referrals, admissions (but increased risk and odds ratio), operations, and aerosolizing anesthetic procedures since implementing social distancing and lockdown measures during the golden month.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthopedic trauma workload in a London level 1 trauma center: the golden month: The COVid Emergency Related Trauma and orthopaedics (COVERT) Collaborative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More than 70% of parents who responded to a national poll by a children's hospital in Chicago feel that the pandemic has taken a heavy toll on their child's mental health, with many of them feeling like the consequences will be greater for them than for adults.","output":"Report reveals increasing children's MH needs during COVID"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents results from a rapid-response industry-academia collaboration for virtual screening of chemical, natural and virtual drug ligands towards identifying potential therapeutics for COVID-19 Compared to resource-intensive traditional approaches of either conducting high- throughput screening in a lab or in-silico molecular dynamics simulations on supercomputers, we have developed an open- source framework that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately and quickly predict the binding potential of a drug ligand with a target protein We have trained a novel molecular-highway graph neural network architecture using the entirety of the BindingDB database to predict the probability of a drug ligand binding to a protein target Our approach achieves a prodigious 98 3% accuracy with its predictions Through this paper, we disseminate our source code and use the AI model to screen both public (ChEMBL, DrugBank) and proprietary databases Compared to other AI-based methods, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on the following metrics - (i) number of molecules currently undergoing active clinical trials, (ii) number of antiviral drugs correctly identified, (iii) accuracy despite not needing active-site priors, and (iv) ability to screen more compounds in unit time ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Deep Learning Predicts Protein-Ligand Interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe an extractionless real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (rRT-PCR) protocol for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 nucleic acid detection using heat as an accurate cost-effective high-capacity solution to COVID\\\\19 testing.

The Covid-19 takes a more severe course in individuals with chronic metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. This category of persons exhibits weak immune activity and decreased levels of endogenous antioxidants. Melatonin is a multifunctional signaling hormone synthesized and secreted primarily by the pineal gland. It is a potent antioxidant with immunomodulatory action and has remarkable anti-inflammatory effects under a variety of circumstances. Regarding Covid-19 and metabolic syndrome, adequate information about the relationship between these two comorbidities is required for better management of these patients. Since Covid-19 infection and complications involve severe inflammation and oxidative stress in people with obesity and diabetes, we anticipated the inclusion of melatonin, as powerful antioxidant, within proposed treatment protocols. In this context, melatonin is a potential and promising agent to help overcome Covid-19 infection and boost the immune system in healthy persons and obese and diabetic patients.

The main outcome was composite poor outcome which comprised of mortality and severe COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 in this study was defined as patients with COVID-19 that fulfill the criteria for severe CAP, including the need for intensive unit care or mechanical ventilation. The secondary outcome was susceptibility, based on cohort comparing COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative participants. RESULTS: There were a total of 290,455 patients from 12 studies in this meta-analysis. PPI use was associated with increased composite poor outcome (OR 1.85 [1.13, 3.03], p = 0.014; I2 90.26%).

These measures aim to protect people's health and, at the same time, impact their social lives. So far, it is little known how people evaluate those anti-Corona measures with regard to their social spheres (close family, wider family and friends, colleagues, and society). Furthermore, it is plausible that the subjective evaluation of attitudinal objects and especially severe events, like the COVID-19 pandemic and the related counter-measures, is multidimensional. Against this background, we combine the social spheres with the elements of the Theory of Planned Behavior. On the methodological basis of the Means-End Theory of Complex Cognitive Structures, we determine the perceived relevance and quality of the attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and social spheres regarding anti-Corona measures. Furthermore, the applied methodology allows the deduction of norm strategies to define the priority of securing or increasing the effectiveness of elements of anti-Corona measures. Based on the answers of 663 participants, we found that the protection from COVID-19 and its consequences (attitude) are more important to people than the practicability of anti-Corona measures in their social lives (perceived behavioral control), which, again, has a higher subjective relevance than the willingness to fulfill the expectations of others (subjective norm). Additionally, people distinguish between their close family (higher subjective relevance) and their other social spheres (lower subjective relevance). The people attribute the highest quality to the tips on hygiene, followed by the restrictions on outdoor activities and the tips for mental health. The protection and practicability of the anti-Corona measures have higher quality ratings than the willingness to fulfill the expectations of others. Based on the norm strategies, policymakers should secure the effectiveness of the current anti-Corona measures with a high priority by focusing on the protection and practicability with regard to close and wider family and friends. Increasing the effectiveness of the protection and practicability of anti-Corona measures in work and society also has a high priority.

The results showed that 39 cytokines from patients with FM were changed at admission. Among them, 8 cytokines returned to normal levels at discharge, including soluble ST2 (sST2), which showed the most marked dynamic changes from disease onset to resolution. Then, in a cohort of 76 patients with FM, 57 patients with acute hemodynamic dysfunction attributable to other causes, and 56 patients with non\\\\FM, receiver operating characteristic curve analyses suggested that plasma sST2 level was able to differentiate FM from non\\\\FM or other FM\\\\unrelated acute heart failure more robustly N\\\\terminal pro\\\\B\\\\type natriuretic peptide or cardiac troponin I.

METHODS: Prospective study of fully-vaccinated immunocompromised adults (solid organ transplant (SOT), hematologic malignancy, solid cancers, autoimmune conditions, HIV infection) versus non-immunocompromised healthcare-workers (HCW). The primary outcome was the proportion with a reactive test (seropositive) for IgG to SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain. Secondary outcomes were comparisons of antibody levels and their correlation with pseudovirus neutralization titers. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with seropositivity. RESULTS: 1271 participants enrolled: 1,099 immunocompromised and 172 HCW. Compared to HCW (92.4% seropositive), seropositivity was lower among participants with SOT (30.7%), hematological malignancies (50.0%), autoimmune conditions (79.1%), solid tumors (78.7%), and HIV (79.8%) (p<0.01). Factors associated with poor seropositivity included age, greater immunosuppression, time since vaccination, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, and vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer) or adenovirus vector vaccines versus mRNA-1273 (Moderna). mRNA-1273 was associated with higher antibody levels than BNT162b2 or adenovirus vector vaccines, after adjusting for time since vaccination, age, and underlying condition. Antibody levels were strongly correlated with pseudovirus neutralization titers (Spearman r=0.89, p<0.0001), but in seropositive participants with intermediate antibody levels, neutralization titers were significantly lower in immunocompromised individuals versus HCW. CONCLUSION: Antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccines were lowest among SOT and anti-CD20 monoclonal recipients, and recipients of vaccines other than mRNA-1273.

Responses highlighted problems in access particularly due to the reliance on a sole provider, regulatory issues and reimbursement, as well as issues of facilities and workforce particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Conclusion: Strategies to address access and availability of radiopharmaceuticals are outlined, to enable timely and equitable patient access to nuclear medicine procedures worldwide. In the face of disruptions to global supply chains by the COVID-19 outbreak, renewed focus on ensuring reliable supply of radiopharmaceuticals is a major priority for nuclear medicine practice globally.","output":"Global Issues of Radiopharmaceutical Access and Availability: a Nuclear Medicine Global Initiative Project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Retrochiasmatic craniopharyngiomas are challenging tumors to remove given their deep location and proximity to critical neurovascular structures.

In this paper, we propose a new method for automatic classification of movement disorders based on an open-access EEG dataset published by Anjun et al. in 2020 [4]. The dataset includes a total of 41 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and 41 control subjects. Control participants were demographically matched for age and sex with PD patients and did not differ in any measurements of education or premorbid intelligence. Additionally, EEG recordings from OFF medication sessions for 27 PD patients were recorded in the practically defined OFF levodopa period (12 h after the last dose of dopaminergic medication). Resting state EEG recordings were gathered under both eyes-open and eyes-closed at a sampling rate of 500 Hz on a 64-channel system and eye blinks were removed [5]. In the first step of our machine learning process, a connectivity matrix is created using three different approaches based on Granger causality, Pearson correlation and Spearman correlation. In a second step, these matrices are fed into a convolutional neural network that is tuned using random search, hyperband and Bayesian optimization. We will show that this approach can provide very accurate classification results for the given EEG data sets. Comparison with the traditional method considering raw EEG data shows that our method is more accurate, highlighting the importance of network topology in describing brain data [6].

The synthesis of N2O reflects the general chemistry and readily from a substrate Nitric oxide (NO) in the environment. The modeling of infectious disease dynamics covering common pathogen-transmission factors, for example intrinsic (or microbes nutrient supply) at a population level, is indeed imperative to curb the menace of any disease. Nonetheless, in areas where novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was at its worst, for example, Wuhan China, Mumbai India, Milan Italy, Washington USA etc., the reduction in N2O emissions was well noticed. Nonetheless, viruses exhibit greater mobility than humans and hijack nutrients including nitrogen to complete their epidemiological cycle all due to limited sequence space of viral genomes, the high probability of genetic drift, extremely large population sizes, the high mutation and recombination rates. In consequence of drastic fall in N2O emissions, lower human transport can not be an all alone contributor, but contrarily it may also be associated with coronavirus intrinsic factors.

The aim of this study was to assess whether aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) abnormalities at admission predict disease course in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Materials and methods: In this single-center retrospective study, data of 188 patients admitted to the Infectious Disease Unit of the Padova University Hospital between February and May 2020 were collected. Patients were considered to have transaminases abnormalities when AST, ALT or both were above the upper limit of normal (ULN). The disease was considered as severe in case of intensive care unit (ICU) patient admission or death. Results: At admission, 98 patients (52.1%) had abnormal transaminases, but only 12 patients (6.4%) showed levels above 3ULN. Patients with severe disease showed higher AST (50 [IQR, 37-77] vs. 30 [IQR, 24-43] U/L, p<0.0001) and a trend to higher ALT (32 [IQR, 20-56] vs. 25 [IQR, 18-39] U/L, p=0.07) levels.

All family routines and work-life arrangements were impacted. A major concern relates to how these measures impacted family and child well-being. Method: We use data from the Elfe Sapris survey, administered during the first lockdown to about 5,000 families participating to the Etude longitudinale francaise depuis l'enfance (Elfe), a nationally representative birth cohort of children born in 2011. We analysed correlations between parents' socioeconomic and living conditions on four relational indicators: the experience of lockdown, the quality of relationships between parents and children, and between siblings, and an indicator of children's socio-emotional well-being, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Results: The impact of the lockdown on family well-being was conditional on socioeconomic factors and their changes over the period. Deterioration of households' financial situation and having to work outside the home during lockdown was negatively correlated with family relationships and children's socio-emotional well-being.

The authors sought to determine the predictive value of the immunocompromised mouse model for fat grafting so that experiments could be standardized and optimized. METHODS Human lipoaspirate injections at different volumes and time points were assessed in a nude mouse model and compared with control injections of nonviable fat. Volume retention and explant histologic score were compared. In a separate study, interanimal reproducibility was determined by implanting a highly consistent hydrogel and measuring variability in volume retention. RESULTS Injection volume significantly affects adipose resorption kinetics at 6 and 12 weeks. Masson trichrome staining revealed that macrophages were unable to infiltrate large (1 ml) grafts, and oil cysts were not absorbed by 18 weeks, which interfered with interpretation of volume retention data. Nonviable tissue was resorbed when grafts were 0.3 ml, and quantification of graft histologic viability correlated well with graft retention at all study time points. Interanimal variability was measured to be 8.44 percent of the mean retention volume for small graft volumes. CONCLUSIONS Human fat graft retention in the immunodeficient mouse correlates with graft viability in small, 0.3-ml-volume grafts. However, centralized oil cysts in nonviable 1.0-ml grafts were not resorbed by 18 weeks and thus volume measurements were confounded and not significantly different from viable samples.

METHODS: Databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, Chinese Knowledge Resource Integrated Database and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry were searched on 20 March 2020. RESULTS: In total, 135 studies were included, involving severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, coronavirus disease 2019 and other coronaviruses. Most were case reports, case series and cohort studies of poor to fair quality.

The Government of India has deputed house-to-house survey teams to aid in identifying asymptomatic individuals and their susceptible contacts. We selected door-to-door survey teams of a COVID-19 red zone in western India and determined their infectioncontrol practices and anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobin G (IgG) status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-day prospective cross-sectional study was conducted by the Department of Microbiology of a tertiary care hospital of Jodhpur, in collaboration with the Rajasthan State Health Services. Participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire regarding personal protective equipment (PPE) use after written informed consent. Venous blood samples were collected and Kavach enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (J Mitra and Co.) was performed to determine anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG status. RESULTS: Out of the total 39 participants, IgG antibody was detected in four. Of them, three reported mild symptoms in the past. Out of two previously real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2-positive participants, only one had detectable IgG antibodies (Ab) in serum. Cloth mask was used by 24, N95 mask by 11, and surgical masks by four. CONCLUSION: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG Abs were detected among four members of house-to-house COVID-19 survey teams in Jodhpur. Most of the team members used cloth masks, whereas the Government of India guidelines has recommended triple-layered surgical masks as minimum essential PPE for healthcare workers in India.

The sensors range across a wide spectrum, acquiring input from non-contact audio-visual means to contact based input via pressure and temperature. The ambit of sensing can be extended further by imparting the body with increased non-contact sensing capability through the phenomenon of electrostatics. Here we present graphene-based tattoo sensor for proximity sensing, employing the principle of electrostatic gating. The sensor shows a remarkable change in resistance upon exposure to objects surrounded with static charge on them. Compared to prior work in this field, the sensor has demonstrated the highest recorded proximity detection range of 20 cm. It is ultra-thin, highly skin conformal and comes with a facile transfer process such that it can be tattooed on highly curvilinear rough substrates like the human skin, unlike other graphene-based proximity sensors reported before. Present work details the operation of wearable proximity sensor while exploring the effect of mounting body on the working mechanism. A possible role of the sensor as an alerting system against unwarranted contact with objects in public places especially during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has also been explored in the form of an LED bracelet whose color is controlled by the proximity sensor attached to it.","output":"Reduced Graphene Oxide Tattoo as Wearable Proximity Sensor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The risk of infection and death by COVID-19 could be associated with a heterogeneous distribution at a small area level of environmental, socioeconomic and demographic factors. Our objective was to investigate, at a small area level, whether long-term exposure to air pollutants increased the risk of COVID-19 incidence and death in Catalonia, Spain, controlling for socioeconomic and demographic factors. METHODS: We used a mixed longitudinal ecological design with the study population consisting of small areas in Catalonia for the period February 25 to May 16, 2020. We estimated Generalized Linear Mixed models in which we controlled for a wide range of observed and unobserved confounders as well as spatial and temporal dependence. RESULTS: We have found that long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and, to a lesser extent, to coarse particles (PM(10)) have been independent predictors of the spatial spread of COVID-19. For every 1 m/m(3) above the mean the risk of a positive test case increased by 2.7% (95% credibility interval, ICr: 0.8%, 4.7%) for NO(2) and 3.0% (95% ICr: -1.4%,7.44%) for PM(10). Regions with levels of NO(2) exposure in the third and fourth quartile had 28.8% and 35.7% greater risk of a death, respectively, than regions located in the first two quartiles. CONCLUSION: Although it is possible that there are biological mechanisms that explain, at least partially, the association between long-term exposure to air pollutants and COVID-19, we hypothesize that the spatial spread of COVID-19 in Catalonia is attributed to the different ease with which some people, the hosts of the virus, have infected others. That facility depends on the heterogeneous distribution at a small area level of variables such as population density, poor housing and the mobility of its residents, for which exposure to pollutants has been a surrogate.","output":"Effects of long-term exposure to air pollutants on the spatial spread of COVID-19 in Catalonia, Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a

advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) on rat bone-marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). METHODS Prepare and identify AGEs. BMSCs were isolated from 16 SD rats and cultured with different concentration of AGEs. Cell viability was detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). BMSCs were cultured with AGEs (0.25 mg/ml) for 30 min, 12 h, 24 h, 72 h and 120 h. In addition, BMSCs were cultured with AGEs, AGEs + JNK inhibitor and AGEs + P38 inhibitor for 24 h and 48 h, respectively. Western blotting and RT-PCR were used to determine the protein and mRNA expression levels, respectively. RESULTS Cell viability of BMSCs was significantly correlated with concentration and effect time of AGEs (P < 0.05), and the most appropriate concentration was 0.25 mg/ml. AGEs stimulation significantly increased the protein expression levels of NF-B p65, JNK, p38 (P < 0.05), decreased IB (P < 0.05), but had no effect on the protein expression of Akt in BMSCs (P > 0.05). At the mRNA level, JNK and p38 inhibitors significantly reduced the levels of NF-B p65, p38 and JNK, increased IB (P > 0.05), but had no effect on Akt in BMSCs (P > 0.05). At the protein level, JNK and p38 inhibitors notably decreased the expression of NF-B p65, p38, p-JNK, P-IB and JNK (P < 0.001), and increased IB (P < 0.05).

The history of prolonged use of corticosteroids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and associated comorbid conditions in these patients increases the possibility of infection with multidrug-resistant microbial strains. It may lead to a grave prognosis, hence appropriate microbiological evaluation and management at the earliest can have a better outcome. Methods A retrospective observational study was carried out among long COVID patients admitted to the Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India, a tertiary care hospital. Eighty-four patients admitted to the ICU or non-ICU ward in the hospital from April to October 2021 were included in the study. Antibiotics, as prescribed by our hospital antibiotic policy, were administered wherever required and were subsequently changed according to culture and sensitivity reports of the samples (sputum, endotracheal aspirates, or blood). An analysis of the antibiotic sensitivity patterns of the pathogens isolated was performed. The outcome after optimum medical management was assessed for survivors, discharge, or death. Results Out of the total of 84 patients, 41 samples (sputum, endotracheal aspirates or blood) were collected and sent for culture, of which 32 (78.1%) were found to be culture positive for pathogens. Among the pathogens isolated, there were 22 (69%) drug-resistant and 10 (31%) sensitive organisms. Among the 22 resistant pathogen isolates, 18 were Gram-negative species, the most common species being Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumanii; two were Gram-positive species, one each from Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, and three were Candida tropicalis. Of five deaths reported among 22 cases with resistant isolates, extensively drug-resistant (XDR), multi-drug resistance (MDR), and pan drug resistance (PDR) strains were detected in three, one, and one cases, respectively, and were harboured by K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumanii. Of the total eight deaths, there were two deaths among the 43 patients who received an empiric antibiotic in the wards, and six deaths were reported in the ICU. Despite raised biomarkers of inflammation, comorbid illnesses, renal impairment, and immunocompromised states, there was 91% survival and discharge, which was statistically significant (p-value = 0.00). Conclusion To conclude, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, A. baumanii, C. tropicalis, S. aureus, and E. faecalis were the most commonly isolated organisms among long COVID pneumonia cases, of which some were MDR, PDR and XDR strains. Early microbiological evaluation with targeted, proper antimicrobial usage along with optimized medical management and, wherever needed, critical care support in the ICU may lead to a better prognostic outcome in those groups of patients.","output":"The Microbial Profile and Resistance Pattern of Pathogens Isolated From Long COVID Pneumonia Patients and Their Correlation to Clinical Outcome: Our Experience From a Tertiary Care Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pooling together samples and testing the resulting mixture is gaining considerable interest as a potential method to markedly increase the rate of testing for SARS-CoV-2, given the resource limited conditions.

A uniform, informative system for naming IBV isolates would be very helpful. Furthermore, the desirability of a single naming system has become more important with the recent discoveries that coronaviruses with genome organizations and gene sequences very similar to those of IBV have been isolated from turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) and pheasants (Phasianus colchicus). To date, no genetic features have been found that are unique to turkey isolates and to pheasant isolates that would permit unequivocal differentiation from IBVs. Should the avian coronaviruses from turkeys, pheasants and other birds each be considered as distinct coronavirus species? Or should avian coronaviruses that have gene sequences similar to those of IBV be treated as host-range variants of IBV or, more objectively, as host-range variants of a species that might be called avian coronavirus (ACoV)? Clearly, the topic of avian coronavirus species differentiation requires debate. For the moment, a naming system for avian coronavirus isolates is overdue. Increasingly, papers will include data of coronaviruses isolated from more than one species of bird. It is desirable to have a nomenclature for avian coronaviruses that indicates the host species of origin. Furthermore, it would be helpful if the name of an isolate included the country/region of origin, an isolate number and the year of isolation. The names of avian paramyxovirus (APMV) and avian influenza virus (AIV) isolates have long since contained this information; I suggest that we adopt a similar convention for isolates of avian coronaviruses. For example, the D274 isolate of IBV could be named chicken/Netherlands/D274/78. Representatives of avian coronaviruses from turkey and pheasant would include turkey/United States(Nc)/NC95/95 and pheasant/UK/750/83. Two upper case letters would be used to denote country of isolation, whereas one upper and one lower case letter would be used to indicate state or province, e.g. Nc, North Carolina. The full-length names could be abbreviated, when desired, similar to the convention used for AIV isolates, e.g. chNL78, tyUS(Nc)95 and phUK83. If the serotype of an isolate has been clearly established, this might be included in the name at end, like the serotype designation of AIVs, e.g. chicken/China/NRZ/91 (Mass.) for the Chinese isolate of the Massachusetts serotype. This suggested naming system for isolates is essentially neutral with regard to whether viruses from different bird species should be considered as different coronavirus species or simply as variants of just one avian coronavirus species. In my opinion an informative nomenclature for avian coronavirus isolates is required now, to improve communication, and need not be delayed until a decision on the definition of coronavirus species has been made.","output":"A nomenclature for avian coronavirus isolates and the question of species status."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unique context of day-to-day living for people who are chronically homeless or living with housing insecurity puts them at high risk during community disasters.

We describe a case series of three patients each of whom tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal swab specimens and presented with pneumothorax. These patients were treated at the New York City Health and Hospitals (NYC H+H) system, a network of eleven hospitals in four different boroughs of New York City.

CT scans in these patients showed bilateral air space disease consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia and pneumothorax with other features including pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumatoceles. This may indicate the underlying pathogenesis of pneumothorax in these patients to involve inflammation-induced pulmonary parenchymal injury and necrosis with subsequent development of air leaks into the pleural cavity, a mechanism similar to that noted in patients during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003.

Cholesterol-depleted insect cells are highly resistant to alphavirus infection and were used to select srf-3, an SFV mutant that is approximately 100-fold less cholesterol dependent for infection due to a single amino acid change in the E1 spike subunit, proline 226 to serine. Sensitive lipid-mixing assays here demonstrated that the in vitro fusion of srf-3 and wild-type (wt) virus with cholesterol-containing liposomes had comparable kinetics, activation energies, and sphingolipid dependence. In contrast, srf-3 fusion with sterol-free liposomes was significantly more efficient than that of wt virus. Thus, the srf-3 mutation does not affect its general fusion properties with purified lipid bilayers but causes a marked and specific reduction in cholesterol dependence. Upon exposure to low pH, the E1 spike subunit undergoes distinct conformational changes, resulting in the exposure of an acid conformation-specific epitope and formation of an E1 homotrimer. These conformational changes were strongly cholesterol and sphingolipid dependent for wt SFV and strikingly less cholesterol dependent for srf-3.

However, the service capability of primary health institutions is not under the hierarchical medical system. Method: Data were collected from the China Health Statistics Yearbook between 2014 and 2020. PHIs included community health centres, community health stations, and township hospitals in our study. The service capability of primary health institutions was analysed from the perspective of structure, process, and results. Structure capability was evaluated using the number of beds, number of personnel, number of health technicians, and proportion of the number of personnel in PHIs accounting for the total number of health personnel. Process capability was evaluated using the number of general practitioners. The number of outpatients and inpatients, medical income, the proportion of drug income, and the average number of patients and beds served by physicians in PHIs per day were employed to evaluate the resulting capability. Results: From 2014 to 2020, the number of community health service centres/stations increased, while the number of township health centres decreased. In the aspect of structure capability, the total number of personnel and health technicians in community health centres/stations and township hospitals both increased during 2014 and 2020. However, the increasing rate in PHIs was a little bit less than that of general medical institutions. The proportion of male health technicians in community health centres and township hospitals both decreased, while the proportion of female technicians in both increased. From 2014 to 2020, the number of beds in PHIs also increased from 138.12  10(4) to 164.94  10(4). However, the proportion of beds in PHIs accounting for the total number of beds in medical institutions decreased. For the resulting capability, from 2014 to 2019, the proportion of diagnosis and treatment times in PHIs decreased from 57.41% to 51.96%, although it increased in 2020. The proportion of inpatients in PHIs decreased from 20.03% to 16.11%. From 2014 to 2020, the utilisation rate of hospital beds in PHIs decreased (from 55.6% to 34% for community health centres and 60.5% to 53.6% for township hospitals). The average daily bed days of doctors in township hospitals was higher than that of doctors in community health service centres. However, the average medical cost of outpatients and the per capita medical cost of inpatients in community health service centres were higher than in township hospitals. Conclusion: In recent years, although the service capability showed an increasing trend in PHIs, the growth rate was lower than the general health institutions. The utilisation rates of PHIs, including beds and physicians, were decreased. Among PHIs, the utilisation in township hospitals was higher than in community health centres with a relatively low price. Under the hierarchical medical system and normalisation period of the COVID-19 epidemic, it is important to improve the service capability to achieve its goal of increasing PHI utilisation and decreasing secondary and tertiary hospital utilisation.","output":"The Service Capability of Primary Health Institutions under the Hierarchical Medical System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic is part of the impact of what has been called the 'Anthropocene' or 'Capitalocene'.

The critical factor in containing this outbreak was early detection and complete assessment of movements and follow-up of patients, healthcare workers, and visitors who were contacts. Visitor records were important in helping identify exposed persons who could carry the infection into the community. In the three hospital outbreaks, three different containment strategies were used to contain spread of infection: closing an entire hospital, removing all potentially infected persons to a dedicated SARS hospital, and managing exposed persons in place. On the basis of this experience, if a nosocomial outbreak is detected late, a hospital may need to be closed in order to contain spread of the disease.

Orf9b is a unique accessory protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. It is implicated in immune evasion by targeting mitochondria, where it associates with the versatile adapter TOM70. Here, we determined the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 orf9b in complex with the cytosolic segment of human TOM70 to 2.2 ?. A central portion of orf9b occupies the deep pocket in the TOM70 C-terminal domain (CTD) and adopts a helical conformation strikingly different from the ?-sheet-rich structure of the orf9b homodimer. Interactions between orf9b and TOM70 CTD are primarily hydrophobic and distinct from the electrostatic interaction between the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) EEVD motif and the TOM70 N-terminal domain (NTD). Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we demonstrated that the orf9b dimer does not bind TOM70, but a synthetic peptide harboring a segment of orf9b (denoted C-peptide) binds TOM70 with nanomolar KD. While the interaction between C-peptide and TOM70 CTD is an endothermic process, the interaction between Hsp90 EEVD and TOM70 NTD is exothermic, which underscores the distinct binding mechanisms at NTD and CTD pockets. Strikingly, the binding affinity of Hsp90 EEVD motif to TOM70 NTD is reduced by ~29-fold when orf9b occupies the pocket of TOM70 CTD, supporting the hypothesis that orf9b allosterically inhibits the Hsp90/TOM70 interaction.

For HCV, the Italian Health Ministry planned a cohort screening for those born in 1969C1989. In order to update the epidemiological data of viral hepatitis in a highly endemic area of Southern Italy and assess whether the screening programs currently planned by the Italian government for those born between 1969C1989 will be effective, a retrospective multicenter study was carried out enrolling all COVID-19 hospitalized patients screened for markers of HCV and HBV infection. Indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in access to the national health system of an unselected population similar to the general one. Among the 2126 patients evaluated, HBsAg and HCV-Ab prevalence was 1.6% and 5.1%, respectively. For HCV infection, a bimodal distribution was observed, with peaks in the birth cohorts 1930C1939 and 1960C1969 (11.6% and 5.6%, respectively). An analysis of the screening period imposed (born: 1969C1989) demonstrates that only 17% of HCV infection could be captured. Thus, an alignment of the screening period (i.e., birth cohort 1960C1984) would capture 40% of cases. Data show a high endemicity of hepatitis virus in our geographic area and the need for a tailored regional screening program. ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic led to the hospitalization of an unselected population with the possibility to evaluate the epidemiology of viral hepatitis. Thus, a retrospective multicenter study was conducted in an area of Southern Italy with the aim of assessing the prevalence of HCV and HBV markers and the ability of current screening program to capture cases. We evaluated 2126 hospitalized patients in seven COVID Centers of Naples and Caserta area in which 70% of the Campania population lives. HBsAg and HCV-Ab prevalence was 1.6% and 5.1%, respectively, with no differences between gender. Decade distribution for birth year shows a bimodal trend of HCV prevalence, with a peak (11.6%) in the decade 1930C1939 and a second peak (5.6%) for those born in 1960C1969. An analysis of the screening period imposed by the Italian government for those born between 1969 and 1989 shows that only 17% of cases of HCV infection could be captured. A small alignment of the screening period, i.e., those born from 1960 to 1984, would capture 40% of cases. The data confirm the high endemicity of our geographical area for hepatitis virus infections and underline the need for a tailored screening program according to the regional epidemiology.","output":"Epidemiology of HCV and HBV in a High Endemic Area of Southern Italy: Opportunities from the COVID-19 PandemicStandardized National Screening or One Tailored to Local Epidemiology?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction As per the COVID-19 treatment guidelines of India, remdesivir and convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) are indicated in moderate and severe patients. In this study, we have evaluated the comparative safety and efficacy of remdesivir versus remdesivir CPT combination and effect of early versus late initiation of remdesivir. Materials and methods A hospital-based observational study was conducted among hospitalized moderate and severe COVID-19 patients treated with either remdesivir and/or CPT as per national guidelines. Response to therapy was evaluated in terms of mortality, mechanical ventilation requirement, ICU requirement, and safety. Results and observations A total of 95 moderate and severe COVID-19 patients on remdesivir (n=35) or remdesivir + CPT combination (n=60) were included. Both the remdesivir and remdesivir + CPT groups were comparable in terms of baseline characteristics, however, proportion of patients with baseline serum creatinine >1.5 was higher in the remdesivir group. No difference was seen between both the groups in terms of mortality, mechanical ventilation requirement, ICU requirement, and safety parameters in the overall moderate and severe COVID-19 populations and when each of these severity categories (moderate and severe) were analyzed separately. Early initiation (<9 days from symptom onset) of remdesivir was associated with better treatment outcome in terms of mortality and requirement of ICU. Post-therapy shortness of breath and LFTs (liver function tests) elevation was more in the late initiation of remdesivir group, which may be due to the lack of efficacy and subsequent disease progression or a direct effect of the drug. The beneficial effect of remdesivir was maintained even after adjustment for important prognostic factors and baseline imbalances (age, sex, disease severity, CPT use, and serum creatinine level).

Therefore, we investigated the association between hs-cTnT levels and the risk of incident CHD using a nested case-control study in a large Japanese cohort study. METHODS: The participants were residents of four Japanese communities in the Circulatory Risk in Communities Study (CIRCS). We obtained 120 cases (81 men and 39 women, aged 38-86 years at baseline) of first incident CHD and 240 controls matched by age, sex, communities, and blood sampling term. Serum hs-cTnT levels were measured using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay with stored sera collected between 2001 and 2011. The median period between sampling at survey and CHD incidence was 2.0 (interquartile range, 0.9-3.7) years. After adjusting for conventional risk factors, the multivariable odds ratios (ORs) of CHD were calculated using conditional logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: hs-cTnT ranged from  3 (assay detection limit) to 155 ng/L. Compared with the lowest quartile of hs-cTnT, multivariable ORs (95% confidence intervals) of CHD for the second, third, and highest quartiles were 1.30 (0.57-2.95), 2.48 (1.09-5.64), and 3.01 (1.27-7.12), respectively. Similar associations were observed after adjusting for estimated glomerular filtration, or after excluding matched groups, including people with chronic kidney disease.

One of the best ways to determine protection against the infection is to quantify the neutralizing activity of serum antibodies.

This study has developed a pseudoviral assay with replication-dependent reporter vectors that can accurately quantify the level of infection directly from the virus producing cell to the permissive target cell. Comparative analysis of cell-free and cell-to-cell infection revealed that the neutralizing activity of convalescent sera was more than tenfold lower in cell cocultures than in the cell-free mode of infection. As the pseudoviral system could not properly model the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, similar experiments were performed with replication-competent coronavirus, which detected nearly complete SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection resistance to neutralization by convalescent sera.

Here we report sequence analysis, structure predictions, and molecular modeling for seventy-nine Mpro variants, constituting all clinically observed mutations in this protein as of April 29, 2020. Residue substitution is widely distributed, with some tendency toward larger and more hydrophobic residues. Modeling and protein structure network analysis suggest differences in cohesion and active site flexibility, revealing patterns in viral evolution that have relevance for drug discovery.","output":"Sequence Characterization and Molecular Modeling of Clinically Relevant Variants of the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a diagnosis that is a true emergency.

To address this, recent studies have highlighted the utility of tongue swabs to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomic DNA in the oral epithelia of tuberculosis infected adults. It is unknown whether tongue swabs have similar utility for diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis and if the presence of DNA in these swabs was associated with whole bacilli. We therefore sought to conduct a preliminary assessment of the utility of tongue swabs to detect tubercle bacilli and their associated genetic material in young children. For this, we recruited hospitalized children with clinically diagnosed tuberculosis (n = 26) or lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI, n = 9). These categories were blinded for downstream laboratory tests, which included PCR, spoligotyping, smear microscopy, and culture. Mtb genomic DNA was detected by PCR only in clinically diagnosed TB cases [11/26 (31.4%)] and not in cases with LRTI. Of these, 5/11 [45.5%] were associated with a spoligotype. Spoligotyping also detected an additional six specimens that were negative by PCR. Using smear microscopy, 19/26 [73.1%] and 4/9 [44.4] were Mtb positive in the tuberculosis or LRTI categories respectively. We noted positive results on all three tests in 5/26 [19.2%] in the tuberculosis category and 0/9 in the LRTI category. All specimens were culture negative. Collectively, these preliminary data present a compelling case for broader testing of tongue swabs to diagnose tuberculosis in children where obtaining standard sputum specimens is not easy.","output":"Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex Bacilli and Nucleic Acids From Tongue Swabs in Young, Hospitalized Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, the first case of the coronavirus was reported, specifically in Wuhan, in China, and the virus began to spread very quickly until it reached more than 3 million cases around the world. But with the lack of technology and medical equipment and the existence of low health awareness in many countries, there is an intense research to combat with that massive problem. In this context, objective of this paper is to discover the spread of the virus according to the countries, by following what users around the world publish on social networking sites, especially on Twitter. In detail, we proposed an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based text classification model that depends on three main steps to discover approximate numbers of infects, by checking the symptoms that published within Twitter posts. A dataset publishing cases of infected and the accompanying symptoms of more than 112 k cases was considered and a model with Na?ve Bayes was trained through a comparative work with eight different classifiers. Na?ve Bayes is a transparent machine learning technique so it is easier to use probabilistic relations between inputs and the outputs to explain results.

Recurrent or prolonged seizures have long been known to permanently alter neuronal circuitry and to cause excitotoxic injury and aberrant inflammation. Furthermore, pathological changes in bioenergetics and metabolism are considered downstream consequences of epileptic seizures that begin at the synaptic level. However, as we highlight in this Review, evidence is also emerging that primary derangements in cellular or mitochondrial metabolism can result in seizure genesis and lead to spontaneous recurrent seizures. Basic and translational research indicates that the relationships between brain metabolism and epileptic seizures are complex and bidirectional, producing a vicious cycle that compounds the deleterious consequences of seizures. Metabolism-based treatments such as the high-fat, antiseizure ketogenic diet have become mainstream, and metabolic substrates and enzymes have become attractive molecular targets for seizure prevention and recovery. Moreover, given that metabolism is crucial for epigenetic as well as inflammatory changes, the idea that epileptogenesis can be both negatively and positively influenced by metabolic changes is rapidly gaining ground. Here, we review evidence that supports both pathophysiological and therapeutic roles for brain metabolism in epilepsy.","output":"The metabolic basis of epilepsy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after decannulation of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is not uncommon. Moreover, the impact of anticoagulation and potential risk factors is unclear. Furthermore, it is unclear if cannula-associated DVT is more common in ECLS patients compared to critically ill patients without ECLS. METHODS: All adult patients who were successfully weaned from ECLS and were screened for DVT following decannulation were included in this observational cohort study. The incidence of post-ECLS-DVT was assessed and cannula-associated DVT rate was compared with that of patients without ECLS after central venous catheter (CVC) removal. The correlation between level of anticoagulation, risk factors and post-ECLS-DVT was determined. RESULTS: We included 30 ECLS patients and 53 non-ECLS patients. DVT was found in 15 patients (50%) of which 10 patients had a DVT in a cannulated vein. No correlation between level of anticoagulation and DVT was found. V-V ECLS mode was the only independent risk factor for post-ECLS-DVT (OR 5.5; 95%CI 1.16-26.41). We found no difference between the ECLS and non-ECLS cohort regarding cannula-associated DVT rate (33% vs 32%). CONCLUSION: Post-ECLS-DVT is a common finding that occurs in half of all patients supported with ECLS. The incidence of cannula-associated DVT was equal to CVC-associated DVT in critically ill patients without ECLS.

Method: Negative sexual cognitions (NSC), positive sexual emotions (PSE) and negative sexual emotions (NSE) are assessed using a tool inspired by the Sexual Mode Questionnaire. Data are crossed with sociodemographic indicators, information on lockdown modalities, indices on sex life, information on psychological functioning and sexual satisfaction. Main Results: One third of the participants saw a decrease in the frequency of their sexual activities or in their sexual satisfaction. Changes in NSCs were found in 74.4% of subjects (increase: 38.4%; decrease: 36%). Emotional changes are found in between 50.7% (NSC: increase: 20.2%; decrease: 30.5 %) and 60.9% (PSE: increase: 24.6 %; decrease: 36.3%) of participants. The effect of lockdown on NSC, NSE, and PSE depends on gender at birth, intensity of depressive symptoms, and attachment styles. Women appear to be more vulnerable to lockdown than men. Insecure or depressed subjects also appear more vulnerable. The lockdown impact also depends on changes in the frequency of physical/digital intercourse during lockdown and the modalities of confinement.

The analysis estimates the marginal impact of each type and level of policy as implemented in concert with other policies. The purpose is to provide policymakers and the general public with an estimate of the relative effectiveness of various COVID-control strategies. We find that a set of widely implemented core policies reduces the spread of virus but not by enough to contain the pandemic except in a few highly compliant jurisdictions. The core policies include the cancellation of public events, restriction of gatherings to fewer than 100 people, recommendation to stay at home, recommended restrictions on internal movement, implementation of a partial international travel ban, and coordination of information campaigns. For the median jurisdiction, these policies reduce growth rate in new infections from an estimated 270% per week to approximately 49% per week, but this impact is insufficient to prevent eventual transmission throughout the population because containment occurs only when a jurisdiction reduces growth in COVID infection to below zero. Most jurisdictions must also implement additional policies, each of which has the potential to reduce weekly COVID growth rate by 10 percentage points or more.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the level of real-life SCIT compliance in pediatric patients and the associated factors. Additional aims were to determine how SCIT compliance was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and why some patients dropped out SCIT. METHOD: Pediatric patients diagnosed with allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, or venom allergy that received SCIT between September 2012 and July 2020 were analyzed. RESULTS: The study included 201 children (66.7% male) with a median (interquartile range) age of 12.8 years (9.4-15.2) at the time of the first SCIT injection. The overall compliance rate before COVID-19 pandemic was 86.1%. Short SCIT follow-up time and venom anaphylaxis were found to be risk factors for drop out. The leading causes of drop outs were moving to another city/country (32.1%), symptom improvement (17.8%), treatment ineffectiveness (14.2%), and adverse reactions (14.2%). Among the 108 patients that were still receiving SCIT during the COVID-19 pandemic, 31 (28.7%) dropped out the therapy. The most frequent reasons for drop-out were fear of being infected with COVID-19 (35.4%) and thinking that the AIT practise stopped due to COVID-19 pandemic (29%). Male gender and older age were found to be the independent risk factors for drop-out of SCIT. CONCLUSIONS: Real life compliance in children was found 13.9% and it was higher than adults.

Cytokines and chemokines are produced to amplify the local inflammatory process followed by the migration of immune cells to the regional lymph nodes where adaptive immune response is initiated. Systemic inflammation enhances the biological response to mobilize additional cells from central and peripheral immune/hematopoietic system. Local mechanisms to limit inflammation are initiated and lead to healing. During the normal inflammatory process, there is a balance between the production of inflammatory chemokines/cytokines such as Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1 and the production of compounds that limit inflammation and have an immune suppressive effect, such as IL-10 and Transforming Factor (TGF) . IL-6 and IL-6/soluble IL-6 Receptor (R) complex stimulate liver cells to produce inflammatory proteins, which represents the systemic inflammation response. The magnitude and the duration of the systemic inflammatory response are linked to the cause, under genetic and epigenetic control. Significant inflammation as seen in septic shock, in severe forms of infections or in certain active cancers, represents the bad inflammation, correlated with a poor prognosis. In addition, the persistence of a chronic smoldering inflammation may lead to pathological situations which are observed in the majority of inflammatory, degenerative, dysmetabolic, or dysimmune diseases and cancer. Chronic smoldering inflammation is a cross between different pathological situations possibly linked. In addition, within the tumor microenvironment, inflammatory process results from different cellular mechanisms modulated by metabolic and vascular changes. On the contrary, a limited and balanced inflammation initiates the normal immune response, including the adaptive response which amplifies any immunotherapy, including vaccines.

Yet the role of prisons as reservoirs of M. tuberculosis, propagating epidemics through spillover to surrounding communities, has been difficult to measure directly. METHODS: To quantify the role of prisons in driving wider community M. tuberculosis transmission, we conducted prospective genomic surveillance in Central West Brazil from 2014 to 2019. We whole genome sequenced 1152 M. tuberculosis isolates collected during active and passive surveillance inside and outside prisons and linked genomes to detailed incarceration histories. We applied multiple phylogenetic and genomic clustering approaches and inferred timed transmission trees. FINDINGS: M. tuberculosis sequences from incarcerated and non-incarcerated people were closely related in a maximum likelihood phylogeny. The majority (70.8%; 46/65) of genomic clusters including people with no incarceration history also included individuals with a recent history of incarceration. Among cases in individuals with no incarceration history, 50.6% (162/320) were in clusters that included individuals with recent incarceration history, suggesting that transmission chains often span prisons and communities. We identified a minimum of 18 highly probable spillover events, M. tuberculosis transmission from people with a recent incarceration history to people with no prior history of incarceration, occurring in the states four largest cities and across sampling years. We additionally found that frequent transfers of people between the states prisons creates a highly connected prison network that likely disseminates M. tuberculosis across the state. INTERPRETATION: We developed a framework for measuring spillover from high-incidence environments to surrounding communities by integrating genomic and spatial information. Our findings indicate that, in this setting, prisons serve not only as disease reservoirs, but also disseminate M. tuberculosis across highly connected prison networks, both amplifying and propagating M. tuberculosis risk in surrounding communities.

In chronic wounds, bacterial colonization is associated with impaired healing. Cold atmospheric plasma is an innovative promising tool to deal with these problems. Objectives The 5\\\\min argon plasma treatment has already demonstrated efficacy in reducing bacterial numbers in chronic infected wounds in vivo. In this study we investigated a 2\\\\min plasma treatment with the same device and the next\\\\generation device, to assess safety and reduction in bacterial load, regardless of the kind of bacteria and their resistance level in chronic wounds. Methods Twenty\\\\four patients with chronic infected wounds were treated in a prospective randomized controlled phase II study with 2 min of cold atmospheric argon plasma every day: 14 with MicroPlaSter alpha device, 10 with MicroPlaSter beta device (next\\\\generation device) in addition to standard wound care. The patient acted as his/her own control. Bacterial species were detected by standard bacterial swabs and bacterial load by semiquantitative count on nitrocellulose filters. The plasma settings were the same as in the previous phase II study in which wounds were exposed for 5 min to argon plasma. Results Analysis of 70 treatments in 14 patients with the MicroPlaSter alpha device revealed a significant (40%, P < 0016) reduction in bacterial load in plasma\\\\treated wounds, regardless of the species of bacteria. Analysis of 137 treatments in 10 patients with the MicroPlaSter beta device showed a highly significant reduction (235%, P < 0008) in bacterial load.

The aim of this study was to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies against COVID-19 in breast milk and serum of lactating mothers post vaccination and to establish a correlation between both. Methods: Hundred and eighty lactating mothers were included in this cross sectional cohort study conducted at Rehman Medical Institute, Peshawar. We described the immunogenicity 21 days after the booster dose of vaccine in 21 patients. Breast Milk and serum specimens were collected and investigated for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies by consuming electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S Roche, Switzerland). Results: One-hundred percent of patients revealed robust positive findings to SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins antibodies in breast milk and 85 percent in serum, i.e., >0.8 IU/mL.

In the Netherlands, 69 out of 127 mink farms were infected with SARS-CoV-2 between April and November 2020 and all mink on infected farms were culled after SARS-CoV-2 infection to prevent further spread of the virus. On some farms, (feral) cats and dogs were present. This study provides insight into the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 positive cats and dogs in ten infected mink farms and their possible role in transmission of the virus. Throat and rectal swabs of 101 cats (12 domestic and 89 feral cats) and 13 dogs of ten farms were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using PCR. Serological assays were performed on serum samples from 62 adult cats and all 13 dogs. Whole Genome Sequencing was performed on one cat sample. Cat-to-mink transmission parameters were estimated using data from all ten farms. This study shows evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in twelve feral cats and two dogs. Eleven cats (19%) and two dogs (15%) tested serologically positive. Three feral cats (3%) and one dog (8%) tested PCR-positive. The sequence generated from the cat throat swab clustered with mink sequences from the same farm. The calculated rate of mink-to-cat transmission showed that cats on average had a chance of 12% (95%CI 10% to 18%) of becoming infected by mink, assuming no cat-to-cat transmission. As only feral cats were infected it is most likely that infections in cats were initiated by mink, not by humans. Whether both dogs were infected by mink or humans remains inconclusive.

Integrating a CRISPRCCas system after nucleic acid amplification improves detection specificity due to RNA-guided recognition of specific sequences of amplicons. Incorporating CRISPRCCas before nucleic acid amplification enables enrichment of rare and low-abundance nucleic acid targets and depletion of unwanted abundant nucleic acids. Unwinding of dsDNA to ssDNA using CRISPRCCas9 at a moderate temperature facilitates techniques for achieving isothermal exponential amplification of nucleic acids. A combination of CRISPRCCas systems with functional nucleic acids (FNAs) and molecular translators enables the detection of non-nucleic acid targets, such as proteins, metal ions, and small molecules.

We compared the duodenal tube test (DTT) with hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HS) for their efficiency in detecting bile secretion. METHODS The subjects of this retrospective study were 47 infants who underwent both DTT and HS to diagnose or exclude BA between January 2000 and March 2018. RESULTS BA was diagnosed in 32 of the 47 patients, and 7 of the remaining 15 non-BA patients underwent intraoperative cholangiography. Among the various DTT parameters, the total bile acid in duodenal fluid (DF-TBA)/serum (S) gamma-glutamyl transferase (GTP) ratio was found to be the most specific for BA, with sensitivity and specificity of 98.0-100%, respectively. One BA patient in whom cut off values were not met was a premature infant. The sensitivity and specificity of HS were 100-56.3%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of the DF-TBA/S-GTP parameter was higher than that of HS (98.6% vs. 85.1%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The DTT could be more a specific method than HS to detect bile excretion. Thus, the DTT should be incorporated into the multidisciplinary diagnostic approach for the differential diagnosis of BA to prevent unnecessary intraoperative cholangiography in patients who do not have BA.","output":"The duodenal tube test is more specific than hepatobiliary scintigraphy for identifying bile excretion in the differential diagnosis of biliary atresia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Knowledge about COVID-19 in children is limited due to the paucity of reported data.

METHODS Four different electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CENTRAL) were searched for articles related to COVID-19 in the pediatric population. We included studies reporting disease characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients aged less than 19 years. We performed a random-effect meta-analysis to provide pooled estimates of various disease characteristics. RESULTS 27 studies (4857 patients) fulfilling the eligibility criteria were included in this systematic review, from a total of 883 records.

Moreover, this study showed a limited involvement of physiotherapists inside the very acute and intense settings. In conclusion, this work revealed that, during COVID-19 pandemic, in the Lombardy region a small percentage of physiotherapists was employed in COVID-19 wards, mainly in post-acute context.

METHODS: We conducted logistic regression analyses to investigate whether knowledge of restrictions, confidence in knowledge of restrictions, motivation to adhere to restrictions, and self-reported behaviour were associated with personal characteristics and tier. RESULTS: Between 81% (tier 2) and 89% (tier 3) of participants correctly identified which tier they lived in. Knowledge of specific restrictions was variable. 73% were confident that they understood which tier was in place in their local area, whereas 71% were confident they understood the guidance in their local area. Confidence was associated with being older and living in a less deprived area. 73% were motivated to adhere to restrictions in their local area. Motivation was associated with being female and older. People living in tiers with greater restrictions were less likely to report going out to meet people from another household socially; reported rates of going out for exercise and for work did not differ. CONCLUSIONS: Although recognition of local tier level was high, knowledge of specific guidance for tiers was variable.

There is also a growing concern of mutations in the virus that demand effective strategies to combat infection. SARS-CoV-2 infects cells via its surface Spike glycoprotein (SgP), a homo-trimeric assembly of S1 and S2 subunits, that binds to cell surface angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), thereby gaining viral entry. SgP also utilizes the cell surface bound heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) to enhance the efficiency of viral entry. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit interacts with both the ACE2 receptor as well as the heparan sulfate (HS) chains of HSPGs. HS is a type of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) that has been recognized as a crucial factor in the infectivity of numerous viruses. Our early work suggested that of the numerous structural possibilities, 3-O-sulfated (3-OS) sequences of HS may be involved in better recognition of SgP (bioRxiv (2020) DOI:10.1101/2020.10.08.331751). Large-scale computational analysis based on our in-house developed genetic algorithm-based dual filtering strategy indicated that HS more favorably interacts with the RBD compared to other electropositive regions in the SgP trimer. The results suggested that the RBD of SgP prefers to recognize optimal three-dimensional factors governed by chain length and sulfation pattern of HS sequences. Microarray screening of 24 distinct HS sequences against the S1 and RBD domains resulted in only eight sequences displaying reasonable affinity for the RBD, which were significantly weaker for the S1 subunit. Of these, two containing 3-O?S sequences exhibited some of the highest signals on the array. Competition studies using the same microarray in the presence of fondaparinux (a 3-OS-containing pentasaccharide) and HS06 (a non-3-OS variant of a HS hexasaccharide) led to the observation that HS06 is a more efficient competitor than fondaparinux. Advanced computational experiments indicated that RBD tends to bind more effectively with 3-OS-containing HS chains when more than one 3-OS groups is present. In conclusion, our work provides additional insight into the structural requirements within HS for mediating efficient viral entry, while also offering new avenues for developing potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Heparan Sulfate Microarray Lends Insight into Selective Binding of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many countries made changes to the routine management of patients with non-communicable diseases, including neurocognitive disorders Therefore, many \\"so-called\\" non-urgent elective procedures and outpatient appointments have been canceled or postponed, possibly impacting negatively on health and well-being of patients in the short- and long-term Aim: Here, we aimed at describing numbers and types of outpatient appointments canceled as a result of government's restrictive measures in our memory clinic Methods: The scheduled appointments at the memory clinic of the Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS, Rome, Italy, are recorded in a comprehensive dataset under strict administrative control Here, we compared appointments (first-time and follow-up) that were canceled from January to April 2020 with those of the corresponding months in 2019 Results: We observed a substantial decrease in appointments during 2020 The majority of scheduled appointments were follow-up, and about a quarter were first-time appointments We estimated that 66 7% and 77 4% of patients missed out respectively their first and follow-up appointments in our memory clinic due to government's restrictive measures in March-April 2020 Conclusions: A large number of patients with neurocognitive disorders missed crucial appointments due to government's restrictive measures, and many experienced a delay in initial diagnosis and initiation of treatment This has relevant impact on their treatment and consequently has (is still having and potentially will have) an increase on the healthcare service burden of clinics Furthermore, as a second wave of COVID-19 affects Europe, and with winter approaching, it is a compelling priority to ensure easy and rapid access to appropriate assessment, care and treatment in the event of a new outbreak and potential subsequent lockdowns, with particular attention to the development of specific healthcare technologies customized to older persons with cognitive impairment","output":"Effects of COVID-19 Infection Control Measures on Appointment Cancelation in an Italian Outpatient Memory Clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The team at Cityblock Health is building, expanding, and regularly updating its rules-based, adaptable model to identify Covid-19 patients at highest risk.

DESIGN: Prospective interventional study. SETTING: Three university hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one gynaecological cancer survivors with dyspareunia. INTERVENTION: The treatment consisted of 12 weekly sessions of physiotherapy combining education, pelvic floor muscle exercises with biofeedback, manual therapy and home exercises. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Women were assessed at baseline and post-treatment. Pelvic floor morphometry was evaluated at rest and on maximal contraction by measuring bladder neck position, anorectal and levator plate angles as well as levator hiatal dimensions with three-dimensional/four-dimensional transperineal ultrasound imaging. Pelvic floor muscle function was evaluated by measuring passive forces (muscle tone measure), flexibility, stiffness, strength, coordination and endurance with an intra-vaginal dynamometric speculum. RESULTS: Significant changes in pelvic floor morphometry and muscle function were found post-treatment. The parameters assessing the changes from rest to maximal contraction significantly improved (e.g., mean change of levator hiatal area narrowing 14%, 95% CI 11-18, Cohen's d effect size 1.48)), supporting the hypothesis of decreased muscle tone and improved muscle contractility following treatment. Women also presented with a significant decrease in tone (mean change -0.4N, 95% CI -0.7 to -0.1, Cohen's d effect size 0.57) and stiffness (mean change -0.1N/mm, 95% CI -0.2 to -0.1, Cohen's d effect size 0.59), as well as significant improvements in flexibility (mean change 9.0mm, 95% CI 5.8-12.2, Cohen's d effect size 1.08), coordination (mean change 3 rapid contractions, 95% CI 2-4, Cohen's d effect size 0.85) and endurance (mean change 683%*s, 95% CI 388-978, Cohen's d effect size 0.90). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest significant improvements in pelvic floor morphometry and muscle function after a multimodal physiotherapy treatment in gynaecological cancer survivors with dyspareunia.

The global disease burden of ROCM has increased significantly following the surge in cases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Endoscopic sinus debridement, systemic antifungal therapy, and control of the underlying immunosuppressive condition are essential for the management of ROCM. Orbital involvement, however, presents a challenge to clinicians. Intervention strategies that have been described to treat orbital disease include orbital exenteration, conservative orbital debridement with or without irrigation with amphotericin B and transcutaneous retrobulbar injection of amphotericin B (TRAMB). Currently, there is a lack of clarity regarding the indications and outcomes of TRAMB as a treatment modality. In this review, the drug formulations used, the complications, and outcomes of previously described cases that have used TRAMB in cases of ROCM are discussed. Favorable outcomes following TRAMB depend on appropriate patient selection and radiological evidence of the orbital burden of the disease. This review aims to familiarize clinicians with objective parameters for patient selection for TRAMB, namely the extent of the disease, the clinical features, and radiological findings; viz. the clinical interpretation of areas of contrast uptake and those of necrosis. TRAMB can be considered as a viable option in select cases of orbital mucormycosis where exenteration or debridement are not indicated, or when there is limited orbital disease.","output":"Transcutaneous retrobulbar injection of amphotericin B in rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis: a review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We discussed anthroponotic cutaneous leishmania transmission in this article, due to its large effect on the community in the recent years.

We established T cell lines specific for the truncated N protein fragments and tested their potential to mediate protection by transfer experiments. Only the T cell line C4-N and the T cell line specific for the full-length N protein were protective. By contrast, all truncated N protein fragments elicited a humoral immune response and contained antigenic sites recognized by antibodies from diseased rats.","output":"An immunodominant CD4+ T cell site on the nucleocapsid protein of murine coronavirus contributes to protection against encephalomyelitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) has disproportionately impacted the African American community. This study aims to identify the risk factors for severe COVID\\\\19 disease in African American patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective cross\\\\sectional analysis of African American patients with COVID\\\\19 treated between March 12 and April 9, 2020, at a single tertiary center. The primary outcome of interest was severe disease defined as those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: The study included 158 consecutive patients. The mean age was 57 years, and 61% were women. The mean (SD) of BMI was 33.2 (8.6) kg/m(2). Overall, patients admitted to the ICU were older (62 vs. 55 years, P = 0.003) and had higher BMI (36.5 kg/m(2) vs. 31.9 kg/m(2), P = 0.002).

Overall, 1124 Italian university students completed a self-report questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive and correlational analyses. Results showed that 22.3% of participants were flourishing, and levels of mental well-being appeared in line with normative values in young Italian adults; levels of academic stress were not significantly higher than those found in other student samples before the COVID-19 outbreak. Students with high levels of information seeking presented higher levels of well-being and risk perception.

Its use in Western countries is still debated owing to concerns about its oncologic equivalence to open gastrectomy (OG). We sought to review and compare their operative outcomes and oncologic specimen quality (number of harvested lymph nodes and surgical margins) for gastric adenocarcinoma (GA). METHODS We reviewed the charts of all patients undergoing LAG (2007-2010) and OG (2000-2010) for GA in a single institution. Several surgeons performed the OGs, whereas 1 fellowship-trained laparoscopic surgeon performed LAGs. The primary outcome was quality of the surgical specimen, assessed by the number of harvested lymph nodes (LNs) and margin status. Secondary outcomes were perioperative events. Data were analyzed as intention to treat. RESULTS We retrieved 60 cases (47 OGs, 13 LAGs). The conversion rate was 23%. Mean operative time was 115 minutes longer and blood loss was 425 mL less (both p < 0.001) for LAGs. A mean of 14.4 (standard deviation [SD] 9.8) and 11.2 (SD 8.2) LNs were harvested for OGs and LAGs, respectively (p = 0.29). Negative margins were achieved for all patients. Mean length of stay was similar (LAG: 19 d v. OG: 18.9 d; p = 0.91). The groups did not differ on major postoperative complications (12.7% v. 23.1%; p = 0.39) or operative mortality (2.1% v. 7.7%; p = 0.32). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic assisted gastrectomy is a challenging but safe and feasible procedure in experienced hands. It offers the same radical resection as OG regarding negative margins and LN retrieval.

Interestingly, it appears to be a disease that predominantly affects adults while the mortality in children is extremely low. However, the pathogenesis of SARS in relation to different characteristics relevant to age remains unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To better understand the role of cytokines in the immunopathological processes of SARS, weanling (4 weeks old), young (6 weeks old) and adult (10 weeks old) male BALB/C mice were inoculated intranasally with N-protein of SARS-CoV in this study. Serum or lung homogenate levels of some cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and interferon- (IFN-) along with acute injury lung index and histology were also analyzed. RESULTS: Histopathological analysis of adult male BALB/C mice after N-protein infection showed progressive inflammatory reactions, especially pulmonary edema, in accordance with a moderately (~13%) elevated level of W/D ratio at 24 h. Although adult groups underwent a progressive lung inflammation in the acute phase accompanied by raised levels of TNF- in serum, no significant changes in lung TNF- level were reported simultaneously. Moreover, adult SARS infected BALB/c mice showed elevated levels of IFN- while IFN- levels in weanling and young groups had no obvious association with lung inflammation. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the observation that adult mice do have progressively greater immune reactions than weanling and adolescent ones over time. The relative immaturity of the immune system in weanlings may confer benefit leading to less impairment of lung function. However, the measurement of TNF- and IFN- levels was not indicative of the severity of lung injury at the early stage of disease.","output":"Differential characteristics of the early stage of lung inflammation induced by SARS-CoV Nucleocapsid protein related to age in the mouse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is effective against helminths and numerous microorganisms, including bacteria and viruses.

There are currently several ongoing clinical trials mainly in the USA and Brazil involving NTZ due not only to the in vitro results, but also for its long-known safety. Here, we study the response of Vero cells to TIZ treatment and unveil possible mechanisms for its antimicrobial effect, using a label-free proteomic approach (LC/MS/MS) analysis to compare the proteomic profile between untreated- and TIZ-treated cells. Fifteen differentially expressed proteins were observed related to various biological processes, including translation, intracellular trafficking, RNA processing and modification, and signal transduction. The broad antimicrobial range of TIZ points towards its overall effect in lowering cell metabolism and RNA processing and modification.

Thirty-six undergraduates underwent a S1-S2 paradigm, with emotional faces and pictures as S1s and S2s, respectively. Contextual uncertainty was manipulated across three blocks, each with 100%, 75%, or 50% S1-S2 emotional congruency.

BTK inhibitors, as well as the U2 combination (anti-CD20 mAb ublituximab + the PI3K-CK1? inhibitor umbralisib), are highly efficacious in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), each of which have been previously demonstrated to be superior over standard chemoimmunotherapy. Treatment with a more selective BTK inhibitor could result in improved efficacy and safety outcomes compared with ibrutinib (ALPINE study, EHA 2021), and we hypothesized that dual blockade of the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway through combination of TG-1701 with U2 may confer greater depth of response compared to either regimen alone. Methods: Patients with CLL and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) were enrolled in an ongoing Phase 1 study. After characterizing the safety profile of TG-1701 monotherapy, a parallel dose escalation arm of TG-1701+U2 was implemented. Select dose levels of TG-1701 monotherapy and TG-1701+U2 were also expanded. All patients were treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or investigator/patient decision to withdraw. Safety was evaluated in all treated patients, and efficacy was evaluated in all treated patients who had at least 1 post-baseline assessment. TG-1701 monotherapy data were previously presented;herein we present data from the TG-1701+U2 dose escalation/expansion and the TG-1701 monotherapy CLL expansion cohorts Results: As of July 2021, 142 patients were treated with TG-1701, 36 of whom were enrolled in the TG-1701+U2 arm. The median # of prior therapies across all treated patients was 1 (range, 0-10) and all patients were BTKi-na?ve. Among the 36 patients treated with U2+1701, 19 were evaluable for efficacy and safety (17 too early to evaluate). The median age was 69 years (range 47-81), and 56% were male. TG-1701+U2 was well tolerated at 4 different dose levels without dose-limiting toxicities. The most common (>30%) all-causality, all grade treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were diarrhea (53%) contusion (42%), nausea (37%), hypertension, ALT/AST increase, and fatigue (all 32% each) with TG-1701+U2. Grade 3/4 AEs >15% were limited to ALT/AST increase (21%). Dose reduction occurred in 1 patient due to an AE, and 4 patients discontinued at least 1 study drug due to an AE: 2 discontinued umbralisib, 1 discontinued umbralisib and TG-1701, and 1 discontinued all 3 agents. At the data cut-off, overall response rate (ORR) was 84% (4 CR and 12 PR) among 19 evaluable patients, with remaining patients awaiting post-baseline assessment. In the monotherapy CLL-specific cohorts (200 mg QD, n=20;and 300 mg QD, n=20), 40 pts were evaluable for safety, and 39 for efficacy (1 pt withdrew due to COVID prior to first response assessment). The median age was 71 (range 49-86), and 43% were male. The most common TEAEs were increased ALT/AST (all grades: 18%;grade 3: 3%), followed by diarrhea (all grades: 15%;grade 3: none), and neutropenia (all grades: 13%;grades 3: 13%). There were no cases of atrial fibrillation, major bleeding, or ventricular tachyarrhythmia in the CLL cohorts at a median follow-up of 12.8 months (range 2.5 - 20.8). TEAEs leading to TG-1701 dose reduction occurred in 1 (3%) patient. No patients in the 200 mg or 300 mg CLL cohorts have discontinued due to AEs. In patients with anemia and thrombocytopenia at baseline, sustained improvement in hematologic variables was observed. The ORR among 39 patients was 97% (all PR/PR-L). Lymphocytosis resolved to normal value or <50% of baseline in 69% (24 of 35 of patients with lymphocytosis). Consistent response rates were observed across all subgroups, including the following high-risk genomic features: del17p/TP53 mutations, unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region (IGHV), and complex karyotype (defined as 3 cytogenetic abnormalities). The median duration of response has not been reached in either cohort. Best change in tumor burden from baseline in patients with CLL is presented in Figure 1. C nclusions: TG-1701 exhibits an encouraging safety and efficacy profile as monotherapy in patients with CLL and additionally shows promising activity and a manageable tolerability profile in combination with U2.

CDC examined the changing age distribution of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States during May-August by assessing three indicators: COVID-19-like illness-related emergency department (ED) visits, positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and confirmed COVID-19 cases. Nationwide, the median age of COVID-19 cases declined from 46 years in May to 37 years in July and 38 in August. Similar patterns were seen for COVID-19-like illness-related ED visits and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results in all U.S. Census regions. During June-August, COVID-19 incidence was highest in persons aged 20-29 years, who accounted for >20% of all confirmed cases. The southern United States experienced regional outbreaks of COVID-19 in June. In these regions, increases in the percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results among adults aged 20-39 years preceded increases among adults aged 60 years by an average of 8.7 days (range = 4-15 days), suggesting that younger adults likely contributed to community transmission of COVID-19. Given the role of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission (2), strict adherence to community mitigation strategies and personal preventive behaviors by younger adults is needed to help reduce their risk for infection and subsequent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to persons at higher risk for severe illness.","output":"Changing Age Distribution of the COVID-19 Pandemic  United States, MayCAugust 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background We systematically reviewed all literature concerning online Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) interventions for chronic pain to evaluate their (1) ACT content, (2) design characteristics, (3) design rationales, and (4) adherence.

Consideration of health economic evidence (HEE) during CPG development in a structured manner remains a challenge globally and locally. This study explored the views, current practice, training needs and challenges faced by CPG developers in the production and use of HEE for CPGs in South Africa. METHODS: This mixed-methods study comprised an online survey and a focus group discussion. The survey was piloted and subsequently sent to CPG role players - evidence reviewers, CPG panellists, academics involved with training in relevant disciplines like health economics and public health, implementers and funders. The focus group participants hold strategic roles in CPG development and health economic activities nationally. The survey evaluated mean values, measures of variability, and percentages for Likert scales, while narrative components were thematically analysed. Focus group data were manually coded, thematically analysed and verified. RESULTS: The survey (n = 55 respondents to 245 surveys distributed) and one focus group (n = 5 participants from 10 people invited) occurred between October 2018 and February 2019. We found the most consistent reason why HEE should inform CPG decisions was making more efficient use of limited financial resources. This was explained by numerous context and methodological barriers. Focus groups participants noted that consideration of complex HEE are not achievable without bolstering skills in applying evidence-based medicine principles. Further concerns include lack of clarity of standard methods; inequitable and opaque topic selection across private and public sectors; inadequate skills of CPG panel members to use HEE; and the ability of health economists to communicate results in accessible ways. Overall, in the absence of clarity about process and methods, politics and interests may drive CPG decisions about which interventions to implement. CONCLUSIONS: HEE should ideally be considered in CPG decisions in South Africa. However, this will remain hampered until the CPG community agree on methods and processes for using HEE in CPGs. Focused investment by national government to address the challenges identified by the study is imperative for a better return on investment as National Health Insurance moves forward.

MERS is caused by a novel betacoronavirus (MERS-CoV). All cases of MERS have been linked through travel to or residence in countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula. Dromedary camels are considered natu- ral reservoirs for MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV is mainly transmitted from infected dromedary camels to human beings, and it is transmitted among human beings by droplets, contact, and perhaps airborne spread. Both community-acquired and hospital-acquired cases have been reported with little human-to-human transmis- sion reported in the community. The largest known outbreak of MERS outside the Arabian Peninsula oc- curred in the Republic of Korea in 2015, with 186 cases. The outbreak was associated with a traveler re- turning from the Arabian Peninsula. Clinical features of MERS range from asymptomatic or mild disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure resulting in death, especially in individuals with underlying comorbidities. MERS is suspected in the presence of febrile acute respiratory illness and close contact with MERS-CoV, and can be confirmed by the detection of viral nucleic acid through RT-PCR or se- rology. No specific drug treatment exists for MERS; however, the neutralizing antibodies, ribavirin and interferon have been shown to be potentially useful anti-MERS-CoV drugs.

Treatment of GvHD is challenging due to its heterogeneous nature of presentation, with steroids remaining the established first-line treatment. Long-term doses of systemic corticosteroids have many well-known side-effects including muscle atrophy. Despite the fact that reports in non-cancer clinical populations treated with glucocorticoids demonstrated that resistance training can reverse atrophy and weakness, no RCT has evaluated the potential of resistance training on preventing the disease- and treatment-induced loss of skeletal muscle mass and function in GvHD patients yet. In this context, ensuring adequate nutrition is important as protein deprivation may accelerate the wasting process. As GvHD patients are commonly found to be malnourished, nutritional medical care should be considered when investigating the effect of exercise in GvHD patients. Therefore, the aim of the present Impact of Resistance Exercise and Nutritional Endorsement on physical performance in patients with GvHD C Study (IRENE-G) is to evaluate the effects of resistance exercise in combination with nutritional endorsement on physical, nutritional and patient-reported outcomes in GvHD patients. METHODS: IRENE-G is a 24-week prospective interventional RCT. One hundred twelve participants will be randomly allocated (1:1) to one of two arms: resistance exercise and nutritional optimization (experimental) vs. nutritional optimization only (control). Participants in the experimental group will engage in a supervised, progressive moderate-to-high intensity resistance training that is consistent with exercise guidelines for cancer patients, while additionally receiving nutritional support/therapy. Subjects of the control group solely receive nutritional support/therapy based on individual needs. Participants will be assessed at baseline, at 8, 16, 24 weeks for physical performance and various physiological, nutritional and patient-reported outcomes. Follow-up will be 6 months after intervention completion. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this will be the first RCT to assess and compare the effects of a resistance intervention supplemented by nutritional support/therapy against nutritional support only on various health-related outcomes in GvHD patients. The study will contribute to our understanding of the value of exercise and nutritional endorsement in counteracting the negative consequences of GvHD and its treatment.

With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the use of telemedicine consultations increased dramatically alongside utilization of other digital technologies. Despite promise and potential advantages for clinicians (including remote working, improved time management and safety) there are known drawbacks to telephone consultations for psychiatrists. This includes limitations to assessments of mental state and risk, with loss of non-verbal communication often cited as a point in favour of more sophisticated technologies such as video calling. By adopting telephone consultations to a greater extent during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Coventry Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team (CRHTT), we aimed to assess the patient experience in telehealth, through a patient survey. METHOD: After an initial assessment or follow-up consultation with a medical practitioner from the crisis team, patients were invited to take part in a short questionnaire with a member of the administration staff. This consisted of eight questions on a Likert scale and three open questions for comments. Results were collated and analyzed via Microsoft Excel. RESULT: Most patients found the telephone consultations satisfactory, with more than 90% returning positive scores in understanding, convenience and overall satisfaction. All patients felt listened to and that their confidentiality was maintained; with all but one respondent willing to engage in further consultations via the telephone. Negative scores were typically returned for practical telephonic problems including poor signal, interference and background noise. In their comments patients expressed largely positive views about their experience with their clinician; analysis revealed key insights into the patient experience, demonstrating the convenience, comfort and flexibility possible with telepsychiatry. CONCLUSION: Patient experience of telemedicine in a UK psychiatric crisis team is mostly positive, with clear advantages for both patients and clinicians. Our results show telephone consultations can be expanded to new patient assessments alongside follow-ups, enabling the team to reach a greater number of service users.

The mean cost per patient was significantly higher in the case of RSV (5,753.43  2,041.62 euros) compared to other etiology (5,395.15  2,040.87 euros) (p = 0.04). Discussion: The study confirms the high hospitalization cost associated with bronchiolitis. In detail, in the case of RSV etiology, the cost was higher compared to other etiology, which is likely due to the longer hospitalization and the more frequent admission to the intensive cure department. Conclusion: This study highlights that bronchiolitis is an important cost item even in a tertiary hospital and that cost-effective interventions targeting RSV are increasingly urgent.","output":"Respiratory Syncytial Virus Bronchiolitis in Infancy: The Acute Hospitalization Cost"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is well-known for its role in blood pressure regulation via the reninCangiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) but also functions in fertility, immunity, haematopoiesis and diseases such as obesity, fibrosis and Alzheimers dementia. Like ACE, the human homologue ACE2 is also involved in blood pressure regulation and cleaves a range of substrates involved in different physiological processes. Importantly, it is the functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV)-2 responsible for the 2020, coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Understanding the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 is crucial for the design of therapies to combat this disease. This review provides a comparative analysis of methodologies and findings to describe how structural biology techniques like X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy have enabled remarkable discoveries into the structureCfunction relationship of ACE and ACE2. This, in turn, has enabled the development of ACE inhibitors for the treatment of cardiovascular disease and candidate therapies for the treatment of COVID-19. However, despite these advances the function of ACE homologues in non-human organisms is not yet fully understood. ACE homologues have been discovered in the tissues, body fluids and venom of species from diverse lineages and are known to have important functions in fertility, envenoming and insectChost defence mechanisms. We, therefore, further highlight the need for structural insight into insect and venom ACE homologues for the potential development of novel anti-venoms and insecticides.","output":"ACE2 and ACE: structure-based insights into mechanism, regulation and receptor recognition by SARS-CoV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Older adults prefer to age in place. Social network change and health decline challenge ageing in place, as stressors that make age-related advantages disappear. The aim of this study was to explore social network change and health decline and its impact on older adults who are ageing in place. METHOD: In-depth interviews (n = 16) were conducted with older adults who were ageing in place and who were experiencing health decline and social network change. Procedures for grounded theory building were followed to analyse the interviews with respondents who were discharged from the hospital less than 4 months ago (n = 7). Narrative analysis was conducted to reach a deeper understanding of the expected complexity of experiences of this targeted sample. RESULTS: Results encompass a typology with four types of impact: A. Sneak preview of old age, B. Disruptive transition into old age, C. Drastically ageing, and D. Steadily ageing. Additionally, indications were found that older adults should be able to move along the four types of impact and ideally could end up in quartile D, experiencing little or no impact at all (anymore). CONCLUSION: The results present an optimistic view on the possibilities of older adults to continue ageing in place despite experiencing unavoidable and uncontrollable stressors in life. Also, the results provide leads for practice, to develop an action perspective for home care nurses and gerontological social workers to determine and reduce the impact of social network change and health decline on older adults who are ageing in place. Suggestions for further research would be to unravel how to detect temporal setbacks in successful ageing in place.

In MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands), the choice of the type of thrombectomy device was left to the discretion of the interventionist. The aim of this study was to explore the differences in functional outcome, neurological recovery, reperfusion, extent of infarction, and adverse events according to stent type and make. METHODS The primary outcome was functional outcome at 90 days, assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Neuroimaging outcomes included occlusion on computed tomographic angiography at 24 hours, infarct volume at 5 to 7 days, and modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction scores. Safety outcomes included death within 90 days and any symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. We analyzed possible interactions between stent type and treatment with multiple regression models. Treatment effects were adjusted for patient age, stroke severity, and collateral score. RESULTS Of the 500 patients included in the trial, 233 were allocated to intervention. Of these, 124 (53%) were first treated with Trevo (adjusted common odds ratio for shift on the mRS [acOR, 1.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-2.92]), 31 (13%) with Solitaire (acOR, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-3.73), 40 (17%) with other retrievable stents or mechanical devices (acOR, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.51-3.93], and 38 (16%) could not be treated.

This study aimed to analyze this approach and its appropriateness in the setting of hospital emergency departments. MATERIAL AND METHODS Secondary analysis of data from the multicenter observational cross-sectional HERMES-AF study carried out in 124 hospitals representative of the Spanish national health service in 2011. Included were consecutive patients with AF restored to sinus rhythm who were discharged home from emergency care. RESULTS A total of 449 patients were included; 204 (45.4%) were already on sinus rhythm maintenance therapy. Of ,the 245 remaining patients, 107 (43.67%) were prescribed maintenance treatment in the emergency department, as follows: 41, an antiarrhythmic drug; 19, upstream therapy; and 49, both treatments. The selection of an antiarrhythmic drug did not follow guideline recommendations in 10 patients (11.8%). Antiarrhythmic drug prescription was associated with having had a prior episode of AF (odds ratio [OR], 2.024; 95% CI, 1.196-3.424; P = .009); a heart rate of more than 110 beats/min (OR, 2.147; 95% CI, 1.034-4.456, P = 0.40); and prescription of anticoagulation on discharge (OR, 1.862; 95% CI, 1.094-3.170; P = .022). Upstream therapy prescription was associated only with a heart rate over 110 beats/min (OR, 2.187; 95% CI, 1.005-4.757; P = .018). In total, 311 patients (69.23%) were discharged from the emergency department with sinus rhythm maintenance therapy: 87 with an antiarrhythmic drug, 117 with an upstream therapy, and 107 with both. CONCLUSION Treatment to prevent the recurrence of AF is underprescribed in emergency departments. Increasing such prescription and ensuring the appropriateness of antiarrhythmic therapy prescribed are points emergency departments can improve in the interest of better sinus rhythm maintenance.","output":"Effective fast-track ambulatory care pathway for patients with COVID-19 at risk for poor outcome: the COVID-A2R model in a hospital emergency department."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pyogenic liver abscesses represent one of the rarer, but potentially life\\\\threatening diseases of the liver.

Improving ELISAs is crucial for detecting biomolecules relates to health disorders and facilitating diagnosis at the early diseases stages. Several methods have been developed to improve the ELISA sensitivity through immobilization of antibodies on the microtiter plates. We have developed a highly sensitive ELISA strategy based on the preparation of acetylated chitosan surfaces in order to improve the antibodies orientation. RESULTS: Chitin surfaces were obtained by mixing small quantities of chitosan and acetic anhydride in each well of a microtiter plate. Anti-c-myc 9E10 low affinity antibody fused to ChBD was cloned and expressed in CHO cells obtaining the anti-c-myc-ChBD antibody. We found that anti c-myc-ChBD binds specifically to the chitin surfaces in comparison with anti-c-myc 9E10, which did not. Chitin surface was used to develop a sandwich ELISA to detect the chimeric human protein c-myc-GST-IL8 cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The ELISA assays developed on chitin surfaces were 6-fold more sensitive than those performed on standard surface with significant differences (p<0,0001).

Decision Support Systems (DSS) may support first-line physicians to diagnose and manage these patients based on personalised data. AIM: To examine the diagnostic accuracy and application of the EMBalance DSS for diagnosis and management of common vestibular disorders in primary care. METHODS: Patients with persistent dizziness were recruited from primary care in Germany, Greece, Belgium and the UK and randomised to primary care clinicians assessing the patients with (+ DSS) versus assessment without (? DSS) the EMBalance DSS. Subsequently, specialists in neuro-otology/audiovestibular medicine performed clinical evaluation of each patient in a blinded way to provide the gold standard against which the + DSS, ? DSS and the DSS as a standalone tool (i.e. without the final decision made by the clinician) were validated. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-four participants (age range 25C85, mean = 57.7, SD = 16.7 years) were assigned to the + DSS (N = 100) and to the ? DSS group (N = 94). The diagnosis suggested by the + DSS primary care physician agreed with the expert diagnosis in 54%, compared to 41.5% of cases in the ? DSS group (odds ratio 1.35). Similar positive trends were observed for management and further referral in the + DSS vs. the ? DSS group. The standalone DSS had better diagnostic and management accuracy than the + DSS group. CONCLUSION: There were trends for improved vestibular diagnosis and management when using the EMBalance DSS.

Especially, the spike of case numbers in South Korea sparks pandemic worries. This virus is reported to spread mainly through person-to-person contact via respiratory droplets generated by coughing and sneezing, or possibly through surface contaminated by people coughing or sneezing on them. More critically, there have been reports about the possibility of this virus to transmit even before a virus-carrying person to show symptoms. Therefore, a low-cost, easy-access protocol for early detection of this virus is desperately needed. Here, we have established a real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rtPCR)-based assay protocol composed of easy specimen self-collection from a subject via pharyngeal swab, Trizol-based RNA purification, and SYBR Green-based rtPCR. This protocol shows an accuracy and sensitivity limit of 1-10 virus particles as we tested with a known lentivirus. The cost for each sample is estimated to be less than 15 US dollars. Overall time it takes for an entire protocol is estimated to be less than 4 hours. We propose a cost-effective, quick-and-easy method for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 at any conventional Biosafety Level II laboratories that are equipped with a rtPCR machine. Our newly developed protocol should be helpful for a first-hand screening of the asymptomatic virus-carriers for further prevention of transmission and early intervention and treatment for the rapidly propagating virus.","output":"Development of a Laboratory-safe and Low-cost Detection Protocol for SARS-CoV-2 of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Care for patients with multimorbidity and long-term complex needs is costly and with demographic changes this group is growing.

Although oral cGVHD occurs in >25 % of cGVHD patients and leads to decreased quality of life, its etiology is poorly understood. The present retrospective cross-sectional analysis of oral cGVHD patients sought to (1) test the feasibility of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify protein biomarkers of oral cGVHD and (2) to gain a clearer understanding of salivary proteins impacted by oral cGVHD. METHODS: Using unstimulated whole saliva, we compared pooled saliva from five patients with a diagnosis of moderate or severe oral cGVHD, with a gender-and age- matched pool of five cGVHD patients with no oral mucosal findings. LC-MS/MS was used to identify salivary proteins, followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Selected mass spectrometric findings, including lactotransferrin, lactoperoxidase, and albumin, were confirmed by targeted label-free quantification. RESULTS: LC-MS/MS led to confident identification of 180 proteins. Of these proteins, 102 changed in abundance at least 2 fold, including 12 proteins identified only in the No oral cGVHD group. Downregulation of ~0.4 fold was confirmed for both lactotransferrin and lactoperoxidase in Oral cGVHD saliva using targeted label-free quantification.

Details regarding the safety and use of tracheostomy in treating COVID-19 continue to evolve. Objective: To evaluate the association of tracheostomy with COVID-19 patient outcomes and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among health care professionals (HCPs). Data Sources: EMBASE (Ovid), Medline (Ovid), and Web of Science from January 1, 2020, to March 4, 2021. Study Selection: English-language studies investigating patients with COVID-19 who were receiving IMV and undergoing tracheostomy. Observational and randomized clinical trials were eligible (no randomized clinical trials were found in the search). All screening was performed by 2 reviewers (P.S. and M.L.). Overall, 156 studies underwent full-text review. Data Extraction and Synthesis: We performed data extraction in accordance with Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. We used a random-effects model, and ROBINS-I was used for the risk-of-bias analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 transmission between HCPs and levels of personal protective equipment, in addition to complications, time to decannulation, ventilation weaning, and intensive care unit (ICU) discharge in patients with COVID-19 who underwent tracheostomy. Results: Of the 156 studies that underwent full-text review, only 69 were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 14 of these 69 studies (20.3%) were included in the meta-analysis. A total of 4669 patients were included in the 69 studies, and the mean (range) patient age across studies was 60.7 (49.1-68.8) years (43 studies [62.3%] with 1856 patients). We found that in all studies, 1854 patients (73.8%) were men and 658 (26.2%) were women. We found that 28 studies (40.6%) investigated either surgical tracheostomy or percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. Overall, 3 of 58 studies (5.17%) identified a small subset of HCPs who developed COVID-19 that was associated with tracheostomy. Studies did not consistently report the number of HCPs involved in tracheostomy. Among the patients, early tracheostomy was associated with faster ICU discharge (mean difference, 6.17 days; 95% CI, -11.30 to -1.30), but no change in IMV weaning (mean difference, -2.99 days; 95% CI, -8.32 to 2.33) or decannulation (mean difference, -3.12 days; 95% CI, -7.35 to 1.12). There was no association between mortality or perioperative complications and type of tracheostomy. A risk-of-bias evaluation that used ROBINS-I demonstrated notable bias in the confounder and patient selection domains because of a lack of randomization and cohort matching. There was notable heterogeneity in study reporting. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that enhanced personal protective equipment is associated with low rates of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during tracheostomy. Early tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 may reduce ICU stay, but this finding is limited by the observational nature of the included studies.","output":"Association of Tracheostomy With Outcomes in Patients With COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Among Health Care Professionals: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: U-ACCOMPLISH is one of two phase 3 induction trials evaluating safety and efficacy of upadacitinib-45 mg once daily (UPA) in adults with ulcerative colitis (UC).

The aim of this literature review was to describe published, quantified risk factors that are relevant for the introduction of BoHV-1. The risk factors described in this study can be used as input for modeling eradication scenarios and for communication on biosecurity measures to stakeholders. A literature search was conducted in November 2020 in two major online search databases, PubMed and Web of Science. The search criteria \\"risk factor\\" combined with different synonyms for BoHV-1 were explored, which resulted in 564 hits. Only studies performed in Europe, written in Dutch, English, French, German or Spanish with an English summary and that quantified risk factors for introduction of BoHV-1 into cattle herds were included. Studies had to quantify the risk factors with crude odds ratios (OR), an estimate of the chance of a particular event occurring in an exposed group to a non-exposed group. After checking for duplicates and excluding articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 12 publications remained for this review. Risk factors were classified into seven groups, i.e., herd characteristics, management, animal characteristics, purchase, direct animal contact, neighborhood and indirect transmission routes. Most relevant factors for introduction of BoHV-1 into cattle herds include herd size, purchase of cattle, cattle density, age of cattle, distance to neighboring cattle herds and professional visitors. Together with other direct and indirect animal contacts, these factors are important when elimination of BoHV-1 is considered. A closed farming system and protective clothing for professional visitors can eliminate the major routes of introduction of BoHV-1 in cattle herds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review solely focussing on measures that can be taken to control introduction of BoHV-1 into cattle herds. Besides testing, focus on managing these (biosecurity) factors will decrease the risk of introducing the virus.","output":"Risk Factors for Introduction of Bovine Herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) Into Cattle Herds: A Systematic European Literature Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Application of fungicides has been the main management practice for Peronospora belbahrii, which is the most important pathogen of sweet basil in the United States. Six replicated experiments were conducted between 2010 and 2016 with field-grown basil of a susceptible cultivar exposed to naturally occurring wind-dispersed sporangiospores of P. belbahrii to evaluate conventional fungicides registered for basil downy mildew in the United States and in development for this use. This project revealed the importance for successful management of using a preventive fungicide application schedule, maintaining a 7-day application interval, and using application equipment designed to provide thorough spray coverage to plants (drop nozzles). Fungicide efficacy was assessed based on incidence of symptomatic leaves rather than disease severity, which is stringent but realistic because there is zero tolerance for disease on fresh-market herbs. Most fungicides were tested as the formulated product marketed in the United States. Oxathiapiprolin was tested as experimental formulations. Its trade name is Orondis. Overall best control was achieved in 2016. Excellent control (99% based on AUDPC values) was obtained with four fungicide programs with oxathiapiprolin, Revus, and ProPhyt, indicating this combination of chemistry was more important than specific timing for each fungicide. Ranman applied in alternation with Revus plus K-Phite was not quite as effective (89% control); this treatment was ineffective in 2015 when the 7-day spray interval was not maintained. Best treatment in 2015 was Quadris applied in alternation with Revus plus oxathiapiprolin for two of three Revus applications. Two different alternations of these fungicides also were effective. But Quadris alternated with Revus was ineffective. When tested singly, the most effective fungicides in 2013 (listed in order based on AUDPC values) were Zampro, Revus, oxathiapiprolin, and Ranman. ProPhyt was effective in 2013 but not in 2012, when another phosphorous acid fungicide, K-Phite, also was ineffective. Only oxathiapiprolin and Zampro were effective in the 2012 experiment; Revus and Ranman were ineffective. Presidio was ineffective both years. Based on the results from this study, Orondis is the most effective fungicide among those evaluated for managing basil downy mildew, and Zampro is second. Neither were labeled for this use on field-grown basil as of June 2020. Ranman applied in alternation with Revus plus K-Phite, a commonly recommended program of labeled fungicides, provided very good control.","output":"Efficacy of Conventional Fungicides for Downy Mildew in Field-Grown Sweet Basil in the United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"School closures, altered access to health services, and economic stress during the COVID-19 pandemic have likely had an impact on the mental and physical well-being of youth worldwide, particularly among those with chronic health conditions (CHCs).

This study investigated the incidence of persistent ACI and identified clinical predictors of ACI recovery in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 2.5 months post-discharge. METHODS: This retrospective study consisted of 10,696 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from March 11, 2020 to June 3, 2021. Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory tests were collected at ACI onset, hospital discharge, and 2.5 months post-discharge. ACI was defined as serum troponin-T (TNT) level >99th-percentile upper reference limit (0.014ng/mL) during hospitalization, and recovery was defined as TNT below this threshold 2.5 months post-discharge. Four models were used to predict ACI recovery status. RESULTS: There were 4,248 (39.7%) COVID-19 patients with ACI, with most (93%) developed ACI on or within a day after admission. In-hospital mortality odds ratio of ACI patients was 4.45 [95%CI: 3.92, 5.05, p<0.001] compared to non-ACI patients. Of the 2,880 ACI survivors, 1,114 (38.7%) returned to our hospitals 2.5 months on average post-discharge, of which only 302 (44.9%) out of 673 patients recovered from ACI. There were no significant differences in demographics, race, ethnicity, major commodities, and length of hospital stay between groups. Prediction of ACI recovery post-discharge using the top predictors (troponin, creatinine, lymphocyte, sodium, lactate dehydrogenase, lymphocytes and hematocrit) at discharge yielded 63.73%-75.73% accuracy. INTERPRETATION: Persistent cardiac injury is common among COVID-19 survivors. Readily available patient data accurately predict ACI recovery post-discharge. Early identification of at-risk patients could help prevent long-term cardiovascular complications.

The study investigated the effect of breathing pattern on positive airway pressure and dead-space clearance by NHF. The breathing cycle during NHF was characterized in 26 patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) and stable COPD and after mechanical ventilation (post-MV) via tracheostomy where also pressure was measured in the trachea. Dead-space clearance was measured in airway models during different breathing patterns. NHF reduced the respiratory rate (RR) and T(I)/T(E) through prolonging the T(E); the T(I)/T(E) ranged between 0.5 observed in the COPD patients and 1.0 in the ARF patients. NHF via a standard medium-sized cannula interface generated a low-level expiratory pressure proportional to NHF rate and breathing flow; the median generated positive end-expiratory pressure was only 1.71 cmH(2)O at NHF 45 L/min. The dilution and purging of expired gas from a nasal cavity model were observed to occur at the end of expiration as expiratory flow slowed and the dynamic pressure decreased. The higher RR with shorter end-expiratory period resulted in reduced dead-space clearance by NHF; 20 L/min cleared 43  2 mL at RR 15 min(?1) vs. 9  5 mL at RR 45 min(?1), P < 0.001, which was increased at higher NHF rate. At lower RR, the clearance was similar between NHF rates 20 and 60 L/min. Higher NHF rates elevate positive airway pressure, and at the increased RR can improve the clearance. This may enhance gas exchange and lead to a reduction in the work of breathing. NEW & NOTEWORTHY During nasal high flow (NHF) an increased breathing frequency, which is commonly observed in acute respiratory failure, can lead to decreased dead-space clearance. Higher NHF rates increase the clearance and reduce the rebreathing which may eventually lower the respiratory rate and the work of breathing. Monitoring of the respiratory rate could be an important indicator of not only the respiratory function but also the NHF rate selection and the therapy efficacy.","output":"Effect of respiratory rate and size of cannula on pressure and dead-space clearance during nasal high flow in patients with COPD and acute respiratory failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New intent discovery aims to uncover novel intent categories from user utterances to expand the set of supported intent classes. It is a critical task for the development and service expansion of a practical dialogue system. Despite its importance, this problem remains under-explored in the literature. Existing approaches typically rely on a large amount of labeled utterances and employ pseudo-labeling methods for representation learning and clustering, which are label-intensive, inefficient, and inaccurate. In this paper, we provide new solutions to two important research questions for new intent discovery: (1) how to learn semantic utterance representations and (2) how to better cluster utterances. Particularly, we first propose a multi-task pre-training strategy to leverage rich unlabeled data along with external labeled data for representation learning. Then, we design a new contrastive loss to exploit self-supervisory signals in unlabeled data for clustering. Extensive experiments on three intent recognition benchmarks demonstrate the high effectiveness of our proposed method, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in both unsupervised and semi-supervised scenarios.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of physical inactivity and the patterns of physical activity among university students in confinement. This cross-sectional study involved 147 Malaysian students and 107 Indonesian students. Body weight before the pandemic and during the pandemic was self-reported by the respondents, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) was used to assess the physical activity and sedentary behavior of the respondents. The findings revealed that 79.6% of Malaysians and 77.6% of Indonesians were physically active during the confinement. There was no significant difference (p < 0.05) in the duration devoted to vigorous-intensity activity (M(Malaysian) = 0.00 MET minutes/week and M(Indonesian) = 480.00 MET minutes/week) and moderate-intensity activity (M(Malaysian) = 0.00 MET minutes/week and M(Indonesian) = 0.00 MET minutes/week) among the studied population. During the pandemic, Malaysian students (M = 1386.00 MET minutes/week) devoted a significantly higher duration to walking (M = 1386.00 MET minutes/week) and sedentary behavior (9.16  4.47 h/day) than Indonesian students (M = 990.00 MET minutes/week and sedentary behavior = 7.85  4.27 h/day). Overall, no significant difference was noted in the total physical activity of Malaysian and Indonesian students during the pandemic (M(Malaysian) = 2826.00 MET minutes/week and M(Indonesian) = 1782.00 MET minutes/week).

Identification of interventions to improve MOUD retention is of interest to policymakers and researchers. On behalf of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, we conducted a rapid evidence review on interventions to improve MOUD retention. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library from February 2009 through August 2019 for systematic reviews and randomized trials of care settings, services, logistical support, contingency management, health information technology (IT), extended-release (XR) formulations, and psychosocial interventions that assessed retention at least 3 months. RESULTS: Two systematic reviews and 39 primary studies were included; most did not focus on retention as the primary outcome. Initiating MOUD in soon-to-be-released incarcerated people improved retention following release. Contingency management may improve retention using antagonist but not agonist MOUD. Retention with interventions integrating medical, psychiatric, social services, or IT did not differ from in-person treatment-as-usual approaches. Retention was comparable with XR- compared to daily buprenorphine formulations and conflicting with XR-naltrexone monthly injection compared to daily buprenorphine. Most psychosocial interventions did not improve retention. DISCUSSION: Consistent but sparse evidence supports criminal justice prerelease MOUD initiation, and contingency management interventions for antagonist MOUD. Integrating MOUD with medical, psychiatric, social services, delivering through IT, or administering via XR-MOUD formulations did not worsen retention. Fewer than half of the studies we identified focused on retention as a primary outcome. Studies used different measures of retention, making it difficult to compare effectiveness.

Given that Latino men have high rates of obesity in the United States and demonstrate greater misreporting compared to Caucasian men, examining the factors that contribute to misreporting among Latino men is warranted. This study examined BMI, Latino ethnic background (Mexican or Puerto Rican), and social desirability in relation to misreporting of BMI, as defined as the discrepancy between self-reported and measured height and weight, in Latino men. Participants were 203 adult Mexican and Puerto Rican men, average age 39.41 years, who participated in a larger study. Participants self-reported their weight and height, had their weight and height objectively measured, and completed a measure of social desirability. Measured BMI was the strongest predictor of misreporting BMI, such that the greater the participants BMI, the greater the discrepancy in BMI (p < .001). Misreporting of BMI did not vary based on ethnic background, and measured BMI did not moderate the relationship between social desirability and misreporting of BMI. When normative error was distinguished from misreporting in post-hoc analyses, results showed that only 34.5% of participants demonstrated misreporting. Findings highlight the importance of identifying normative error when examining misreporting in order to improve the accuracy of self-reported BMI data.

Masks are essentially air filters worn on the face that should filter out as many of the dangerous particles as possible. Here, the dangerous particles are the droplets containing the virus that are exhaled by an infected person. Woven fabric is unlike the material used in standard air filters. Woven fabric consists of fibers twisted together into yarns that are then woven into fabric. There are, therefore, two lengthscales: the diameters of (i) the fiber and (ii) the yarn. Standard air filters have only (i). To understand how woven fabrics filter, we have used confocal microscopy to take three-dimensional images of woven fabric. We then used the image to perform lattice Boltzmann simulations of the air flow through fabric. With this flow field, we calculated the filtration efficiency for particles a micrometer and larger in diameter. In agreement with experimental measurements by others, we found that for particles in this size range, the filtration efficiency is low. For particles with a diameter of 1.5 m, our estimated efficiency is in the range 2.5%C10%. The low efficiency is due to most of the air flow being channeled through relatively large (tens of micrometers across) inter-yarn pores. So, we conclude that due to the hierarchical structure of woven fabrics, they are expected to filter poorly.","output":"Modeling the filtration efficiency of a woven fabric: The role of multiple lengthscales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Governments all around the world are faced with economic and social problems borne from the need for modern and reliable infrastructure. Rapid urbanization, increasing population size and economic growth are the main causes of increasing infrastructure investment needs in the world.

The problems in the provision of finance for these investments are aggravated with the new Covid crisis, as the funds reserved for infrastructure investments are now likely to be allocated to urgent needs such as healthcare and unemployment benefits. In such a volatile environment, identifying future investment needs and discussing how these needs will be met is important and timely more than ever. This paper, introduces the global infrastructure investment trends in the future and discusses the use of public and private finance for infrastructure spending. In this concept, the following questions are explored, (1) What is the volume and trend of global infrastructure investment needs? (2) How do infrastructure investment needs differ among regions? (3) How will this infrastructure investment needs be financed?, and (4) What may be some of the future issues to be solved? To find out future infrastructure investment needs and trends, reports outlining the future prospects of the infrastructure sector are examined and trends are revealed. Then, a review of financing mechanisms is introduced in the light of the main procurement systems used by governments for realizing infrastructure projects. In this concept, design-bid-build, design-build and project finance models are explored in terms of their organizational and financial structure. Future issues to be solved are mainly derived from a cross examination of concerns raised in published infrastructure investment case studies and of future trends. Results reveal that the need for investment in infrastructure is growing steadily. As a response to this growth, the use of private finance is increasingly being encouraged by governments all over the world and a variety of international organizations. However, it appears that long-standing private finance issues predominantly observed in demand-based projects will continue to be discussed over the coming years by policymakers, scholars and communities. Indeed, many governments and organizations are already speeding up research efforts into ensuring the resilience of public private partnerships (PPP) in infrastructure projects. The insights from this research are expected to revive interest and research efforts into the potential future challenges for infrastructure financing and options available for governments.","output":"Trends in Global Infrastructure Investment and Financial Consequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory failure in COVID-19 is a common feature in fatal cases and has been considered as a failure of the immune system to control the virus.

Pooled analysis show individuals with obesity were more at risk for COVID\\\\19 positive, >46.0% higher (OR = 1.46; 95% CI, 1.30C1.65; p < 0.0001); for hospitalization, 113% higher (OR = 2.13; 95% CI, 1.74C2.60; p < 0.0001); for ICU admission, 74% higher (OR = 1.74; 95% CI, 1.46C2.08); and for mortality, 48% increase in deaths (OR = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.22C1.80; p < 0.001). Mechanistic pathways for individuals with obesity are presented in depth for factors linked with COVID\\\\19 risk, severity and their potential for diminished therapeutic and prophylactic treatments among these individuals. Individuals with obesity are linked with large significant increases in morbidity and mortality from COVID\\\\19. There are many mechanisms that jointly explain this impact. A major concern is that vaccines will be less effective for the individuals with obesity.","output":"Individuals with obesity and COVID\\\\19: A global perspective on the epidemiology and biological relationships"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Information about the spread of the coronavirus is circulated through various information channels in the society, both mainstream media, alternative media, social media, and daily conversation.

The absence of any vaccine as well as any definitive drug to cure, has made the situation very grave. Therefore only few effective tools are available to contain the rapid pace of spread of this disease, named as COVID-19. On 24th March, 2020, the the Union Government of India made an announcement of unprecedented complete lockdown of the entire country effective from the next day. No exercise of similar scale and magnitude has been ever undertaken anywhere on the globe in the history of entire mankind. This study aims to scientifically analyze the implications of this decision using a kinetic model covering more than 96% of Indian territory. This model was further constrained by large sets of realistic parameters pertinent to India in order to capture the ground realities prevailing in India, such as: (i) true state wise population density distribution, (ii) accurate state wise infection distribution for the zeroth day of simulation (20th March, 2020), (iii) realistic movements of average clusters, (iv) rich diversity in movements patterns across different states, (v) migration patterns across different geographies, (vi) different migration patterns for pre- and post-COVID-19 outbreak, (vii) Indian demographic data based on the 2011 census, (viii) World Health Organization (WHO) report on demography wise infection rate and (ix) incubation period as per WHO report. This model does not attempt to make a long-term prediction about the disease spread on a standalone basis; but to compare between two different scenarios (complete lockdown vs. no lockdown). In the framework of model assumptions, our model conclusively shows significant success of the lockdown in containing the disease within a tiny fraction of the population and in the absence of it, it would have led to a very grave situation.","output":"A kinetic model for qualitative understanding and analysis of the effect of complete lockdown imposed by India for controlling the COVID-19 disease spread by the SARS-CoV-2 virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung infections (community- or hospital-acquired) represent the most common cause for sepsis.

At cellular level, virus infection initiates with binding of viral particles to the host surface cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). SARS-CoV-2 engages ACE2 as the entry receptor and employs the cellular serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for S protein priming. TMPRSS2 activity is essential for viral spread and pathogenesis in the infected host. Understanding how TMPRSS2 protein expression in the lung varies in the population could reveal important insights into differential susceptibility to influenza and coronavirus infections. Here, we systematically analyzed coding-region variants in TMPRSS2 and the eQTL variants, which may affect the gene expression, to compare the genomic characteristics of TMPRSS2 among different populations. Our findings suggest that the lung-specific eQTL variants may confer different susceptibility or response to SARS-CoV-2 infection from different populations under the similar conditions. In particular, we found that the eQTL variant rs35074065 is associated with high expression of TMPRSS2 but with a low expression of the interferon (IFN)-/-inducible gene, MX1, splicing isoform.

However, it is not known how the putative MHV RdRp (Pol) is targeted to and retained on cellular membranes. In this report, we show that a 100-kDa protein was stably detected by an anti-Pol antiserum as a mature product throughout the virus life cycle. Gradient fractionation and biochemical extraction experiments demonstrated that Pol was not an integral membrane protein but was tightly associated with membranes and coimmunoprecipitated with the replicase proteins 3CLpro, p22, and p12. By immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, Pol colocalized with viral proteins at replication complexes, distinct from sites of virion assembly, over the entire course of infection. To determine if Pol associated with cellular membranes in the absence of other viral factors, the pol domain of gene 1 was cloned and expressed in cells as a fusion with green fluorescent protein, termed Gpol. In Gpol-expressing cells that were infected with MHV, but not in mock-infected cells, Gpol relocalized from a diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm to punctate foci that colocalized with markers for replication complexes. Expression of Gpol deletion mutants established that the conserved enzymatic domains of Pol were dispensable for replication complex association, but a 38-amino-acid domain in the RdRp unique region of Pol was required. This study demonstrates that viral or virus-induced factors are necessary for Pol to associate with membranes of replication complexes, and it identifies a defined region of Pol that may mediate its interactions with those factors.","output":"Characterization of the expression, intracellular localization, and replication complex association of the putative mouse hepatitis virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe, uncorrected hypothyroidism can result in a dangerous hypometabolic state leading to myxedema crisis, a rare but life-threatening illness.

The analysis considered the WTI market and focused on the Covid-19 pandemic period January 2020CNovember 2021 and contrasted with the long preceding period from January 2000 to date. It was found that the crude oil market was informationally efficient most of the time with small sporadic deviations from efficiency in the pre-Covid-19 years. The Covid-19 period exhibited the largest deviations from efficiency, mainly in the first months of the outbreak, accompanied by a marked reduction of nonlinear components. The analysis was conducted for different scales, and the results showed that the deviations from efficiency were more pronounced for quarterly scales. For the sake of comparison, the analysis was also carried out on the trading volume dynamics and the results showed that the market activity is not fully random. The dynamics of the trading volume exhibited significant deviations from the randomness behavior when the crude oil market was efficient, and a behavior that was consistent with nonlinear patterns. The opposite behavior was noted for stages when the crude oil market showed strong deviations from efficiency.

Prior studies demonstrated successful use of convalescent plasma therapy for treatment of other viral illnesses. Our primary objective was to evaluate treatment efficacy of convalescent plasma in patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective matched cohort study, we enrolled recipients of convalescent plasma collected from donors recovered from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection under the single patient eIND process. We individually matched 35 cases with 61 controls based on age, gender, supplemental oxygen requirements, and C-reactive protein level at the time of hospital admission. We compared the outcomes of in-hospital mortality and hospital length of stay between the groups. RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 20% among the cases and 24.6% among the controls (P = .61). A multivariable logistic regression model that included age, gender, duration of symptoms, need for mechanical ventilation, and pharmacologic interventions revealed no significant difference in mortality by study group (P = .71). The median length of stay was significantly greater among convalescent plasma recipients compared with controls, 10 (IQR, 6-17) vs 7 (IQR, 4-11) days, P < .01.

Methods: We conducted a mobile phone-based cross-sectional survey from December 2020 through April 2021 among individuals aged 18+ in Uganda. Psychological distress was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-4. We applied linear regression to assess associations between experiences of COVID-19 (including fear of infection, social isolation, income loss, difficulty accessing medical care, school closings, and interactions with police) and PHQ-4 score, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics. Findings: 29.2% (95%CI 27.8% to 30.6%) of 4,066 total participants reported scores indicating moderate psychological distress, and 12.1% (11.1% to 13.1%) reported scores indicating severe distress. Distress was most common among individuals who were female, had lower levels of education, and lived in households with children.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 23 asymptomatic patients and 35 patients with lung involvement who were diagnosed with COVID-19 as well as 22 healthy volunteers. Lung involvement was determined using computed-tomography. Serum soluble-RAGE (sRAGE) levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The sRAGE levels were significantly higher in the asymptomatic group than in the control group. Age, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, and ferritin levels were higher and the sRAGE level was lower in the patients with lung involvement than in the asymptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, patients with high sRAGE levels were younger and had asymptomatic COVID-19. Patients with low sRAGE levels were elderly patients with lung involvement, which indicates that the RAGE pathway plays an important role in the aggravation of COVID-19.","output":"The Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Product (RAGE) Pathway in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-Brief (BIS-Brief) is a self-report scale that can be used to measure impulsivity in adolescents. In this study, it was aimed to determine the psychometric properties of the Turkish version of the BIS-Brief in clinical and non-clinical adolescent samples. Methods: The study included two groups of 116 psychiatric outpatients and 175 middle and high school students. For the re-test study, a small subgroup of the patient group (n=21) was re-applied BIS-Brief three weeks later. Socio-demographic data of the participants were collected. Aggression subscale of Childhood Behavior Checklist (CBCL), hyperactivity/impulsivity and anger control problems subscales of Conners-Wells' Adolescents Self-Report Scale-Long (CASS-L), and hyperactivity subscale of Conner's Parent Rating Scale-Short Form (CPRS-S) were administered. Results: The mean ages of the patient and control groups were 15.221.58 years and 15.161.86 years, respectively. There were 77 (66.4%) males in the patient group and 107 (61.1%) males in the control group. Cronbach's alphas for internal consistency were 0.78 (patient group) and 0.70 (control group). Three weeks test-retest reliability was 0.64 (patient group). We found a two-dimensional structure for the Turkish BIS-Brief. The BIS-Brief scores had a significant correlation with the scores of CBCL's aggression subscale (r=0.48; p<0.01), CASS-L's hyperactivity/impulsivity (r=0.45; p<0.01) and anger control problems subscales (r=0.45; p<0.01) and CPRS-S' hyperactivity subscale (r=0.21; p<0.01). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the Turkish version of the BIS-Brief is a reliable and valid measure for clinical and non-clinical adolescent samples.

To allow the diagnosis of COVID-19 infections, several assays based on the real-time PCR technique have been proposed. The requests for diagnosis are such that it was immediately clear that the choice of the most suitable method for each microbiology laboratory had to be based, on the one hand, on the availability of materials, and on the other hand, on the personnel and training priorities for this activity. Unfortunately, due to high demand, the shortage of commercial diagnostic kits has also become a major problem. To overcome these critical issues, we have developed a new qualitative RT-PCR probe. Our system detects three genesRNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N)and uses the -actin gene as an endogenous internal control. The results from our assay are in complete agreement with the results obtained using a commercially available kit, except for two samples that did not pass the endogenous internal control. The coincidence rate was 0.96. The LoD of our assay was 140 cp/reaction for N and 14 cp/reaction for RdRp and E. Our kit was designed to be open, either for the nucleic acid extraction step or for the RT-PCR assay, and to be carried out on several instruments. Therefore, it is free from the industrial production logics of closed systems, and conversely, it is hypothetically available for distribution in large quantities to any microbiological laboratory.

Understanding how maternal COVID-19 disease can affect placental histopathology has been limited by small study cohorts with mild disease, review by multiple pathologists, and potential confounding by maternal-fetal comorbidities that can also influence placental findings. This study aims to identify pathologic placental findings associated with COVID-19 disease and severity, as well as to distinguish them from changes related to coexisting maternal-fetal comorbidities. METHODS: This is an observational study of 61 pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who delivered and had a placental histological evaluation at NYU Langone Health between March 19, 2020 and June 30, 2020. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of placental histopathologic features and their association with maternal-fetal comorbidities and severity of COVID-19 related hypoxia. Analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test and t-test with p < 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: Sixty-one placentas were included in the study cohort, 71% from pregnancies complicated by at least one maternal-fetal comorbidity. Twenty-five percent of placentas were small for gestational age and 77% exhibited at least one feature of maternal vascular malperfusion. None of the histopathologic features in the examined placentas were associated with the presence of any specific maternal-fetal comorbidity. Thirteen percent of the cohort required maternal respiratory support for COVID-19 related hypoxia. Villous trophoblast necrosis was associated with maternal supplemental oxygen requirement (67 vs. 33%, p = 0.04) and intubation (67 vs. 33%, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: In pregnancies complicated by COVID-19 disease, there was a high prevalence of placental histopathologic changes identified, particularly features of maternal vascular malperfusion, which could not be attributed solely to the presence of maternal-fetal comorbidities. The significantly increased prevalence of villous trophoblast necrosis in women needing respiratory support suggests a connection to the severity of COVID-19 illness.","output":"Association of SARS-CoV-2 placental histopathology findings with maternal-fetal comorbidities and severity of COVID-19 hypoxia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"maxSIMhealth is a multidisciplinary collaborative manufacturing, design, and simulation laboratory at Ontario Tech University in Oshawa, Canada combining expertise in Health Sciences, Computer Science, Engineering, Business and Information Technology, aiming at building community partnerships to advance simulation training.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients admitted to our institution with confirmed COVID-19 status by polymerase chain reaction between March 1, 2020, and May 13, 2020, and selected those who underwent both d-dimer and venous duplex ultrasound examination. This cohort was divided into two groups, those with and without DVT based on duplex ultrasound examination. These groups were then compared to determine the value of d-dimer in establishing this diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 1170 patients were admitted with COVID-19, of which 158 were selected for this study. Of the 158, there were 52 patients with DVT and 106 without DVT. There were no differences in sex, age, race, or ethnicity between groups. Diabetes and routine hemodialysis were less commonly seen in the group with DVT. More than 90% of patients in both groups received prophylactic anticoagulation, but the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis was not predictive of DVT. All patients had elevated acute-phase d-dimer levels using conventional criteria, and 154 of the 158 (97.5%) had elevated levels with age-adjusted criteria (mean d-dimer 16,163  5395 ng/mL). Those with DVT had higher acute-phase d-dimer levels than those without DVT (median, 13,602 [interquartile range, 6616-36,543 ng/mL] vs 2880 [interquartile range, 1030-9126 ng/mL], P < .001). An optimal d-dimer cutoff of 6494 ng/mL was determined to differentiate those with and without DVT (sensitivity 80.8%, specificity 68.9%, negative predictive value 88.0%). Wells DVT criteria was not found to be a significant predictor of DVT. Elevated d-dimer as defined by our optimal metric was a statistically significant predictor of DVT in both univariate and multivariable analyses when adjusting for other factors (odds ratio, 6.12; 95% confidence interval, 2.79-13.39; P < .001).

Concern regarding neurological complications following vaccination escalated following the report of TM during the safety and efficacy trials of the COVID-19 vaccine. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the first case of Longitudinal Extensive Transverse Myelitis (LETM) in Malaysia following administration of the chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine. A 25-year-old female presented with bilateral lower limb weakness and inability to walk with a sensory level up to T8 with absent visual symptoms. Urgent gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine showed long segment TM over the thoracic region. Cerebrospinal fluid autoantibodies for anti-aquaporin-4 and anti-myelin-oligodendrocyte were negative. A diagnosis of LETM following vaccination was made, and the patient was started on a high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone. The patient eventually made a recovery following treatment. CONCLUSION: LETM is a rare but serious adverse reaction following vaccination. Previously reported cases showed an onset of symptoms between 10 to 14 days post-vaccination, suggesting a delayed immunogenic reaction. However, the incidence of myelitis in COVID-19 is much more common, far greater than the risk associated with vaccination.","output":"Longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis following ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 vaccine: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article describes the context, development, objectives, and content of three instruments.

Hospital discharge data may offer a more representative view of violence, through use of proxy codes, i.e. diagnosis of injuries correlated with violence. The goals of this paper are to compare the trends in violence in Minnesota, and associations of county-level demographic characteristics with violence rates, measured through explicitly diagnosed violence and proxy codes. It is an exploration of how certain sub-populations are overrepresented in traditional surveillance systems. METHODS: Using Minnesota hospital discharge data linked with census data from 2004 to 2014, this study examined the distribution and time trends of explicit, proxy, and combined (proxy and explicit) codes for child abuse, intimate partner violence (IPV), and elder abuse. The associations between county-level risk factors (e.g., poverty) and county violence rates were estimated using negative binomial regression models with generalized estimation equations to account for clustering over time. RESULTS: The main finding was that the patterns of county-level violence differed depending on whether one used explicit or proxy codes. In particular, explicit codes suggested that child abuse and IPV trends were flat or decreased slightly from 2004 to 2014, while proxy codes suggested the opposite. Elder abuse increased during this timeframe for both explicit and proxy codes, but more dramatically when using proxy codes. In regard to the associations between county level characteristics and each violence subtype, previously identified county-level risk factors were more strongly related to explicitly-identified violence than to proxy-identified violence. Given the larger number of proxy-identified cases as compared with explicit-identified violence cases, the trends and associations of combined codes align more closely with proxy codes, especially for elder abuse and IPV. CONCLUSIONS: Violence surveillance utilizing hospital discharge data, and particularly proxy codes, may add important information that traditional surveillance misses. Most importantly, explicit and proxy codes indicate different associations with county sociodemographic characteristics. Future research should examine hospital discharge data for violence identification to validate proxy codes that can be utilized to help to identify the hidden burden of violence.","output":"Measuring the hidden burden of violence: use of explicit and proxy codes in Minnesota injury hospitalizations, 2004-2014"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pain fellowship programs are facing unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The murine model of BA, employing rhesus rotavirus (RRV), parallels human disease and has been used to elucidate mechanistic aspects of a virus induced biliary cholangiopathy. We previously reported that RRV VP4 gene plays an integral role in activating the immune system and induction of BA. Utilizing rotavirus binding and blocking assays, this study elucidated how RRV VP4 protein governs cholangiocyte susceptibility to infection both in vitro and in vivo in the murine model of BA. We identified the amino acid sequence on VP4 and its cholangiocyte binding protein, finding that the sequence is specific to those rotavirus strains which cause an obstructive cholangiopathy. Pretreatment of murine and human cholangiocytes with this VP4 derived peptide (TRTRVSRLY), significantly reduced RRVs ability to bind and infect the cells. However, the peptide did not block cholangiocyte binding of TUCH and Ro1845, strains which do not induce murine BA. The SRL sequence within TRTRVSRLY is required for cholangiocyte binding and viral replication. The cholangiocyte membrane protein bound by SRL was found to be Hsc70. Inhibition of Hsc70 by siRNAs reduced RRVs ability to infect cholangiocytes. This virus-cholangiocyte interaction is also seen in vivo in the murine model of BA, where inoculation of mice with TRTRVSRLY peptide significantly reduced symptoms and mortality in RRV-injected mice. CONCLUSION: The tri-peptide SRL on RRV VP4 binds to the cholangiocyte membrane protein Hsc70 defining a novel binding site governing VP4 attachment.

Where, early cancer diagnostic and treatment very critical for live-saving, leading to patient better prognosis and successful full recovery. During the most recent couple of decades, numerous examinations have been performed on the early discovery of malignant growth utilizing noninvasive or light intrusive methods in lieu of conventional excisional biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The change of the optical properties of ex-vivo breast tissues provides different responses to light transmission, absorption, and particularly the reflection over the spectrum range. We offer the use of Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) with advanced image processing and pattern recognition in order to analyze HSI data for breast cancer detection. The spectral signatures were mined and evaluated in both malignant and normal tissue. K-mean clustering was designed for classifying hyperspectral data in order to evaluate and detection of cancer tissue. This method was used to detect ex-vivo breast cancer. Spatial spectral images were created to high spot the differences in the reflectance properties of malignant versus normal tissue. RESULTS Trials showed that the superficial spectral reflection images within 500 nm wavelength showed high variance (214.65) between cancerous and normal breast tissues. On the other hand, image within 620 nm wavelength showed low variance (0.0020).However, the superimposed of spectral region 420-620 nm was proposed as the optimum bandwidth. Finally, the proposed HS imaging system was capable to discriminate the tumor region from normal tissue of the ex-vivo breast sample with sensitivity and a specificity of 95 % and 96 %.

This study investigated the mental state and attitudes of older Chinese adults during this epidemic. DESIGN Cross-sectional online surveys on a convenience sample of China's general population at two different time points. Online surveys were disseminated through popular Chinese social media applications. Adults 18 or older living in China during the initial (N = 1148) and second stages (N=470) were included in the survey. The Worries, Strategies, and Confidence Questionnaire (WSQ) was created to assess worries and awareness of the disease. RESULTS Combined responses (N=1618), 76.1% were female and about 7.0% were 60 years or above. In the first wave, older adults were found less likely to worry about being infected by COVID-19 (p < 0.05) and reported less attention paid to protective measures (p = 0.004) than young adults. However, as the disease evolved, older participants in the second wave were more worried than young adults (p = 0.027) and older adults in the first wave (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS During the epidemic of COVID-19, watchfulness of the epidemic among older Chinese adults fluctuated over time. Initially they were slow to respond proactively, but their worries gradually increased.

They are proposed to form stacking interactions with polypurine sequences in the 5-untranslated region (UTR) of selected mRNAs, thereby clamping the RNA substrate onto eIF4A and causing inhibition of the translation initiation complex. Since virus replication relies on the host translation machinery, it is not surprising that the rocaglate Silvestrol has broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Unfortunately, synthesis of Silvestrol is sophisticated and time-consuming, thus hampering the prospects for further antiviral drug development. Here, we present the less complex structured synthetic rocaglate CR-31-B (?) as a novel compound with potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity in primary cells and in an ex vivo bronchial epithelial cell system.

Since HEV has a polypurine-free 5-UTR that folds into a stable hairpin structure, we hypothesized that RNA clamping by Silvestrol and its derivatives may also occur in a polypurine-independent but structure-dependent manner. Interestingly, the HEV 5-UTR conferred sensitivity towards Silvestrol but not to CR-31-B (?). However, if an exposed polypurine stretch was introduced into the HEV 5-UTR, CR-31-B (?) became an active inhibitor comparable to Silvestrol. Moreover, thermodynamic destabilization of the HEV 5-UTR led to reduced translational inhibition by Silvestrol, suggesting differences between rocaglates in their mode of action, most probably by engaging Silvestrol's additional dioxane moiety.","output":"Comparison of broad-spectrum antiviral activities of the synthetic rocaglate CR-31-B (?) and the eIF4A-inhibitor Silvestrol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The year 2020 witnessed a record number of reported cases of tick-borne encephalitis in Switzerland.

A self-administered survey (PEF-COVID19) was applied in the Brazilian general population, age &#8805; 18 years. T-test for independent samples and Chi-square tests were used to compare Brazil and different macro-regions, p??0.05. RESULTS: 1,977 participants filled the survey and 1,845 were included; 80% of the included ones were in social isolation. In general, the self-related physical exercise practice before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and exercise characteristics were highly affected by the pandemic (p??0.05). Sedentary behavior increased significantly (14.9 vs. 29.8%) and between the active ones, the frequency of PEx per week and duration of the PEx practice decreased significantly. The motivation to exercise also changed considering performance and health before and during the pandemic, respectively (10 vs. 5.6% and 72.4 vs. 79.1%). Also, the sample started to exercise less in the night and more in the afternoon, respectively (33.7 vs. 25.3% and 19.1 vs. 31.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic highly influenced the physical exercise practice and habits (frequency, duration, motivation, period to exercise) in Brazil and its main macro-regions. These results can be used to create measures, as home-based exercise programs, to avoid the harm of sedentary behaviors and mental health impact during and after the pandemic.","output":"Brazil before and during COVID-19 pandemic: Impact on the practice and habits of physical exercise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In the era of social distancing to curb the spread of COVID-19, bubbling is the combining of two or more households to create an exclusive larger group. The impact of bubbling on COVID-19 transmission is challenging to quantify because of the complex social structures involved. Methods: We developed a network description of households in the UK, using the configuration model to link households. We explored the impact of bubbling scenarios by joining together households of various sizes. For each bubbling scenario, we calculated the percolation threshold, that is, the number of connections per individual required for a giant component to form, numerically and theoretically. We related the percolation threshold to the household reproduction number. Results: We find that bubbling scenarios in which single-person households join with another household has a minimal impact on network connectivity and transmission potential. Ubiquitous scenarios where all households form a bubble are likely to lead to extensive transmission that is hard to control. The impact of plausible scenarios, with variable uptake and heterogeneous bubble sizes, can be mitigated with reduced numbers of contacts outside the household. Conclusions: Bubbling of households comes at an increased risk of transmission, however under certain circumstances risks can be modest and could be balanced by other changes in behaviours.","output":"Household bubbles and COVID-19 transmission: insights from percolation theory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the settings and activities associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant circulation in France, as well as the protection against symptomatic Delta infection. METHODS: In this nationwide case-control study, cases were SARS-CoV-2 infected adults recruited between 23 May and 13 August 2021. Controls were non-infected adults from a national representative panel matched to cases by age, sex, region, population density and calendar week. Participants completed an online questionnaire and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and recent activity-related exposures, past history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and COVID-19 vaccination. FINDINGS: We did not find any differences in the settings and activities associated with Delta versus non-Delta infections and grouped them for subsequent analyses. In multivariable analysis involving 12634 cases (8644 Delta and 3990 non-Delta) and 5560 controls, we found individuals under 40 years and attending bars (aOR:1.9; 95%CI:1.6-2.2) or parties (aOR:3.4; 95%CI:2.8-4.2) to be at increased risk of infection. In those aged 40 years and older, having children attend daycare (aOR:1.9; 95%CI:1.1-3.3), kindergarten (aOR:1.6; 95%CI:1.2-2.1), primary school (aOR:1.4; 95%CI:1.2-1.6) or middle school (aOR:1.3; 95%CI:1.2-1.6) were associated with increased risk of infection. We found strong protection against symptomatic Delta infection for those with prior infection whether it was recent (2-6 months) (95%; 95%CI:90-97) or associated with one dose (85%; 95%CI:78-90) or two doses of mRNA vaccine (96%; 95%CI:87-99). For those without past infection, protection was lower with two doses of mRNA vaccine (67%; 95%CI:63-71). INTERPRETATION: In line with other observational studies, we find reduced vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic Delta infections.

Favorable control of CRS represents a promising and effective strategy to mitigate the clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients with moderate to severe pneumonia. Using in vivo cytokine release assay in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-engrafted immunodeficient mice, we reported that 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC), a synthetic progestogen, exhibited significant inhibition of OKT-3-stimulated production of numerous cytokines including TNF-, IFN-, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and GM-CSF. Furthermore, 17-OHPC inhibited in vitro production of IFN-, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 in human PBMCs stimulated with OKT3, while exhibiting down-regulation of the mRNA levels of TNF-, IFN-, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10. Using the same human PBMCs, additional stimulators anti-CD28 antibody or PHA treatments led to substantial cytokine production, which was also attenuated by 17-OHPC. OKT3-stimulated phosphorylation of IB and nuclear translocation of NF-B p65 in human PBMCs were also reversed by 17-OHPC, suggesting its inhibition on NF-B signaling in immune cells. Taken together, this work reported both in vivo and in vitro inhibition of cytokine production by 17-OHPC, presumably by virtue of its suppression of NF-B signaling. These findings provide pharmacological evidence to support the potential application of 17-OHPC in treating CRS associated with COVID-19.","output":"17-Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate Inhibits Cytokine Production via Suppression of NF-B Activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using peritoneal macrophage cultures it was found that both PRI mice and their macrophages in culture were susceptible to mouse hepatitis virus and that C(3)H mice and macrophages were resistant. All F(1) macrophages and some back-cross cell cultures were susceptible. The degeneration of F(1) and back-cross macrophages obtained either from adult mouse peritoneal exudate or newborn mouse liver, occurred more slowly than PRI macrophages. Segregation of susceptibility occurred in the first back-cross generation. Tests of three back-cross generations from susceptible mice yielded about one-quarter of the mice shown to be susceptible either by direct test or test of their macrophages. A clear correlation between susceptibility in vivo and in vitro was established both in the test of the percentage segregation and in tests of individual back-cross mice. A small series of tests, however, indicated that 50 per cent of the back-cross mice had the genetic capacity to transmit susceptibility. Thus a hypothesis of two genes for susceptibility, although not excluded, may yield to a hypothesis of a single dominant gene, incompletely expressed.

We examined whether such discrimination mediates the association between victimization and social withdrawal, and whether these associations differ between men and women. We also determined the prevalence of social withdrawal and the discrimination experienced by patients suffering from a severe mental illness. This study is embedded in the Victimization in Psychiatric Patients study. Information on discrimination, social withdrawal and victimization was obtained using structured self-report questionnaires (N = 949). We reported the 12-month prevalence of these phenomena and used path analysis to estimate the direct path between personal and property victimization and social withdrawal, and the indirect path through the discrimination experienced. The impact of gender was assessed by testing interaction terms. Social withdrawal was reported by 20.6% (95%CI 18.1-23.2) of participants, and being discriminated against in the past 12 months by 75.3% (95%CI: 72.6-78.0%). While crime victimization had no direct effects on social withdrawal, personal crime victimization (B = 0.47; 95%CI 0.25-0.72; p < 0.001) and property crime victimization (B = 0.65; 95%CI 0.42-0.93; p < 0.001) had significant indirect effects on social withdrawal, which were mediated by the discrimination experienced. In men we found a direct negative effect of property crime on social withdrawal (B = -0.68; 95%CI: -1.21to -0.11, p = 0.014).

While struggling with the unknown nature of this novel coronavirus, many researchers and groups attempted to project the progress of the pandemic using empirical or mechanistic models, each one having its drawbacks. The first confirmed cases were announced early in March, and since then, serious containment measures have taken place in Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we present a different approach, a Bayesian negative binomial multilevel model with mixed effects, for the projection of the COVID-19 pandemic and apply this model to the Turkish case. The model source code is available at https://github.com/kansil/covid-19. We predicted confirmed daily cases and cumulative numbers for June 6th to June 26th with 80%, 95% and 99% prediction intervals (PI). RESULTS: Our projections showed that if we continued to comply with measures and no drastic changes are seen in diagnosis or management protocols, the epidemic curve would tend to decrease in this time interval. Also, the predictive validity analysis suggests that proposed model projections should be in the 95% PI band for the first 12 days of the projections. CONCLUSION: We expect that drastic changes in the course of the COVID-19 in Turkey will cause the model to suffer in predictive validity, and this can be used to monitor the epidemic. We hope that the discussion on these projections and the limitations of the epidemiological forecasting will be beneficial to the medical community, and policy-makers.","output":"Projecting the Course of COVID-19 in Turkey: A Probabilistic Modeling Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Communication errors and system problems negatively impact teamwork and shared decision-making and can cause patient harm.

We report an initial experience of the use of ribavirin and interferon (IFN)-2b in the management of MERS CoV at a tertiary care hospital. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: A case series of 6 patients admitted with a confirmed diagnosis of MERS CoV were treated with ribavirin and IFN-2b in addition to supportive management. The patients demographics, clinical parameters, and outcomes were recorded. Fifty-four close contacts of these patients were screened for MERS CoV. METHODS: Six patients with MERS CoV infection were included in this study. Four cases featured symptomatic disease, including pneumonia and respiratory failure, while 2 were asymptomatic close contacts of the MERS CoV patients. The MERS CoV infection was confirmed by reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction detection of the consensus viral RNA targets upstream of the E gene (UPE) and open reading frame (ORF1b) on a sputum sample. The patients demographics, comorbid conditions, time to diagnosis and initiation of treatment, and clinical outcomes were recorded.

With increasing numbers of people acquiring pets and spending time with them in confined spaces due to COVID-19 lockdowns, it is important to be aware of adverse health consequences brought about by this interaction. We present a case of B bronchiseptica pneumonia in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and review key characteristics of an additional 30 cases of B bronchiseptica infections in 29 patients with HIV/AIDS that were identified by literature review. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 61-year-old male with HIV/AIDS who was not on antiretroviral therapy and had advanced immunosuppression with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 3 cells/L sought medical attention for multiple somatic issues including subjective fevers, shortness of breath, and intermittent chest pain. DIAGNOSIS: Computed tomography of the chest identified bilateral nodular opacities in the lower lobes with scattered areas of ground glass opacities. B bronchiseptica was identified in sputum culture by mass spectrometry followed by supplementary biochemical testing. INTERVENTIONS: Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated and changed to levofloxacin after susceptibility testing was completed. OUTCOMES: The patient was discharged after symptomatic improvement with levofloxacin. LESSONS: Pneumonia with interstitial infiltrates in the setting of advanced CD4 lymphocyte depletion is the most common clinical syndrome caused by B bronchiseptica in patients with HIV/AIDS, and may be accompanied by sepsis. Advanced immune suppression, as well as chronic medical conditions, for example, alcoholism, diabetes, and renal failure that compromise host defenses are also commonly found in cases of B bronchiseptica infection in patients who do not have HIV infection. Reported animal contact among patients was not universal.

It is the first study to assess the utility of emergency teleophthalmology with a simple smartphone application or web browser and a webcam to manage emergency eye care in a population with sudden restricted access to ophthalmologists. In this study, every patient who asked for an ophthalmic emergency consultation in a single specialized center in Paris ('SOS ??il') first had to undergo a teleconsultation appointment to evaluate the indication for a physical consultation to preserve lockdown. Under medical advice only, a physical appointment was given within a day (if necessary). The aim of the study was to describe the population and diagnoses and evaluate the main judgment criteria, defined as the 'ability of teleconsultation to properly indicate a physical consultation for fair diagnosis and treatment in eye emergencies'. This organization has permitted physicians and patients to preserve social distancing while avoiding 3 or 4 physical consultations per person. Notably, 27% of teleconsultations were followed by a physical appointment. There was a mean 4.12-day delay between symptom apparition and consultation, and less than 1 day for traumas, superficial corneal foreign body and neuro-ophthalmological emergencies.

As of June 21, 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused 8,769,844 confirmed infections with 463,745 fatal cases worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is a major challenge for clinicians. In our clinic, we found a rare case that a COVID-19 patient combined with ischemic stroke. CASE PRESENTATION: A 79-year-old man was admitted to the Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine due to right limb weakness for 1 day and slight cough for 1 week. At presentation, his oxygen saturation was 94.2% on room air and body temperature was 37.3 C (99.0 F) with some moist rales. Neurological examination showed right limb weakness, and the limb muscle strength was grade 4. The left leg and arms were unaffected. In addition, runs of speech were not fluent enough with tongue deviation. Laboratory studies showed lymphopenia and eosinophilic granulocytopenia. Chest CT revealed bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities, with a peripheral lung distribution. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from throat swab sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. This patient was treated with antiviral drugs and anti-inflammatory drugs with supportive care until his discharge. Clopidogrel (75 mg) and atorvastatin (20 mg) were administered orally to treat acute ischemic stroke. After 12 days of treatment, he can walk normally and communicate with near fluent language. CONCLUSION: We report an even more unusual case, a patient who was hospitalized for right limb weakness and was later diagnosed with COVID-19. Here, SARS-CoV-2 infection caused hypoxemia and excessive secretion of inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to the occurrence and development of ischemic stroke. Once COVID-19 patients show acute ischemic stroke, neurologists should cooperate with infectious disease doctors to help patients.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on ischemic stroke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple studies have suggested the spread of COVID-19 is affected by factors such as climate, BCG vaccinations, pollution and blood type.

We conducted a systematic review for studies using measured anthropometry to examine trends in obesity in the USA published from 2012 to 2018 and for systematic reviews to document trends in obesity across the globe published from 2014 to 2018. RECENT FINDINGS For the USA, the only nationally representative data source capturing trends in obesity in this period was the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which uses repeated cross-sectional data to document national trends in obesity in the USA. For global trends, the only systematic reviews of obesity across the globe were the Global Burden of Disease Obesity study and the Non-communicable Disease Risk Factor Collaboration study. In general, the population distribution of body mass index (BMI) in the USA has shifted towards the upper end of its distribution over the past three decades. The global distribution has similarly increased, albeit with large regional differences. US and global studies suggest an increasing trend in obesity since the 1980s, and there is a dearth of nationally representative longitudinal studies using measured anthropometry to capture trends in adult obesity in the USA for the same individuals over time.

Findings from recent scientific literature in each of these areas was synthesized from an applied and/or clinical perspective with the purpose of providing clinical researchers and practitioners with practical guidance on contemporary uses of inertial sensors in applied clinical settings. EXPERT OPINION IMU-based wearable devices have undergone a rapid transition from use in laboratory-based clinical practice to unsupervised, applied settings. Successful use of wearable inertial sensing for assessing mobility, motor performance and movement disorders in applied settings will rely also on machine learning algorithms for managing the vast amounts of data generated by these sensors for extracting information that is both clinically relevant and interpretable by practitioners.","output":"Wearable inertial sensors for human movement analysis: a five-year update."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiorgan injury has been implicated in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19).

This mutation was first detected in clinical samples in Europe during the 2007-2008 influenza season. Viruses with this mutation reached a prevalence of 11% by the end of the season in North American isolates tested by the CDC. We developed a highly sensitive and specific quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay to detect the H274Y mutation. This assay utilizes a 5'-methyl-isocytosine (isoC) residue and fluorescent reporters on genotype-specific primers. During PCR, a quencher coupled to isoguanine (isoG) is site-specifically incorporated complementary to the isoC/dye, resulting in loss of fluorescence. Optimization of primers and assay conditions produced a limit of detection of 100 gene copies per reaction for both wild-type and H274Y genotypes. In samples with mixed populations, it can reliably detect as little as a 1% wild-type or 0.1% H274Y component. This high sensitivity makes the assay usable on samples with viral loads too low for dideoxy or pyrosequencing analysis. Additionally, the assay distinguishes seasonal A/H1N1 from A/H3N2, influenza B, or 2009 pandemic A/H1N1, making it useful for influenza virus subtyping as well as for drug resistance detection. We probed seasonal A/H1N1 samples from the 2005-2006, 2006-2007, and 2007-2008 influenza seasons.

In this study, we aim to assess the impact of the duration of the lockdown on glycaemic control and diabetes-related complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search was conducted using Cochrane library. A simulation model was created using glycemic data from previous disasters (taken as similar in impact to current lockdown) taking baseline HBA1c and diabetes-related complications data from India-specific database. A multivariate regression analysis was conducted to analyse the relationship between the duration of lockdown and glycaemic targets & diabetes-related complications. RESULTS: The predictive model was extremely robust (R2 = 0.99) and predicted outcomes for period of lockdown up to 90 days. The predicted increment in HBA1c from baseline at the end of 30 days and 45 days lockdown was projected as 2.26% & 3.68% respectively. Similarly, the annual predicted percentage increase in complication rates at the end of 30-day lockdown was 2.8% for non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 2.9% for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 1.5% for retinal photocoagulation, 9.3% for microalbuminuria, 14.2% for proteinuria, 2.9% for peripheral neuropathy, 10.5% for lower extremity amputation, 0.9% for myocardial infarction, 0.5% for stroke and 0.5% for infections.

That's why many scientists are working on new methods to reduce further growth of new cases and, by intelligent patients allocation, reduce number of patients per doctor, what can lead to more successful treatments. However to properly manage the COVID-19 spread there is a need for real-time prediction models which can reliably support various decisions both at national and international level. The problem in developing such system is the lack of general knowledge how the virus spreads and what would be the number of cases each day.

Tests for detection of SARS coronavirus antibody were performed for HCWs at these 2 time points and for control subjects during the SARS epidemic. SETTING Tertiary care referral center in Taipei, Taiwan. SUBJECTS Ninety SARS-care task force members (SARS HCWs) and 82 control subjects. RESULTS All serum specimens tested negative for SARS antibody. Survey scores for SARS HCWs immediately after care were significantly lower than those for the control group (P<.05 by the t test) in 6 categories. Vitality, social functioning, and mental health immediately after care and vitality and mental health after self-quarantine and off-duty shifts were among the worst subscales. The social functioning, role emotional, and role physical subscales significantly improved after self-quarantine and off-duty shifts (P<.05, by paired t test). The length of contact time (mean number of contact-hours per day) with patients with SARS was associated with some subscales (role emotional, role physical, and mental health) to a mild extent.

Here we describe the use of a convenient bacteria-based two-hybrid (B2H) system to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. We identify sixteen distinct intraviral protein-protein interactions (PPIs), involving sixteen proteins. We find that many of the identified proteins interact with more than one partner. We further show how our system facilitates the genetic dissection of these interactions, enabling the identification of selectively disruptive mutations. We also describe a modified B2H system that permits the detection of disulfide bond-dependent PPIs in the normally reducing Escherichia coli cytoplasm and we use this system to detect the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) with its cognate cell surface receptor ACE2. We then examine how the RBD-ACE2 interaction is perturbed by several RBD amino acid substitutions found in currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our findings illustrate the utility of a genetically tractable bacterial system for probing the interactions of viral proteins and investigating the effects of emerging mutations. In principle, the system could also facilitate the identification of potential therapeutics that disrupt specific interactions of virally encoded proteins.

To reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission, suspected COVID-19 patients entering the Emergency Department (ED) were assigned to a high-risk (ED) or low-risk (acute medical unit, AMU) area based on symptoms, travel and contact history. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of our pre-triage screening method and to analyse the characteristics of initially undetected COVID-19 patients. Methods. This was a retrospective, observational, single centre study. Patients  18 years visiting the AMU-ED between 17 March and 17 April 2020 were included. Primary outcome was the (correct) number of COVID-19 patients assigned to the AMU or ED. Results. In total, 1287 patients visited the AMU-ED: 525 (40.8%) AMU, 762 (59.2%) ED. Within the ED group, 304 (64.3%) of 473 tested patients were COVID-19 positive, compared to 13 (46.4%) of 28 tested patients in the AMU group. Our pre-triage screening accuracy was 63.7%. Of the 13 COVID-19 patients who were initially assigned to the AMU, all patients were 65 years of age and the majority presented with gastro-intestinal or non-specific symptoms. Conclusion. Older COVID-19 patients presenting with non-specific symptoms were more likely to remain undetected.

METHODS The programs of the GSoU meeting of 2011, 2018, 2019 and the virtual conference in 2020 were retrospectively quantified by gender and categorized by chair or speaker, type, and topic of the session. Descriptive analysis was applied. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify gender inequity and variables influencing gender distribution. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS A total of 2.504 chairs and speakers were invited to the GSoU meeting in 2018 and 2019. Female speakers or chairs were represented in 17.8%, indicating a gender gap of 64.7%. There were significant differences between session type, topic, and gender distribution for chairs and speakers. The topic surgical techniques were independent variables for both, underrepresented female chairs and speakers, respectively (p < 0.001).

However, due to limited diagnostics for influenza there is little data regarding clinical outcomes of patients with H1N1 pneumonia in our region. Our objective was to determine the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized with H1N1 pneumonia at a tertiary care facility in Karachi, Pakistan. METHODS: A retrospective study of adult patients admitted with influenza pneumonia from November 2017 to February 2018 at a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. Patient characteristics were compared between influenza A H1N1 and other types of influenza using multivariable logistic regression analysis and subgroup analysis for factors associated with mortality in H1N1 Pneumonia was performed. RESULTS: Out of 497 adult patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP), 172 fulfilled the criteria for Influenza like illness (ILI). 88 patients had PCR confirmed Influenza pneumonia of whom n = 57 (65%) had Influenza A H1N1. The mean age of patients 53.5 years (SD: 17.3) and 60% were male. The overall mortality from Influenza in this study was 15.9% (n = 14); out of these 11 (78.5%) had Influenza A H1N1. Multivariable analysis showed that the increase in length of hospital admission was significantly associated with H1N1 Influenza A infection (OR: 1.47 CI: 1.2C1.8). Factors associated with mortality showed that presence of ARDS, Septic shock and multi-organ failure was highly significantly associated with death (p-value < 0.001) along with deranged liver function tests (p-value 0.01) and presence of nosocomial infection (p-value 0.027).

BACKGROUND Acute treatment options for patients with CH who have an insufficient response to oxygen and triptans are limited. Intranasal ketamine has anecdotally been successful in treating a CH attack. METHODS We conducted an open-label pilot study enrolling 23 patients with chronic CH (International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition), and of these, 20 patients treated a single CH attack with intranasal ketamine. Under in-hospital observation, patients received 15 mg of intranasal ketamine every 6 min a maximum of five times. The primary endpoint was a 50% reduction in pain intensity within 15 min after initiating treatment. RESULTS The primary endpoint was not met; 15 min after the first ketamine administration, the mean reduction in pain intensity was 1.1 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.6 to 2.7, p = 0.188) on the numeric rating scale (NRS), equivalent to a 15% reduction in pain intensity. However, 30 min after the first application, the pain intensity was reduced by 59% on an 11-point NRS (mean difference: 4.3, 95% CI: 2.4-6.2, p < 0.001, N = 16) and 11 out of 16 (69%) scored 4 or below on the NRS. Four patients received rescue medication 15 min after the first ketamine application and were therefore excluded from the analysis at 30 min. Half of the patients preferred ketamine to oxygen and/or sumatriptan injection. No serious adverse events were identified during the trial. CONCLUSION Intranasal ketamine may be an effective acute treatment for CH at 30 min but should be tested in a larger controlled design.

We sought to assess psychiatrists' knowledge of advance directives, as this knowledge is fundamental to the implementation and drafting of these personal documents. METHODS: A previously published questionnaire that evaluated the knowledge of medical professors was used. The sample, composed of psychiatrists from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, originated from a publicly available list. During the search process, the COVID-19 pandemic affected Brazil and the rest of the world, which influenced our methodology and results. RESULTS: A total of 40 psychiatrists participated in the study. The results obtained, although not significant, suggested that psychiatrists with an increased time of practice had more knowledge of advance directives. Nevertheless, less than half of the participants had knowledge about this topic. CONCLUSION: The number of psychiatrists surveyed indicates the need for further studies on the subject. The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on this study led to findings such as a change in sensitivity when addressing the topic and greater difficulty in contacting professionals.","output":"Advance Directives: Knowledge of the Topic Among Psychiatrists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our hospital is one of the tertiary care hospitals in Oman receiving COVID-19 (C19) patients.

Yet Glaeser carefully evades the fundamental ethnoracial inequalities at the heart of Turner's frontier thesis, which were inseparable from the Social Darwinist hijacking of evolutionary thought that corrupted economics and other social sciences beginning in the late 19th century. In this paper, the Glaeser-Turner genealogy is used to interpret today's evolving materialities and discourses of race, class, identity, and urbanism.

The present mixed-methods study explores COVID-19-related changes in college student drinking. We characterize concomitant changes in social and location drinking contexts and describe reasons attributed to changes in drinking. METHODS: We conducted two studies of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on drinking behavior, drinking context, and reasons for both increases and decreases in consumption among college students. Study 1 (qualitative) included 18 heavy-drinking college students (Mage = 20.2; 56% female) who completed semi-structured interviews. Study 2 (quantitative) included 312 current and former college students who reported use of alcohol and cannabis (Mage = 21.3; 62% female) and who completed an online survey. RESULTS: In both studies, COVID-19-related increases in drinking frequency were accompanied by decreases in quantity, heavy drinking, and drunkenness. Yet, in Study 2, although heavier drinkers reduced their drinking, among non-heavy drinkers several indices of consumption increased or remained stable . Both studies also provided evidence of reductions in social drinking with friends and roommates and at parties and increased drinking with family. Participants confirmed that their drinking decreased due to reduced social opportunities and/or settings, limited access to alcohol, and reasons related to health and self-discipline. Increases were attributed to greater opportunity (more time) and boredom and to a lesser extent, lower perceived risk of harm and to cope with distress. CONCLUSION: This study documents COVID-19-related changes in drinking among college student drinkers that were attributable to changes in context, particularly a shift away from heavy drinking with peers to lighter drinking with family. Given the continued threat of COVID-19, it is imperative for researchers, administrators, and parents to understand these trends as they may have lasting effects on college student drinking behaviors.","output":"Changes in Alcohol Use and Drinking Context due to the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multimethod Study of College Student Drinkers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN Recientemente hemos conocido una decisin judicial, en relacin con un paciente nonagenario COVID-19, que resulta absolutamente clarificadora respecto a la siempre compleja cuestin de los internamientos y tratamientos involuntarios de las personas mayores El rgano judicial autoriz el internamiento involuntario, pero por el contrario deneg la posibilidad de imponer un tratamiento mdico en contra de la voluntad del paciente Esta situacin invita a revisar los diferentes tipos de internamiento involuntario que prev nuestro ordenamiento jurdico y cmo se regula el tratamiento mdico involuntario en funcin de su finalidad y de la capacidad del paciente para decidir, permitindose desde la ausencia de consentimiento a la posibilidad del consentimiento por representacin En el mbito de la salud pblica, el elemento determinante para poder imponer cualquier medida sanitaria en contra de la voluntad del paciente es, nica y exclusivamente, el riesgo para la salud de la poblacin En el caso presentado, el rgano judicial rechaza la posibilidad autorizar el tratamiento mdico por no aportar nada desde el punto de vista de la salud pblica a los intereses de terceros Sin embargo, s autoriza el internamiento involuntario por ser esencial para garantizar el aislamiento ABSTRACT We had the opportunity to know a judicial decision in relation to a nonagenarian COVID-19 patient, which is clarifying regarding the complex issue of involuntary admission and involuntary treatment of the elderly The judge authorized the involuntary admission but denied the possibility of imposing medical treatment against the will of the patient This situation invites us to review the different types of involuntary admission that our legal system provides and how involuntary medical treatment is regulated according to its purpose and the patient's ability to decide In the field of public health, the determining element to be able to impose any sanitary measure against the will of the patient is the risk to the health of the population In the case presented, the judge rejects the possibility of authorizing medical treatment for not contributing anything from the point of view of public health However, it does authorize involuntary admission as it is essential to guarantee isolation","output":"COVID-19: Internamiento involuntario s, tratamiento obligatorio no"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, reliable diagnostics are absolutely indispensable.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of online learning which may affect engagement and concentration, particularly for those students with specific learning difficulties. AIMS: Students would show lower scores on all the measures of student experience when judging these during online learning versus learning within the classroom. This negative impact of online learning on concentration, engagement, perceived learning, and self-worth compared to classroom education would be more significant for those with specific learning difficulties. The drop in student experience scores due to online learning would be associated with poorer mental well-being. SAMPLE: Four hundred seven pupils aged 11-18 years at a secondary education school in Wales. METHODS: A retrospective online survey comparing pupils' normal classroom experience to learning online during the first national lockdown in the United Kingdom (March-July 2020). RESULTS: Pupils' learning experiences (concentration, engagement, ability to learn, and self-worth from learning) were significantly lower for online learning compared to the classroom learning. These differences were more marked in students with specific learning difficulties. Perceived ability to learn and engage during classroom and online learning were also associated with mental well-being. CONCLUSIONS: The move to online learning appears to have affected students' ability to concentrate and engage in their schoolwork and appears to have reduced their ability to learn and get self-worth from their work.

This paper presents a marker-less mobile AR application for the display and inspection of high-resolution 3D cultural assets, overlayed on a particular location in the real-world scene. Instead of predefined markers, an image captured by the user is exploited as a pattern for real-time feature matching, pose estimation and scene augmentation. Our approach is based on pure computer vision and photogrammetric techniques, implemented using native C++ and Java code for Android mobile platforms. It is built with the use of the OpenCV library and the OpenGL ES graphics API without any dependencies of AR Software Development Kits (SDKs). Therefore, it supports cross-vendor portability regarding mobile model devices and hardware specifications. The evaluation of the developed application examines the performance of various matching techniques and the overall responsiveness of processing and 3D rendering on mid-range and low-end smartphones.

It is extremely difficult to build a general assembler that is able to reconstruct the original sequence instead of many contigs. However, we believe that creating specific assemblers, for solving specific cases, will be much more fruitful than creating general assemblers. FINDINGS: In this paper, we present Arapan-S, a whole-genome assembly program dedicated to handling small genomes. It provides only one contig (along with the reverse complement of this contig) in many cases. Although genomes consist of a number of segments, the implemented algorithm can detect all the segments, as we demonstrate for Influenza Virus A. The Arapan-S program is based on the de Bruijn graph. We have implemented a very sophisticated and fast method to reconstruct the original sequence and neglect erroneous k-mers. The method explores the graph by using neither the shortest nor the longest path, but rather a specific and reliable path based on the coverage level or k-mers lengths. Arapan-S uses short reads, and it was tested on raw data downloaded from the NCBI Trace Archive. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that the accuracy of the assembly was very high; the result was checked against the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) database using the NCBI BLAST Sequence Similarity Search. The identity and the genome coverage was more than 99%. We also compared the efficiency of Arapan-S with other well-known assemblers. In dealing with small genomes, the accuracy of Arapan-S is significantly higher than the accuracy of other assemblers. The assembly process is very fast and requires only a few seconds.

However, the clinically approved modulators only partially reverse CFTR dysfunction and there is still a considerable number of individuals with CF carrying rare CFTR mutations who remain without any effective CFTR modulator therapy. Accordingly, additional efforts have been pursued to identify novel and more potent CFTR modulators that may benefit a larger CF population. The use of ex vivo individual-derived specimens has also become a powerful tool to evaluate novel drugs and predict their effectiveness in a personalized medicine approach. In addition to CFTR modulators, pro-drugs aiming at modulating alternative ion channels/transporters are under development to compensate for the lack of CFTR function. These therapies may restore normal mucociliary clearance through a mutation-agnostic approach (ie, independent of CFTR mutation) and include inhibitors of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), modulators of the calcium-activated channel transmembrane 16A (TMEM16, or anoctamin 1) or of the solute carrier family 26A member 9 (SLC26A9), and anionophores. The present review focuses on recent progress and challenges for the development of ion channel/transporter-modulating drugs for the treatment of CF.","output":"Pharmacological Modulation of Ion Channels for the Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: New York City (NYC) was an epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the United States during the spring of 2020 with approximately 203,000 laboratory-confirmed cases reported from March to May of 2020. Jamaica Hospital Medical Center (JHMC) and Flushing Hospital Medical Center (FHMC) are both located in Queens, New York, one of the NYC boroughs with the largest number of COVID-19 cases. While managing COVID-19 patients, we observed an increased prevalence of severe hyperglycemia and DKA in COVID-19 patients with increased insulin requirements. We conducted a study to compare the prevalence of DKA, insulin requirements, and time to resolution of DKA from March 15 to May 15 of 2019 to the same period in 2020. This study will help us better manage these patients during this ongoing pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients aged 18 years and older hospitalized for DKA at JHMC & FHMC between March 15th and May 15th of 2019 and 2020. We looked at age, sex, serum glucose, serum betahydroxybutyrate, steroid use, subcutaneous insulin requirements, time to resolution of DKA, etc., along with clinical notes. Our study was appropriately powered to find a 10 unit increase in daily subcutaneous insulin requirement. The statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 19.0. Normalcy was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Statistical significance was assessed with the Mann-Whitney U Test. RESULTS: The number of DKA cases was 27 in 2019 versus 76 in 2020. Out of those 76 cases, 52 of them were COVID-19 positive. There was an increased use of steroids in patients with COVID-19 and DKA compared to the non-COVID-19 patients with DKA. Despite this, there was no statistically significant difference in time to resolution of DKA or insulin requirements in patients with COVID-19 and DKA identified in our study. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with an increased prevalence of DKA. There is no difference in time to resolution of DKA or insulin requirements in patients with DKA and COVID-19 compared to patients without COVID-19 identified in our study.","output":"The effect of COVID-19 on diabetic ketoacidosis management and outcomes: The experience of two NYC Hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The confinement of the population for an indefinite period within the framework of the national French prevention strategy of Covid-19 has a negative psychosocial impact already documented in other countries.

In this work, we propose an experimental testbed to analyze the performance of a WSN using the IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA/CA unslotted mode under jamming attacks in terms of goodput, packet receive rate (PRR), and energy consumption to assess the risk for users and the network in the smart scenario.

The measurements obtained using the experimental testbed were correlated with analytical models. The results show that in the presence of one interferer, for SINR values higher than [Formula: see text] dB, the PRR is almost [Formula: see text] , and the goodput [Formula: see text] Kbps, but the system performance is significantly degraded when the amount of interferers increases.

METHODS: The multiple-access outpatient pathway and the telemedicine pathway were both performed with WatchPAT and implemented in a real-life healthcare scenario, adopting a cost-minimization approach. A cost-minimization analysis was undertaken to assess the economic impact of the two alternatives. The cost analyses were performed in euros for the year 2021 adopting the patient, the hospital, and the societal perspectives. Given the chosen perspectives, direct medical costs, direct nonmedical costs, and indirect costs were considered. In addition, a univariate sensitivity analysis was conducted. RESULTS: From a hospital perspective, the telemedicine approach was estimated to cost 49 more than the multiple-access alternative. Considering the patient perspective, the telemedicine approach was estimated to cost 167 less than the multiple-access pathway.

However, our multi-group analysis revealed that the indirect effects of COVID-19 on OCBs were only valid amongst younger generations, i.e., Generation Y and Generation Z. Finally, our hypothesised model is not invariant across Generations X, Y and Z.

Our aim is to document hematological parameters of patients with COVID-19 during initial stage of diagnosis and to identify early hematological indicators of severe infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at Shifa International Hospital, Pakistan from April to November 2020. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19, diagnosed on RT-PCR and had a complete blood count (CBC) done within 48 hours of diagnosis were included. Data was analyzed using IBM? SPSS Statistics. RESULTS: A total of 425 patients were included in this study out of whom 272(64%) were males. The mean age was 55.61  17.84 years. 95 patients (22.4%) had normal blood counts within 48 hours of COVID-19 diagnosis. Cytopenias were seen in 193(45.4%) patients. There were 75(17.6%) mortalities during the study period. Chi-square test showed that thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and neutrophilic leucocytosis were significantly associated with mortality (P = .037, P < .001, P < .001 respectively) and need for ventilator (P = .009, P < .001, P < .001, respectively). Neutrophilia was also associated with development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (P < .001). On ROC analysis, Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.693 and 0.660 for the outcomes mortality and need for ventilator, respectively. For a subset of 288 patients who had D-dimer levels checked within 48 hours of COVID-19 diagnosis, the AUC for mortality and ventilator need was 0.708 and 0.671, respectively.

This pattern of overuse contributes to inefficient health care spending. These patients require coordinated care to achieve optimal health outcomes. However, the poor exchange of health-related information between various clinicians renders the delivery of coordinated care challenging. Health information exchanges (HIEs) facilitate health-related information sharing and have been shown to be effective in chronic disease management; however, their effectiveness in the delivery of integrated care is less clear. It is prudent to consider new approaches to sharing both general medical and behavioral health information. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify and describe factors influencing the intention to use behavioral health information that is shared through HIEs. METHODS: We used a mixed methods design consisting of two sequential phases. A validated survey instrument was emailed to clinical and nonclinical staff in Alabama and Oklahoma. The survey captured information about the impact of predictors on the intention to use behavioral health data in clinical decision making. Follow-up interviews were conducted with a subsample of participants to elaborate on the survey results. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze survey data. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes from the interviews. RESULTS: A total of 62 participants completed the survey. In total, 63% (n=39) of the participants were clinicians. Performance expectancy (=.382; P=.01) and trust (=.539; P<.001) predicted intention to use behavioral health information shared via HIEs. The interviewees (n=5) expressed that behavioral health information could be useful in clinical decision making. However, privacy and confidentiality concerns discourage sharing this information, which is generally missing from patient records altogether. The interviewees also stated that training for HIE use was not mandatory; the training that was provided did not focus specifically on the exchange of behavioral health information. CONCLUSIONS: Despite barriers, individuals are willing to use behavioral health information from HIEs if they believe that it will enhance job performance and if the information being transmitted is trustworthy. The findings contribute to our understanding of the role HIEs can play in delivering integrated care, particularly to vulnerable patients.","output":"Intention to Use Behavioral Health Data From a Health Information Exchange: Mixed Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents unique challenges to Asian countries like Singapore with a predominantly Confucian culture.

Notably, coinfection of TGEV and PEDV is common in piglets with diarrhea-related diseases. In this study, intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) were single or coinfected with PEDV and/or TGEV, followed by the comparison of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), especially interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), between different groups via transcriptomics analysis and real-time qPCR. The antiviral activity of swine interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (sIFITM3) on PEDV and TGEV infection was also evaluated. The results showed that DEGs can be detected in the cells infected with PEDV, TGEV, and PEDV+TGEV at 12, 24, and 48 hpi, and the number of DEGs was the highest at 24 hpi. The DEGs are mainly annotated to the GO terms of protein binding, immune system process, organelle part, and intracellular organelle part. Furthermore, 90 ISGs were upregulated during PEDV or TGEV infection, 27 of which were associated with antiviral activity, including ISG15, OASL, IFITM1, and IFITM3. Furthermore, sIFITM3 can significantly inhibit PEDV and TGEV infection in porcine IPEC-J2 cells and/or monkey Vero cells. Besides, sIFITM3 can also inhibit vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication in Vero cells.

Contact tracing is made ineffective, however, by delays in testing, calling, and isolating. Even if delays are minimized, contact tracing triggered by testing of symptomatic individuals can only prevent a fraction of onward transmissions from contacts. Without other measures in place, contact tracing alone is insufficient to prevent exponential growth in the number of cases in a population with little immunity. Even when used effectively with other measures, occasional bursts in call loads can overwhelm contact tracing systems and lead to a loss of control. We propose embracing approaches to COVID-19 contact tracing that broadly test individuals without symptoms, in whatever way is economically feasible-either with fast and cheap tests that can be deployed widely, with pooled testing, or with screening of judiciously chosen groups of high-risk individuals.

There is increasing evidence that a combination of inflammation and hypercoagulable state are the main mechanisms of respiratory failure in these patients. This narrative review aims to summarize currently available evidence on the complex interplay of immune dysregulation, hypercoagulability, and thrombosis in the pathogenesis of respiratory failure in COVID-19 disease. In addition, we will describe the experience of anticoagulation and anti-inflammatory strategies that have been tested. Profound suppression of the adaptive and hyperactivity of innate immune systems with macrophage activation appears to be a prominent feature in this infection. Immune dysregulation together with endotheliitis and severe hypercoagulability results in thromboinflammation and microvascular thrombosis in the pulmonary vasculature leading to severe respiratory distress. Currently, some guidelines recommend the use of prophylactic low molecular weight heparin in all hospitalized patients, with intermediate dose prophylaxis in those needing intensive care, and the use of therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with proven or suspected thrombosis. Strong recommendations cannot be made until this approach is validated by trial results. To target the inflammatory cascade, low-dose dexamethasone appears to be helpful in moderate to severe cases and trials with anti-interleukin agents (e.g., tocilizumab, anakinra, siltuximab) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are showing early promising results. Potential newer agents (e.g., Janus kinase inhibitor such as ruxolitinib, baricitinib, fedratinib) are likely to be investigated in clinical trials. Unfortunately, current trials are mostly examining these agents in isolation and there may be a significant delay before evidence-based practice can be implemented. It is plausible that a combination of anti-viral drugs together with anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulation medicines will be the most successful strategy in managing severely affected patients with COVID-19.","output":"The Interplay Between Coagulation and Inflammation Pathways in COVID-19-Associated Respiratory Failure: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2017 revision of WHO Classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues contains separate chapters on the immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders In this mini-review, the brief description of pathological, immunophenotypical and clinical features of lymphoid neoplasms associated with primary immune disorders, HIV infection, those arising in post-transplant setting and other lymphoproliferative disorders (excluding those induced by radiation) is given The heterogeneous spectrum of these lymphoid malignancies is specified by the nature of those factors that are capable to induce immune suppression or chronic antigenic stimulation of immune system Taking into account the full swing of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and our ignorance of the ability of this virus to induce the sustained stimulation of immune system, we could not exclude the high risk of autoimmune diseases and lymphoid neoplasms in the long-term post-pandemic period In this context, the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as well as some recently reported cell receptors for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry should be considered as far as some of them (CD147, CD26) could be tumor-associated antigens","output":"Immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders and lymphoid neoplasms in post-COVID-19 pandemic era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pharmaceutical industry is constantly striving for innovative ways to bridge the translational gap between preclinical and clinical drug development to reduce attrition.

Understanding its pathogenesis is crucial to guide prognostic and therapeutic implications. Viral infections are known to alter the lipid profile and metabolism of their host cells, similar to the case with MERS and SARS-CoV-2002. Since lipids play various metabolic roles, studying lipid profile alterations in COVID-19 is an inevitable step as an attempt to achieve better therapeutic strategies, as well as a potential prognostic factor in the course of this disease. Several studies have reported changes in lipid profile associated with COVID-19. The most frequently reported changes are a decline in serum cholesterol and ApoA1 levels and elevated triglycerides. The hyper-inflammatory state mediated by the Cytokine storm disturbs several fundamental lipid biosynthesis pathways. Virus replication is a process that drastically changes the host cell's lipid metabolism program and overuses cell lipid resources. Lower HDL-C and ApoA1 levels are associated with higher severity and mortality rates and with higher levels of inflammatory markers. Studies suggest that arachidonic acid omega-3 derivatives might help modulate hyper-inflammation and cytokine storm resulting from pulmonary involvement.

Respondents suggested that the distress would be reduced if: more resources were provided in hospital;protocols and guidelines were implemented and counselling facilities with recreational activities were available to frontline workers.ConclusionThis study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental health of healthcare workers and more support or strategies need to come in place to protect frontline workers at the time of crises.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of healthcare workers in different regions of the world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The global COVID-19 pandemic creates an obvious acute health care resourcing and response problem. The different timing of pandemic peak in geographically distinct locations creates a short window of response opportunity. Rapid dissemination of medical information from early affected areas to later ones is therefore crucial to optimise planning. Formulating the best system response for at-risk patient populations is especially complex. People with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) are exposed to long-term immunosuppressive disease modifying treatments (DMTs) and, in theory, could be at increased risk of contracting the virus and developing complications. Social media, such as Twitter, can provide a global platform to rapidly share information and individual experiences. METHODS AND RESULTS: This report summarizes the case experience of pwMS with COVID-19 infection in the first month of the pandemic as reported on Twitter using the #MSCOVID19 hashtag. 26 individual cases of COVID-19 in pwMS were reported from Europe and the United States of America. The cases involved a combination of relapsing and progressive MS phenotypes treated with a range of DMT (5 anti CD20 therapy, 4 cladribine, 4 fingolimod, 4 injectables, 3 alemtuzumab, 2 dimethyl fumarate, 2 untreated, 1 teriflunomide, 1 natalizumab). The cases shared present the earliest reported data on outcomes of COVID-19 infection in pwMS. Whilst limited, the cautiously reassuring nature of these early cases assisted in clinical management by allowing neurologists to continuously reassess their approach to DMT management.","output":"MSCOVID19: Using social media to achieve rapid dissemination of health information"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exosomes are cell-derived nanovesicles that hold promise as living vehicles for intracellular delivery of therapeutics to mammalian cells. This potential, however, is undermined by the lack of effective methods to load exosomes with therapeutic proteins and to facilitate their uptake by target cells. Here, we demonstrate how a vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) can both load protein cargo onto exosomes and increase their delivery ability via a pseudotyping mechanism. By fusing a set of fluorescent and luminescent reporters with VSVG, we show the successful targeting and incorporation of VSVG fusions into exosomes by gene transfection and fluorescence tracking. We subsequently validate our system by live cell imaging of VSVG and its participation in endosomes/exosomes that are ultimately released from transfected HEK293 cells. We show that VSVG pseudotyping of exosomes does not affect the size or distributions of the exosomes, and both the full-length VSVG and the VSVG without the ectodomain are shown to integrate into the exosomal membrane, suggesting that the ectodomain is not required for protein loading. Finally, exosomes pseudotyped with full-length VSVG are internalized by multiple-recipient cell types to a greater degree compared to exosomes loaded with VSVG without the ectodomain, confirming a role of the ectodomain in cell tropism. In summary, our work introduces a new genetically encoded pseudotyping platform to load and enhance the intracellular delivery of therapeutic proteins via exosome-based vehicles to target cells.","output":"Pseudotyping exosomes for enhanced protein delivery in mammalian cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reactive poly(pentafluorophenyl acrylate) (PPFPA)-grafted surfaces offer a versatile platform to immobilize biomolecules. Here, we utilize PPFPA-grafted surface and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) recognizing J2 antibody to construct a universal virus detection platform with enhanced sensitivity. PPFPA on silicon substrates is prepared, and surface hydrophilicity is modulated by partial substitution of the pentafluorophenyl units with poly(ethylene glycol). Following dsRNA antibody immobilization, the prepared surfaces can distinguish long dsRNAs from single-stranded RNAs of the same length and short dsRNAs. As long dsRNAs are common byproducts of viral transcription/replication, these surfaces can detect the presence of different kinds of viruses without prior knowledge of their genomic sequences. To increase dsRNA detection sensitivity, a two-step method is devised where the captured dsRNAs are visualized with multiple fluorophore-tagged J2 antibodies. We show that the developed platform can differentiate foreign long dsRNAs from cellular dsRNAs and other biomolecules present in the cell lysate. Moreover, when tested against cells infected with hepatitis A or C viruses, both viruses are successfully detected using a single platform. Our study shows that the developed PPFPA platform immobilized with J2 antibody can serve as a primary diagnostic tool to determine the infection status for a wide range of viruses.","output":"Reactive Polymer Targeting dsRNA as Universal Virus Detection Platform with Enhanced Sensitivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To identify validated dermatology-specific and disease-specific psychosocial needs assessment tools for caregivers of paediatric patients with dermatological conditions.

Grey literature, bibliographies, online databases of QoL tools and several trial registers were searched (2000C5 Oct 2021). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Eligible studies involved adult caregivers caring for a child (no age limit) with any form of any skin condition. Predetermined exclusion criteria, as per protocol, were applied to the search results. DATA ABSTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Title, abstract, full-text screening and data abstraction (standardised forms) were done independently in duplicate. Boths predefined methodological criteria assessed risk of bias. Narrative synthesis was used to present the findings. RESULTS: 187 full-text articles were examined from a total of 8979 records. Most tools were generic QoL tools, relevant to spouse/partner or based on their childs perception of the disease or assessed patients quality of life. Following quality appraisal, 26 articles were identified, and 11 tools (1 dermatology-specific and 10 disease-specific) were included. Information outcome domains were provided for each tool (study specific, questionnaire specific, adequacy of measurement properties and risk of bias). No literature was found pertaining to the use of these tools within healthcare settings and/or as e-tools. DISCUSSION: With limited evidence supporting the quality of their methodological and measurement properties, this review will inform future dermatological Core Outcome Set development and improve evidence-based clinical decisions.

Herein, we provide a descriptive review of the violative companies and their products in question.Methods: We examined the warning and notice of violation letters to companies posted on the FDA webpage over a 6-month period from March 6-August 31. Of all letters, we identified the product in violation, the venue of promotion, violation type, and country of the violating firm.Findings: A total of 93 letters were reported. Across all letters, USA-based companies had the leading number of warning and violation letters. The most common product category was CBD-containing products, followed by essential oils, and approved drug products for off-label use. While all letters reported the promotion of unapproved product(s) (93/93;100%), the majority of letters reported misbranding (90/93;97%), and/or had claims that lacked scientific substantiation (83/93;89%). Finally, all promotional violations were linked to websites, along with other mainstream venue(s): Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, and/or email.Interpretation: Despite the desperate need of COVID-19 treatments, it remains mandatory for the promotion of products by companies to comply to standard regulatory requirements. As the pandemic persists, the FDA must continue their efforts to monitor, inspect, and enforce violative companies.

The complexity of this condition requires a whole-person centered approach. In response to COVID-19 outbreak, telerehabilitation has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional in-person visits. PURPOSE: The aim of this report was to present the potential of telerehabilitation for persistent postpartum PGP within the biopsychosocial framework. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 26-year-old female presented with persistent pregnancy-related PGP of 8 months duration after her first vaginal delivery. The video-consults were performed using telerehabilitation platform. The patient received six telerehabilitation consults of 45 min duration over five weeks. Assessment of physical and psychosocial factors, cognitively focused strategies including pain neurophysiology education, sensory-motor remapping exercises, and graded increase of activity were administered. Rehabilitation was divided into the following phases: assessment, desensitization, graded exposure, and supported independence. OUTCOMES: The Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire (PGQ) score was significantly reduced from 72.2 during the assessment to 15.3 at discharge. This change was significantly more substantial than the minimal clinically important change estimated for the PGQ.

Method: Eighty infants underwent postoperative invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 12 h and planned extubation. The infants were randomized to undergo either NHFOV or NCPAP after extubation. Primary outcomes were the incidence of PRF and reintubation, the average PaCO(2) level, the average oxygenation index (OI), and pulmonary recruitment in the early extubation phase. Secondary outcomes included the NCPAP/NHFOV time, length of hospital stay, treatment intolerance, signs of discomfort, pneumothorax, adverse hemodynamic effects, nasal trauma, and mortality. Results: Except for PaCO(2) within 12 after extubation (39.3  5.8 vs. 43.6  7.3 mmHg, p = 0.05), there was no statistically significant difference for any of the primary outcome measure (PRF, reintubation within 12 h after extubation, oxygenation index within 12 h after extubation, or lung volumes on X-ray after extubation) or secondary outcome measures (duration of non-invasive ventilation, duration of hospital stay, ventilation intolerance, signs of discomfort, pneumothorax, nasal trauma, adverse hemodynamic effects, or death prior to discharge), p > 0.1 for each comparison.

The tool has been successfully applied to several virus families, although it may not work well for virus families with highly diverse genome organization. The PASC tool at NCBI established distributions of identity for a number of virus families. A new virus sequence can be tested with this system within a few minutes to suggest the taxonomic position of the virus in a specific family. This system eliminates potential discrepancies in the results caused by different algorithms and/or different data used by the virology community.

The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a significant disruption in the provision of dental services globally. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on dental services provided in Australia through the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of Medicare data on utilization of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule obtained from the Australian Government. Data were analysed for the period February to September 2020, with the number of services provided per month across five categories (diagnostic, preventive, restorative, endodontic and oral surgery) compared with the monthly average for 2019 (95% CI) and the same month for 2019. Total services by month were reported for 2017, 2018 and 2019 to compare the yearly trend with 2020. Differences in services provision by State/Territory were also described. RESULTS: Over the period of March to September, there were 881 454 fewer dental services provided in 2020 than 2019, with the largest decline seen in April. There was a greater decline in preventive and diagnostic services, and a smaller decline in endodontic and oral surgery services. A second wave of COVID-19 in Victoria saw 198 609 fewer dental services provided in that state from July to September 2020 than 2019. Dental service provision had still not returned to normal levels across Australia by September 2020. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the provision of dental services to children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who already experience higher levels of dental disease and disadvantage in accessing dental care. Although the restriction of dental services was deemed necessary in order to minimize the risk of transmission of COVID-19 in the dental setting, the impact of these restrictions on oral health will be long lasting. Given the chronic and progressive nature of dental disease, the deferral of necessary dental care is likely to contribute to poorer oral health and long-term problems for many Australians.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on the provision of paediatric dental care: Analysis of the Australian Child Dental Benefits Schedule"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), causing a global pandemic with devastating effects on healthcare and social-economic systems, has no special antiviral therapies available for human coronaviruses (CoVs).

It is true that no one knows if the COVID-19 pandemic that attacks all countries in the world has had many adverse effects on society. One of the most important impacts is the decline in income and business due to government policies that require reducing the number of people gathering or creating crowds in Indonesia. As a result of this decreased income, employers made efforts to lay off employees to prevent their business from rolling down. However, this policy creates losses for employees who work in the place of business. The conclusion that can be drawn is a violation of the contents of the agreement if when laying off employees or workers but they do not give their rights, namely salary, because salary is the right of every employee who works, and when leaving but not returning to employ an employee where the contract is still valid it is a violation of the contents of the contract, except with the agreement and conditions to terminate the employee's unilateral contract with compensation for severance pay by the hotel.

According to the cycles of threshold (Ct) values of qPCR testing, samples are judged as positive or negative. However, samples with Ct values in the gray zone are classified as \\"possibly positive\\" and required to be tested again. Repetitive qPCR may not eliminate the uncertain results but increase the workload of detection. CRISPR/Cas12a can specifically recognize the nucleic acid of the nM level and then indiscriminately slash the single-strand DNA with multiple turnovers. In this way, the detection signals can be greatly amplified. Here, we propose a CRISPR-based checking method to solve gray zone problems. After qPCR testing, the screening gray zone samples can be successfully checked by the CRISPR/Cas12a method. Furthermore, to conduct CRISPR reaction assay more conveniently and prevent possible aerosol contamination in the operational process, a gray zone checking cassette is designed. African swine fever virus (ASFV) is selected as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of the CRISPR-based checking method. Of 28 real swine blood samples, 6 ASFV qPCR gray zone samples are successfully checked. The CRISPR-based checking method provides a novel solution to eliminate gray zone sample problems with no additional effects on the PCR, which is operable and applicable in practical detection. The entire process can be completed within 10-15 min.

Students were surveyed on their perceived overall impact of Covid-19 on their training and several exposure variables. Univariate analyses and adjusted multivariable analysis were performed to determine strengths in associations. RESULTS: A total of 1604 eligible participants from 45 countries took part in this survey and 56.3% (n = 860) of these were female. The median age was 21 (Inter Quartile Range:21C23). Nearly half (49.6%, n = 796) of medical students were in their clinical years. The majority (n = 1356, 84.5%) were residents of a low or middle income country. A total of 1305 (81.4%) participants reported that the Covid-19 pandemic had an overall negative impact on their training. On adjusted analysis, being 21 or younger, females, those reporting a decline in conventional lectures and ward based teaching were more likely to report an overall negative impact on their training (p  0.001).

The joint relief team regularly visited all evacuation shelters across the area to assess the situation of resource supply levels, infrastructural damage, rapid need of resources, and the health status of the evacuees. In this cross-sectional observational study, we evaluated the relationship between the resource supply levels and health status among evacuees in two time periods (days 14C19 and 20C25). Among the evaluated vital resources, clean tap water supply was among the most disrupted by the disaster, and was not fully restored in most shelters during the assessment period. The cross-sectional relationship between resource supplies and morbidity was inconsistent between the two assessment periods, reflecting the multifactorial nature of health status in evacuation shelters. The clean tap water supply level at the first assessment showed a strong negative correlation with the subsequent prevalence of respiratory or gastrointestinal infectious conditions at the second assessment. Restorations in the clean tap water supply and toilet hygiene correlated each other, and both correlated with a decrease in the prevalence of gastrointestinal infectious conditions.

Having a patient-facing role and working outside your home were important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the end of the first wave (April 26 to June 28, 2020), but not in the second wave (from the end of August to Nov 1, 2020). Age (young adults, particularly those aged 17-24 years) was an important initial driver of increased positivity rates in the second wave. For example, the estimated percentage of individuals testing positive was more than six times higher in those aged 17-24 years than in those aged 70 years or older at the end of September, 2020. A substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms around their positive test (45-68%, dependent on calendar time. INTERPRETATION: Important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 varied substantially between the part of the first wave that was captured by the study (April to June, 2020) and the first part of the second wave of increased positivity rates (end of August to Nov 1, 2020), and a substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important for managing the COVID-19 pandemic moving forwards.

METHODS: Patients hospitalized for HF from 52 hospitals in China were enrolled between 2016 and 2018. They were divided into developing and validating cohorts; the developing cohort was used for calculating the weights of biomarkers and constructing the multi-biomarker panel, while the validating one was used for evaluating the relationship between multi-biomarker points and outcomes. In total, five conventional biomarkers reflecting various pathophysiological processes were included in the panel: N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity troponin T, hemoglobin, albumin, and creatinine. The weights of the biomarkers were defined based on their relationship with cardiovascular death, and each patient had a multi-biomarker point ranging from 0 to 12. The primary clinical outcome was cardiovascular death, and the other clinical outcomes included rehospitalization for HF, all-cause death, and all-cause rehospitalization in 1-year. The quality of life was measured using Kansas City Cardiovascular Questionnaire. Multi-variable Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the risks of clinical outcomes, and generalized linear models were used to evaluate the quality of life. RESULTS: In total, 4,693 patients hospitalized for HF were included in this analysis; the median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 67 (57C75) years old and 1,763 (37.6%) were female. The median multi-biomarker point was 5 (IQR, 2C6). There were 18.0% of patients in the low point group (<2), 29.4% in the mid-low point group (2C4), 27.8% in the mid-high point group (5C6), and 24.7% in the high point group (>6). Compared with those in the low point group, the patients in the high point group had a significantly excess risk of cardiovascular death (adjusted hazard ratio: 5.69, 95% CI, 3.33C9.70). Furthermore, patients with higher points were also more prone to worse quality of life. CONCLUSION: Systemic impairment reflected by abnormal conventional biomarker values was common amongst patients hospitalized for HF and had substantially cumulative adverse influence on clinical outcomes and quality of life.","output":"Multi-Biomarker Points and Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized for Heart Failure: Insights From the China PEACE Prospective Heart Failure Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Little is known on potential socioeconomic and gender disparities in dietary changes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We aimed to evaluate by global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) whether there is subclinical myocardial deformation after COVID-19 infection. Two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) was performed within 29.5  4.5 days after COVID-19 treatment. The standard GLS limit was identified at < ?18%. The patients were divided into two groups according to their hs-TnI levels during hospitalization as with (> 11.6 ng/dl) and without (< 11.6 ng/dl) myocardial injury. Patients (n = 74) mean age was 59.9 years, and women were in the majority (60.8%). Of the patients, 43.2% of them were hypertensive, and 10.9% were diabetic. Abnormal LV-GLS values (> ?18) were measured in 28 patients (37.8%). While 16 (57.1%) of these patients were in the group with myocardial injury, 12 (26.1%) of them were in the group without myocardial injury (p = 0.014).

Determining the optimal levels of nutrient supplies to cultures can eliminate feeding of excess nutrients, lowering production costs and reducing nutrient pollution into the environment. With the advent of omics and bioinformatics methods, it is now possible to construct genome-scale models that accurately describe the metabolism of microorganisms. In this study, a genome-scale model of the green alga Chlorella vulgaris (iCZ946) was applied to predict feeding of multiple nutrients, including nitrate and glucose, under both autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions. The objective function was changed from optimizing growth to instead minimizing nitrate and glucose uptake rates, enabling predictions of feed rates for these nutrients. The metabolic model control (MMC) algorithm was validated for autotrophic growth, saving 18% nitrate while sustaining algal growth. Additionally, we obtained similar growth profiles by simultaneously controlling glucose and nitrate supplies under heterotrophic conditions for both high and low levels of glucose and nitrate. Finally, the nitrate supply was controlled in order to retain protein and chlorophyll synthesis, albeit at a lower rate, under nitrogen-limiting conditions. This model-driven cultivation strategy doubled the total volumetric yield of biomass, increased fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield by 61%, and enhanced lutein yield nearly 3 fold compared to nitrogen starvation. This study introduces a control methodology that integrates omics data and genome-scale models in order to optimize nutrient supplies based on the metabolic state of algal cells in different nutrient environments. This approach could transform bioprocessing control into a systems biology-based paradigm suitable for a wide range of species in order to limit nutrient inputs, reduce processing costs, and optimize biomanufacturing for the next generation of desirable biotechnology products.","output":"Utilizing genome-scale models to optimize nutrient supply for sustained algal growth and lipid productivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biometric traits gradually proved their importance in real-life applications, especially in identification field.

METHODS: An anonymous online questionnaire was sent to 1000 randomly selected junior doctors in the North\\\\West of England. The questionnaire included 37 questions on general and pandemic\\\\specific stressors, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory Health Services Survey. The main outcomes of interest were junior doctor ratings of stressors and scores for burnout (emotional exhaustion [EE], depersonalisation [DP], and personal accomplishment [PA]). Stepwise regression analysis was undertaken to assess associations between stressors and burnout. RESULTS: In total, 326 responses were collected (response rate = 33%). Of the top 10 stressors rated by junior doctors, 60% were related to the pandemic. Multiple stressors were found to be associated with the burnout dimensions.

Methodologically, the definition also allow us to replace the parametric and generally ill-posed estimation problems that followed the counterfactual definition by combinatorial enumeration problems on non-experimental samples. We use over 20 contemporary methods and simulations to demonstrate that the approach leads to accuracy gains in standard out-of-sample prediction, intervention effect prediction and causal effect estimation tasks.

The circulating cytokine levels in the blood reflect a thorough insight into the immune system status. Indeed, measuring one cytokine may deliver more information equivalent to detecting multiple diseases at a time. However, if the reported cytokine levels are interpreted with considering lifestyle and any comorbid health conditions for the individual, this will promote a more precise assessment of the immune status. Therefore, this study addresses the most recent advanced assays that deliver rapid, accurate measuring of the cytokine levels in human blood, focusing on add-on potentials for point-of-care (PoC) or personal at-home usage, and investigates existing health questionnaires as supportive assessment tools that collect all necessary information for the concrete analysis of the measured cytokine levels. We introduced a ten-dimensional featuring of cytokine measurement assays. We found 15 rapid cytokine assays with assay time less than 1 h; some could operate on unprocessed blood samples, while others are mature commercial products available in the market. In addition, we retrieved several health questionnaires that addressed various health conditions such as chronic diseases and psychological issues. Then, we present a machine learning-based solution to determine what makes the immune system fit. To this end, we discuss how to employ topic modeling for deriving the definition of immune fitness automatically from literature. Finally, we propose a prototype model to assess the fitness of the immune system through leveraging the derived definition of the immune fitness, the cytokine measurements delivered by a rapid PoC immunoassay, and the complementary information collected by the health questionnaire about other health factors. In conclusion, we discovered various advanced rapid cytokine detection technologies that are promising candidates for point-of-care or at-home usage; if paired with a health status questionnaire, the assessment of the immune system status becomes solid and we demonstrated potentials for promoting the assessment tool with data mining techniques.","output":"Potential of Point-of-Care and At-Home Assessment of Immune Status via Rapid Cytokine Detection and Questionnaire-Based Anamnesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the paucity of longitudinal data in gait recovery after stroke, we compared temporospatial gait characteristics of stroke patients during subacute (<2 months post-onset, T0) and at approximately 6 and 12 months post-onset (T1 and T2, respectively) and explored the relationship between gait characteristics at T0 and the changes in gait speed from T0 to T1. Forty-six participants were assessed at T0 and a subsample of 24 participants at T2. Outcome measures included Fugl-Meyer lower-extremity motor score, 14 temporospatial gait parameters and symmetry indices of 5 step parameters. Except for step width, all temporospatial parameters improved from T0 to T1 (p  0.0001). Additionally, significant improvements in symmetry were found for the initial double-support time and single-support time (p  0.0001). Although group results at T2 were not different from those at T1, the individual analysis revealed that 42% (10/24) of the subsample showed a significant increase in gait speed. The increase in gait speed from T0 to T1 was negatively correlated with gait speed and stride length, and positively correlated with the symmetry indices of stance and single-support times at T0 (p  0.002). Temporospatial gait parameters and stance time symmetry improve over the first 6 months after stroke with an apparent plateau thereafter. Approximately 40% of the subsample continue to increase gait speed from 6 to 12 months post-stroke. A greater increase in gait speed during the first 6 months post-stroke is associated with initially slower walking, shorter stride length, and more pronounced asymmetry in stance and single-support times. The improvement in lower-extremity motor function and bilateral improvements in step parameters collectively suggest that gait changes over the first 12 months after stroke are likely due to neurological recovery, although some compensation by the non-paretic side cannot be excluded.","output":"Longitudinal Changes in Temporospatial Gait Characteristics during the First Year Post-Stroke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mealtimes occur six times a day on eating disorder (ED) inpatient units and are a mainstay of treatment for EDs.

The aim of this quality improvement project was to decrease the number of ED behaviours at mealtimes in the dining room through the implementation of initiatives identified through diagnostic work. METHODS: The Model for Improvement was used as the systematic approach for this project. Baseline assessment included observations in the dining room, gathering of qualitative feedback from staff and patients and the development of an ED behaviours form used by patients and staff. The first change idea of a host role in the dining room was introduced, and the impact was assessed. RESULTS: The introduction of the host role has reduced the average number of ED behaviours per patient in the dining room by 35%. Postintervention feedback demonstrated that the introduction of the host role tackled the disorganisation and chaotic feeling in the dining room which in turn has reduced distress and anxiety for patients and staff.

Although most people using this herb do not experience adverse health effects associated with kratom use, medical providers should be knowledgeable of emerging substances and concurrent, sequential, or simultaneous use of other drugs which may impact healthcare recommendations and prescribing practices. METHODS: The objective of this narrative review was to elucidate selected health effects associated with using kratomeither alone or with other substances. Since scientifically controlled human subjects research on kratom use is still limited, relevant case reports were also described. RESULTS: Cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, and psychiatric effects associated with kratom use were especially notable, and in-utero exposure accompanied concern regarding a neonates risk for developing neonatal abstinence syndrome. Our ability to identify and understand the role of this herb in kratom-associated fatalities is complicated since kratom is not routinely screened for in standard forensic toxicology. If a screening is performed, it is usually for the major alkaloid, mitragynine, as a surrogate for kratom use. In addition to lacking a standard practice of screening decedents for kratom alkaloids, the association between mortality and kratom use may be confounded by polysubstance use, adulteration of kratom products, and drug-herb interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing medical awareness of this herb is vital to ensuring prompt administration of best-practice medical advice or treatment for people seeking information related to kratom use or for patients experiencing an adverse health effect that may be associated with using or withdrawing from kratom.

Disjuncture is a concept proposed by adult educator Peter Jarvis to describe the phenomenon of what happens when an individual is confronted with an experience that conflicts with her/his previous understanding of the world. Faced with a situation that creates disjuncture, the person is compelled to find new knowledge and new ways of doing things; i.e., he/she must embark on a learning process. The recent introduction of social distancing as a measure aiming to reduce transmission of the COVID-19 virus has dramatically changed people's behaviour, but this measure does not only have preventive and desirable effects. There is an associated risk for increased isolation among the older generations of the population, as well as a change in intergenerational relationships. Although the current pandemic (as disjuncture) may potentially initiate major learning processes in the human collective, we should remember that disjuncture is often theorised within neutral, or even positive, contexts. In a context of fear, however, learning may result in a narrowing of mindsets and a rejection of collective efforts and solidarity between generations. In terms of the types of learning triggered by the current pandemic (as disjuncture), one problem is non-reflective learning, which primarily occurs on a behavioural level. We need to recognise this and engage in reflective learning if we are to make the choices that will lead to a society that is worth living in for all generations.

A vast majority of fractures (94.5%) showed minimal or no displacement. Over one-third of injuries (60/152, 39.4%) demonstrated only soft tissue swelling or hematoma without fracture. Associated injuries were seen most frequently in the upper extremity, occurring synchronously in 11 (11.4%) patients, and preceding the index facial injury in 20 (21%) patients. CONCLUSION: /advances in knowledge. The midface was the most frequent location of injury in victims of intimate partner violence, and the nasal bone was the most commonly fractured facial bone. Recognizing these injury patterns can help radiologists suspect IPV and prompt them to discuss the possibility of IPV with the clinical providers.","output":"Facial injury patterns in victims of intimate partner violence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current review will provide recent updates in the clinical management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Despite the vast majority of athletes experiencing mild symptoms, potential cardiac involvement and complications have to be explored to support a safe return to play. Accordingly, we were aimed at a comprehensive echocardiographic characterization of post-COVID athletes (P-CA) by comparing them to a propensity-matched healthy, non-COVID athlete (N-CA) cohort. One hundred and seven elite athletes with COVID-19 were prospectively enrolled after an appropriate quarantine period and formed the P-CA group (236 years, 23% female). From our retrospective database comprising 425 elite athletes, 107 age-, gender-, body surface area-, and weekly training hours-matched subjects were selected as a reference group using propensity score matching (N-CA group). All athletes underwent a comprehensive clinical investigation protocol comprising 2D and 3D echocardiography. Left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volumes (EDVi) and ejection fractions (EF) were quantified using dedicated softwares. To characterize LV longitudinal deformation, 2D global longitudinal strain (GLS) and the ratio of free wall versus septal longitudinal strain (FWLS/SLS) were also calculated. In order to describe septal flattening (SF C frequently seen in P-CA), LV eccentricity index (EI) was measured. P-CA and N-CA athletes had comparable LV and RV EDVi (P-CA vs N-CA; 7712 vs 7813mL/m(2); 7916 vs 8014mL/m(2), respectively). P-CA group had significantly higher LV EF (584 vs 564%, p<0.001) and GLS (?18.21.8 vs ?17.62.2%, p<0.05). Eccentricity index was significantly lower in P-CA (0.890.10 vs 0.990.04, p<0.001), which was attributable to a distinct subgroup of P-CA athletes with a prominent SF (n=34, 32%), further provoked by inspiration. In this subgroup, the eccentricity index was markedly lower compared to the rest of the P-CA group (0.790.07 vs 0.950.07, p<0.001). In the SF subgroup, LV EDVi was significantly higher (8014 vs 7511 mL/m(2), p<0.001), while RV EDVi did not differ (8216 vs 7815mL/m(2)). Moreover, the FWLS/SLS ratio was significantly lower in the SF subgroup (0.920.09 vs 0.970.08, p<0.01). Interestingly, P-CA athletes with SF experienced fatigue (17 vs 34%, p<0.05) or chest pain (0 vs 15%, p=N/A) less frequently during the course of the infection; however, the presence of a mild pericardial effusion was more common (41 vs 12%, p<0.01). Elite athletes following COVID-19 showed distinct morphological and functional cardiac changes compared to a propensity score-matched control athlete group. These results are mainly driven by a subgroup, which presented with some echocardiographic features characteristic of constrictive pericarditis (septal flattening, lower FWLS/SLS ratio, pericardial effusion). Follow-up of athletes and further, higher case number studies are warranted to determine the clinical significance and potential effects on exercise capacity of these findings.

Materials/Methods An online survey was sent nationwide to radiation oncologists, accompanied by a $10 gift card incentive for completing the survey. Of 117 complete responses received, the majority of respondents reported practicing in an academic setting (92%) and in an urban area (95%). 42% of respondents were still in training, while the rest had graduated from residency 0-5 years (16%), 6-10 years (8%), 11-20 years (15%), and 21+ years (19%) ago. Results Of all respondents, 79% worked at institutions that had implemented a work-from-home policy. Satisfaction was reported to be 87% regarding work-from-home flexibility, 84% regarding decreased commute to work, 40% regarding interaction with patients, 46% regarding impact on workflow, and 76% regarding overall impression. Before COVID-19, 99% of all visits were completed in-person whereas after COVID-19, telephone and telemedicine video visits comprised approximately 35% of new patient consults, 12% of on-treatment visits (OTVs), and 51% of follow-up visits. The primary factors in determining whether a patient was seen via telemedicine were patient preference (46%), physician preference (32%), and department policy (22%). Overall, in-person visits were felt to be better than telemedicine encounters in obtaining information during consultation (55%), establishing a personal connection with the patient/family (89%), answering questions about radiation treatment (45%), assessing for toxicity while on-treatment (87%), and assessing for toxicity/recurrence during follow-up (70%). 70% of respondents were in favor of more telemedicine utilization even after the COVID-19 pandemic, while 22% were in favor of telemedicine use only during the pandemic, and 8% were against the use of telemedicine unless absolutely necessary. Telemedicine visits for OTV encounters were deemed somewhat appropriate or extremely appropriate by 86% of respondents for patients confirmed to be COVID-positive, 79% for patients with mild symptoms who had not been tested, 65% for asymptomatic patients living with an at-risk person, 57% for asymptomatic patients who had recently traveled to a high-risk zone within the last 14 days, 92% for physician with mild symptoms who had not been tested, and 89% for asymptomatic physician living with an at-risk person. Conclusion Telemedicine has become quickly integrated into the Radiation Oncology clinical workflow allowing for convenience, flexibility, and minimization of infection transmission. These encounters are likely to play a role in conjunction with C not in place of C in-person visits, which allow physicians the ability to obtain crucial information during consultation, establish a personal connection with patients, and assess for toxicity/recurrence.","output":"Telemedicine Perspectives in Radiation Oncology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe the systems developed for the WNUT-2020 shared task 2, identification of informative COVID-19 English Tweets.

Pharyngitis caused by GAS may have complications such as acute rheumatic fever subsequently leading to rheumatic heart disease (RHD). RHD continues to have high morbidity and mortality and affects millions of children and young adults, mostly in developing countries. An effective preventive vaccine against GAS may reduce the morbidity and mortality. A 30-valent M-protein-based vaccine is currently at the clinical trials stage of development. Potential vaccine coverage will depend on the geographical distribution of GAS emm (M protein) types. OBJECTIVES: To determine the emm types of GAS isolates circulating in the north-west of Pretoria, South Africa. METHODS: Throat swabs were collected from patients aged 3 - 20 years presenting with pharyngitis at one local clinic. In addition, GAS clinical isolates were collected from the National Health Laboratory Service diagnostic laboratory. Emm genotyping was done on the GAS isolates by amplification of the emm gene followed by sequencing of the 5' portion of the gene. The emm types were correlated with the types in the vaccine. RESULTS: A total of 54 GAS isolates were collected, comprising 19 pharyngitis and 35 clinical isolates. We found 15 different emm types among the 43 GAS isolates that were successfully sequenced. Eleven isolates (20%) could not be typed. The most prevalent emm type was 92 (26%), which is part of the 30-valent vaccine. This was followed by emm 25 and 75, each accounting for 12% of the isolates. Up to 67% of the emm types are not covered in the 30-valent vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Fifteen emm types were identified, of which 92 was the most prevalent. It is concerning that 67% of the emm types are not covered in the vaccine currently under development. It is recommended that surveillance studies be extended to include other parts of the country in order to expand knowledge of the circulating emm types.","output":"Molecular characterisation of group A streptococcus isolates recovered from the north-west of Pretoria, South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To examine the feasibility of using a computer tool for stratifying the severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on computed tomography (CT) images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively examined 44 confirmed COVID-19 cases. All cases were evaluated separately by radiologists (visually) and through an in-house computer software. The degree of lesions was visually scored by the radiologist, as follows, for each of the 5 lung lobes: 0, no lesion present; 1, <1/3 involvement; 2, >1/3 and < 2/3 involvement; and 3, >2/3 involvement. Lesion density was assessed based on the proportion of ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and fibrosis of the lesions. The parameters obtained using the computer tool included lung volume (mL), lesion volume (mL), lesion percentage (%), and mean lesion density (HU) of the whole lung, right lung, left lung, and each lobe. The scores obtained by the radiologists and quantitative results generated by the computer software were tested for correlation. A Chi-square test was used to test the consistency of radiologist- and computer-derived lesion percentage in the right/left lung, upper/lower lobe, and each of the 5 lobes. RESULT: The results showed a strong to moderate correlation between lesion percentage scores obtained by radiologists and the computer software (r ranged from 0.7679 to 0.8373, P < 0.05), and a moderate correlation between the proportion of GGO and mean lesion density (r = ?0.5894, P < 0.05), and proportion of consolidation and mean lesion density (r = 0.6282, P < 0.05). Computer-aided quantification showed a statistical significant higher lesion percentage for lower lobes than that assessed by the radiologists ((2) = 8.160, P = 0.004).

Demographic, personal and residency factors were assessed as potential predictors of PHQ-9 depression scores. Similar to training interns in the US, the proportion of participants in China who met depression criteria at least once during the first year of residency increased substantially, from 9.1 to 35.1%. History of depression and symptoms at baseline were common factors significantly associated with depression during residency. By contrast, neuroticism, early family environment, female gender and not being coupled were associated with depression risk only in the US, while young age was a predictor of depression only in China. Fear of workplace violence also was a predictor in China. Long duty hours and reduced sleep duration emerged as training predictors of depression in both countries.

Multiple studies have reported the presence of autoantibodies in patients with COVID-19. Also the presence of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) and flaring of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after COVID-19 has been described.[1, 2] Furthermore, in rheumatology clinics patients may present with polyarthritis compatible with RA shortly after SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it is unclear how often ACPA occur after COVID-19 and whether preceding COVID-19 impacts on disease presentation of RA and phenotype of the ACPA response. Objectives: This study aims to determine the seroprevalence of ACPA after COVID-19 and to investigate the association between preceding COVID-19 infection and disease presentation of new-onset RA, including clinical phenotype and autoantibody response. Methods: To estimate the prevalence of ACPA after COVID-19 we measured ACPA IgG in samples from 61 patients visiting the specialized post-COVID outpatient clinic of the LUMC 5 weeks after hospitalization, using routine tests or in-house ELISA. Furthermore, we identified 5 patients presenting with polyarthritis compatible with RA after SARS-CoV-2 infection. To study the impact of COVID-19 on disease presentation, we examined clinical phenotype, autoantibody isotype positivity and ACPA IgG variable domain (V-domain) glycosylation of these patients and compared these features to regular RA patients. Autoantibody isotypes, including rheumatoid factor (RF) IgM/IgA, anti-CCP2 IgG/ IgM/ IgA and anti-carbamylated protein antibodies (anti-CarP) IgG were measured using in-house ELISA's. The percentage of V-domain glycosylation of purified ACPA IgG was measured with UHPLC. Results: None of the 61 post-COVID patients tested positive for ACPA 5 weeks after hospitalization, except two patients previously diagnosed with ACPA-positive RA. Thus, we could not observe an increase in ACPA-positivity shortly after COVID-19. Of the 5 patients who developed polyarthritis compatible with RA after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the average age was 63.6 years and 2/5 were female. 4/5 patients had been hospitalized due to severe COVID-19. On average, joint complaints started 6.6 weeks after infection, although two patients reported symptoms before infection. 4/5 patients fulfilled the ACR 2010 criteria for RA. Three patients (patient 1, 4, 5) were phenotypically very similar to regular new-onset RA patients. Patient 3 had a history of seronegative RA and had been in DMARD-free remission for 5 years. She flared 6 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patient 2 had a remarkably different presentation. He was admitted with a suspected septic polyarthritis or pneumonia with reactive polyarthritis 6 weeks after COVID-19. ACPA level was low positive. The patient died unexpectedly after two days and autopsy revealed dilating myocarditis of unclear underlying cause. No causative pathogen could be identified. Previous studies have shown that RA-patients are most often either seronegative or triple-positive for RF, ACPA and anti-CarP antibodies. Autoantibody measurements on sera of the post-COVID polyarthritis patients revealed a similar pattern (Figure 1A) with two patients being completely seronegative, and three patients positive for a range of autoantibodies. In all post-COVID samples, the percentage of ACPA IgG V-domain glycosylation was significantly increased compared to total IgG (Figure 1B), similar as in regular RA. Conclusion: In conclusion, we found that the seroprevalence of ACPA is not increased post-COVID and that most patients presenting with polyarthritis after COVID-19 resemble regular RA patients, both regarding clinical phenotype and autoantibody characteristics. Although sample size and follow-up was limited, it appears that RA post-COVID may be coincidence rather than connected.","output":"The onset of rheumatoid arthritis after COVID-19-coincidence or connected"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To limit the transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is important to understand the sources of social behavior for members of the general public.

Considering the changing landscape of HCV treatment, prevention, and care, and in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, this analysis seeks to evaluate Sweden's progress towards the World Health Organization (WHO) elimination targets and identify remaining barriers. METHODS: The data used for modelling HCV transmission and disease burden in Sweden were obtained through literature review, unpublished sources and expert input. A dynamic Markov model was employed to forecast population sizes and incidence of HCV through 2030. Two scenarios ('2019 Base' and 'WHO Targets') were developed to evaluate Sweden's progress towards HCV elimination. RESULTS: At the beginning of 2019, there were 29 700 (95% uncertainty interval: 19 300-33 700) viremic infections in Sweden. Under the base scenario, Sweden would achieve and exceed the WHO targets for diagnosis, treatment and liver-related death. However, new infections would decrease by less than 10%, relative to 2015. Achieving all WHO targets by 2030 would require (i) expanding harm reduction programmes to reach more than 90% of people who inject drugs (PWID) and (ii) treating 90% of HCV + PWID engaged in harm reduction programmes and &#8805;7% of PWID not involved in harm reduction programmes, annually by 2025.

The objective was to evaluate the implementation of a tele-consultation program in an adult population with RA Methods: Analytical observational study longitudinal cohort (Clinical trials NCT04768413) that evaluated the effectiveness of a tele consultation model compared with a face-to-face consultation model in adult RA patients. Patients were followed 12 weeks (Jul-Oct 2020) at an RA center of excellence in Colombia. Simple random sampling was done. Two groups were included: Group A, patients who were cared for by tele-consultation care and Group B, thosewho wished to continue with the usual face-to-face consultation. Data regarding activity of disease (Week 0,6,12) [Patient Activity Scale (PAS) in both groups and DAS28 in group B], and Quality of life [EQ-5D-3L], disability [Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)], therapeutic adherence [Morisky-Green Adherence Scale (MGLS)] and self-care capacity [Appraisal of Self-care Agency Scale -Revised (ASA-R)] were evaluated (weeks 0-12). Outcomes regarding COVID-19 were evaluated. Bivariate analysis was done (StataV-13;P-value<0.05). Results: 218 adults were included: (109/Group A-109/Group B). The groups did not differ in general characteristics (Table). Group A: (n = 71), no statistically significant differences were observed in the median scores of VAS global, VAS pain, PAS, HAQ, EQ-5D and ASA-R while increase in adherence was demonstrated (MGLS, without statistical significance). Group B: (n = 18), a significant increase in adherence (MGLS, p = 0,019) and in self-care (ASA-R, p = 0,0077) were found, no other differences were found (including DAS-28). A third group was constituted by patients that transited between the two models (figure).

BACKGROUND Headache is a common reason for presentation to EDs. Little is known about the epidemiology, investigation, and treatment of nontraumatic headache in patients attending EDs internationally. METHODS An international, multicenter, observational, cross-sectional study was conducted over one calendar month in 2019. Participants were adults (18 years) with nontraumatic headache as the main presenting complaint. Exclusion criteria were recent head trauma, missing records, interhospital transfers, re-presentation with same headache as a recent visit, and headache as an associated symptom. Data collected included demographics, clinical assessment, investigation, treatment, and outcome. RESULTS We enrolled 4536 patients (67 hospitals, 10 countries). \\"Thunderclap\\" onset was noted in 14.2% of cases (644/4536). Headache was rated as severe in 27.2% (1235/4536). New neurological examination findings were uncommon (3.2%; 147/4536). Head computed tomography (CT) was performed in 36.6% of patients (1661/4536), of which 9.9% showed clinically important pathology (165/1661). There was substantial variation in CT scan utilization between countries (15.9%-75.0%). More than 30 different diagnoses were made. Presumed nonmigraine benign headache accounted for 45.4% of cases (2058/4536) with another 24.3% classified as migraine (1101/4536). A small subgroup of patients have a serious secondary cause for their headache (7.1%; 323/4536) with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), stroke, neoplasm, non-SAH intracranial hemorrhage/hematoma, and meningitis accounting for about 1% each. Most patients were treated with simple analgesics (paracetamol, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents). Most patients were discharged home (83.8%; 3792/4526). In-hospital mortality was 0.3% (11/4526). CONCLUSION Diagnosis and management of headache in the ED is challenging. A small group of patients have a serious secondary cause for their symptoms. There is wide variation in the use of neuroimaging and treatments. Further work is needed to understand the variation in practice and to better inform international guidelines regarding emergent neuroimaging and treatment.","output":"Epidemiology, investigation, management, and outcome of headache in emergency departments (HEAD study)-A multinational observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Providing informal care for older people, or people with chronic conditions, is associated with poorer physical and mental health and reduced quality of life.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted to recognize the pattern of metabolic and radiographic alterations on 18F-FDG PET/CT scans in Covid-19 patients. 492 18F-FDG PET/CT scans were reviewed for pulmonary and systemic abnormalities. RESULTS: 18F-FDG PET/CT demonstrated new lung infiltrates in 29 asymptomatic patients. 13/29 patients had Covid-19 infection confirmed by nasopharyngeal nucleic acid PCR test. The most common lung abnormality was pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) (90%) in peripheral distribution (100%), involving 1 lobe in four patients (30.8%), 2-3 lobes in four patients, and 4-5 lobes in five patients (38.4%). Mean SUVmax was 4.7 (range 1.3-13.1). Ten patients developed symptoms, mainly fever, fatigue, and dry cough, within 6.4  7.8 days (range 1-24). Of the available laboratory data of 12 patients, eight developed lymphopenia, and five patients had neutrophilia. Five patients required hospitalization, and two died of complications. CONCLUSION: For a given geographic region in the later stage of a pandemic, such as Covid-19, community spread of the disease is common.

Recent investigations from Sweden and the US have indicated that pregnant and postpartum women are at increased risk of severe complications associated with COVID\\\\19. This study aims to find out the prevalence of maternal mortality and the clinical course of maternal mortality cases due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted from May 1st, 2020, to April 30th, 2021, at Postgraduate Institute and YCM Hospital Pimpri Pune (Maharashtra), a dedicated COVID hospital during COVID pandemic. During study period, all pregnant women who were diagnosed to have COVID-19 infection by RT PCR/Rapid Antigen Test were admitted and were enrolled for the study. Aim To audit the maternal mortality due to COVID-19 infection. Primary To estimate the prevalence of maternal mortality due to COVID-19 infection in obstetric patients. Secondary To systematically study and analyze the clinical course of infection in mothers who had mortality due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Data collected in standard format regarding Demography, clinical presentation, need for ICU/HDU, CXR findings, laboratory parameters and cases with maternal mortality were studied in detail to fulfill the study objectives. Results Among 871 COVID-19 cases diagnosed during pregnancy, nine patients had maternal mortality due to covid pneumonia. There was no obvious obstetric cause for mortality in these cases. The prevalence of maternal mortality was 0.01 (1.03%). Cases with maternal mortality were mostly in 3rd Trimester (5 of 9 cases) and presented with moderate to severe illness with breathlessness and myalgia in all 9 cases, cough and fever in 7 out of 9 cases, Tachypneoa was noted in all patients. Saturation below 90 in 6 cases and below 94 in 3 cases. Chest X-ray showed bilateral lung affection in all 9 cases. Leukocytosis with raised N:L ratio was predominantly seen, thrombocytopenia noted in 5 cases and elevated levels of acute phase reactants and inflammatory markers such as CRP, S. ferritin, ESR, LDH, D-dimer and S. fibrinogen was observed. None of the study participants received vaccine for COVID-19. Conclusions COVID-19 pneumonia is an additional toll for maternal mortality. Obstetric patients in 2nd and 3rd trimester having COVID-19 infection with late presentation to hospital, moderate to severe disease (RR > 30 min), with raised inflammatory markers (N:L ratio, CRP, Ferritin, d-Dimer, etc.) at presentation, having bilateral lung affection are at risk of poor maternal outcome.","output":"Prevalence of Maternal Mortality and Clinical Course of Maternal Deaths in COVID-19 Pneumonia-A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extensive evidence indicates that RNA G-quadruplexes have associated with some important cellular events.

Methods: Datasets GSE36830 and GSE72713 were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus. Dataset GSE36830 was used to identify differentially expressed genes in CRSwNP patients. GO, KEGG analysis, and PPI network analysis were applied to further investigate the function of DEGs in CRSwNP. GSEA was also performed to explore the mechanisms of DEGs. Dataset GSE72713 was applied to validate the key gene. Moreover, to detect the expression of target gene, nasal polyp tissues and middle turbinate specimens were collected from CRSwNP patients (n = 20) and controls (n = 20), respectively. RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence staining were applied. HE and AB-PAS staining were used to assess the infiltration of inflammatory cells. The proliferation and migration ability of human nasal epithelial cells (HNEpCs) were tested via Cell Counting kit-8, wound healing assay and Transwell migration assay. Air-liquid interface was used to culture primary human nasal epithelial cells (pHNECs) from health controls and nasal polyp tissues of CRSwNP patients. Results: A total of 1035 DEGs were identified, and 661 genes were up-regulated and 374 genes were down-regulated. According to PPI network analysis, the top 10 scored genes were identified. Among them, only EGF was down-regulated in CRSwNP. Meanwhile, GSEA result shows that EGF is significantly enriched in WNT activated receptor activity. CCK-8, wound healing assay, and transwell migration assay indicated that recombinant human EGF can promote the proliferation and migration of HNEpCs in vitro. Immunofluorescence staining shows that rhEGF can increase the expression of ZO-1 in pHNECs from nasal polyp tissues.

To identify characteristics of workers and industries where particular concerns are more common. Method Prospective cohort study of 1063 employed Australian adults, enrolled at the start of the pandemic. Data on attitudes to workplaces reopening were collected 1 JulyC30 September 2020. The frequency of concerns describes infection risk and changes to work and impact on home life. Regression models examined associations between demographic and industry factors with reopening concerns. Results More than four in five (82.4%) of workers reported concerns about workplace infection risk. Just over half (53.4%) reported concerns about impacts to work and home life. Concerns were more prevalent for workers reporting psychological distress, financial stress, and among those exclusively working from home. Concerns regarding infection risk were common for workers in health care (IRR 1.16, 95% CI [1.01, 1.33]), retail (IRR 1.31, 95% CI [1.06, 1.61]), and accommodation/food service industries (IRR 1.25, 95% CI [1.01, 1.55]). Concerns regarding changes to work and home life were more common for female workers (IRR 1.24, 95% CI [1.07, 1.43]), and partners/spouses with dependent children (IRR 1.44, 95% CI [1.16, 1.79]). Conclusion Concerns of COVID-19 infection in the workplace are common. Many workers are also concerned about changes to their work and home life. The prevalence of concerns is related to the nature of work and responsibilities at home. Actions that reduce risk of workplace transmission, coupled with effective communication of infection controls, may alleviate worker concerns whilst recognising workers family and social circumstances.

The purpose was to gain perceptions into best strategies for online instruction for those content areas that promoted course objective competency with an emphasis on learner engagement. Fifty-four DPT students were surveyed following the completion of an 8-week summer semester Foundational Sciences course at the University of the Incarnate Word, School of Physical Therapy, DPT program. The 7-question anonymous survey addressed content delivered both synchronously (live) and asynchronously (prerecorded or self-regulated) with regard to time, synchronous class size and format (large group vs. breakout room), use of asynchronous voiceovers and video tutorials, and rating of specific activities promoting engagement. Open feedback questions addressed virtual course elements that students identified as most and least supportive of content mastery. Fifty responses were collected (93% response rate). Findings from the survey indicated a preference for synchronous sessions of 1.5 hr (94%) in length with the combination of both large and small group (breakout room) sessions (90%). Sixty percent of respondents preferred having a mix of synchronous classes with the entire cohort of 54 learners and smaller synchronous sessions with half the cohort. While 50% indicated a preference for more asynchronous PowerPoint voiceovers, 46% indicated that they preferred not having asynchronous voiceovers that aligned with every synchronous class. Activities promoting engagement received mixed ratings overall using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from poor to excellent. Activities that received majority satisfactory ratings included Poll Everywhere (44%), Zoom annotation tool (40%), Zoom breakout room activities (44%) and StudyMate flashcards (56%). Activities with roughly equivalent ratings for satisfactory, very good and excellent included asynchronous voiceovers (28-36%) and Kahoot quizzes (26-38%). The inclusion of guest speakers was least favorable (32% combined poor and fair responses) out of all the activities utilized to enhance engagement. Respondent open feedback indicated that accessibility to recorded synchronous sessions and asynchronous voiceovers were most valuable to their learning. Question interruptions during synchronous sessions and discussion-based breakout room sessions with less structure was least helpful to their learning.

This conclusion, however, was based on a limited number of studies, and no attempt has been made to quantify the exact magnitude of this beneficial effect. Such information would help ensure adequate statistical power in future studies and could help place the effects of dietary NO3- on various aspects of exercise performance (i.e., endurance vs. strength vs. power) in better context. We therefore undertook a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis to quantify the effects of NO3- supplementation on human muscle power. METHODS The literature was searched using a strategy developed by a health sciences librarian. Data sources included Medline Ovid, Embase, SPORTDiscus, Scopus, Clinicaltrials.gov , and Google Scholar. Studies were included if they used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover experimental design to measure the effects of dietary NO3- on maximal power during exercise in the non-fatigued state and the within-subject correlation could be determined from data in the published manuscript or obtained from the authors. RESULTS Nineteen studies of a total of 268 participants (218 men, 50 women) met the criteria for inclusion. The overall effect size (ES; Hedge's g) calculated using a fixed effects model was 0.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29, 0.56; p = 6.310  10- 11). There was limited heterogeneity between studies (i.e., I2 = 22.79%, H2 = 1.30, p = 0.3460). The ES estimated using a random effects model was therefore similar (i.e., 0.45, 95% CI 0.30, 0.61; p = 1.064  10- 9). Sub-group analyses revealed no significant differences due to subject age, sex, or test modality (i.e., small vs. large muscle mass exercise).

A crucial challenge in studying MV infection is to understand the so-called 'measles paradox'-the progression of the infection to severe immunosuppression before clearance of acute viremia, which is also observed in canine distemper virus (CDV) infection. However, a lack of models that match in vivo data has restricted our understanding of this complex and counter-intuitive phenomenon. Recently, progress was made in the development of a model that fits data from acute measles infection in rhesus macaques. This progress motivates our investigations to gain additional insights from this model into the control mechanisms underlying the paradox. In this paper, we investigated analytical conditions determining the control and robustness of viral clearance for MV and CDV, to untangle complex feedback mechanisms underlying the dynamics of acute infections in their natural hosts. We applied control theory to this model to help resolve the measles paradox. We showed that immunosuppression is important to control and clear the virus. We also showed under which conditions T-cell killing becomes the primary mechanism for immunosuppression and viral clearance. Furthermore, we characterized robustness properties of T-cell immunity to explain similarities and differences in the control of MV and CDV. Together, our results are consistent with experimental data, advance understanding of control mechanisms of viral clearance across morbilliviruses, and will help inform the development of effective treatments. Further the analysis methods and results have the potential to advance understanding of immune system responses to a range of viral infections such as COVID-19.","output":"Control theory helps to resolve the measles paradox"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous studies have revealed a diagnostic role of pathogen-specific IgA in respiratory infections.

Liquid biopsy is a new and important medical approach to disease detection. This approach has been successfully used for mouth cancer detection and monitoring of treatment progress in many countries. Liquid biopsy is an attractive option for mouth cancer detection because it does not involve any invasive procedure and can be used on easily accessible body fluids, such as saliva and blood. Furthermore, there is evidence that this technology has some advantage over the normal tissue biopsy because it is not invasive, neither does it need any surgical expertise. Hence, we have focused on how easy or practical it would be, to employ the use of liquid biopsy on the African continent, as well as other low- and middle-income countries. We have discussed the different types of this technology in three main areas of focus, viz, what factors are important before, during and after collection of samples for liquid biopsy analysis, and what are the obstacles to routine use of this approach in resource-limited settings. ABSTRACT: An important driving force for precision and individualized medicine is the provision of tailor-made care for patients on an individual basis, in accordance with best evidence practice. Liquid biopsy(LB) has emerged as a critical tool for the early diagnosis of cancer and for treatment monitoring, but its clinical utility for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) requires more research and validation. Hence, in this review, we have discussed the current applications of LB and the practicality of its routine use in Africa; the potential advantages of LB over the conventional gold-standard of tissue biopsy; and finally, practical considerations were discussed in three parts: pre-analytic, analytic processing, and the statistical quality and postprocessing phases. Although it is imperative to establish clinically validated and standardized working guidelines for various aspects of LB sample collection, processing, and analysis for optimal and reliable use, manpower and technological infrastructures may also be an important factor to consider for the routine clinical application of LB for OSCC. LB is poised as a non-invasive precision tool for personalized oral cancer medicine, particularly for OSCC in Africa, when fully embraced. The promising application of different LB approaches using various downstream analyses such as released circulating tumor cells (CTCs), cell free DNA (cfDNA), microRNA (miRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), and salivary exosomes were discussed. A better understanding of the diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers of OSCC, using LB applications, would significantly reduce the cost, provide an opportunity for prompt detection and early treatment, and a method to adequately monitor the effectiveness of the therapy for OSCC, which typically presents with ominous prognosis.","output":"The Practicality of the Use of Liquid Biopsy in Early Diagnosis and Treatment Monitoring of Oral Cancer in Resource-Limited Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) and is a major health concern Following two SARS-CoV-2 pandemic waves, intensive care unit (ICU) specialists are treating a large number of COVID19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients From a pathophysiological perspective, prominent mechanisms of COVID19-associated ARDS (CARDS) include severe pulmonary infiltration/edema and inflammation leading to impaired alveolar homeostasis, alteration of pulmonary physiology resulting in pulmonary fibrosis, endothelial inflammation (endotheliitis), vascular thrombosis, and immune cell activation Although the syndrome ARDS serves as an umbrella term, distinct, i e , CARDS-specific pathomechanisms and comorbidities can be noted (e g , virus-induced endotheliitis associated with thromboembolism) and some aspects of CARDS can be considered ARDS atypical  Importantly, specific evidence-based medical interventions for CARDS (with the potential exception of corticosteroid use) are currently unavailable, limiting treatment efforts to mostly supportive ICU care In this article, we will discuss the underlying pulmonary pathophysiology and the clinical management of CARDS In addition, we will outline current and potential future treatment approaches ? 2020 The Author(s)","output":"COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (CARDS): Current knowledge on pathophysiology and ICU treatment C A narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One or more thyroid nodules, most often asymptomatic, may be found in more than half of the population, and they usually do not require specific therapeutic management, except for cancerous nodules.

The cytokine storm is an activation cascade of auto-amplifying cytokines, which leads to excessive activation of immune cells and generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It occurs when large numbers of white blood cells are activated and release inflammatory cytokines, in turn activating even more white blood cells, finally resulting in an exaggerated pro-inflammatory-mediated response and ineffective anti-inflammatory control, leading to tissue damage, multiorgan failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. Although cytokine storm pathogenesis is multifactorial, we hypothesize there is a close association between hypoxemia and cytokine storms in COVID-19, although it is difficult to establish the direction of this relationship. Most probably they coexist and, given enough time, one triggers the other in a chain reaction. Careful analysis of the day-to-day clinical evolution of COVID-19 indicates that there are short and slight periods of hypoxemia (confirmed by pulse oximetry and arterial gasometry), even on the day of the onset of persistent cough and/or shortness of breath. We propose the use of continuous positive airway pressure in early stages of COVID-19, at the onset of respiratory symptoms. This non-invasive ventilation method may be useful in individualized treatments to prevent early hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients and thus avoid triggering a cytokine storm. We believe such an approach is relevant everywhere, and in Cuba in particular, since the country has initiated national production of mechanical ventilation systems, including non-invasive ventilators. Moreover, as Cuba's COVID-19 protocols ensure early patient admission to isolation centers or hospitals, clinicians can prescribe the early use of continuous positive airway pressure as soon as respiratory symptoms begin, averting early hypoxemia and its triggering effect on cytokine storm development, and consequently, avoiding acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and death.","output":"Hypoxemia and Cytokine Storm in COVID-19: Clinical Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research aims to find a theoretical concept of assessment for students during the Covid-19 pandemic as a follow-up step for assessment activities in obtaining the validity of assessment results.

To meet that need, the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), the nations largest hospital surveillance system, launched a module for collecting hospital coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) data. We present time-series estimates of the critical hospital capacity indicators from April 1 to July 14, 2020. DESIGN: From March 27 to July 14, 2020, the NHSN collected daily data on hospital bed occupancy, number of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and the availability and/or use of mechanical ventilators. Time series were constructed using multiple imputation and survey weighting to allow nearCreal-time daily national and state estimates to be computed. RESULTS: During the pandemics April peak in the United States, among an estimated 431,000 total inpatients, 84,000 (19%) had COVID-19. Although the number of inpatients with COVID-19 decreased from April to July, the proportion of occupied inpatient beds increased steadily. COVID-19 hospitalizations increased from mid-June in the South and Southwest regions after stay-at-home restrictions were eased. The proportion of inpatients with COVID-19 on ventilators decreased from April to July. CONCLUSIONS: The NHSN hospital capacity estimates served as important, nearCreal-time indicators of the pandemics magnitude, spread, and impact, providing quantitative guidance for the public health response.

However, the O(3) levels throughout the Guangxi region of South China showed a clear downward trend during the lockdown. To better understand this unusual phenomenon, we investigated the characteristics of conventional pollutants, the influence of meteorological and anthropogenic factors quantified by a multiple linear regression (MLR) model, and the impact of local sources and long-range transport based on a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) and the HYSPLIT model. Results show that in Guangxi, the conventional pollutants generally declined during the COVID-19 lockdown period (January 24 to February 9, 2020) compared with their concentrations during 2016C2019, while O(3) gradually increased during the resumption (10 February to April 2020) and full operation periods (May and June 2020). Focusing on Beihai, a typical Guangxi region city, the correlations between the daily O(3) concentrations and six meteorological parameters (wind speed, visibility, temperature, humidity, precipitation, and atmospheric pressure) and their corresponding regression coefficients indicate that meteorological conditions were generally conducive to O(3) pollution mitigation during the lockdown. A 7.84 g/m(3) drop in O(3) concentration was driven by meteorology, with other decreases (4.11 g/m(3)) explained by reduced anthropogenic emissions of O(3) precursors. Taken together, the lower NO(2)/SO(2) ratios (1.25C2.33) and consistencies between real-time monitored primary emissions and ambient concentrations suggest that, with the closure of small-scale industries, residual industrial emissions have become dominant contributors to local primary pollutants. Backward trajectory cluster analyses show that the slump of O(3) concentrations in Southern Guangxi could be partly attributed to clean air mass transfer (24C58%) from the South China Sea. Overall, the synergistic effects of the COVID-19 lockdown and meteorological factors intensified O(3) reduction in the Guangxi region of South China.","output":"Ozone pollution mitigation in Guangxi (South China) driven by meteorology and anthropogenic emissions during the COVID-19 lockdown()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Feline parvovirus (FPV), a type of parvovirus prevalent worldwide, can cause foetal death and acute enteritis in adult cats with severe leukopenia, and yet there are no effective drugs to prevent or treat FPV.

Constant evolution of SARS-CoV-2 generates new mutations across its genome including the coding region for the RBD in the spike protein. In addition to the well-known single mutation in the RBD, the recent new mutation strains with an RBD double mutation are causing new outbreaks globally, as represented by the delta strain containing RBD L452R/T478K.

Thus, how to exploit the limited prior information to obtain high-quality CT images becomes a crucial issue. We notice that almost all existing methods solely focus on a single CT image while neglecting the solid fact that, the scanned objects are always highly spatially correlated. Consequently, there lies bountiful spatial information between these acquired consecutive CT images, which is still largely left to be exploited.

We first conduct data completion in the Radon domain, and transform the obtained full-view Radon data into images through FBP. Subsequently, we employ the spatial correlation between continuous CT images to productively restore them and then refine the image texture to finally receive the ideal high-quality CT images, achieving PSNR of 40.209 and SSIM of 0.943.

In vitro translation of mRNAs derived from this plasmid indicated that the 58 nucleotides from the SRV-1 gag-pro overlap were sufficient to induce an efficient -1 shift in a heterologous context. Mutational analysis demonstrated that the slip site is formed at the heptanucleotide G GGA AAC. The frameshift efficiency of the wild type sequence in rabbit reticulocyte lysate was 23%.

Adding increasing amounts of an SRV-1 pseudoknot containing RNA transcript to a translation reaction programmed with an SRV-1 frameshift reporter mRNA had no effect on the frameshift efficiency, arguing against the role of a specific pseudoknot-recognising factor in the frameshifting process.","output":"Identification and analysis of the pseudoknot-containing gag-pro ribosomal frameshift signal of simian retrovirus-1."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Shifting consumer behavior towards more sustainable diets can benefit environmental sustainability and human health. Although more frequent home cooking is associated with a better diet quality and fast-food consumption with worse diet quality, the environmental impact of diets based on frequency of cooking or eating fast food is not well understood. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the frequency of cooking dinner at home or eating fast food is associated with dietary greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE). We linked 24-h dietary recall data from adult respondents in the 2007C2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (N = 11,469) to a database of GHGE factors to obtain a measure of dietary GHGE (kgCO(2)-eq/2000 kcal) (the sum of emissions released in the production of food for an individuals diet), adjusted by energy intake (kgCO(2)-eq/2000 kcal). We examined associations between frequency of cooking dinner (the only meal for which cooking frequency was measured), frequency of eating fast food, and dietary GHGE and protein sources (beef, pork, poultry, other meat, and fish and seafood (g/2000 kcal)) using generalized linearized regression models that controlled for age, sex, and other socio-economic characteristics. Greater cooking frequency was associated with higher dietary GHGE. In fully adjusted models, cooking 5C6 times/week was associated with an additional 0.058 kgCO(2)-eq/2000 kcal (SE 0.033) and cooking 7 times/week was associated with an additional 0.057 kgCO(2)-eq/2000 kcal (SE 0.027) when compared to cooking 0C2 times/week. Individuals in households who cooked dinner more frequently consumed significantly more meat, poultry, and fish (cooking 7 times/week: 148.7 g/2000 kcal vs. cooking 0C2 times/week: 135.4 g/2000 kcal, p-trend = 0.005), which could explain the association with a higher carbon footprint diet. There were few associations of note between fast-food frequency and GHGE. Policies and interventions that reduce consumption of meat and increase consumption of plants when both cooking meals at home and eating meals out are needed to shift toward diets that will be beneficial for both human health and the health of the planet.","output":"Cooking at Home, Fast Food, Meat Consumption, and Dietary Carbon Footprint among US Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While many of the persisting social problems in Ghana and Africa broadly tend to be visible expressions of indiscipline and lawlessness, their roots are often found in inequalities.

The main idea of using anti-adhesion drugs in severe malaria is to release sequestered parasites (or prevent additional sequestration) as quickly as possible. This may significantly improve the outcomes for patients with severe malaria by decreasing local and systemic inflammation associated with the disease and reestablishing the microvascular blood flow.

METHODS Two serum panels from patients hospitalized in Paris, France, and from patients living in Bangui, Central African Republic, acquired prior to the 2019 COVID-19 outbreak, were tested by 3 CE IVD-labeled RDTs for SARS-CoV-2 serology [BIOSYNEX? COVID-19 BSS (IgG/IgM); SIENNA? COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette; NG-Test? IgG-IgM COVID-19]. RESULTS Detectable IgG or IgM reactivities could be observed in 31 (3.43%) of the 902 IgG and IgM bands of the 3 RDTs used with all pre-epidemic sera. The frequencies of IgG/IgM reactivities were similar for European (3.20%) and African (3.55%) sera. IgM reactivities were observed in 9 European and 14 African sera, while IgG reactivity was observed in only 1 African serum (15.1% versus 0.66%). The test NG-Test? IgG-IgM COVID-19 showed the highest rates of IgG or IgM reactivities [6.12% (18/294)], while the test BIOSYNEX? COVID-19 BSS (IgG/IgM) showed the lowest rate [1.36% (4/294)]. Some combinations of 2 RDTs in series allowed decreasing significantly the risk of false positive test results. CONCLUSION Our observations point the risk of false positive reactivities when using currently available RDT for SARS-CoV-2 serological screening, especially for the IgM band, even if the test is CE IVD-labeled and approved by national health authorities, and provide the rational basis for confirmatory testing by another RDT in case of positive initial screening.

For a critical branching process at each lattice point and recurrent random walk of particles, the effect of limit spatial clustering of particles over the lattice is studied. A model illustrating epidemic propagation is also considered. In this model, we consider two types of particles: infected and immunity generated. Initially, there is an infected particle that can infect others. Here, for the local number of particles of each type at a lattice point, we study the moments and their limiting behavior. Additionally, the effect of intermittency of the infected particles is studied for a supercritical branching process at each lattice point.

We conduct a comparative network analysis of social entrepreneurships conceptual structure at academic and non-academic levels. This analysis has been performed considering scientific articles keywords and Wikipedia webpages co-occurrences, enabling us to identify four different thematic clusters in both cases. Moreover, plotting the centrality and density of each cluster on a bi-dimensional matrix, we have sketched a strategic diagram and provided the thematic evolution of this research topic, based on the level of interaction among clusters, and the degree of cohesion of keywords in each cluster. This paper represents one of the first attempts in the entrepreneurship literature to shed light on the conceptual boundaries of a research topic based on the analysis of both a scientific and an open-source knowledge database. Our results reveal similarities and discrepancies between those two different sources of knowledge, and outline avenues for future studies at the intersection between social entrepreneurship and the research domains of digital transformation, performance measurement, entrepreneurial ecosystems, and ethics.

COVID-19, the clinical disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has a variable presentation ranging from asymptomatic infection to life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure. Liver involvement is common during COVID-19 and exhibits a spectrum of clinical manifestations from asymptomatic elevations of liver function tests to hepatic decompensation. The presence of abnormal liver tests has been associated with a more severe presentation of COVID-19 disease and overall mortality. Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in the liver of COVID-19 patients, it remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 productively infects and replicates in liver cells and has a direct liver-pathogenic effect. The cause of liver injury in COVID-19 can be attributed to multiple factors including virus-induced systemic inflammation, hypoxia, hepatic congestion and drug induced liver disease. Among patients with cirrhosis, COVID-19 has been associated with hepatic decompensation and liver-related mortality. Additionally, COVID-19's impact on healthcare resources can adversely affect delivery of care and outcomes of patients with chronic liver disease. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of liver injury during COVID-19 will be important in the management of COVID-19 patients, especially those with advanced liver disease.

Our hypothesis is that crude mortality rates are not sufficient to assess the impact of the epidemic on public health. The objective of this paper is to estimate the potential years of life lost (YLL) of patients who died from COVID-19. METHOD: We realised a retrospective analysis of the exhaustive sample of COVID-19 PCR-positive patients who died in public hospitals of Marseille during this first wave. Data on demographic characteristics, comorbidities and care pathways were collected from medical records. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was used to assess what would have been the probability of dying within 1 year of these patients in the absence of COVID-19 and to estimate total YLL. RESULTS: Among the 1631 patients who were hospitalised for COVID-19, 178 patients died, at an average age of 80 years. According to CCI, 88.8% of the deceased patients had an 85% probability of dying within 1 year before COVID-19. Among the 11.2% who had a lower CCI probability, 18 out of 20 had at least one additional comorbidity known to be a major risk factor of mortality in COVID-19 disease. Cumulative total number of YLL was estimated to be 541 in this deceased population, that is, an average of 3 YLL. CONCLUSION: Although our results should be interpreted with caution, this analysis confirms that mortality due to COVID-19 translates into a limited number of YLL due to both old age and preexisting comorbidities in the most vulnerable patients. This fact should be better considered in public health management of the pandemic both for risk communication and design of the most appropriate protective measures.","output":"Life-years lost by COVID-19 patients in public hospitals of Marseille (APHM-South-Eastern France): a limited death toll: a retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examines the ritual dynamics of virtual court hearings.

In patients with type-II diabetes, fat distribution is characterized by visceral and ectopic adipose tissues expansion, resulting in systemic inflammation, which may play a role in driving the COVID-19 cytokine storm. Our aim was to determine if cardiac adipose tissue, combined to interleukin-6 levels, could predict adverse short-term outcomes, death and ICU requirement, in COVID-19 diabetic patients during the 21 days after admission. METHODS: Eighty one consecutive patients with type-II diabetes admitted for COVID-19 were included. Interleukin-6 measurement and chest computed tomography with total cardiac adipose tissue index (CATi) measurement were performed at admission. The primary outcome was death during the 21 days following admission while intensive care requirement with or without early death (ICU-R) defined the secondary endpoint. Associations of CATi and IL-6 and threshold values to predict the primary and secondary endpoints were determined. RESULTS: Of the enrolled patients (median age 66 years [IQR: 59C74]), 73% male, median body mass index (BMI) 27 kg/m(2) [IQR: 24C31]) 20 patients had died from COVID-19, 20 required intensive care and 41 were in conventional care at day 21 after admission. Increased CATi and IL-6 levels were both significantly related to increased early mortality (respectively OR = 6.15, p = 0.002; OR = 18.2, p < 0.0001) and ICU-R (respectively OR = 3.27, p = 0.01; OR = 4.86, p = 0.002). These associations remained significant independently of age, sex, BMI as well as troponin-T level and pulmonary lesion extension in CT. We combined CATi and IL-6 levels as a multiplicative interaction score (CATi*IL-6). The cut-point for this score was  6386 with a sensitivity of 0.90 and a specificity of 0.87 (AUC = 0.88) and an OR of 59.6 for early mortality (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac adipose tissue index and IL-6 determination at admission could help physicians to better identify diabetic patients with a potentially severe and lethal short term course irrespective of obesity. Diabetic patients with high CATi at admission, a fortiori associated with high IL-6 levels could be a relevant target population to promptly initiate anti-inflammatory therapies.

To diminish the effect of this widespread pandemic, it is essential to detect COVID-19 cases as quickly as possible.

They play a vital role in early prediction and developing treatment plans for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 chest infection patients.

Computer simulations show that the presented system (1) increases the effectiveness of differentiating COVID-19, viral pneumonia, and normal conditions, (2) is effective on small datasets, and (3) has faster inference time compared to deep learning methods with comparable performance. Computer simulations are performed on two publicly available datasets; (a) the Kaggle dataset, and (b) the COVIDGR dataset. To assess the performance of the presented system, various evaluation parameters, such as accuracy, recall, specificity, precision, and f1-score are used.

In a high-powered study (N = 895), we tested direct and indirect effects of boredom and self-control on adherence. The results showed that both traits were important predictors of adherence but the underlying mechanisms differed. Specifically, individuals high in boredom perceived social distancing as more difficult, which in turn reduced their adherence (i.e., a mediated effect). In contrast, individuals high in self-control adhered more to the guidelines without perceiving them as more or less difficult;however, self-control moderated the effect of difficulty on adherence.

Despite the availability of effective human papillomavirus vaccines, South Texas Latino/a adolescents sub-optimally complete the series. Research shows provider recommendation strongly predicts vaccine uptake, but minority adolescents are less likely to report that their provider recommended the vaccine and series completion. There is also scant information on the HPV vaccine administration process in clinic practices providing vaccination services to Latino adolescents with limited access to healthcare resources. The purpose of the study was to describe providers experience with administering the HPV vaccine to Latino/a patients in their practices. METHODS: The study used qualitative description to describe the experience of 15 South Texas healthcare providers (doctors and nurses) with the process of HPV vaccine administration in their practices. We conducted open ended, audio-recorded interviews, which were subsequently transcribed verbatim and uploaded into Atlas.(ti) 7.0 for analysis. The interviews yielded detailed descriptions of barriers and facilitators that could potentially impact HPV vaccine uptake. RESULTS: Providers identified parental exposure to provider recommendation as enhancing HPV acceptance and existing policies and implementation of evidence-based practices as facilitators of HPV vaccine uptake. Barriers ranged from parental fears of adolescent sexual activity and potential vaccine side effects to lack of transportation and the cost of the vaccine. CONCLUSION: These findings reflect barriers and facilitators to administering the HPV vaccine previously identified and also highlight issues unique to the situation among Latinos in South Texas. Implications include the need to design and implement efforts to improve provider-parent communication and enhance parental and adolescent patients understanding of and confidence in the HPV vaccine.

The primary exposure was RAASi at hospital discharge and the primary endpoint was recurrent AKI within 12 months. Cox proportional hazards models were fit on a propensity score-weighted cohort to compare time to recurrent AKI and mortality by RAASi exposure. Among 96,983 patients, 40% were on RAASi at discharge. Compared to patients who continued RAASi use, those discontinuing use experienced no difference in risk for recurrent AKI but had a significantly higher risk of mortality [hazard ratio 1.33 (95% confidence interval1.26-1.41)]. No differences in recurrent AKI risk was observed for non-users started or not on RAASi compared to prevalent users who continued RAASi. Subgroup analyses among those with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and malignancy were similar with exception of a modest reduction in recurrent AKI risk among RAASi discontinuers with chronic kidney disease. Thus, RAASi use among survivors of moderate to severe AKI was associated with little to no difference in risk for recurrent AKI but was associated with improved survival.

On this basis, an improved rumor spreading model under media coverage is constructed in combination with time delay. Two thresholds are calculated by using the comparison theorem of impulse differential equation. The conditions of global attractively and persistence of rumor spreading are analyzed. Then, the optimal control problem under pulse vaccination is designed to minimize the rumor spreading scale and control cost, then the optimality conditions are obtained by using the Pontryagin's minimum principle. Finally, the theoretical results are verified by numerical simulations. It shown that increasing the proportion of pulse vaccination or shortening the pulse period or prolonging time delay contribute to the restraint of rumors. Increasing the pulse period or decreasing the delay time both aggravate the rumor spreading.

Prior research operationalized entrepreneurial careers as an escape from poor work environments; thus, there is a lack of understanding regarding how job-satisfaction can trigger entrepreneurship within and related to the environment of universities. This study, draws on Social Cognitive Career Theory and the concept of entrepreneurial intention, to address whether the role of job satisfaction is a moderating factor between outcome expectations and entrepreneurial intention. Furthermore, we examine to what extent (I) entrepreneurial intention and (II) spin-off intention are determined by certain outcome expectations and perceived behavioral control. To address these questions this study examined academic researchers in specialized and non-technical fields and builds on a survey of 593 academic researchers at Swiss Universities of Applied Science. The results showed that outcome expectations are a significant predictor for entrepreneurial intentions, in general, and spin-off intentions, in particular. A multi-group analysis corroborated that job satisfaction operates as a motivational factor in entrepreneurial transition and interactions with entrepreneurial outcome expectations. In conclusion, the concept of job satisfaction and Social Cognitive Career Theory were powerful constructs to better the understand the process of entrepreneurial career decisions by academic researchers.","output":"Should I Stay, or Should I Go?

This study aims to evaluate its effectiveness in improving eHL. Methods Between April 2019 and October 2020, college students attending the first year of medical and communication theory course at the University of Florence (Italy) joined a web-based survey before and after accessing the DMVEC website. The 8-item self-assessment IT-eHEALS tool was used to examine subjects eHL, in addition to questions on sources features and its quality. All responses were rated on a 5-points Likert scale. Changing of abilities perception was assessed using Wilcoxon test. Results 362 students joined the survey, 329 medical and 33 communication ones. Participants felt moderately confident in eHL, with an initial IT-eHEALS overall mean score of 3.6  0.7 for medical students and of 3.2  0.8 for communication students. Medical students had a good perception on how to find helpful health sources (mean score of 3.9  0.8) and communication students felt sure in discerning sources quality (mean score of 3.5  1.0). Instead, their confidence in using web information to make health decisions was low (medical students: mean score of 2.9  1.1;communication students: mean score of 2.8  1.1).

Two reviewers screened and studied titles, abstracts and reports. We extracted information to characterize sociodemographic variables, clinical presentation, laboratory results, treatments and outcomes. Results: Eight reports (n=12 patients) of GBS and COVID-19 were identified; one was a Miller Fisher case. Overall, the median age was 62.5 (interquartile range (IQR)=54.5-70.5) years, and there were more men (9/102). GBS symptoms started between 5 and 24 days after those of COVID-19.

Prior studies have examined the association between respiratory virus infection (RVI) and CLAD were limited by older diagnostic techniques, study design, and case numbers. We examined the association between symptomatic RVI and CLAD using modern diagnostic techniques in a large contemporary cohort of lung transplant recipients (LTRs). Methods. We retrospectively assessed clinical variables including acute rejection, cytomegalovirus pneumonia, upper and lower RVI, and the primary endpoint of CLAD (determined by 2 independent reviewers) in 250 LTRs in a single university transplantation program. Univariate and multivariate Cox models were used to analyze the relationship between RVI and CLAD in a time-dependent manner, incorporating different periods of risk following RVI diagnosis. Results. Fifty patients (20%) were diagnosed with CLAD at a median of 95 weeks post-transplantation, and 79 (32%) had 114 episodes of RVI.

Computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) complement each other, facilitating clinicians to arrive at a diagnosis. Hence, even with the best radiological modalities, correlation between clinical and microbiological findings is crucial for the accurate diagnosis of fungal rhinosinusitis. In addition, the role of traditional methods such as KOH microscopy and culture should be accurately evaluated. To this end, we aimed to diagnose rhinosinusitis with a fungal etiology based on radiological findings and subsequently correlate these findings with those of microbiological techniques, namely culture and KOH microscopy. A total of 57 clinically suspected fungal rhinosinusitis cases were included in the study. Radiological investigations were performed using either CT or MRI. Tissues samples were processed and analyzed using KOH microscopy and culture. The results of the study suggest that using a single method for the diagnosis of fungal rhinosinusitis is inadequate. Rather, the diagnosis should be based on radiological as well as microbiological findings, especially for cases that are clinically ambiguous.

The optimal cutoff values of FCP and FIT for predicting MH were 161 mg/kg and 106 ng/mL for UC and 367 mg/kg and 57 ng/mL for CD, respectively. FCP showed better specificity than the FIT. Patients with CD and normal ileocolonoscopy had elevated FCP during active small intestinal inflammation. CONCLUSIONS Both FCP and FIT correlate well with endoscopic activity in pediatric patients with IBD. The FCP is a superior marker for predicting MH.","output":"Both fecal calprotectin and fecal immunochemical tests are useful in children with inflammatory bowel disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Strategies to develop therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infection may be informed by experimental identification of viral-host protein interactions in cellular assays and measurement of host response proteins in COVID-19 patients. Identification of genetic variants that influence the level or activity of these proteins in the host could enable rapid in silico assessment in human genetic studies of their causal relevance as molecular targets for new or repurposed drugs to treat COVID-19. We integrated large-scale genomic and aptamer-based plasma proteomic data from 10,708 individuals to characterize the genetic architecture of 179 host proteins reported to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins or to participate in the host response to COVID-19. We identified 220 host DNA sequence variants acting in cis (MAF 0.01C49.9%) and explaining 0.3C70.9% of the variance of 97 of these proteins, including 45 with no previously known protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) and 38 encoding current drug targets. Systematic characterization of pQTLs across the phenome identified protein-drug-disease links, evidence that putative viral interaction partners such as MARK3 affect immune response, and establish the first link between a recently reported variant for respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients at the ABO locus and hypercoagulation, i.e. maladaptive host response.

This study analyzed the mediation role of coping and affect in the relation between self-compassion and negative emotional symptoms during the quarantine decreed by Portuguese Health Authorities in the first phase of the coronavirus outbreak. A total of 428 Portuguese adults (75% women; M(age) = 40.8, SD = 11.6) completed an online survey comprised by the Self-Compassion Scale (predictor); Short Version of Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (outcomes); The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; and Brief-COPE. These instruments were adapted to COVID 19s epidemic. Parallel mediation analyses demonstrated that self-compassionate participants were at less risk of suffering from symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress during the quarantine. Plus, the relation between self-compassion and depressive, anxious, and stress symptoms were mediated by negative affect and dysfunctional coping style, but only for symptoms of depression. The findings support coping strategies and affect as links between self-compassion and distress but also the importance of separately analyzing the role of self-compassion, negative affect, and coping on symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress. Low self-compassion might increase negative affect, maintaining stress responses to face demanding events during the COVID-19 epidemic.

In the last century, some researchers and clinician have noticed that the psychosocial and neurocognitive functioning of patients with malignant gliomas can be impaired. Many clinical studies have demonstrated that part of patients, adults or children, diagnosed with glioblastoma will suffer from cognitive deficiency during their clinical course, especially in long-term survivors. Many nanoparticles (NPs) can inhibit the biological functions of tumours by modulating tumour-associated inflammation, which provokes angiogenesis and tumour growth. As one of the best antiviral nanoparticles (AVNPs), AVNP2 is the 2nd generation of AVNP2 that have been conjugated to graphite-graphene for improving physiochemical performance and reducing toxicity. AVNP2 inactivates viruses, such as the H1N1 and H5N1influenza viruses and even the SARS coronavirus, while it inhibits bacteria, such as MRSA and E. coli. As antimicrobials, nanoparticles are considered to be one of the vectors for the administration of therapeutic compounds. Yet, little is known about their potential functionalities and toxicities to the neurotoxic effects of cancer. Herein, we explored the functionality of AVNP2 on inhibiting C6 in glioma-bearing rats. The novel object-recognition test and open-field test showed that AVNP2 significantly improved the neuro-behaviour affected by C6 glioma. AVNP2 also alleviated the decline of long-term potentiation (LTP) and the decreased density of dendritic spines in the CA1 region induced by C6. Western blot assay and immunofluorescence staining showed that the expressions of synaptic-related proteins (PSD-95 and SYP) were increased, and these findings were in accordance with the results mentioned above. It revealed that the sizes of tumours in C6 glioma-bearing rats were smaller after treatment with AVNP2. The decreased expression of inflammatory factors (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-) by Western blotting assay and ELISA, angiogenesis protein (VEGF) by Western blotting assay and other related proteins (BDNF, NF-?B, iNOS and COX-2) by Western blotting assay in peri-tumour tissue indicated that AVNP2 could control tumour-associated inflammation, thus efficiently ameliorating the local inflammatory condition and, to some extent, inhibiting angiogenesis in C6-bearing rats. In conclusion, our results suggested that AVNP2 could have an effect on the peri-tumor environment, obviously restraining the growth progress of gliomas, and eventually improving cognitive levels in C6-bearing rats.","output":"AVNP2 protects against cognitive impairments induced by C6 glioma by suppressing tumour associated inflammation in rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the most important problems in contemporary science, and especially in biology, is to reveal mechanisms of pattern formation. On the level of biological tissues, patterns form due to interactions between cells. These interactions can be long-range if mediated by diffusive molecules or short-range when associated with cell-to-cell contact sites. Mathematical studies of long-range interactions involve models based on differential equations while short-range interactions are modelled using discrete type models. In this paper, we use cellular automata (CA) technique to study formation of patterns due to short-range interactions. Namely, we use von Neumann cellular automata represented by a finite set of lattices whose states evolve according to transition rules. Lattices can be considered as representing biological cells (which, in the simplest case, can only be in one of the two different states) while the transition rules define changes in their states due to the cell-to-cell contact interactions. In this model, we identify rules resulting in the formation of stationary periodic patterns. In our analysis, we distinguish rules which do not destroy preset patterns and those which cause pattern formation from random initial conditions. Also, we check whether the forming patterns are resistant to noise and analyse the time frame for their formation. Transition rules which allow formation of stationary periodic patterns are then discussed in terms of pattern formation in biology.","output":"Formation of Morphogenetic Patterns in Cellular Automata"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Schwannoma, a benign nerve sheath tumor, is quite rare and more so in jawbones.

The primary aim of this study was to identify risks for breastfeeding/pumping cessation with neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) infants' mothers who smoke or live with individuals who smoke, using a novel survival-analytic approach. METHODS/DESIGN: Mothers (N = 360) were recruited for a secondhand smoke prevention intervention during infants' NICU hospitalizations and followed for ~6 months after infant discharge. Data were obtained from medical records and participant self-report/interviews. RESULTS: The sample was predominantly ethnic/racial minorities; mean age was 26.8 (SD = 5.9) years. One-fifth never initiated breastfeeding/pumping (n = 67; 18.9%) and mean time-to-breastfeeding cessation was 48.1 days (SD = 57.2; median = 30.4 [interquartile range: 6.0-60.9]). Education, length of stay, employment, race/ethnicity, number of household members who smoke, and readiness-to-protect infants from tobacco smoke were significantly associated with breastfeeding cessation. Further, infants fed breast milk for &#8805;4 months had 42.7% more well-child visits (p < 0.001) and 50.0% fewer respiratory-related clinic visits (p < 0.05). DISCUSSION: One-quarter of infants admitted to NICUs will be discharged to households where individuals who smoke live; we demonstrated that smoking-related factors were associated with mothers' breastfeeding practices.

METHODS A retrospective analysis of data from patients with deep infiltrating endometriosis with rectal involvement who underwent a laparoscopic surgery in the years 2002-2009 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at our institution was done. RESULTS Between 2002 and 2009, a laparoscopic partial rectal resection was performed in 52 patients, and laparoscopic disk resection was performed in 4 cases with deep infiltrating endometriosis. The mean age of patients was 34.4 years (range, 22-62 years). Preoperative symptoms included dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, chronic pelvic pain, and infertility. The laparoscopic procedure was converted to formal laparotomy in 3 patients (5.4%). The mean duration of surgery was 145 minutes. Postoperative complications included 3 cases of anastomotic leakage with rectovaginal fistula in two cases and intraabdominal bleeding in 1 case. The mean hospital stay was 7 days. Postoperatively, nine patients had a normal delivery, two of them after in vitro fertilization treatment.

With quarantine and social distancing restrictions, school closures, and recreational venues suspended or providing reduced access, the social safety net for violence prevention has been disrupted significantly. Impacts include the concerns of underreporting and increased risk of child abuse and neglect, as well as challenges in operating CPSs and keeping their workforce safe. OBJECTIVE: The current discussion paper explored the impact of COVID-19 on child maltreatment reports and CPS responses by comparing countries using available population data. METHOD: Information was gathered from researchers in eight countries, including contextual information about the country's demographics and economic situation, key elements of the CPS, and the CPS response to COVID-19. Where available, information about other factors affecting children was also collected. These data informed a discussion about between-country similarities and differences. RESULTS: COVID-19 had significant impact on the operation of every CPS, whether in high- income or low-income countries. Most systems encountered some degree of service disruption or change. Risk factors for children appeared to increase while there were often substantial deficits in CPS responses, and in most countries there was at a temporary decrease in CM reports despite the increased risks to children. CONCLUSIONS: The initial data presented and discussed among the international teams pointed to the way COVID-19 has hampered CPS responses and the protection of children more generally in most jurisdictions, highlighting that children appear to have been at greater risk for maltreatment during COVID-19.","output":"Child maltreatment reports and Child Protection Service responses during COVID-19: Knowledge exchange among Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Germany, Israel, and South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new family of IFNs called type III IFN or IFN- has been described, and shown to induce antiviral activity against several viruses in the cell culture.

The full-length poIFN-3 cDNA sequence encoded 196 amino acids with a 23 amino acid signal peptide. Sequence alignments showed that poIFN-3 had an amino acid sequence similarity to Ovis aries (78.1 %), Bos taurus (76.0 %), Tupaia belangeri (71.3 %), Equus caballus (69.9 %), and Homo sapiens (69.9 %). The phylogenetic analysis based on the genomic sequences indicated that poIFN-3 is located in the same branch as B. taurus and O. aries IFN-3. The poIFN-3 without a signal anchor sequence was efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant poIFN-3 exhibited significant antiviral effects against PEDV in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect of poIFN-3 on PEDV was observed under three different treatment conditions. The highest inhibition of PEDV was observed in Vero E6 cell cultures pretreated with poIFN-3 (prior to PEDV infection). In addition, poIFN-3 was able to induce the expression of IFN-stimulated genes, including ISG15, OAS1, and Mx1 in Vero E6 cells.

Therefore, in this study, Fu and bc loops were joined together to develop a short recombinant protein as an alternative of whole DENV envelope protein, and its immunogenic potential as fusion peptide was estimated. For de novo designing of the antigen, Fu and bc peptides were linked with an optimised linker so that the three dimensional conformation was maintained as it is in DENV envelope protein. The redesigned Fubc protein was expressed in E. coli and purified. Subsequently, structural integrity of the purified protein was verified by CD spectroscopy. To characterise immune responses against recombinant Fubc protein, BALB/c mice were subcutaneously injected with emulsified antigen preparation. It was observed by ELISA that Fubc fusion protein elicited higher serum IgG antibody response either in the presence or in absence of Freunds adjuvant in comparison to the immune response of Fu and bc peptides separately. Furthermore, the binding of Fubc protein with mice antisera was validated by SPR analysis.

Due to the unique challenges that they face, afflicted patients and their families benefit from support groups that provide psychosocial support. Hospitals have traditionally preferred in-person support group meetings, but there has recently been a great increase in the need for online meetings amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. With increasing usage of the Internet for health advice and assistance, it is important to assess the availability of information on support groups online. METHODS: Two independent investigators queried the terms Crohns support group using the Google search engine. The first 100 websites were analyzed and categorized into either informational websites (IW) or professional websites (PW) depending on their association. The mode of support group meetings was categorized as either online or in-person. Websites that included outdated events, were inaccessible, did not specify the mode of meeting, required additional contact, or were irrelevant were excluded. Statistical analyses were performed using the chi-squared test of independence with significance level at p<0.05. RESULTS: A total of 56 websites (33 IW, 23 PW) met our inclusion criteria. IW offered online meetings more often than PW (60.6% and 39.1%, respectively; p=0.11). In contrast, PW offered in-person meetings more often than IW (73.9% and 69.7%, respectively; p=0.73). Excluded websites (30 IW, 14 PW) were further analyzed for their reason for elimination. For IW, the most frequent causes of exclusion in descending order were as follows: irrelevance (30.0%), outdated (26.7%), inaccessible (20.0%), did not specify the mode of meeting (13.3%), and redirected for further information (10.0%). Listing of outdated sessions was the most common reason for exclusion of PW from the study (57.1%), and the proportion was significantly higher than IW (26.7%) (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Crohns disease patients face unique challenges that require special attention. Support groups are an important means of alleviating stress, depression, and anxiety in order to improve their QOL. Yet, due to the COVID-19 social distancing policies, many are refrained from participating in in-person sessions.

Aim To characterize the demographics of those tested and infected with COVID-19 in Georgia; to evaluate factors associated with transmission between cases and their contacts; and to determine how transmission varied due to NPI up to 24 June 2020. Methods We use data gathered by the Georgian National Center for Disease Control on all polymerase chain reaction tests conducted (among symptomatic patients, through routine testing and contact tracing); hospitalization data for confirmed cases, and contact tracing data. We calculated the number of contacts per index case, the secondary attack rate (% contacts infected), and effective R number (new cases per index case), and used logistic regression to estimate how age, gender, and contact type affected transmission. Results Most contacts and transmission events were between family members. Contacts <40 years were less likely to be infected, while infected individuals >50 were more likely to die than younger patients. Contact tracing identified 917 index cases with mean 3.1 contacts tested per case, primarily family members. The overall secondary attack rate was 28% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 26-29%) and effective R number was 0.87 (95%CI 0.81-0.93), peaking at 1.1 (95%CI 0.98-1.2) during the period with strongest restrictions.

Based on anatomic preparations of all ear muscles on two cadavers, hot spots for the needle EMG of each individual muscle were defined. Needle and surface EMG were performed in one healthy participant; facial movements could be defined for the reliable activation of individual ear muscles' surface EMG. In healthy participants, most tasks led to the activation of several ear muscles without any side difference. The greatest EMG activity was seen when smiling. Ipsilateral and contralateral gaze were the only movements resulting in very distinct activation of the transversus auriculae and obliquus auriculae muscles. In patients with facial synkinesis, ear muscles' EMG activation was stronger on the postparalytic compared to the contralateral side for most tasks. Additionally, synkinetic activation was verifiable in the ear muscles. The surface EMG of all ear muscles is reliably feasible during distinct facial tasks, and ear muscle EMG enriches facial electrodiagnostics.","output":"Electromyography of Extrinsic and Intrinsic Ear Muscles in Healthy Probands and Patients with Unilateral Postparalytic Facial Synkinesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a new concept for biomarker discovery and gene expression data classification that rises from the Relative Expression Analysis (RXA).

The main contribution is a decision tree with splitting nodes that consider relative fraction comparisons between multiple gene pairs. In addition, to face the enormous computational complexity of RXA, the most time-consuming part which is scoring all possible gene pairs in each splitting node is parallelized using GPU. This way the algorithm allows searching for more tailored interactions between sub-groups of genes in a reasonable time.

Cancer patients are felt to be a high-risk group for COVID-19, and therefore, concerns have been raised regarding the safety of operating during this time; however, the potential risk of cancer progression if untreated must also be considered. The aim of this study was therefore to identify the incidence of COVID-19 post-operatively in patients undergoing elective cancer surgery of all types. METHODS: Data were collected on all patients who had an elective therapeutic cancer operation in a single large district general hospital, where standard COVID-19 precautions were in place, between 01/02/2020 and 27/4/2020, Follow-up was for a minimum of 2 weeks post-discharge. The primary outcome was the incidence of COVID-19 during the follow-up period. RESULTS: A total of 621 elective cancer surgeries, from a range of specialities, were performed during the study period, with 55% (n = 341) being done as day cases. None of the patients were positive for COVID-19 post-operatively using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of COVID-19 following elective cancer surgery in this group of high-risk patients appears to be minimal in this study. With further precautions being introduced to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19, an increase in the rate of elective cancer surgery should be a current priority for all hospitals where possible.","output":"Is Elective Cancer Surgery Safe During the COVID-19 Pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine that was recently launched exhibited high levels of efficacy and safety in a phase III RCT, along with robust immunogenicity in phase II trials.

Methods: We measured titers of neutralizing IgGs against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 14 days post-immunization of 425 healthcare providers utilizing the SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay and estimated the geometric mean concentration (GMC) of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgGs both in the previously-infected group and among the uninfected. The trial is registered on the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number registry (study ID: ISRCTN61884303).Results: 392 of study participants 92.24% (95% CI:89.27, 94.43) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay, while 33 subjects had an IgG concentration lower than 50 AU/ml (GMC 24.80303 AU/ml;95% CI:19.190, 30.41612). All 63 previously-infected convalescent participants had very high SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titers with a GMC of 19993,61AU/ml.

Studies with type I interferon (IFN-I) receptor (IFNAR)-deficient mice revealed a key role of the IFN-I axis in the protection against CVB3 infection, whereas the source of IFN-I and cell types that have to be IFNAR triggered in order to promote survival are still unknown. We found that CVB3 infected IFN- reporter mice showed effective reporter induction, especially in hepatocytes and only to a minor extent in liver-resident macrophages. Accordingly, upon in vitro CVB3 infection of primary hepatocytes from murine or human origin abundant IFN- responses were induced. To identify sites of IFNAR-triggering we performed experiments with Mx reporter mice, which upon CVB3 infection showed massive luciferase induction in the liver. Immunohistological studies revealed that during CVB3 infection MX1 expression of hepatocytes was induced primarily by IFNAR-, and not by IFN-III receptor (IFNLR)-triggering. CVB3 infection studies with primary human hepatocytes, in which either the IFN-I or the IFN-III axis was inhibited, also indicated that primarily IFNAR-, and to a lesser extent IFNLR-triggering was needed for ISG induction. Interestingly, CVB3 infected mice with a hepatocyte-specific IFNAR ablation showed severe liver cell necrosis and ubiquitous viral dissemination that resulted in lethal disease, as similarly detected in classical IFNAR(-/-) mice. In conclusion, we found that during CVB3 infection hepatocytes are major IFN-I producers and that the liver is also the organ that shows strong IFNAR-triggering. Importantly, hepatocytes need to be IFNAR-triggered in order to prevent virus dissemination and to assure survival. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that during CVB3 infection hepatocytes serve as important IFN-I producers and sensors not only in the murine, but also in the human system.","output":"Interferon-beta expression and type I interferon receptor signaling of hepatocytes prevent hepatic necrosis and virus dissemination in Coxsackievirus B3-infected mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of an adept and potent countermeasure, especially a vaccine to provide active acquired immunity against the virus is essential to cease the accelerated spread of COVID-19. In this study, we attempt to justify the prospect of designing a vaccine for COVID-19 based on the genetic similarity between the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 and RaTG13 virus.Various studies reveal a sequence similarity between that of SARS-COV-2 and bat RaTG13 i.e. up to 96% genetic similarity. The major differences being in the receptor-binding domain of spike protein.In this study, the protein sequences for a set of predicted epitope sites on spike, nucleocapsid, and membrane proteins of SARS-CoV-2 strains were compared for the same sequence on the RaTG13 virus. The results indicated a high degree of similarity for the epitope sites ranging between 95-100% for both T and B cell epitopes.Using the zoonotic strain RaTG13 virus as a vaccine could prove to have an added advantage such that the furin cleavage site present on the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 is absent in RaTG13 virus. This furin cleavage site is essential for the entry of the virus onto the host cell and hence vital for causing infection. Thus, its absence could add to the safety of the vaccine.With the high degree of similarity observed for B & T cell epitope sites in SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 and the absence of furin cleavage sites on RaTG13 as an additional advantage, the study suggests that the zoonotic RaTG13 virus could be considered for the development of a potential vaccine for COVID-19.","output":"Prospect of Using RaTG13 Sarbecovirus As a Candidate Vaccine for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protective policies have been unequally and inconsistently applied in the United States throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.

Establishing a DV Registry System (DVRS) can help to systematically integrate data from several sources and provide valid and reliable information on the scope and severity of harms. The main objective of this study was to develop, validate, and pilot-test a minimum datasheet for a DVRS to register DV victims in medical facilities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted in two main phases. Phase one includes developing the datasheet for registration of DV in the DVRS. In phase two, the datasheet designed in the previous step was used in a pilot implementation of the DVRS for 12 months to find practical challenges. The preliminary datasheet was first developed using information on similar registry programs and guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) and then reviewed by four expert panels. Through a two-round Delphi technique, experts evaluated the instrument using the Content Validity Index (CVI) and Content Validity Ratio (CVR). The consistency of the responses was evaluated by test-retest analysis. Finally, two physicians in two forensic medical clinics registered the victims of physical and/or sexual violence perpetrated by a family member. RESULTS: Preliminary datasheet consisted of 31 items. In the first round of Delphi, fifteen items had good content validity (I-CVI and CVR) and were kept, and seven items were moved to the next round. Also, in the first round of Delphi, experts suggested adding three items, including history of the violence, custody of the child, and custody of the elderly. All items evaluated in the second round were kept due to good CVR and CVI scores. As a result of Test-retest correlation coefficients for self-reprted items, two items including perpetrators alcohol and drug use status were excluded (r(30) = +.43, and +.38, p< .01, two-tailed, respectively). Finally, 24 items were included in the datasheet including 15 items for individuals characteristics (victims characteristics and perpetrators characteristics), eight items for incidents characteristics, and one item for past history of violence experience. A total of 369 cases were registered from September 23, 2019, to July 21, 2020. The majority of the reported cases were female (82%) and were 19C40 years old. No physical and/or sexual violence was reported from rural areas, which calls upon researchers to explore how services for detecting and treating the victims can be made accessible to these areas. CONCLUSION: DVRS can show trends in DV by age, sex, the context of the violence, and incidence characteristics at every point in time. This is particularly valuable in planning and prioritizing research areas and interventions for DV prevention. Additionally, DVRS can be linked to other disease registry programs which can contribute to continuity and coordination of care, and major research in the future. Although a DVRS can be a promising initiative in identifying the areas in need of urgent interventions, there is no guarantee for its proper implementation due to limited resources and other challenges.","output":"Development, validation, and pilot implementation of the minimum datasheet for a domestic violence registry system: The case of a developing country"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Effective waiting list management and comprehensive prioritisation can provide timely delivery of appropriate services to ensure that the patient needs are met and increase equity in the provision of health services.

We hypothesized a priori that the mood disturbance groups would perform worse than healthy controls, with the comorbid group performing worst overall. METHODS: Eight hundred and thirty-one (M = 620, F = 211) collegiate athletes completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery at baseline which included self-report measures of anxiety and depression. Athletes were separated into four groups [Healthy Control (HC) (n = 578), Depressive Symptoms Only (n = 137), Anxiety Symptoms Only (n = 54), and Comorbid Depressive/Anxiety Symptoms (n = 62)] based on their anxiety and depression scores. Athletes' neurocognitive functioning was analyzed via Z score composites of Attention/Processing Speed and Memory. RESULTS: One-way analysis of variance revealed that, compared to HC athletes, the comorbid group performed significantly worse on measures of Attention/Processing Speed but not Memory. However, those in the depressive symptoms only and anxiety symptoms only groups were not significantly different from one another or the HC group on neurocognitive outcomes. Chi-square analyses revealed that a significantly greater proportion of athletes in all three affective groups were neurocognitively impaired compared to the HC group. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that collegiate athletes with comorbid depressive/anxiety symptoms should be identified, as their poorer cognitive performance at baseline could complicate post-concussion interpretation. Thus, assessing for mood disturbance at baseline is essential to obtain an accurate measurement of baseline functioning.

Most research exists to reduce demand (n=149);39 higher quality studies reported benefits of contact tracing, school closures, travel restrictions, and mass vaccination. Of 28 strategies to augment resources, 6 higher quality studies reported effectiveness of establishing temporary facilities, use of volunteers, and decision support software. Of 23 strategies to optimize existing resources, 12 higher quality studies reported successful scope of work expansions and building on existing interagency agreements. Of 15 COVID-19 studies, 4 higher quality studies evaluated combinations of policies and one reported benefits of community-wide mask policies. Conclusion: Despite the volume, the evidence base is limited;few strategies were empirically tested in robust study designs. The review provides a comprehensive overview of the effects of strategies to allocate resources and provides critical appraisal to direct them to the best available evidence.","output":"Allocation of Scarce Resources in a Pandemic: Rapid Systematic Review Update of Strategies for Policy Makers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This study aimed to summarize the characteristics of chest CT imaging in Chinese patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) to provide reliable evidence for further guiding clinical routine. Methods: PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases were thoroughly searched to identified relevant articles involving the features of chest CT imaging in Chinese patients with COVID-19. All data were analyzed utilizing R software version i386 4.0.0. Random-effects models were employed to calculate pooled mean differences. Results: 19 trials incorporating 1332 cases were included in the study. The results demonstrated that the incidence of ground-glass opacities (GGO) was 0.79, consolidation was 0.34; mixed GGO and consolidation was 0.46; air bronchogram sign was 0.41; crazy paving pattern was 0.32; interlobular septal thickening was 0.55; reticulation was 0.30; bronchial wall thickening was 0.24; vascular enlargement was 0.74. subpleural linear opacity was 0.28; intrathoracic lymph node enlargement was 0.03; pleural effusions was 0.03. The distribution in lung: the incidence of central was 0.05; peripheral was 0.74; peripheral involving central was 0.38; diffuse was 0.19; unifocal involvement was 0.09; multifocal involvement was 0.57; unilateral was 0.16; bilateral was 0.83; The incidence of lobes involved (>2) was 0.70; lobes involved ([less double equals]2) was 0.35. Conclusion: GGO, vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening more frequently occurred in patients with COVID-19. Peripheral, bilateral, involved lobes >2 might be the features of COVID-19 in the distribution aspect.

In this regard, the Crisis Management Interprofessional Education program (CMIPE) in the form of desktop maneuver with the presence of the military nurses and other professional groups involved in the crisis was designed and implemented in Military Nursing School in Tehran, Iran. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of the military nurses of participating in an interprofessional education program in crisis management domain. METHODS: This was an exploratory case study using conventional content analysis of the experiences of 28 military nurses participating in this program. The qualitative data were collected with three methods including observation in the field (note-taking and filming) and an open-ended questionnaire and two focus group discussions with military nurses. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis of the experiences of military nurses led to the emergence of four overarching themes which included professional mutual recognition, shared mental models, valuing joint responsibility and collaboration, perceived self-worth as a member of an interprofessional team. CONCLUSION: The crisis management education based on an interprofessional approach created new experiences for military nurses by bringing together professional groups involved in a crisis in a constructive interaction, and with emphasis on learning from each other. This empowers them to provide teamwork and interprofessional collaboration in a critical situation, and therefore, enhancing their ability to cope with different crises.","output":"Military nurses Experiences of Interprofessional education in Crisis Management: a Qualitative Content Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Aim Contact lens wearers need to maintain optimal hygiene practices during the COVID-19 pandemic to minimise contact-lens complications including microbial keratitis and corneal infiltrative events.

We previously showed that this immunosenescence includes a reduction in the functional maturation of M cells in the follicle-associated epithelia (FAE) covering the Peyers patches, diminishing the ability to sample of antigens and pathogens from the gut lumen. Here, co-expression analysis of mRNA-seq data sets revealed a general down-regulation of most FAE- and M cell-related genes in Peyers patches from aged mice, including key transcription factors known to be essential for M cell differentiation. Conversely, expression of ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS-Cov-2 virus, was increased in the aged FAE. This raises the possibility that the susceptibility of aged Peyers patches to infection with the SARS-Cov-2 virus is increased. Expression of key Paneth cell-related genes was also reduced in the ileum of aged mice, consistent with the adverse effects of aging on their function. However, the increased expression of these genes in the villous epithelium of aged mice suggested a disturbed distribution of Paneth cells in the aged intestine. Aging effects on Paneth cells negatively impact on the regenerative ability of the gut epithelium and could indirectly impede M cell differentiation. Thus, restoring Paneth cell function may represent a novel means to improve M cell differentiation in the aging intestine and increase mucosal vaccination efficacy in the elderly.","output":"Aging-Related Impairments to M Cells in Peyers Patches Coincide With Disturbances to Paneth Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy seems likely to increase mortality rates and delay the easing of social distancing restrictions Online platforms with large audiences may influence vaccine hesitancy by spreading fear and misinformation that is avoided by the mainstream media Understanding what types of vaccine hesitancy information is shared on the popular social web site Twitter may therefore help to design interventions to address misleading attitudes This study applies content analysis to a random sample of 446 vaccine hesitant Covid-19 tweets in English posted between 10 March and 5 December 2020 The main themes discussed were conspiracies, vaccine development speed, and vaccine safety Most (79%) of those tweeting refusal to take a vaccine expressed right-wing opinions, fear of a deep state, or conspiracy theories A substantial minority of vaccine refusers (18%) mainly tweeted non-politically about other themes The topics on Twitter reflect vaccine concerns, but those stating vaccine refusal in non-political contexts may unsettle the wider Twitter network by reaching outside right-wing areas of Twitter","output":"Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy on English-language Twitter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nucleic acids are promising for a variety of therapies, such as cancer therapy and the gene therapy of genetic disorders.

Severely ill patients may present with thyroid function abnormalities, so-called non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS), and several studies have linked TSH and the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) to homeostatic regulation and function of lymphocyte populations. PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that abnormal thyroid function correlates with lymphopenia in patients with severe infections. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of absolute lymphocyte counts, circulating TSH, T4, free T4 (FT4), T3, albumin and inflammatory biomarkers was performed in two independent hospitalized study populations: bacterial sepsis (n=224) and COVID-19 patients (n=161). A subgroup analysis was performed in patients with severe lymphopenia and normal lymphocyte counts. RESULTS: Only T3 significantly correlated (rho=0.252) with lymphocyte counts in patients with bacterial sepsis and lower concentrations were found in severe lymphopenic compared to non-lympopenic patients (n=56 per group). Severe lymphopenic COVID-19 patients (n=17) showed significantly lower plasma concentrations of TSH, T4, FT4 and T3 compared to patients without lymphopenia (n=18), and demonstrated significantly increased values of the inflammatory markers interleukin-6, C-reactive protein and ferritin. Remarkably, after one week follow-up, the majority (12/15) of COVID-19 patients showed quantitative recovery of their lymphocyte numbers, while TSH and thyroid hormones remained mainly disturbed.

This study aimed to compare initial values and longitudinal changes in respiratory system compliance (CRS), oxygenation parameters and ventilatory ratio (VR) in patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pulmonary ARDS matched on oxygenation. METHODS: 135 patients with COVID-19 ARDS from two centers were included in a physiological study; 767 non-COVID-19 ARDS from a clinical trial were used for the purpose of at least 1:2 matching. A propensity-matching was based on age, severity score, oxygenation, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and pulmonary cause of ARDS and allowed to include 112 COVID-19 and 198 non-COVID pulmonary ARDS. RESULTS: The two groups were similar on initial oxygenation. COVID-19 patients had a higher body mass index, higher CRS at day 1 (median [IQR], 35 [28-44] vs 32 [26-38] ml cmH2O-1, p = 0.037). At day 1, CRS was correlated with oxygenation only in non-COVID-19 patients; 61.6% and 68.2% of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pulmonary ARDS were still ventilated at day 7 (p = 0.241). Oxygenation became lower in COVID-19 than in non-COVID-19 patients at days 3 and 7, while CRS became similar. VR was lower at day 1 in COVID-19 than in non-COVID-19 patients but increased from day 1 to 7 only in COVID-19 patients. VR was higher at days 1, 3 and 7 in the COVID-19 patients ventilated using heat and moisture exchangers compared to heated humidifiers. After adjustment on PaO2/FiO2, PEEP and humidification device, CRS and VR were found not different between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients at day 7. Day-28 mortality did not differ between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients (25.9% and 23.7%, respectively, p = 0.666).

This novel mechanism can reduce LDL by a?? 50%, like reductions achieved with high intensity statins or PCSK9 inhibiting monoclonal antibodies. Inclisiran is indicated in the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), unable to achieve target LDL concentrations with diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy. It is more expensive than PCSK9 inhibiting monoclonal antibodies and still lacks clinical evidence for the expected reduction in ASCVD events when added to statin therapy. Although some patients experience injection site reactions of mild or moderate severity, current evidence suggests a strong safety profile with total and serious adverse events approximating that of placebo. The dosing protocol of inclisiran offers its biggest clinical advantage over PCSK9 inhibiting monoclonal antibodies, being administered only every six months after initial baseline and three-month doses rather than every second or fourth week.

Thus, inclisirin is a novel siRNA molecule that provides further options in the management of hypercholesterolemia refractory to statins alone.

The continuum of care via telestroke has broadened to include prehospital, inter-facility and intra-facility hospital-based services, stroke telerehabilitation, and ambulatory telestroke. However, disparities in technology access remain a challenge. Preservation of reimbursement and the reduction of regulatory burden that was initiated during the public health emergency will be necessary to maintain expanded patient access to the full complement of telestroke services.

In this large community-based cohort study of the UK Biobank, 24,130 patients diagnosed with depression were compared to 120,366 matched individuals without such a diagnosis. Follow-up was conducted from 6 months after the index date until death or the end of 2019, for the occurrence of 470 medical conditions and 16 specific causes of death. The median age at the time of the depression diagnosis was 62.0 years, and most of the patients were female (63.63%). During a median follow-up of 4.94 years, 129 medical conditions were found to be significantly associated with a prior diagnosis of depression, based on adjusted Cox regression models. Using disease trajectory network analysis to visualize the magnitude of diseaseCdisease associations and the temporal order of the associated medical conditions, we identified three main affected disease clusters after depression (i.e., cardiometabolic diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases, and diseases related to tobacco abuse), which were further linked to a wider range of other conditions. In addition, we also identified three depression-mortality trajectories leading to death due to cardiovascular disease, respiratory system disease and malignant neoplasm. In conclusion, an inpatient diagnosis of depression in later life is associated with three distinct network-based clusters of medical conditions, indicating alterations in the cardiometabolic system, chronic status of inflammation, and tobacco abuse as key pathways to a wide range of other conditions downstream. If replicated, these pathways may constitute promising targets for the health promotion among depression patients.","output":"Disease trajectories and mortality among individuals diagnosed with depression: a community-based cohort study in UK Biobank"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a surge in the use of video visits for both established and new patients. As policymakers and clinicians think about the permanent role of video visits after the pandemic, there is a critical need to understand how the lack of a physical exam during video visits can impact surgical management of urologic conditions. METHODS: We reviewed medical records for 350 consecutive urology patients who underwent new patient video visits from March through May 2020. We identified all patients who had a procedure (or surgery) recommended during, and scheduled after, their video visit. Our primary outcome was procedural plan concordance, the proportion of video visit plans that remained the same after the patient was seen in-person, either in clinic or on day of surgery. The median days between video and in-person visits was compared between concordant and discordant cases using the Mann-Whitney U test;p <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Of the 350 patients, 117 (33%) were evaluated by new patient video visits and had a procedure or surgery scheduled. Of which, 108 (92%) had concordant (unchanged) plans after in-person evaluation. Further, 98% of plans for in-office procedures and 88% of plans for operating room procedures were concordant with virtual visit recommendations. Seven patients (6%) had their surgical plans altered due to a change in their clinical course and two patients (1.7%) were counseled that operative approach would depend on genitourinary exam findings (Table 1). The number of days between video visit and in-person evaluation did not differ significantly in concordant cases (median 45 [IQR, 17.3-91]) as compared to discordant cases (median 55 [IQR, 20-140];p=0.6). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that most surgical plans developed during new patient video visits are unchanged after inperson examination. However, certain urologic conditions (e.g., penile cancer) rely on the genitourinary exam to dictate the surgical approach. Continued research on the clinical appropriateness of video visits is necessary to optimize video visit delivery.","output":"Does the lack of a physical exam during video visits impact surgical plans?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: While respiratory failure is a frequent and clinically significant outcome of COVID-19, cardiac complications are a common feature in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and are associated with worse patient outcomes.

Methods and Results: We systematically compared autopsy samples from non-COVID-19 donors and COVID-19 patients using RNA-seq and immunohistochemistry. We observed strikingly increased expression levels of CCL2 as well as macrophage infiltration in heart tissues of COVID-19 patients. We generated an immuno-cardiac co-culture platform containing human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) and macrophages. We found that macrophages induce increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis in CMs by secreting IL-6 and TNF- after SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Using this immuno-cardiac co-culture platform, we performed a high content screen and identified ranolazine and tofacitinib as compounds that protect CMs from macrophage-induced cardiotoxicity.

Amidst this global crisis, various controversies have been emerging about how to manage the virus, ranging from whether face masks should be required as a preventive measure to whether hydroxychloroquine is an appropriate treatment. There has been a barrage of contradictory claims related to these issues. However, in many cases, it is not possible for an individual to wait until consensus is reached before deciding on a course of action. Meanwhile, to avoid misplacing trust, trust must be well grounded. Conventional school science largely focuses on the trustworthiness of data and evidence, rather than that of the people making scientific claims. This failure to consider the human factor renders conventional school science inadequate for helping students make informed judgements about granting trust. Drawing on the literature in epistemic practice, this paper highlights four epistemic processes potentially useful for students to ground their trust, including (1) identifying whether recognition from peer reviewers has been obtained; (2) examining the credentials of those who claim expertise; (3) determining the level of expert consensus; and (4) identifying possible sources of bias. Through critical reflection on events related to the Covid-19 pandemic as examples, this paper examines how these epistemic processes inform judgement about the trustworthiness of people in terms of their competence and motives. The discussion highlights the need to develop students capacity to identify expertise/ credentials, the nature of journals and of organisations when trust is assigned. This paper offers a frame for science educators on guiding students to place trust as a part of their decision-making process. The capability would be relevant to contexts beyond the Covid-19 pandemic.","output":"Trust in the time of corona: epistemic practice beyond hard evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a world health emergency.

METHODS We identified women aged 18 years with stage 0-IV breast cancer who were diagnosed in a single health system between January 2014 and July 2016. The baseline visit was defined as the first postdiagnosis, pretreatment clinical evaluation. Zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression (modeling non-zero DT scores and DT scores = 0) and logistic regression (modeling DT score  4, threshold for social services referral) were used to examine associations between baseline score (0 = none to 10 = extreme) and types of stressors (emotional, familial, practical, physical, spiritual) after adjustment for race/ethnicity and other characteristics. Linear regression with log transformation was used to identify predictors of time to evaluation and time to treatment. RESULTS A total of 1029 women were included (median baseline DT score = 4). Emotional, physical, and practical stressors were associated with distress in both the ZINB and logistic models (all P < .05). Black patients (n = 258) were more likely to report no distress than Whites (n = 675; ZINB zero model odds ratio, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.68-4.40; P < .001) despite reporting a similar number of stressors (P = .07). Higher DT scores were associated with shorter time to evaluation and time to treatment while being Black and having physical or practical stressors were associated with delays in both (all P < .05).

Both the abuse potential in mothers with ELM and in mothers with a history of mental disorders might be associated with a disturbed mother-child interaction. OBJECTIVE: The current study examined differences in emotional availability between mothers with a history of ELM and previous or current mental disorders (non-resilient), mothers with ELM without mental disorders (resilient), and control mothers without ELM and without mental disorders. METHODS: Thirty-three non-resilient mothers, 18 resilient mothers, and 37 control mothers and their 5- to 12-year-old children participated in a standardized mother-child interaction task. Videotaped interactions were rated by three independent, trained raters based on the Emotional Availability Scales (EA Scales) and compared between the groups. RESULTS: The non-resilient mothers and their children showed reduced maternal sensitivity, structuring, non-intrusiveness, non-hostility, responsiveness, and involvement compared to the resilient mothers and their children and the control mothers and their children (p = 0.006, ?p2 = 0.12). No differences on any of the EA Scales were found between resilient mothers and control mothers. CONCLUSIONS: These deficits in mother-child interaction in non-resilient mothers might contribute to mechanisms that could explain the cycle of abuse. Interestingly, resilient mothers, who did not develop a mental disorder despite having experienced ELM, did not show these deficits.

Since most wastewater virus concentration methods were developed and validated for nonenveloped viruses, it is imperative to determine the efficiency of the most commonly used methods for the enveloped severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Municipal wastewater seeded with a human coronavirus (CoV) surrogate, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), was used to test the efficiency of seven wastewater virus concentration methods: (ACC) adsorption-extraction with three different pre-treatment options, (DCE) centrifugal concentration device methods with two different devices, (F) polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) concentration, and (G) ultrafiltration. MHV was quantified by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the concentration efficiency was calculated for each method. The mean MHV recoveries ranged from 26.7 to 65.7%. The most efficient methods were (B) Adsorption-extraction methods, with MgCl2 pre-treatment, and (C) without manipulation (C), most efficiently concentrated MHV. The third most efficient method used the Amicon? Ultra-15 centrifugal device (D) and its recovery efficiency was not statistically different from the most efficient methods. The methods with the worst recovery efficiency included the adsorption extraction method with acidification (A), followed by PEG concentration (F). Our results suggest that absorption-extraction methods with minimal pretreatment or without manipulation can provide suitably rapid, cost-effective and relatively straightforward recovery of enveloped viruses in wastewater. The MHV is a promising process control for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and can be used as a quality control measure to support community-level epidemic mitigation and risk assessment.","output":"Comparison of virus concentration methods for the RT-qPCR-based recovery of murine hepatitis virus, a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 from untreated wastewater"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brain tumors are difficult to treat and cause substantial fatalities worldwide. Medical professionals visually analyze the images and mark out the tumor regions to identify brain tumors, which is time-consuming and prone to error. Researchers have proposed automated methods in recent years to detect brain tumors early. These approaches, however, encounter difficulties due to their low accuracy and large false-positive values. An efficient tumor identification and classification approach is required to extract robust features and perform accurate disease classification. This paper proposes a novel multiclass brain tumor classification method based on deep feature fusion. The MR images are preprocessed using min-max normalization, and then extensive data augmentation is applied to MR images to overcome the lack of data problem. The deep CNN features obtained from transfer learned architectures such as AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet18 are fused to build a single feature vector and then loaded into Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) to predict the final output. The novel feature vector contains more information than the independent vectors, boosting the proposed method's classification performance. The proposed framework is trained and evaluated on 15,320 Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs). The study shows that the fused feature vector performs better than the individual vectors. Moreover, the proposed technique performed better than the existing systems and achieved accuracy of 99.7%; hence, it can be used in clinical setup to classify brain tumors from MRIs.","output":"A Novel and Effective Brain Tumor Classification Model Using Deep Feature Fusion and Famous Machine Learning Classifiers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anemia is a common complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and is associated with a reduced quality of life, and an increased morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms involved in anemia associated to CKD are diverse and complex.

Patients are most commonly managed with oral or intravenous iron supplements and with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA). However, these treatments have associated risks, and sometimes are insufficiently effective. Nonetheless, in the last years, there have been some remarkable advances in the treatment of CKD-related anemia, which have raised great expectations. On the one hand, a novel family of drugs has been developed: the hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs). These agents induce, among other effects, an increase in the production of endogenous EPO, improve iron availability and reduce hepcidin levels.

However, there is a lack of strong evidence to define the life-threatening conditions (LTCs) that telephone triage ought to identify. Therefore, we aimed to build consensus for the LTCs associated with chest pain that ought to be identified during telephone triage for emergency calls. METHODS: We conducted a Delphi study in three rounds. Twenty experts in pre-hospital care and emergency medicine experience from the UK were invited to participate. In round I, experts were asked to list all LTCs that would require priority 1, 2, and 4 ambulance responses. Round II was a ranking evaluation, and round III was a consensus round. Consensus level was predefined at > = 70%. RESULTS: A total of 15 participants responded to round one and 10 to rounds two and three. Of 185 conditions initially identified by the experts, 26 reached consensus in the final round. Ten conditions met consensus for requiring priority 1 response: oesophageal perforation/rupture; ST elevation myocardial infarction; non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with clinical compromise (defined, also by consensus, as oxygen saturation < 90%, heart rate < 40/min or systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg); acute heart failure; cardiac tamponade; life-threatening asthma; cardiac arrest; tension pneumothorax and massive pulmonary embolism.

Method: We conducted a descriptive epidemiological analysis of the first 100 deaths reported among RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases. Demographic, epidemiological, and risk factors information was obtained associated comorbidities and clinical signs and symptoms were recorded and frequencies were determined. Results: A total of 100 mortalities with overall Case Fatality Rate 1.67% (CFR) were analysed. Median age of patients was 64.5 years (IQR: 54-70) with 75% (n=75) Males. Among all deaths reported, 71 (71%) cases had one or more documented comorbidities at the time of diagnosis. Most frequently reported co-morbidities were; hypertension (67 %), followed by Diabetes Mellitus 945%) and Ischemic Heart Diseases (27%). First death was reported on 18 March 2020 and the most frequent presenting symptoms were shortness of breath (87%) and fever (79%). Median duration of illness was eight days (IQR: 4-11 days), the median delay reaching hospital to seek health care was three days (IQR: 0-6 days) while median duration of hospital stay was also three days (IQR: 1-7 days). Among all reported deaths, 62% were attributed to local transmission as these cases had no history of international travel. The most affected age group was 60-69 years while no death reported in age group below 20 years. Conclusion: High CFR among old age group and its association with co-morbidities (chronic disease) suggests targeted interventions such as social distancing and strict quarantine measure for elderly and morbid people. Comparative studies among deaths and recovered patients are recommended to explore further disease dynamics.

In this study, we aimed to reveal the relationship between the volume of thymus gland, which provides T lymphocyte maturation in children, with the severity of lung involvement and blood laboratory values in pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection. Methods Thymus density and thymus and cardiac volumes were measured in pediatric COVID-19 patients and a control group that underwent thoracic tomography for reasons other than infection. Thymus/heart ratios were calculated to index the thymus volumes of the patients to their body dimensions. The severity of pneumonia was demonstrated by proportioning the involved lung parenchymal volume to the total lung volume in patients with typical involvement in thoracic tomography. The relationship between volumetric and blood laboratory values was statistically evaluated. Results Thymus density (p = 0.015) and thymus/heart ratio (p = 0.04) significantly differed between patients with COVID-19 infection and the control group. A correlation was observed between the pneumonia involvement rate and C-reactive protein (CRP) (k : 0.451, p = 0.08) and white blood cell (WBC;k : 0.419, p = 0.015) values in the thoracic tomography of the COVID-19 group.

Severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), mainly caused by influenza, are a leading cause of hospitalisation and mortality. Increasing evidence indicates that non-influenza respiratory viruses (NIRVs) also contribute to the burden of SARI. In Belgium, SARI surveillance by a network of sentinel hospitals is ongoing since 2011. AIM: Here, we report the results of using in-house multiplex PCRs for the detection of a flexible panel of viruses in respiratory ILI and SARI samples and the estimated incidence rates of SARI associated to each virus. METHODS: ILI was defined as an infection with onset of fever and cough or dyspnoea. SARI was defined as an infection requiring hospitalization with onset of fever and cough or dyspnoea within the previous 10 days. Samples were collected during four winter seasons and tested by multiplex RT-qPCRs for influenza virus and NIRVs. Using catchment population estimates, incidence rates of SARI associated to each virus were calculated. RESULTS: One third of the SARI cases were positive for NIRVs, reaching 49.4% among children under fifteen. In children under five, incidence rates of NIRV-associated SARI were double that of influenza (103.4 versus 57.6 per 100000 person-months), with NIRV co-infections, respiratory syncytial viruses, human metapneumoviruses and picornaviruses contributing the most (33.1, 13.6, 15.8 and 18.2 per 100000 person-months, respectively). CONCLUSION: Early testing for NIRVs could be beneficial to clinical management of SARI patients, especially in children under five, for whom the burden of NIRV-associated disease exceeds that of influenza.","output":"Extending influenza surveillance to detect non-influenza respiratory viruses of public health relevance: analysis of surveillance data, 2015-2019, Belgium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Animal models of human diseases play a critical role in medical research.

Effective CPT is likely to require high titres of neutralising antibody (nAb) in convalescent donations. Understanding the relationship between functional neutralising antibodies and antibody levels to specific SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 proteins in scalable assays will be crucial for the success of a large\\\\scale collection. We assessed whether neutralising antibody titres correlated with reactivity in a range of enzyme\\\\linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) targeting the spike (S) protein, the main target for human immune response. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 52 individuals with a previous laboratory\\\\confirmed SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection. These were assayed for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 nAbs by microneutralisation and pseudo\\\\type assays and for antibodies by four different ELISAs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to further identify sensitivity and specificity of selected assays to identify samples containing high nAb levels. RESULTS: All samples contained SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 antibodies, whereas neutralising antibody titres of greater than 1:20 were detected in 43 samples (83% of those tested) and >1:100 in 22 samples (42%). The best correlations were observed with EUROimmun immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactivity (Spearman Rho correlation coefficient 0.88; p < 0.001). Based on ROC analysis, EUROimmun would detect 60% of samples with titres of >1:100 with 100% specificity using a reactivity index of 9.1 (13/22).

SETTING: The study was conducted from March to June 2020 within the context of an ethical committee (EC) in Northern Italy. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven EC members and five additional external healthcare and bioethical professionals, forming a multidisciplinary panel, took part in the study. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The compilation of a list of ethical principles (maximum of 10 items) and their priority ranking and application within an emergency pandemic context was established as the expected outcome of this work. RESULTS: A consensus on 10 guiding ethical principles was reached by the multidisciplinary panel. Transparency ranked first on the priority list as the most frequently voted principle, followed by the number of lives saved, life-years saved, respect for individuals' autonomy and equity. Other principles including life cycle, 'sickest first', reciprocity, instrumental value and lottery were also considered appropriate as potential tiebreakers. These principles were discussed and made consistent with the current Italian pandemic context by producing an explanatory document.

However, a major drawback of naked DNA-based vaccines is their low immunogenicity and the amount of plasmid DNA necessary to elicit a response. Nano-sized liposomes can overcome this limitation, enhancing both nucleic acid stability and targeting to cells after administration. We tested two different DNA vaccines in cationic liposomes to improve the immunogenic properties. For this, we cloned the coding sequences of the Plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte binding protein homologue 5 (PfRH5) either alone or fused with small the small hepatitis virus (HBV) envelope antigen (HBsAg) encoding sequences, potentially resulting in HBsAg particles displaying PfRH5 on their outside. Instead of invasive intraperitoneal or intramuscular immunization, we employed intradermal immunization by tattooing nano-encapsulated DNA. Mice were immunized with 10 g encapsulated DNA encoding PfRH5 alone or in fusion with HBsAg and this elicited antibodies against schizont extracts (titer of 10(4)). Importantly, only IgG from animals immunized with PfRH5-HBs demonstrated sustained IgG-mediated inhibition in in vitro growth assays showing 58% and 39% blocking activity after 24 and 48 h, respectively. Intradermal tattoo-vaccination of encapsulated PfRH5-HBsAg coding plasmid DNA is effective and superior compared with an unfused PfRH5-DNA vaccine, suggesting that the HBsAg fusion may be advantageous with other vaccine antigens.","output":"A DNA Vaccine Encoding Plasmodium falciparum PfRH5 in Cationic Liposomes for Dermal Tattooing Immunization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DISCLAIMER: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

PURPOSE: Adherence to self-administered biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) is necessary for therapeutic benefit. Health-system specialty pharmacies (HSSPs) have reported high adherence rates across several disease states; however, adherence outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) populations have not yet been established. METHODS: We performed a multisite retrospective cohort study including patients with RA and 3 or more documented dispenses of bDMARDs from January through December 2018. Pharmacy claims were used to calculate proportion of days covered (PDC). Electronic health records of patients with a PDC of <0.8 were reviewed to identify reasons for gaps in pharmacy claims (true nonadherence or appropriate treatment holds). Outcomes included median PDC across sites, reasons for treatment gaps in patients with a PDC of <0.8, and the impact of adjusting PDC when accounting for appropriate therapy gaps. RESULTS: There were 29,994 prescriptions for 3,530 patients across 20 sites. The patient cohort was mostly female (75%), with a median age of 55 years (interquartile range [IQR], 42-63 years). The original(ie, prereview) median PDC was 0.94 (IQR, 0.83-0.99). Upon review, 327 patients had no appropriate treatment gaps identified, 6 patients were excluded due to multiple unquantifiable appropriate gaps, and 420 patients had an adjustment in the PDC denominator due to appropriate treatment gaps (43 instances of days supply adjusted based on discordant days supply information between prescriptions and physician administration instructions, 11 instances of missing fills added, and 421 instances of clinically appropriate treatment gaps). The final median PDC after accounting for appropriate gaps in therapy was 0.95 (IQR, 0.87-0.99).

Thus, it is hypothesized that TNF- blockers can prevent either COVID-19 incidence or its serious symptoms. TNF- blockers are prescribed to treat various autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and seronegative spondyloarthropathies (SpA). Therefore, the objective of this work was to examine this hypothesis that TNF- blockers can prevent COVID-19 incidence in patients with RA or SpA. METHODS: A caseCcontrol study was conducted through interviews based on a structured questionnaire to investigate the frequency of COVID-19 incidence in 254 eligible patients with RA or SpA about whom 45% were under treatment with one type of TNF- blockers including infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept at least for 3 months during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interviews were carried out twice, at the beginning and the end of the study (JuneCDecember 2020). Patients with COVID-19 during the study or before that were considered as cases. The control group was patients without COVID-19 experience. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and logistic regression was used to determine the relationships between COVID-19 incidence and independent variables. RESULTS: A small percentage of patients treated with TNF- blockers (5.22%, 6/115) experienced COVID-19, while a large percentage of patients with COVID-19 did not receive TNF- blockers (27.34%, 38/139). According to odds ratio, adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept decreased significantly the risk of developing COVID-19 up to 96.8, 95, and 80.3% (p < 0.05), respectively. Therefore, TNF- blockers could probably decrease the chances of the COVID-19 incidence in patients with RA or SpA.

We aimed to evaluate the patterns and effects of on-admission hyperglycemia and inflammatory response in a level 1 trauma center. We hypothesized that higher initial readings of blood glucose and cytokines are associated with severe injuries and worse in-hospital outcomes in trauma patients. METHODS: A prospective, observational study was conducted for adult trauma patients who were admitted and tested for on-admission blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18 and hs-CRP. Patients were categorized into four groups [non-diabetic normoglycemic, diabetic normoglycemic, diabetic hyperglycemic (DH) and stress-induced hyperglycemic (SIH)]. The inflammatory markers were measured on three time points (admission, 24 h and 48 h). Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to account for the correlation for the inflammatory markers. Pearson's correlation test and logistic regression analysis were also performed. RESULTS: During the study period, 250 adult trauma patients were enrolled. Almost 13% of patients presented with hyperglycemia (50% had SIH and 50% had DH). Patients with SIH were younger, had significantly higher Injury Severity Score (ISS), higher IL-6 readings, prolonged hospital length of stay and higher mortality. The SIH group had lower Revised Trauma Score (p = 0.005), lower Trauma Injury Severity Score (p = 0.01) and lower GCS (p = 0.001). Patients with hyperglycemia had higher in-hospital mortality than the normoglycemia group (12.5% vs 3.7%; p = 0.02). A significant correlation was identified between the initial blood glucose level and serum lactate, IL-6, ISS and hospital length of stay. Overall rate of change in slope 88.54 (95% CI:-143.39-33.68) points was found more in hyperglycemia than normoglycemia group (p = 0.002) for IL-6 values, whereas there was no statistical significant change in slopes of age, gender and their interaction. The initial IL-6 levels correlated with ISS (r = 0.40, p = 0.001). On-admission hyperglycemia had an adjusted odds ratio 2.42 (95% CI: 1.076-5.447, p = 0.03) for severe injury (ISS > 12) after adjusting for age, shock index and blood transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: In trauma patients, on-admission hyperglycemia correlates well with the initial serum IL-6 level and is associated with more severe injuries. Therefore, it could be a simple marker of injury severity and useful tool for patient triage and risk assessment.

Previous studies have shown that indica and japonica varieties varied in machine transplanting efficiency and optimal seeding density. In this study, a RIL population derived from '9311' and 'Nipponbare' were performed to explore the seedling traits variations and the genetic mechanism under three seeding densities. RESULTS: The parents and RIL population exhibited similar trends as the seeding density increased, including seedling height and first leaf sheath length increases, shoot dry weight and root dry weight decreases. Among the 37 QTLs for six traits detected under the three seeding densities, 12 QTLs were detected in both three seeding densities. Five QTL hotspots identified clustered within genomic regions on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 6 and 11. Specific QTLs such as qRDW1.1 and qFLSL5.1 were detected under low and high seeding densities, respectively. Detailed analysis the QTL regions identified under specific seeding densities revealed several candidate genes involved in phytohormones signals and abiotic stress responses. Whole-genome additive effects showed that '9311' contributed more loci enhancing trait performances than 'Nipponbare', indicating '9311' was more sensitive to the seeding density than 'Nipponbare'. The prevalence of negative epistasis effects indicated that the complementary two-locus homozygotes may not have marginal advantages over the means of the two parental genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed the differences between indica rice and japonica rice seedling traits in response to seeding density.

Genome-wide additive and two-locus epistasis suggested a dynamic of the genetic control underlying different seeding densities. It was concluded that novel QTLs, additive and epistasis effects under specific seeding density would provide adequate information for rice seedling improvement during machine transplanting.","output":"Genetic analysis of rice seedling traits related to machine transplanting under different seeding densities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused respiratory failure in many patients. With no effective treatment or vaccine, prolonged mechanical ventilation is common in survivors. Timing and performance of tracheostomy, for both patient and surgical team safety, remains a question. Here within, we report our experience with percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy with modification to minimize aerosolization. METHODS: A modified percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy technique is described. The technique was performed on 10 patients in the surgical intensive care unit. RESULTS: Ten patients underwent percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. There were 7 males, and the average age for the group was 60.8 years. The average number of ventilator days before the operation was 26.3. All procedures were successful, and no patient had any procedure-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: The procedure described was successful in our patient population. We believe that this approach is safe for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and limits aerosolization during the operation.

This paper finds an analogy between a polymerization reaction and COVID-19 transmission dynamics, which will provide a novel perspective to optimal control measures. Susceptible individuals, exposed people, infected cases, recovered population, and the dead can be assumed to be specific molecules in the polymerization system. In this paper, a hypothetical polymerization reactor is constructed to describe the transmission of an epidemic, and its kinetic parameters are regressed by the least-squares method. The intensity of social distancing u is considered to the mixing degree of the reaction system, and contact tracing and isolation  can be regarded as an external circulation in the main reactor to reduce the concentration of active species. Through these analogies, this model can predict the peak infection, deaths, and end time of the epidemic under different control measures to support the decision-making process. Without any measures (u = 1.0 and  = 0), more than 90% of the population would be infected. It takes several years to complete herd immunity by nonpharmacological intervention when the proportion of deaths is limited to less than 5%. However, vaccination can reduce the time to tens to hundreds of days, which is related to the maximum number of vaccines per day.","output":"Modeling and Control of COVID-19 Transmission from a Perspective of Polymerization Reaction Dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital contact tracing of an infected person, testing the possible infection for the contacted persons, and isolation play a crucial role in alleviating the outbreak. Here, we design a dynamic graph streaming algorithm that can trace the contacts under the control of the Public Health Authorities (PHA). Our algorithm receives proximity data from the mobile devices as contact data streams and uses a sliding window model to construct a dynamic contact graph sketch. Prominently, we introduce the edge label of the contact graph as a binary contact vector, which acts like a sliding window and holds the latest D days (incubation period) of temporal social interactions. Notably, the algorithm prepares the direct and indirect (multilevel) contact list from the contact graph sketch for a given set of infected persons. Finally, the algorithm also uses a disjoint set data structure to construct the infection pathways for the trace list. The present study offers the design of algorithms with underlying data structures for digital contact trace relevant to the proximity data produced by Bluetooth enabled mobile devices. Our analysis reveals that for COVID-19 close contact parameters, the storage space requires maintaining the contact graph of ten million users;having 14 days of close contact data in the PHA server takes 55 Gigabytes of memory and preparation of the contact list for a given set of the infected person depends on the size of the infected list.

They are metastable and poised for structural changes. These features allow viruses to communicate with host cells during entry, and to release the viral genome, a process known as uncoating. Studies have shown that hundreds of host factors directly or indirectly support this process. The cell provides molecules that promote stepwise virus uncoating, and direct the virus to the site of replication. It acts akin to a snooker player who delivers accurate and timely shots (cues) to the ball (virus) to score. The viruses, on the other hand, trick (snooker) the host, hijack its homeostasis systems, and dampen innate immune responses directed against danger signals. In this review, we discuss how cellular cues, facilitators, and built\\\\in viral mechanisms promote uncoating. Cues come from receptors, enzymes and chemicals that act directly on the virus particle to alter its structure, trafficking and infectivity. Facilitators are defined as host factors that are involved in processes which indirectly enhance entry or uncoating. Unraveling the mechanisms of virus uncoating will continue to enhance understanding of cell functions, and help counteracting infections with chemicals and vaccines.

Objectives: This study aimed to examine the incidence, nature, and seriousness of medication errors (MEs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective study of MEs and ADRs reported at the King Saud Medical City (KSMC) between April 2020 and September 2020. Results: A total of 343 MEs and 416 ADRs were reported during the study period. The incidence of MEs was 19% (19/100). Seventy-five MEs (21.5%) reached the patient but did not cause any harm. Wrong dose (n=101, 29.4%) was the most common type of MEs. Physicians were the most common source of MEs (87.5%). Antibiotics (32%) and antineoplastics (25%) were the most common drug categories involved in MEs and ADRs, respectively. Thirty-nine percent (n=163) of the ADRs were of serious nature. 24% (n=100) required hospitalization, 5% (n=21) were life-threatening, 16 (3.8%) required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage, and 6.2% (n=26) resulted in the discontinuation of treatment. Conclusion: The reporting of MEs appears to be high among COVID-19 patients in a large tertiary care setting in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The majority of MEs were caused by dosing errors and errors in drug frequency, mostly ascribed to physicians, which may be indicative of burnout or stress among them.

METHODS: We analyzed the data of 1675 patients aged under 65 years who were admitted to hospitals with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. For validation, 324 similar patients were enrolled. Disease progression was defined as administration of medication, oxygen inhalation and mechanical ventilator starting one day or longer after admission. RESULTS: The patients who exacerbated tended to be older, male, had histories of smoking, and had high body temperatures, lower oxygen saturation, and comorbidities such as diabetes/obesity and hypertension. Stepwise logistic regression analyses revealed that comorbidities of diabetes/obesity, age [] 40 years, body temperature [] 38 degree, and oxygen saturation < 96% (DOATS) were independent risk factors of worsening COVID-19.

We conducted a scoping review of global health inequalities in NAFLD distribution and outcomes according to gender/sex, ethnicity/race, and socioeconomic position from PubMeds inception to May 2021. Ultimately, 20 articles were included in the review, most (75%) of them carried out in the United States.

In the US, the Hispanic population had the highest NAFLD prevalence and poorer outcomes (seven articles), whereas Whites had fewer complications than other ethnicities (two articles). Patients with low socioeconomic status had higher NAFLD prevalence (four articles) and a higher likelihood of progression and complications (five articles). In conclusion, globally there is a lack of studies analyzing NAFLD prevalence and outcomes according to various axes of inequality through joint intersectional appraisals, and most studies included in our review were based on the US population.

Lao PDR has among the highest rates of malnutrition in Southeast Asia. We assessed the relative difficulty in meeting food needs during the COVID-19 pandemic in rural districts of Luang Prabang Province, Lao PDR compared to before; determined associations between pandemic-associated difficulties in food access and household, maternal and child food security; and identified resiliency-promoting strategies. MethodsIn November 2020, households (N = 1,122) with children under five years were interviewed. Respondents reported the relative ease of access of food and health care as well as changes in income and expenditures compared to before March 2020. We used generalized linear models with cluster robust standard errors to assess univariate and multivariate associations. ResultsNearly four-fifths (78.5%) found it harder to meet household food needs during the pandemic. The most common reasons were increased food prices (51.2%), loss of income (45.3%), and decreased food availability (36.6%). Adjusting for demographics, households with increased difficulty meeting food needs had lower food consumption scores and child dietary diversity. Over 85% of households lost income during the pandemic. Decreased expenditures was associated with reliance on more extreme coping strategies to meet food needs. The households who experienced no change in meeting food needs produced a greater percentage of their food from homegrown methods (4.22% more, 95% CI: 1.28, 7.15), than households who found it more difficult. We estimated that decreases in child bodyweight by 0.5 - 1% would increase wasting in this population by 1.7 - 2.1 percentage points. ConclusionsPandemic-associated shocks may have large effects on malnutrition prevalence. Action is needed to mitigate consequences of the pandemic on nutrition. Local food production and safety net programs that offset income losses may help. Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABSThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted food supply chains and livelihoods, causing concerns that a global nutrition crisis is imminent and prompting leaders from United Nations agencies to issue an immediate call to action to direct funds towards prevention of child malnutrition. While documented COVID-19 transmission in Lao PDR was lower than that of surrounding counties, malnutrition rates are high, particularly in the northern province of Luang Prabang, which is heavily reliant on tourism for livelihoods. What are the new findings?Nearly four-fifths of those interviewed in Luang Prabang Province, Lao PDR reported that it was harder to meet their households food needs, compared to before the pandemic, with 51% attributing the reason to increased food prices. Over 85% of households reported losing income. Lower expenditures and increased difficulty obtaining food were both associated with lower household food consumption scores and higher household coping strategies, in adjusted analyses. Households who obtained a greater proportion of their foods through home production appeared more resilient than households who obtained a greater proportion of their foods through purchasing. What do the new findings imply?The pandemic may deeply exacerbate food insecurity in Lao PDR, potentially leading to increases in child wasting. Increased local food production and establishment of safety net programs that offset income losses may be two strategies that address this problem among this population.","output":"Changes in household food security, access to health services, and income in northern Lao PDR during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Descriptions of passenger lymphocyte syndrome (PLS), immune cytopenias and transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) after intestine-containing transplants remain scarce.

Compared to the Wuhan reference strain, a total of 1034 unique nucleotide mutations were identified in the mutant strains (49.15%, n = 30,221) globally. Of these mutations, 367 occupy primer binding sites including the 3'-end mismatch to the primer-pair of 11 well-characterized primer sets.

The N protein of SARS-CoV-2 comprises an average of 1.2 mutations per strain compared to 4.4 and 0.4 in Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and SARS-CoV, respectively. Despite being proposed as the alternative target to spike protein for vaccine and therapeutics, the ongoing evolution of the N protein may challenge these endeavors, thus needing further immunoinformatics analyses. Therefore, continuous monitoring is required for tracing the ongoing evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in prophylactic and diagnostic interventions.","output":"Evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and its consequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Some controversy exists regarding the safety of intra-articular hyaluronic acid (IAHA) in the management of osteoarthritis (OA). OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to re-assess the safety profile of IAHA in patients with OA, through a comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials. METHODS A comprehensive literature search was undertaken in the databases MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Scopus. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials that assessed adverse events (AEs) with IAHA in patients with OA were eligible for inclusion. Authors and/or study sponsors were contacted to obtain the full report of AEs. The primary outcomes were overall severe and serious AEs, as well as the following MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC)-related AEs: gastrointestinal, cardiac, vascular, respiratory, nervous system, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, musculoskeletal, renal and urinary disorders, infections and infestations, and hypersensitivity reaction. RESULTS Database searches initially identified 1481 records. After exclusions according to the selection criteria, 22 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, and nine studies having adequate data were ultimately included in the meta-analysis. From the studies excluded according to the pre-specified selection criteria, 21 with other pharmacological OA treatments permitted during the trials were a posteriori included in a parallel qualitative synthesis, from which eight studies with adequate data were finally included in a parallel meta-analysis. Since this meta-analysis was designed to assess safety, the exclusion criterion on concomitant anti-OA medication was crucial. However, due to the high number of studies that allowed mainly concomitant oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), we decided to include them in a post hoc parallel analysis in order to compare the results from the two analyses. No statistically significant difference in odds was found between IAHA and placebo for all types of SOC-related disorders, except for infections and infestations, for which significantly lower odds were found with IAHA compared with placebo, both overall (odds ratio [OR] = 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40-0.93; I2 = 0%) and in studies without concomitant anti-OA medication (OR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.27-0.89). There were significant increased odds of reporting serious AEs with IAHA compared with placebo, both overall (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.21-2.63; I2 = 0%) and in studies with concomitant anti-OA medication (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.10-2.89), but not in studies without concomitant anti-OA medication (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 0.92-3.47). CONCLUSIONS Using the available data on studies without any concomitant anti-OA medication permitted during clinical trials, IAHA seems not to be associated with any safety issue in the management of OA. However, this evidence was associated with only a \\"low\\" to \\"moderate\\" certainty. A possible association with increased risk of serious AEs, particularly when used with concomitant OA medications, requires further investigation.","output":"Safety of Intra-articular Hyaluronic Acid Injections in Osteoarthritis: Outcomes of a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The existence of overlapping genes (OLGs) with significant coding overlaps revolutionises our understanding of genomic complexity.

The study included 22 million patients with RT-PCR qualitative test results for SARS-CoV-2, of which 3.9 million had more than one test at Labcorp. We observed a minuscule <0.1% basal positive rate for follow up tests >115 days, which could account for false positives, long-haulers, and/or reinfection but is indistinguishable in the data. In observing repeat-testing, for patients who have a second test after a first RT-PCR, 30% across the cohort tested negative on the second test. For patients who test positive first and subsequently negative within 96 h (40% of positive test results), 18% of tests will subsequently test positive within another 96-h span. For those who first test negative and then positive within 96 h (2.3% of negative tests), 56% will test negative after a third and subsequent 96-h period. The sudden changes in RT-PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2 from this large cohort study suggest that negative test results during active infection or exposure can change rapidly within just days or hours. We also demonstrate that there does not appear to be a basal false positive rate among patients who test positive >115 days after their first RT-PCR positive test while failing to observe any evidence of widespread reinfection.","output":"Follow-Up SARS-CoV-2 PCR Testing Outcomes From a Large Reference Lab in the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, the BSHS hosted two major online events, the first of their kind in our collective experience.

ABSTRACT: Cancer is a complex disease with apoptosis evasion as one of its hallmarks; therefore, apoptosis induction in transformed cells seems a promising approach as a cancer treatment. TNF apoptosis-inducing ligands, which are naturally present in the body and possess tumoricidal activity, are attractive candidates. The most studied proteins are TNF-, FasL, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Over the years, different recombinant TNF family-derived apoptosis-inducing ligands and agonists have been designed. Their stability, specificity, and half-life have been improved because most of the TNF ligands have the disadvantages of having a short half-life and affinity to more than one receptor. Here, we review the outlook on apoptosis-inducing ligands as cancer treatments in diverse preclinical and clinical stages and summarize strategies of overcoming their natural limitations to improve their effectiveness.","output":"Apoptosis-Inducing TNF Superfamily Ligands for Cancer Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, RNA viral infections caused by respiratory viruses, such as influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Zika virus, are a major public health threats in the world. Although myriads of diagnostic methods based on RNA amplification have been developed in the last decades, they continue to lack speed, sensitivity, and specificity for clinical use. A rapid and accurate diagnostic method is needed for appropriate control, including isolation and treatment of the patients. Here, we report an isothermal, label-free, one-step RNA amplification and detection system, termed as iROAD, for the diagnosis of respiratory diseases. It couples a one-step isothermal RNA amplification method and a bio-optical sensor for simultaneous viral RNA amplification/detection in a label-free and real-time manner. The iROAD assay offers a one-step viral RNA amplification/detection example to rapid analysis (<20 min). The detection limit of iROAD assay was found to be 10-times more sensitive than that of real-time reverse transcription-PCR method. We confirmed the clinical utility of the iROAD assay by detecting viral RNAs obtained from 63 human respiratory samples. We envision that the iROAD assay will be useful and potentially adaptable for better diagnosis of emerging infectious diseases including respiratory diseases.","output":"An isothermal, label-free, and rapid one-step RNA amplification/detection assay for diagnosis of respiratory viral infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose This article aims to examine the COVID-19 pandemic management system in Bangladesh and the role played by various bureaucratic leaders both at national and local levels Particularly, attention is paid to the interface between the health sector and administrative leaders The role played by front-line public servants and their superiors are also examined Also, an attempt is made to encapsulate lessons learned from the crisis and the ways to prepare for the next one Design/methodology/approach This study is based on secondary data and observation by the author as well as insights from the author's 36 years of experience in the Bangladesh bureaucracy Administrative leadership is conceptualized as bureaucrats appointed to administrative positions and discharging administrative duties both at the national and local levels Findings A disfunctionality in the COVID-19 management system is observed, which is a direct consequence of the administrative leaders' preference for leading from behind Some structural constraints in the system are also uncovered Originality/value It draws on observations, experiences and insights from the author's long association with the Bangladesh administrative system Its intended users are researchers and practitioners of public leadership","output":"Leading in the shadows: understanding administrative leadership in the context of COVID-19 pandemic management in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19- related patient care and research have focused on short-term outcomes, particularly among those with underlying or preexisting medical conditions.

It is estimated that 25% of adult population have mental health condition and 68% of them suffer from comorbid medical condition. Readmission rates in psychiatric patients are high and we still lack understanding potential predictors of recidivism. Physical comorbidity could be one of important risk factors for psychiatric readmission. The aim of the present study was to review the impact of physical comorbidity variables on readmission after discharge from psychiatric or general inpatient care among patients with co-occurring psychiatric and medical conditions. METHODS A comprehensive database search from January 1990 to June 2014 was performed in the following bibliographic databases: Ovid Medline, PsycINFO, ProQuest Health Management, OpenGrey and Google Scholar. An integrative research review was conducted on 23 observational studies. RESULTS Six studies documented physical comorbidity variables only at admission/discharge and 17 also at readmission. The main body of studies supported the hypothesis that patients with mental disorders are at increased risk of readmission if they had co-occurring medical condition. The impact of physical comorbidity variables on psychiatric readmission was most frequently studied in in patients with affective and substance use disorders (SUD). Most common physical comorbidity variables with higher probability for psychiatric readmission were associated with certain category of psychiatric diagnoses. Chronic lung conditions, hepatitis C virus infection, hypertension and number of medical diagnoses were associated with increased risk of readmission in SUD; Charlson Comorbidity Index, somatic complaints, physical health problems with serious mental illnesses (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, personality disorders); not specified medical illness, somatic complaints, number of medical diagnoses, hyperthyroidism with affective disorders (depression, bipolar disorder). Co-occurring physical and mental disorders can worsen patient's course of illness leading to hospital readmission also due to non-psychiatric reasons. CONCLUSIONS The association between physical comorbidity and psychiatric readmission is still poorly understood phenomenon. Nevertheless, that physical comorbid conditions are more common among readmitted patients than single admission patients, their association with readmission can vary according to the nature of mental disorders, characteristics of study population, applied concept of comorbidity, and study protocol.","output":"Psychiatric readmissions and their association with physical comorbidity: a systematic literature review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Early identification of patients who are at high risk of poor clinical outcomes is of great importance in saving the lives of patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the context of limited medical resources. Objective: To evaluate the value of the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), calculated at hospital admission and in isolation, for the prediction of the subsequent presence of disease progression and serious clinical outcomes (e.g., shock, death). Methods: : We designed a prospective cohort study of 352 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 between January 9 and February 26, 2020, in Yichang City, Hubei Province. Patients with an NLR equal to or higher than the cutoff value derived from the receiver operating characteristic curve method were classified as the exposed group. The primary outcome was disease deterioration, defined as an increase of the clinical disease severity classification during hospitalization (e.g., moderate to severe/critical;severe to critical). The secondary outcomes were shock and death during the treatment. Results: : During the follow-up period, 51 (14.5%) patients conditions deteriorated, 15 patients (4.3%) had complicated septic shock, and 15 patients (4.3%) died. The NLR was higher in patients with deterioration than in those without deterioration (median: 5.33 vs. 2.14, P <0.001), and higher in patients with serious clinical outcomes than in those without serious clinical outcomes (shock vs. no shock: 6.19 vs. 2.25, P <0.001;death vs. survival: 7.19 vs. 2.25, P <0.001). The NLR measured at hospital admission had high value in predicting subsequent disease deterioration, shock and death (all the areas under the curve > 0.80). The sensitivity of an NLR  2.6937 for predicting subsequent disease deterioration, shock and death was 82.0% (95% confidence interval, 69.0 to 91.0), 93.3% (68.0 to 100), and 92.9% (66.0 to 100), and the corresponding negative predictive values were 95.7% (93.0 to 99.2), 99.5% (98.6 to 100) and 99.5% (98.6 to 100), respectively.

The negative health outcomes for the COVID-19 infection have been most severe in the frail elderly dwelling in Canadian long-term care (LTC) homes. Methods: : An online cross-sectional survey of Ontario LTC Clinicians working in LTC homes in Ontario Canada was conducted to provide the LTC clinician perspective on the preparedness and engagement of the LTC sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey questionnaire was developed in collaboration with the Ontario Long-Term Care Clinicians organization (OLTCC) and was distributed between March 30, 2020 to May 25, 2020. All registered members of the OLTCC and Nurse-led LTC Outreach Teams were invited to participate. The primary outcomes were: 1) the descriptive report of the screening measures implemented, communication and information received, and the preparation of the respondents LTC home to a potential COVID-19 outbreak;and 2) the level of agreement, as reported using a five-point Likert scale), to COVID-19 preparedness statements for the respondents LTC home was also assessed. Results: : The overall response rate was 54% (160/294). LTC homes implemented a wide range of important interventions (e.g. instituting established respiratory isolation protocols, active screening of new LTC admissions, increasing education on infection control processes, encouraging sick staff to take time off, etc). Ample communications pertinent to the pandemic were received from provincial LTC organizations, the government and public health officials. However, the feasibility of implementing public health recommendations, as well as the engagement of the LTC sector in pandemic planning were identified as areas of concern. Medical director status was associated with an increased knowledge of local implementation of interventions to mitigate COVID-19, as well as endorsing increased access to reliable COVID-19 information and resources to manage a potential COVID-19 outbreak in their LTC home. Conclusions: : This study highlights the communication to and implementation of recommendations in the Ontario LTC sector, despite some concerns regarding feasibility. Importantly, LTC clinician respondents clearly indicated that better engagement with LTC leaders is needed to plan a coordinated pandemic response.","output":"A cross-sectional survey assessing the preparedness of the long-term care sector to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A distance between two languages is a useful tool to measure the language similarity, and is closely related to the intersection problem as well as the shortest string problem.

One is the r-shortest string problem that decides whether or not a given PEL contains a string of length shorter than r. The other problem is the edit-distance problem of PELs with respect to other language families such as finite languages or regular languages. We show that the r-shortest string problem and the edit-distance problem with respect to finite languages are NEXPTIME-complete, and the edit-distance problem with respect to regular languages is undecidable.

METHODS: This study utilised data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). The sample consisted of 2877 adolescents. Exposure measures were area-level social disadvantage (Socioeconomic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA)), and parent-reported household income from Wave 5. Outcomes, measured in Wave 6, wereadolescent-reported oral health behaviours: frequency of brushing, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) and dental visits. Associations between quintiles of each exposure and each oral health behaviour were tested by fitting multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Household income and area-level disadvantage were associated with dental visits and brushing frequency. Associations between social disadvantage and consumption of SSBs was less apparent, with only the leastdisadvantaged adolescentshaving lower odds of consumption of SSBs compared to the mostdisadvantaged group. CONCLUSION: Broad population-based strategies must be adopted to reduce intake of SSBs, however targeted strategies are needed among more disadvantaged populations to address infrequent tooth brushing and irregular dental visits among adolescents.","output":"Associations between Individual-level and Area-level social disadvantage and oral health behaviours in Australian adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is commonly used for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Aspirin use is associated with better outcomes among COVID-19 positive patients. We hypothesized that the aspirin use for primary cardiovascular disease prevention might have a protective effect on COVID-19 susceptibility and disease duration. We conducted a retrospective population-based cross-sectional study, utilizing data from the Leumit Health Services database. The proportion of patients treated with aspirin was significantly lower among the COVID-19-positive group, as compared to the COVID-19-negative group [73 (11.03%) vs. 1548 (15.77%); P = 0.001]. Aspirin use was associated with lower likelihood of COVID-19 infection, as compared to nonusers (adjusted OR 0.71 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.99; P = 0.041). Aspirin users were older (68.06  12.79 vs. 56.63  12.28 years of age; P < 0.001), presented a lower BMI (28.77  5.4 vs. 30.37  4.55; P < 0.0189), and showed higher prevalence of hypertension (56, 76.71%), diabetes (47, 64.38%), and COPD (11, 15.07%) than the aspirin nonusers (151, 25.64%, P < 0.001; 130, 22.07%, P < 0.001; and 43, 7.3%, P = 0.023, respectively). Moreover, COVID-19 disease duration (considered as the time between the first positive and second negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test results) among aspirin users was significantly shorter, as compared to aspirin nonusers (19.8  7.8 vs. 21.9  7.9 P = 0.045). Among hospitalized COVID-positive patients, a higher proportion of surviving subjects were treated with aspirin (20, 19.05%), as opposed to 1 dead subject (14.29%), although this difference was not significant (P = 0.449).

The aim of the current study was to determine the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of a new technique using a pure endoscopic approach and tissue-apposing stent placement for gastrojejunal anastomosis (GJA). MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective, experimental study on six live pigs weighing 20 - 45 kg. Endoscopies were performed using a double-channel gastroscope, and included the creation of a GJA using a tissue-apposing, fully covered, self-expanding metallic stent. Antibiotic therapy was continued for 7 days after the procedure, and food was gradually reintroduced from Day 3. Changes in weight following the procedure were compared with a control group of age-matched animals. Anastomosis functionality was confirmed by endoscopy at 3 weeks (before the animals were euthanized), and during histopathological analysis. The primary outcomes were morbidity and mortality at 3 weeks. Secondary outcomes were technical feasibility, procedure time, and patency of the GJA. RESULTS The procedures were performed successfully in all animals. The mean procedure time was 26  6.7 minutes (range 15 - 32 minutes). One case of stent migration occurred during the procedure; the stent was successfully replaced using the same procedure. All animals were alive after 3 weeks. The mean weight gain during follow-up was 0.85  2.56 kg (range - 2 to + 2 kg) compared with 5.2  1.6 kg (range 3 - 7 kg) in control animals (P = 0.007). At necropsy, the stents were still in place in all animals, without evidence of peritonitis. Histopathology confirmed permeable anastomoses with continuity of the mucosa and mucosa muscle layers. CONCLUSIONS GJA with a tissue-apposing stent is safe, feasible, and reproducible without anastomotic leakage in a porcine model using a pure endoscopic approach and standard endoscopic equipment.","output":"Gastrojejunal anastomosis using a tissue-apposing stent: a safety and feasibility study in live pigs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction.

METHODS: We isolated monoclonal antibodies from CR-T3-SEQ13 vaccinated cynomolgus monkeys, compared their therapeutic effects with E6F6, identified their epitopes on HBsAg, determined the pharmacokinetics and studied their physical property. RESULTS: A panel of anti-HBsAg mAbs was generated through memory B cell stimulatory culture. Two lead monkey-human chimeric antibodies, C1-23 and C3-23, effectively suppressed HBsAg and HBV DNA in HBV-Tg mice. The humanized antibodies and humanized-mouse reverse chimeric antibodies of two antibodies exhibited comparable HBsAg clearance and viral suppression efficacy as those versions of E6F6 in HBV-Tg mice. Humanized antibody hu1-23 exhibited more efficacy HBsAg-suppressing effects than huE6F6-1 and hu3-23 in HBV-Tg mice at dose levels of 10 and 20 mg/kg. Evaluation of the binding sites indicates that the epitope recognized by hu1-23 is located in HBsAg aa 118-125 and 121-125 for hu3-23. Physical property study revealed that hu1-23 and hu3-23 are stable enough for further development as a drug candidate.

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of hospitalized adults and adolescents with influenza-related pneumonia (Flu-p) from type A and type B strains in China. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from Flu-p patients in five hospitals in China from January 2013 to May 2019. Multivariate logistic and Cox regression models were used to assess the effects of influenza virus subtypes on clinical outcomes, and to explore the risk factors of 30-day mortality for Flu-p patients. RESULTS: In total, 963 laboratory-confirmed influenza A-related pneumonia (FluA-p) and 386 influenza B-related pneumonia (FluB-p) patients were included. Upon adjustment for confounders, multivariate logistic regression models showed that FluA-p was associated with an increased risk of invasive ventilation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.824, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.279C6.414; P < 0.001), admittance to intensive care unit (aOR: 1.630, 95% CI: 1.074C2.473, P = 0.022) and 30-day mortality (aOR: 2.427, 95% CI: 1.568C3.756, P < 0.001) compared to FluB-p. Multivariate Cox regression models confirmed that influenza A virus infection (hazard ratio: 2.637, 95% CI: 1.134C6.131, P = 0.024) was an independent predictor for 30-day mortality in Flu-p patients.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Danish nationwide registries, we identified patients with a first-time acute cardiovascular admission in two periods: 1) January 2-October 16, 2019 and 2) January 2-October 15, 2020. Weekly incidence rates of a first-time cardiovascular admission, overall and according to subtypes, in the two periods were calculated. The incidence rate of first-time cardiovascular admissions overall was significantly lower during the first weeks of lockdown in 2020 compared with a similar period in 2019 but increased after the gradual reopening of the Danish society. A similar trend was observed for all subgroups of cardiovascular diseases. The mortality rate among patients admitted after March 12 was not significantly different in 2020 compared with 2019 (mortality rate ratio 0.98 [95% CI, 0.91-1.06]). CONCLUSIONS: In Denmark, we observed a substantial decrease in the rate of acute cardiovascular admissions, overall and according to subtypes, during the first weeks of lockdown. However, after the gradual reopening of the Danish society, the admission rates for acute cardiovascular diseases increased and returned to rates similar to those observed in 2019.

We describe 44 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients (cycle threshold value <30) admitted to the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Hanoi between March 6 and April 15 2020. Whole SARS-CoV-2 genomes from these patients were sequenced using Illumina Miseq and analysed for common genetic variants and relationships to local and globally circulating strains. Results showed that 32 cases were Vietnamese with a median age of 37 years (range 15-74 years), and 23 were male. Most cases were acquired outside Vietnam, mainly from the UK (n = 15), other European countries (n = 14), Russia (n = 6) and countries in Asia (n = 3). No cases had travelled from China. Forty-one cases had symptoms at admission, typically dry cough (n = 36), fever (n = 20), sore throat (n = 14) and diarrhoea (n = 12). Hospitalisation was long with a median of 25 days, most commonly from 20-29 days. All SARS-CoV-2 genomes were similar (92-100% sequence homology) to the reference sequence Wuhan_1 (NC_045512), and 32 strains belonged to the B.1.1 lineage.

RESULTS: More than half of the 29 included patients showed (neuro)psychiatric problems at both follow-up moments. Two weeks after discharge, we mainly saw symptoms related to anxiety and depression. Except for complaints related to the traumatic experience of the COVID-19, these seemed to have a favorable natural course. A negative time effect was seen for complaints consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder. Two months after discharge limitations in cognition and overall functioning appeared to be the main complaints after COVID-19. CONCLUSION: (Neuro)psychiatric symptoms after a COVID-19 are common.

Initially, these were characterized by a shortage of vaccine supply, and specific risk groups were prioritized. Once supply was guaranteed and vaccination coverage saturated, the focus shifted from risk groups to anti-vaxxers, the underaged population, and regions of low coverage. At the same time, hopes to reach herd immunity by vaccination campaigns were put into perspective by the emergence and spread of more contagious and aggressive viral variants. Particularly, concerns were raised that not all vaccines protect against the new-emerging variants. Methods and findings: A model designed to predict the effect of vaccination campaigns on the spread of viral variants is introduced. The model is a comprehensive extension of the model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 2.0 (http://covidsim.eu/). The model is age and spatially stratified, incorporates a finite (but arbitrary) number of different viral variants, and incorporates different vaccine products. The vaccines are allowed to differ in their vaccination schedule, vaccination rates, the onset of vaccination campaigns, and their effectiveness. These factors are also age and/or location dependent. Moreover, the effectiveness and the immunizing effect of vaccines are assumed to depend on the interaction of a given vaccine and viral variant. Importantly, vaccines are not assumed to immunize perfectly. Individuals can be immunized completely, only partially, or fail to be immunized against one or many viral variants. Not all individuals in the population are vaccinable. The model is formulated as a high-dimensional system of differential equations, which is implemented efficiently in the programming language Julia. As an example, the model was parameterized to reflect the epidemic situation in Germany until November 2021 and predicted the future dynamics of the epidemic under different interventions. In particular, without tightening contact reductions, a strong epidemic wave is predicted. At the current state, mandatory vaccination would be too late to have a strong effect on reducing the number of infections. However, it would reduce mortality. An emergency brake, i.e., an incidence-based stepwise lockdown would be efficient to reduce the number of infections and mortality. Furthermore, to specifically account for mobility between regions, the model was applied to two German provinces of particular interest: Saxony, which currently has the lowest vaccine rollout in Germany and high incidence, and Schleswig-Holstein, which has high vaccine rollout and low incidence. Conclusions: A highly sophisticated and flexible but easy-to-parameterize model for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is introduced. The model is capable of providing useful predictions for the COVID-19 pandemic, and hence provides a relevant tool for epidemic decision-making. The model can be adjusted to any country, to derive the demand for hospital and ICU capacities as well as economic collateral damages.","output":"Predicting the impact of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns - a flexible age-dependent, spatially-stratified predictive model, accounting for multiple viral variants and vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 epidemic has been a significant healthcare challenge in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), COVID-19 infection is transmitted predominately by respiratory droplets generated when people breathe, talk, cough, or sneeze. Wearing a mask is the primary, effective, and convenient method of blocking 80% of all respiratory infections. Therefore, many face mask detection and monitoring systems have been developed to provide effective supervision for hospitals, airports, publication transportation, sports venues, and retail locations. However, the current commercial face mask detection systems are typically bundled with specific software or hardware, impeding public accessibility. In this paper, we propose an in-browser serverless edge-computing based face mask detection solution, called Web-based efficient AI recognition of masks (WearMask), which can be deployed on any common devices (e.g., cell phones, tablets, computers) that have internet connections using web browsers, without installing any software. The serverless edge-computing design minimizes the extra hardware costs (e.g., specific devices or cloud computing servers). The contribution of the proposed method is to provide a holistic edge-computing framework of integrating (1) deep learning models (YOLO), (2) high-performance neural network inference computing framework (NCNN), and (3) a stack-based virtual machine (WebAssembly). For end-users, our web-based solution has advantages of (1) serverless edge-computing design with minimal device limitation and privacy risk, (2) installation free deployment, (3) low computing requirements, and (4) high detection speed.

In this context, intercultural dialogues are of utmost importance. Indeed, different models of traditional ethics might be of assistance in constructing a new, global ethics that could help us confront the present predicament and prepare for other possible global crises that might await us in the future. The explosive, pandemic spread of COVID-19 in 2020 clearly demonstrated that in general, one of the most effective tools for containment of the epidemics is precisely human and interpersonal solidarity, which must also be accompanied by a certain degree of autonomous self-discipline. The present paper follows the presumption that these types of personal and interpersonal attitudes are-inter alia-culturally conditioned and hence influenced by different traditional models of social ethics. In light of the fact that East-Asian or Sinic societies were more successful and effective in the process of containing and eliminating the virus compared to the strategies of the Euro-American regions, I will first question the widespread assumption that this effectiveness is linked to the authoritarian political traditions of the Sinic East and Southeast Asian areas.

It restricts cellular gene expression through a combination of inhibiting translation by blocking the mRNA entry channel of the 40S ribosomal subunit and by promoting mRNA degradation. We performed a detailed structure-guided mutational analysis of CoV-2 nsp1 coupled with in vitro and cell-based functional assays, revealing insight into how it coordinates these activities against host but not viral mRNA. We found that residues in the N-terminal and central regions of nsp1 not involved in docking into the 40S mRNA entry channel nonetheless stabilize its association with the ribosome and mRNA, thereby enhancing its restriction of host gene expression. These residues are also critical for the ability of mRNA containing the CoV-2 leader sequence to escape translational repression. Notably, we identify CoV-2 nsp1 mutants that gain the ability to repress translation of viral leader-containing transcripts. These data support a model in which viral mRNA binding functionally alters the association of nsp1 with the ribosome, which has implications for drug targeting and understanding how engineered or emerging mutations in CoV-2 nsp1 could attenuate the virus.","output":"The N-terminal and central domains of CoV-2 nsp1 play key functional roles in suppression of cellular gene expression and preservation of viral gene expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital twin technology consists of creating virtual replicas of objects or processes that simulate the behavior of their real counterparts.

Previous studies have suggested a role for endothelial cell injury in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. To determine whether endotheliopathy is involved in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy pathogenesis, we assessed markers of endothelial cell and platelet activation in critically and non-critically ill patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: In this single-centre cross-sectional study, hospitalised adult (&#8805;18 years) patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were identified in the medical intensive care unit (ICU) or a specialised non-ICU COVID-19 floor in our hospital. Asymptomatic, non-hospitalised controls were recruited as a comparator group for biomarkers that did not have a reference range. We assessed markers of endothelial cell and platelet activation, including von Willebrand Factor (VWF) antigen, soluble thrombomodulin, soluble P-selectin, and soluble CD40 ligand, as well as coagulation factors, endogenous anticoagulants, and fibrinolytic enzymes. We compared the level of each marker in ICU patients, non-ICU patients, and controls, where applicable. We assessed correlations between these laboratory results with clinical outcomes, including hospital discharge and mortality. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to further explore the association between biochemical markers and survival. FINDINGS: 68 patients with COVID-19 were included in the study from April 13 to April 24, 2020, including 48 ICU and 20 non-ICU patients, as well as 13 non-hospitalised, asymptomatic controls. Markers of endothelial cell and platelet activation were significantly elevated in ICU patients compared with non-ICU patients, including VWF antigen (mean 565% [SD 199] in ICU patients vs 278% [133] in non-ICU patients; p<00001) and soluble P-selectin (159 ng/mL [48] vs 112 ng/mL [31]; p=00014). VWF antigen concentrations were also elevated above the normal range in 16 (80%) of 20 non-ICU patients. We found mortality to be significantly correlated with VWF antigen (ra??=a??038; p=00022) and soluble thrombomodulin (ra??=a??038; p=00078) among all patients. In all patients, soluble thrombomodulin concentrations greater than 326 ng/mL were associated with lower rates of hospital discharge (22 [88%] of 25 patients with low concentrations vs 13 [52%] of 25 patients with high concentrations; p=00050) and lower likelihood of survival on Kaplan-Meier analysis (hazard ratio 59, 95% CI 19-184; p=00087).

When Air Force (AF) Reservists arrived in NYC, 64th Air Expeditionary Group leaders worked with FEMA, Task Force New York/New Jersey, and NYC chains of command to send Airmen to NYC hospitals, including Lincoln Medical Center (LMC). Within 72 hours of arrival, 60 AF Reservists, including 30 registered nurses and 3 medical technicians, integrated into LMC to provide support during April and May 2020. This assistance began during the peak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Air Force nurses provided over 6,000 hours of care to over 800 patients in the emergency department and ad hoc intensive care and medical-surgical units. As infections declined, AF nurses shifted to providing care in established units. In these units, AF nurses provided patient care and worked directly with LMC nurses to provide directed teaching experiences to improve their comfort and competency with caring for acutely ill COVID-19 patients. The deployment of AF Reservists into civilian facilities was a success and bolstered the capability of three facilities struggling to care for SARS-CoV-2 patients.

METHODS Plasma samples were collected from older adults (75-98 years) before and after three doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination, and from younger adults (18-74 years) post-dose two, for comparison. Antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2 antigens (spike protein [S], S-receptor binding domain [S-RBD], and nucleocapsid [N]), functional activity against S, and live-virus neutralization were measured against the vaccine virus and the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants of concern (VOC). RESULTS Vaccination induced greater antibody titers in older females than males, with both age and frailty associated with reduced antibody responses in males, but not females. Responses declined significantly in the six months following the second dose. The third dose restored functional antibody responses and eliminated disparities caused by sex, age, and frailty in older adults. Responses to the VOCs, particularly the Omicron variant, were significantly reduced relative to the vaccine virus, with older males having lower titers to the VOCs than females. Older adults had lower responses to the vaccine and VOC viruses than younger adults, with disparities being greater in males than females. CONCLUSION Older and frail males may be more vulnerable to breakthrough infections due to low antibody responses before receipt of a third vaccine dose. Promoting third dose coverage in older adults, especially males, is crucial to protecting this vulnerable population.","output":"Association of frailty, age, and biological sex with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine-induced immunity in older adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) has been recognized as an invariant internal control for various gene expression studies due to its classical housekeeping role in the glycolytic metabolism. However recently, this enzyme has been proven to be a multifunctional protein involved in diverse non-glycolytic activities. In the present study, two paralogue isoforms of GAPDH mRNAs were characterized from a marine teleost species, rockbream (Oplegnathus fasciatus; Perciformes) and their transcriptional responses to bacterial and viral infections were examined. Rockbream GAPDH1 and GAPDH2 cDNAs encoded 333 and 335 amino acids, respectively, and the amino acid sequence identity between those two isoforms was 74%. Two isoform GAPDH mRNAs were detected ubiquitously in all of tissues examined, but their expression levels were quite variable among tissues. Based on the real-time RT-PCR analysis, the transcription of rbGAPDH1 was affected by neither bacterial (Escherichia coli, Edwardsiella tarda, Vibrio anguillarum or Streptococcus iniae) nor viral (rockbream iridovirus; RBIV) challenges. However on the contrary, the mRNA expression of rbGAPDH2 was significantly up-regulated in liver resulting from the bacterial infections (up to 25-fold), and in both liver (more than sixfold) and kidney (up to fivefold) from the viral infection. Results in the present study suggest that teleost GAPDH isoforms may also be potentially involved in immune modulations especially with respect to inflammatory responses, which is distinct from its classical glycolytic function.","output":"Differential modulations of two glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNAs in response to bacterial and viral challenges in a marine teleost Oplegnathus fasciatus (Perciformes)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new virus isolated from the lungs of rats is prevalent in colony reared and wild rats and induces a fatal pneumonitis in newborn rats.

Mobility plays a central role in this dilemma because the movement of people enables both economic activity and virus spread. We use mobility data in the form of counts of travelers between regions, to extend the often-used SEIR models to include mobility between regions. We quantify the trade-off between mobility and infection spread in terms of a single parameter, to be chosen by policy makers, and propose strategies for restricting mobility so that the restrictions are minimal while the infection spread is effectively limited. We consider restrictions where the country is divided into regions, and study scenarios where mobility is allowed within these regions, and disallowed between them. We propose heuristic methods to approximate optimal choices for these regions. We evaluate the obtained restrictions based on our trade-off. The results show that our methods are especially effective when the infections are highly concentrated, e.g., around a few municipalities, as resulting from superspreading events that play an important role in the spread of COVID-19.

Using a national surveillance system, we describe the epidemiology of IC adults hospitalized with influenza. METHODS: We analyzed data on adults (aged 18 years) hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza during the 2011C2012 through 2014C2015 seasons and reported to CDCs Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET). We defined IC patients as having 1 of the following: HIV, AIDS, cancer, stem cell or organ transplantation, non-steroid immunosuppressive therapy, immunoglobulin deficiency, asplenia, and other rare conditions. We compared IC and non-IC patients using (2) or Fishers exact tests and t-tests or MannCWhitney U tests. RESULTS: Among 35,348 adults hospitalized over four seasons, 3,633 (10%) were IC. The most common IC conditions were cancer (44%), non-steroid immunosuppressive therapy (44%), and HIV (17%). IC patients were younger than non-IC patients (mean 61  17 vs. 67  20 years; P < 0.01). IC patients were more likely to have underlying renal disease (27% vs. 18%) and liver disease (7% vs. 3%) and less likely to have most other chronic underlying conditions including obesity (18% vs. 23%), cardiovascular disease (40% vs. 47%), and chronic lung disease (35% vs. 41%; P < 0.01 for all). IC patients were more likely to have received influenza vaccination (53% vs. 46%; P < 0.01). Among cases with symptom data (2014C2015), IC patients were more likely to present with fever (68% vs. 61%; P < 0.01) but respiratory distress was similar (53% vs. 54%; P = 0.3). Overall, the majority of IC and non-IC patients received antivirals (87% vs. 85%; P < 0.01). IC patients had a longer duration of hospitalization (median (IQR) 4 (2C6) vs. 3 (2C6) days; P < 0.01) and were more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia (34 vs. 31%; P < 0.01) and to require intensive care (18% vs. 16%; P = 0.01). Death during hospitalization occurred in 135 (3.7%) IC and 945 (3.0%) non-IC patients (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Among adults hospitalized with influenza, IC patients had worse outcomes including a longer duration of hospitalization and higher probability of pneumonia and intensive care unit admission, and increased all-cause mortality, although these results are not adjusted for potential confounders.

METHODS: Using data for households with Black and white respondents in pooled Canadian Community Health Survey cycles from 2005 to 2014, the 18-question Household Food Security Survey Module was analyzed (N = 491,400). Bivariate and multivariate logistic and multinomial regression models were run using respondents race, immigration status, and six well-established predictors of household food insecurity in the general population. Additional multivariable logistic regression models were run, with race interacted with each predictor individually to yield predicted probabilities. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of household food insecurity was 10.0% for white respondents and 28.4% for Black respondents. The odds of Black households being food-insecure as compared with white households fell from 3.56 (95% CI: 3.30C3.85) to 1.88 (95% CI: 1.70C2.08) with adjustment for household socio-demographic characteristics. In contrast with white households, there was relative homogeneity of risk of food insecurity among Black subgroups defined by immigration status, household composition, education, and province of residence. Homeownership was associated with lower probabilities of food insecurity for Black and white households, but the probability among Black owners was similar to that for white renters (14.7% vs. 14.3%). Black households had significantly higher predicted probabilities of food insecurity than their white counterparts across all main sources of household income except child benefits and social assistance.

The disease was declared by WHO in March 2020 as a pandemic and is still affecting countries around the world. Although considered a human disease, it is thought to have its origins in bats, and transmitted to humans potentially through an intermediate animal. What is not fully understood is the likelihood of the virus transmitting back to animal populations, either to companion or wild animals. For the virus to enter host cells, it needs to interact with particular proteins on the cell surface. Here we review the susceptibility of animals to the SARS-CoV-2 virus through the comparison of proteins between animals and humans. The most studied is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2), which has been used to rank the viral susceptibility of a range of vertebrates. Here, we also assess three other proteins. Of these, TMPRSS2 may be helpful in determining susceptibility, whereas the other two would appear to be of limited use. We propose that future work should examine changes seen in these proteins which alter the ease by which the virus can enter cells. This type of analysis may contribute limited evidence in predicting if animals are safe from such viruses and may help to guide future welfare concerns. ABSTRACT: COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a world-wide problem for the human population. It is known that some animal species, such as mink, can become infected and transmit the virus. However, the susceptibility of most animals is not known. Here, we review the use of sequence analysis of the proteins which are known to interact with SARS-CoV-2 as a way to estimate an animals susceptibility. Although most such work concentrates on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2), here TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane Serine Protease 2), neuropilin-1 and furin are also considered. Polymorphisms, especially ones which are known to alter viral/host interactions are also discussed. Analysis of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein sequences across species suggests this approach may be of some utility in predicting susceptibility; however, this analysis fails to highlight some susceptible animals such as mink. However, combined with observational data which emerges over time about which animals actually become infected, this may, in the future, be a useful tool to assist the management of risks associated with human/animal contact and support conservation and animal welfare measures.","output":"Interacting Proteins, Polymorphisms and the Susceptibility of Animals to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Healthcare professional (HCP) burnout transcends clinician job title and role, thus creating a need for interprofessional strategies to address burnout. The organizational framework of offering employer-sponsored mindfulness programming to HCPs sets the stage for an orchestrated, mindful response to COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This single arm pre-post interventional research tested changes in measures of burnout, resilience, perceived stress and work engagement for interprofessional HCP faculty and students participating in Mindfulness in Motion (MIM), a novel eight-week multimodal evidencedCbased onsite intervention. METHODS: A Graduate Medical Education (GME) pilot of MIM was expanded to target inter-professional resiliency within an academic health center. MIM is the core offering of the Gabbe Health and Wellness program for students, staff, faculty, and residents and is embedded across the entire medical center. RESULTS: The faculty/student role demographic categories (n = 267) included resident physicians, resident chaplains, attending physicians, medical center faculty, and hospital administrative/managerial clinical staff. These cohorts demonstrated significant 27% reduction in participants meeting burnout criteria. Total burnout was determined by scores on subscales of emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and personal accomplishment (PA) of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). There was a highly significant pre/post decrease in the in the emotional exhaustion (p < 0.00001) and depersonalization scores (p < 0.001), with highly significant increase in the personal accomplishment (p < 0.00001) scores.

As one of the earliest medical teams to enter the pandemic area, researchers have been exploring effective infection control measures that are currently in practice. Through observation and research, it has been noticed that layers of protective equipment have a hidden danger of infection while protecting the safety of the personnel. The members of each medical team have typically focused on the standard use of personal protective equipment (PPE). However, after a long period of intensive diagnosis and treatment in clinics and due to physical exertion and tiredness, problems such as improper operation are prone to occur during the tedious PPE doffing, thereby producing a relatively high risk of infection. This study primarily analyzes PPE doffing procedures, existing problems, and measures for improvement to explore methods to improve PPE donning and doffing and reduce the risk of infection.","output":"Problems and solutions of personal protective equipment doffing in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many studies have investigated the impact of gender on mental health, but only a few have addressed gender differences in mental health risk and prevention. We conducted a narrative review to assess the current state of knowledge on gender-specific mental health preventive interventions, along with an analysis of gender-based risk factors and available screening strategies. Out of 1598 articles screened using a comprehensive electronic search of the PubMed, Web-of-Science, Scopus, and Cochrane databases, 53 were included for review. Among risk factors for mental health problems, there are individual, familiar, social, and healthcare factors. Individual factors include childhood adversities, which show gender differences in distribution rates. However, current childhood abuse prevention programs are not gender-specific. Familiar factors for mental health problems include maternity issues and intimate partner violence, and for both, some gender-specific preventive interventions are available. Social risk factors for mental health problems are related to education, employment, discrimination, and relationships. They all display gender differences, but these differences are rarely taken into account in mental health prevention programs.

This is a single-center retrospective analysis proposing methods for evaluation of vitals and antimicrobial therapy in intensive care patients. For each patient included in the present study, duration of antibiotic therapy, consecutive days of treatment and type and combination of antimicrobial agents have been assessed and considered as single unique daily record for analysis. Each parameter, composing a record was normalized using a fuzzy logic approach and assigned to five descriptive categories (fuzzy domain sub-sets ranging from very low to very high). Clustering of these normalized therapy records was performed, and each patient/day was considered to be a pertaining cluster. The same methodology was used for hourly bed-side monitoring. Changes in patient conditions (monitoring) can lead to a shift of clusters. This can provide an additional tool for assessing progress of complex patients.

The deep learning-based approaches have attracted attention because they can predict DPIs without human trial and error. However, because data labeling requires significant resources, the available protein data size is relatively small, which consequently decreases model performance. Here, we propose two methods to construct a deep learning framework that exhibits superior performance with a small labeled dataset. RESULTS: At first, we use transfer learning in encoding protein sequences with a pretrained model, which trains general sequence representations in an unsupervised manner. Second, we use a Bayesian neural network to make a robust model by estimating the data uncertainty. Our resulting model performs better than the previous baselines at predicting interactions between molecules and proteins. We also show that the quantified uncertainty from the Bayesian inference is related to confidence and can be used for screening DPI data points.

We quantified the haematological response following treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria to identify the factors associated with malarial anaemia. METHODS Individual patient data from eligible antimalarial efficacy studies of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, available through the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network data repository prior to August 2015, were pooled using standardised methodology. The haematological response over time was quantified using a multivariable linear mixed effects model with nonlinear terms for time, and the model was then used to estimate the mean haemoglobin at day of nadir and day 7. Multivariable logistic regression quantified risk factors for moderately severe anaemia (haemoglobin < 7 g/dL) at day 0, day 3 and day 7 as well as a fractional fall  25% at day 3 and day 7. RESULTS A total of 70,226 patients, recruited into 200 studies between 1991 and 2013, were included in the analysis: 50,859 (72.4%) enrolled in Africa, 18,451 (26.3%) in Asia and 916 (1.3%) in South America. The median haemoglobin concentration at presentation was 9.9 g/dL (range 5.0-19.7 g/dL) in Africa, 11.6 g/dL (range 5.0-20.0 g/dL) in Asia and 12.3 g/dL (range 6.9-17.9 g/dL) in South America. Moderately severe anaemia (Hb < 7g/dl) was present in 8.4% (4284/50,859) of patients from Africa, 3.3% (606/18,451) from Asia and 0.1% (1/916) from South America. The nadir haemoglobin occurred on day 2 post treatment with a mean fall from baseline of 0.57 g/dL in Africa and 1.13 g/dL in Asia. Independent risk factors for moderately severe anaemia on day 7, in both Africa and Asia, included moderately severe anaemia at baseline (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 16.10 and AOR = 23.00, respectively), young age (age < 1 compared to  12 years AOR = 12.81 and AOR = 6.79, respectively), high parasitaemia (AOR = 1.78 and AOR = 1.58, respectively) and delayed parasite clearance (AOR = 2.44 and AOR = 2.59, respectively). In Asia, patients treated with an artemisinin-based regimen were at significantly greater risk of moderately severe anaemia on day 7 compared to those treated with a non-artemisinin-based regimen (AOR = 2.06 [95%CI 1.39-3.05], p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, the nadir haemoglobin occurs 2 days after starting treatment.

This study aimed to estimate the monthly incidence of MERS-CoV cases and to investigate their correlation to climate factors. METHODS: The study used aggregated monthly MERS-CoV cases that reported to the Saudi Center for Disease Prevention and Control from the Riyadh Region between November 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018. Data on the meteorological situation throughout the study period was calculated based on Google reports on the Riyadh Region (24.7136 N, 46.6753 E). The Poisson regression was used to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each climate factor. RESULTS: A total of 712 MERS-CoV cases were included in the analysis (mean age 54.2  9.9 years), and more than half (404) (56.1%) MERS-CoV cases were diagnosed during a five-month period from April to August. The highest peak timing positioned in August 2015, followed by April 2014, June 2017, March 2015, and June 2016. High temperatures (IRR = 1.054, 95% CI: 1.043C1.065) and a high ultraviolet index (IRR = 1.401, 95% CI: 1.331C1.475) were correlated with a higher incidence of MERS-CoV cases. However, low relative humidity (IRR = 0.956, 95% CI: 0.948C0.964) and low wind speed (IRR = 0.945, 95% CI: 0.912C0.979) were correlated with a lower incidence of MERS-CoV cases. CONCLUSION: The novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV, is influenced by climate conditions with increasing incidence between April and August. High temperature, high ultraviolet index, low wind speed, and low relative humidity are contributors to increased MERS-CoV cases.

Morbid obesity entails increased risk for thromboembolic events. There is no clear protocol for thromboembolic prophylaxis, regarding timing and length of treatment, in bariatric surgery. Thromboelastography provides data on a coagulation process from creation of the clot until the fibrinolysis. METHODS Ninety-three morbidly obese patients were prospectively recruited within a 2-year period. Coagulation profile was measured by thromboelastography before surgery, in the immediate postoperative period, within 3 h from surgery, and in the late postoperative period, within 10-14 days after surgery. Venous thromboembolic prophylaxis was achieved by giving low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), once a day. RESULTS Of the eligible patients, 67 underwent sleeve gastrectomy while 23 underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Normal values of coagulation factor function, clotting time, and fibrin function, as measured by R, K, and  (angle), were demonstrated in addition to higher maximal amplitude (MA) values, reflecting increased function of platelets. The average MA value before the surgery was above normal and continued rising consistently in the immediate postoperative as well as in the early postoperative period. CONCLUSIONS Morbidly obese patients have a strong tendency toward thrombosis, as demonstrated by pathologically elevated MA values. Altered coagulation profiles were demonstrated 2 weeks postoperatively; thus, prophylaxis that continued at least for 2 weeks after bariatric surgery should be considered. Since LMW heparin is not sufficient alone as thromboembolic prophylaxis, we recommend adding antiplatelet therapy.

We wished to test the feasibility of an optimised exercise intervention for mild or pre-frailty in a primary-care setting and inform the design of a definitive randomised control trial. METHODS: The intervention was co-designed with eighteen older adults in two group workshops, informed by systematic review and meta-analysis. Eligible patients aged 65+, mildly frail or less, presenting to an Irish primary-care centre over 6 months from January 2020 were invited to participate. They were offered an exercise guide and educational discussion. Demographics, health indicators and frailty scores were recorded. Feasibility was assessed using the Bowen model for acceptability; participation; demand; implementation; practicality; adaptation; integration; expansion; and limited-efficacy. Half of the randomly selected participants were telephoned after one month, and all the participants were called after two to measure effects on adherence. FINDINGS: 94 of 107 eligible people (88%) participated (average age 77, 59 women (63%)). Only 15% had previously considered resistance exercises. The intervention satisfied all Bowen feasibility criteria. At one month, 65% of participants were exercising. At two months, adherence amongst those previously called was higher: 78%. 87% described exercises as very easy or somewhat easy. 66% felt much better or slightly better. INTERPRETATION: Frailty intervention uptake and adherence were high. A single telephone call appeared to help increase adherence. Participants reported meaningful physical and mental health benefits.

This article reports findings from an Australia-wide survey that invited responses from those who changed their cycling behaviour during the pandemic lockdowns. The survey premise was that the pandemic lockdowns in each state presented the conditions of a natural experiment to test whether the reduction in automobile traffic affected how cyclists reported experiencing the cycling environment. The survey was in the field from 3 August to 16 September 2020 with purposive sampling. A total of 699 respondents participated, with 444 complete surveys. Key questions we seek to address include: Did cycling activity increase during the pandemic shutdowns? How did cyclists from under-represented groups experience the pandemic lockdowns? The findings are twofold. First, cycling activity increased among most respondents during pandemic lockdowns for exercise and wellbeing, but not for transport. Our survey reports that for respondents the pandemic lockdowns did not result in an uptake of active transport, despite the appearance of pop-up cycle lanes. Second, the reduced traffic of the pandemic shutdown period created a particular opportunity for women to ride bikes. The key policy implication is that cities in Australia should be designed for more relaxed modalities of mobility if the goal is to increase rates of active travel and cycling activity.","output":"The reactivated bike: Self-reported cycling activity during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by Coronavirus.

Chronic alcohol abuse has been proposed as a predisposing factor despite lack of supporting evidence. Because alcohol and propofol have a common site of action, we postulated that paradoxical excitement responses during propofol-induced sedation occur more frequently in hazardous and harmful alcohol drinkers than in social or non-drinkers. METHODS One hundred and ninety patients undergoing orthopaedic knee joint surgery were enrolled in this prospective and observational study. Subjects were divided into Group HD (hazardous and harmful drinkers) or Group NHD (no hazardous drinkers) according to the alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT). In study 1, propofol infusion was adjusted to achieve the bispectral index at 70-80 using target-controlled infusion. In study 2, the target concentration of propofol was fixed at 0.8 (study 2/Low) or 1.4 g ml(-1) (study 2/High). Paradoxical excitement responses were categorized by intensity into mild, moderate, or severe. RESULTS The overall incidence of paradoxical excitement response was higher in Group HD than in Group NHD in study 1 (71.4% vs 43.8%; P=0.022) and study 2/High (70.0% vs 34.5%; P=0.006) but not in study 2/Low. The incidence of moderate-to-severe response was significantly higher in Group HD of study 1 (28.6% vs 3.1%; P=0.0005) and study 2/High (23.3% vs 3.4%; P=0.029) with no difference in study 2/Low. Severe excitement response occurred only in Group HD of study 1 and study 2/High.

METHODS: From February 2020 to March 2021, patients from surgical and medical ICUs at the University Hospital Dresden were screened for sepsis. Patient characteristics and outcomes were assessed descriptively. Patient survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Associations between in-hospital mortality and risk factors were modeled using robust Poisson regression, which facilitates derivation of adjusted relative risks. RESULTS: In 177 ICU patients treated for sepsis, COVID-19 was diagnosed and compared to 191 septic ICU patients without COVID-19. Age and sex did not differ significantly between sepsis patients with and without COVID-19, but SOFA score at ICU admission was significantly higher in septic COVID-19 patients. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with 59% compared to 29% in Non-COVID patients. Statistical analysis resulted in an adjusted relative risk for in-hospital mortality of 1.74 (95%-CI=1.35C2C24) in the presence of COVID-19 compared to other septic patients. Age, procalcitonin maximum value over 2 ng/ml, need for renal replacement therapy, need for invasive ventilation and septic shock were identified as additional risk factors for in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 was identified as independent risk factor for higher in-hospital mortality in sepsis patients.

It has created a perplexing situation about what actions one should and should not take. Mathematical modeling of biological systems is challenging and gives a different perspective, especially in decision making under multiple complex scenarios. Public health officials grapple with multiple issues such as recommending a lockdown, contact tracing, promoting the mask usage, social distancing, and frequent handwashing, as well as keeping the families of patients in isolation for the incubation period. It is even more challenging to find the optimal combination of all of the above without the use of a suitable mathematical model. There are many different approaches to modeling the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Some models are easy to use, while others need extensive use of high-end computers. However, models to assist public health official's decision making are hard to find. In this paper, we discuss a novel systems approach to building a model for simulating the spread of COVID-19. The model, MIMANSA, divides an individual's in-person social interactions into three areas, namely home, workplace, and public places. While tracking the in-person interactions, the model follows the virus spread. Internally, the model labels healthy people who turn into silent carriers, virus-infected patients, or healthy carriers. It tracks down to the smallest level of a single day interaction. As and when a new silent carrier is created, the model automatically expands and builds a network of virus spread. All single-day blocks are integrated to get the final result. MIMANSA is novel due to its ability to build a virus spread network as a multilevel, integrated model, and in the end, enable one to make complex decisions with ease. MIMANSA is trained and validated using the data from the www.COVID-19India.org website. It does not use any arbitrary constants. All its parameters have a physical significance and are measurable. Once trained, the parameter estimation is complete, and the model is ready to run multiple scenarios. MIMANSA has four control mechanisms that a user can use. It helps one simulate the what-if scenarios. The first one is to control the exposure level to the virus depending on the number of hours spent with a silent carrier. The second provides control over the infection rate or the probability of a healthy person getting infected in the presence of a silent carrier. The third one allows the user to control lockdown effectiveness percentage, and the fourth one gives control over quarantine percentage. Inside the model, MIMANSA differentiates between virus-infected patients, silent carriers, and healthy carriers. MIMANSA has the capability to consider variations in virus activity levels of every asymptomatic patient, varying the exposure to the virus, and varying the infection rate depending on the person's immunity. MIMANSA can simulate scenarios to study the impact of many different conditions simultaneously. MIMANSA assists public health officials in complex decision making, enables scientists in projecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread, and aids hospital administrators in management. MIMANSA will play a significant role in finding the balance between the effect of strict lockdown on the economy vs. the marginally high number of COVID-19 patients with a bit relaxed lockdown.","output":"Multilevel Integrated Model with a Novel Systems Approach (MIMANSA) for Simulating the Spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Structure prediction for proteins lacking homologous templates in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) remains a significant unsolved problem.

Large-scale benchmark tests showed that C-I-TASSER can fold more than twice the number of non-homologous proteins than the I-TASSER, which does not use contacts. When applied to a folding experiment on 8,266 unsolved Pfam families, C-I-TASSER successfully folded 4,162 domain families, including 504 folds that are not found in the PDB. Furthermore, it created correct folds for 85% of proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, despite the quick mutation rate of the virus and sparse sequence profiles. The results demonstrated the critical importance of coupling whole-genome and metagenome-based evolutionary information with optimal structure assembly simulations for solving the problem of non-homologous protein structure prediction.","output":"Folding non-homologous proteins by coupling deep-learning contact maps with I-TASSER assembly simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, several mental health care providers were obliged to shut down outpatient services, including group therapy and psychoeducational sessions. The lockdown in many countries is a serious threat to peoples mental well-being, especially for individuals with severe mental illnesses. Discontinued outpatient treatments and disruption of daily routines are considered to be risk factors for destabilization of patients with mental illness. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptability, usability, and feasibility of a group chat program to replace cancelled face-to-face group sessions in an outpatient psychiatric department. METHODS: Participants (N=33) were recruited in the outpatient department of a large university medical center in Leipzig, Germany. Former face-to-face group participants were invited to take part in a therapist-guided group-chat for 4 weeks (8 sessions) and were asked to evaluate the program via self-administered standardized questionnaires at baseline (T0, preintervention), after every chat session (T1), and posttreatment (T2, after 4-6 weeks). The chat groups were specific to the following mental disorder diagnoses and based on the same therapeutic principles and techniques as the former face-to-face groups: anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Sociodemographic measures, attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic, depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), quality of life (abbreviated World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment), treatment credibility/expectancy (Credibility Expectancy Questionnaire), and participants satisfaction (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 [ZUF-8]) were measured. RESULTS: Participants joined an average of 5 out of 8 offered chat sessions. Participation rates in the respective groups were highest in the ADHD group (8.6/11, 78%) and lowest in the anxiety group (3.7/9, 41%). The overall preintervention level of depressive symptoms was moderate and showed a slight, nonsignificant improvement at posttreatment (T0: mean 10.7, SD 5.5; T2: mean 10.2, SD 5.5). A similar result was observed regarding quality of life (T0: median 41.7-68.8; T2: median 50-70.3). Treatment credibility and expectancy scores were medium-high (T0: mean(credibility) 18.1, SD 3.8; mean(expectancy) 11.2, SD 5.1; T2: mean(credibility) 17.1, SD 4.8; mean(expectancy) 10.3, SD 5.8). Further, significant correlations were detected between posttreatment expectancy score and posttreatment PHQ-9 score (r=C0.41, P=.02), posttreatment physical quality of life (r=0.54, P=.001), and posttreatment psychological quality of life (r=0.53, P=.002). Overall, participants satisfaction with the program was very high, both after chat sessions and at posttreatment (ZUF-8: mean score 20.6, SD 1.0). Of all participants, a majority (27/31, 87%) rated the program as excellent/good and indicated they would recommend the group chat program to a friend in need of similar help (23/31, 74%). CONCLUSIONS: A therapist-guided group chat program to substitute outpatient group setting treatment during the COVID-19 lockdown was shown to be feasible, usable, and highly acceptable for participants. Web-based programs such as this one provide an easy-to-implement tool to successfully stabilize participants during a difficult time, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the decades ahead, the rise in aging populations will be one of these challenges, and one in which the needs and requirements between demographic cohorts will vary greatly. Although we need to create future smart age-friendly ecosystems to meet these needs, technology still does not feature in the WHO eight domains of an age-friendly city.

However, the association between the degree of OSA and COVID-19 severity is unclear. Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate whether or not parameters to clinically evaluate OSA severity and the type of OSA treatment are associated with COVID-19 severity. Patient data from OSA patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were reviewed from outpatients from the Isala Hospital and patients admitted to the Isala Hospital, starting from March until December 2020. Baseline patient data, sleep study parameters, OSA treatment information and hospital admission data were collected. Apnea hypopnea index (AHI), low oxyhemoglobin desaturation (LSAT), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), respiratory disturbance index (RDI), and the type of OSA treatment were regarded as the independent variables. COVID-19 severityCbased on hospital or intensive care unit (ICU) admission, the number of days of hospitalization, and number of intubation and mechanical ventilation daysCwere regarded as the outcome variables. Multinomial regression analysis, binary logistic regression analysis, and zero-inflated negative binomial regression analysis were used to assess the association between the parameters to clinically evaluate OSA severity and COVID-19 severity. A total of 137 patients were included. Only LSAT was found to be significantly associated with the COVID-19 severity (p<0.05) when COVID-19 severity was dichotomized as non-hospitalized or hospitalized and ICU admission or death. Therefore, our findings showed that LSAT seems to be a significant risk factor for COVID-19 severity. However, the degree of OSACbased on AHI, ODI, and RDICand OSA treatment were not found to be risk factors for COVID-19 severity when looking at hospital or ICU admission, the number of days of hospitalization, and number of intubation and mechanical ventilation days.","output":"Association between the degree of obstructive sleep apnea and the severity of COVID-19: An explorative retrospective cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preliminary evidence indicates that pollution increases the severity and likelihood of COVID-19 infections similar to many other infectious diseases. This paper models the interaction of pollution and disease preventive actions, either pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical interventions, on transmission of infectious diseases in a neoclassical growth framework. There are two externalities C households do not take into account how their actions affect disease transmission, and productive activity results in pollution which increases the likelihood of infections. The disease dynamics are modeled to be of SIS type. We study the difference in health and economic outcomes between the decentralized economy, where households do not internalize externalities, and socially optimal outcomes, and characterize the taxes and subsidies that decentralize the latter. Thus, we examine the question whether there are sufficient incentives to reduce pollution, at both private and public levels, once its effects on disease transmission is considered. In competitive outcomes, pollution increases with increased productivity. The socially efficient outcome has higher pollution than a competitive outcome, despite increase in abatement, as the effect of higher productivity and larger labor supply dominates.

In addition, dialysis for most patients is performed in-center, with therapy offered three times per week for 3.5 hours per session in sites highly exposed to virus contamination. A weak immune system and low cytokine storm explain why COVID-19 may be less severe in dialysis patients as death due to COVID-19 or effects on comorbidities in COVID-19 patients is due to overresponse against the virus by the immune system and cytokine storm. However, during the frequent trips between the dialysis center and home, the risk of coronavirus infection could be high. Moreover, hemodialysis patients constitute a distinct and high-risk group that is often associated with low immunity, decline or loss of the ability to work, substantial economic burden, the inability to fulfill family responsibilities and participate in an active social life, and suffer from various complications such as muscle weakness, pruritus, fatigue, diabetes, hypertension, and restless legs.

Simply stated, telehealth is a tool to provide health care from a distance. Jefferson Health has leveraged its acute care telehealth platform to screen, order testing, and manage patients with COVID-19-related concerns. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the expansion and results of using a telehealth program to increase access to care while minimizing additional potential exposures during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Screening algorithms for patients with SARS-CoV-2-related complaints were created, and 150 new clinicians were trained within 72 hours to address increased patient demand. Simultaneously, Jefferson Health created mobile testing sites throughout eastern Pennsylvania and the southern New Jersey region. Visit volume, the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests ordered, and the number of positive tests were evaluated, and the volume was compared with preceding time periods. RESULTS: From March 8, 2020, to April 11, 2020, 4663 patients were screened using telehealth, representing a surge in visit volume. There were 1521 patients sent to mobile testing sites, and they received a telephone call from a centralized call center for results. Of the patients who were tested, nearly 20% (n=301) had a positive result. CONCLUSIONS: Our model demonstrates how using telehealth for a referral to central testing sites can increase access to community-based care, decrease clinician exposure, and minimize the demand for personal protective equipment.

The objectives of this study were to understand mothers' SARS-CoV-2 vaccine intentions to explore reasons for and against SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. METHODS: Participants from the All Our Families pregnancy longitudinal cohort whose children had reached ages 9-12 years were invited in May-June 2020 to complete a survey on the impact of COVID-19. The survey covered topics about the impact of the pandemic and included 2 specific questions on mothers' intentions to vaccinate their child against SARS-CoV-2. Current responses were linked to previously collected data, including infant vaccine uptake. Multinomial regression models were run to estimate associations between demographic factors, past vaccination status and vaccination intention. Qualitative responses regarding factors affecting decision-making were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: The response rate was 53.8% (1321/2455). A minority of children of participants had partial or no vaccinations at age 2 (n = 200, 15.1%). A total of 60.4% of mothers (n = 798) intended to vaccinate their children with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, 8.6% (n = 113) did not intend to vaccinate and 31.0% (n = 410) were unsure. Lower education, lower income and incomplete vaccination history were inversely associated with intention to vaccinate. Thematic analysis of qualitative responses showed 10 themes, including safety and efficacy, long-term effects and a rushed process.

SEHA Kidney Care (SKC) is the largest provider of dialysis services in the United Arab Emirates providing dialysis services to ~1180 patients, including ~80 patients on peritoneal dialysis. Mortality of COVID-19 among patients with ESKD on dialysis is high and ranges from 14 to 31% in different published series. Not much is known about antibody response to COVID-19 in this group of patients. Patient population demographics in the UAE are dissimilar to many other countries. The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of patients and clinical staff who developed COVID-19 RT-PCR positivity and assess antibody response to COVID-19. Methods: : We conducted a retrospective analysis to characterize features of COVID-19 in our adult dialysis population. In addition, IgG antibody serology was also performed to assess response to COVID-19. Results: : The incidence of COVID-19 infection in our population was 13%. 81% of the patients were males, average age was 53.2  12? years, and 95% were on in-center haemodialysis. The majority of patients (68%) developed mild disease while 13% required critical care. Combinations of drugs including Hydroxychloroquine, Favipiravir, Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Camostat, Tocilizumab and steroids were used based on local guidelines. The median time to viral clearance was 15 days [IQR 6-26]. Overall mortality in our cohort was 9.2%.We performed COVID-19 IgG antibody serology in a subset (n=87) of RT-PCR positive patients. Interestingly, 23 (26%) patients did not develop any antibody response. We successfully implemented a regular screening strategy for patients and staff to identify asymptomatic carriers with an aim to isolate them from the rest of the cohort. Conclusions: : Our study has highlighted an important finding of lack of antibody response in a quarter of patients with ESKD. This may have significant implications for this group of patients while efforts are underway to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19. With regular screening of all dialysis patients and staff, asymptomatic carriers can be identified and prevent spread of COVID-19 within the dialysis units.","output":"Outcomes of patients with End Stage Kidney Disease on dialysis with COVID-19.

Aims and Objectives: COVID-19 diagnosis should serve as an impetus for smokers to discontinue its use. The study was conducted to estimate change in cigarette dependence among newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases. Materials and Methods: Study was conducted between October and December 2020 and newly diagnosed male COVID-19 patients who were current smokers at diagnosis were recruited from two hospitals involved in testing and treatment of COVID-19. Baseline socioclinical information was recorded at diagnosis in addition to the estimation of cigarette dependence using Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and health status using Post-COVID-19 Functional Scale (PCFS). Follow-up was done at 2 weeks after recovery using both FTND and PCFS scales. Wilcoxon signed-rank test, paired t-test, and ANOVA were used for univariate analysis and multivariate regression was done. Results: A total of 171 subjects with mean age of 43.79 years were included in the study. FTND scores decreased significantly from the day of diagnosis to follow-up visit with 79% of subjects reporting a decrease. On univariate analysis, decrease in FTND had a significant association with presence of comorbidity, any symptoms, presence of respiratory symptoms, and if supplemental oxygen was administered. On multivariate analysis, symptomatic COVID-19 disease, higher age, PCFS at baseline, and PCFS at follow-up had a significant association with decreased PCFS values at followup. Conclusion: COVID-19 diagnosis was followed by significant decrease in FTND score, particularly for symptomatic and older subjects. Post-COVID follow-up visits should be used as an opportunity by health providers to ensure its sustainability and for achieving cessation.

Part of the coronavirus challenges is the various spiritual undertones attributed to it in many quarters. Hence, this study seeks to understand the various spiritual undertones attributed to the coronavirus incidence in southwest Nigeria. METHODOLOGY: This paper examined the coronavirus pandemic and spirituality sociologically in southwest Nigeria, using secondary and primary data. Secondary data includes a review of literature, social media comments, official records, and newspaper reports. Primary data entails using google form (questionnaire) circulated via social media with 221 responses retrieved and analyzed using the frequency distribution tables and bar charts. Also, a one-sample t-test was used for further statistical analysis. RESULTS: Findings show that rather than attributing coronavirus incidence to spirituality alone, most of the respondents also see it as a public health concern, and precautionary measures should adhere. They see the government ban on social gathering, which affected the religious houses as the right thing to do and not solely targeted as religious houses. However, most believe that religious houses provide 'essential' emotional and spiritual support to the people. Respondents also believe they can get their healing from their place of worship even if infected with the coronavirus. CONCLUSION: Based on the findings it was recommended that religious organizations should source valid data so that policy-makers can make informed decisions. Also, there is a need to have an accurate record of the number of infected persons and death rates to know the right time to ease lockdown and lift the social gathering measures. There should also be a place for easy and free testing for people. This will help the government ascertain the number of infected persons, reduce the associated fear with the pandemic, and lessen the people's economic, social, and religious effects.","output":"Coronavirus pandemic and spirituality in southwest Nigeria: A sociological analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many drugs have been considered for treatment of COVID-19, and several monoclonal antibodies have been granted emergency use authorizations for this purpose, but only remdesivir (Veklury), an IV antiviral agent that inhibits RNA polymerase, has been approved by the FDA, and it is only approved for use in hospitalized patients.

Within fragile health systems that lack PC, incurable illness is often marked by pain and suffering, as well as burdensome costs. In high-income settings, PC decreases healthcare utilisation, thus enhancing value. Similar cost-effectiveness models are lacking in low-income and middle-income countries and with them, the impetus and funding to expand PC delivery. METHODS We conducted a systematic search of seven databases to gather evidence of the cost-effectiveness of PC in low-income and middle-income countries. We extracted and synthesised palliative outcomes and economic data from original research studies occurring in low-income and middle-income countries. This review adheres to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and includes a quality appraisal. RESULTS Our search identified 10 eligible papers that included palliative and economic outcomes in low-income and middle-income countries. Four provided true cost-effectiveness analyses in comparing the costs of PC versus alternative care, with PC offering cost savings, favourable palliative outcomes and positive patient-reported and family-reported outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Despite the small number of included studies, wide variety of study types and lack of high-quality studies, several patterns emerged: (1) low-cost PC delivery in low-income and middle-income countries is possible, (2) patient-reported outcomes are favourable and (3) PC is less costly than the alternative. This review highlights the extraordinary need for robust cost-effectiveness analysis of PC in low-income and middle-income countries in order to develop health economic models for the delivery of PC, direct resource allocation and guide healthcare policy for PC delivery in low-income and middle-income countries.","output":"Is palliative care cost-effective in low-income and middle-income countries?

Despite this frightening picture, denialism and noncompliance with public health measures are common in the historical record, for example during the 1918 Influenza pandemic or the 2015 Ebola epidemic. The unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2its high basic reproduction number (R(0)), time-limited natural immunity and considerable potential for asymptomatic spreadexacerbate the public health repercussions of noncompliance with interventions (such as vaccines and masks) to limit disease transmission. Our work explores the rationality and impact of noncompliance with measures aimed at limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this work, we used game theory to explore when noncompliance confers a perceived benefit to individuals. We then used epidemiological modeling to predict the impact of noncompliance on control of SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that the presence of a noncompliant subpopulation prevents suppression of disease spread. RESULTS: Our modeling demonstrates that noncompliance is a Nash equilibrium under a broad set of conditions and that the existence of a noncompliant population can result in extensive endemic disease in the long-term after a return to pre-pandemic social and economic activity. Endemic disease poses a threat for both compliant and noncompliant individuals; all community members are protected if complete suppression is achieved, which is only possible with a high degree of compliance. For interventions that are highly effective at preventing disease spread, however, the consequences of noncompliance are borne disproportionately by noncompliant individuals. CONCLUSIONS: In sum, our work demonstrates the limits of free-market approaches to compliance with disease control measures during a pandemic. The act of noncompliance with disease intervention measures creates a negative externality, rendering suppression of SARS-CoV-2 spread ineffective. Our work underscores the importance of developing effective strategies for prophylaxis through public health measures aimed at complete suppression and the need to focus on compliance at a population level.

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 exerts this anti-IFN activity. We found that SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 hijacks Nup98 to block STAT nuclear import and antagonize interferon signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivou-se identificar os impactos e estratgias de empreendedores de diferentes segmentos de mercado no cenrio de crise da COVID-19.

Moreover, few studies have focused on COVD-19 deaths.

The exposure of interest was average temperature and other weather conditions, measured at 25 days prior and 25 days after the first reported COVID-19 death was collected in the OECD countries and US states. The outcome of interest was cumulative COVID-19 mortality, assessed for each region at 25, 30, 35, and 40 days after the first reported death. Analyses were performed with negative binomial regression and adjusted for other weather conditions, particulate matter, sociodemographic factors, smoking, obesity, ICU beds, and social distancing. A 1 C increase in ambient temperature was associated with 6% lower COVID-19 mortality at 30 days following the first reported death (multivariate-adjusted mortality rate ratio: 0.94, 95% CI 0.90, 0.99, p = 0.016). The results were robust for COVID-19 mortality at 25, 35 and 40 days after the first death, as well as other sensitivity analyses.

This study assessed the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students and interim foundation year doctors across the United Kingdom (UK), and the support that they received and sought. METHODS: A prospective, observational, multicentre study was conducted. All medical students and interim foundation year doctors were eligible to participate. The data analysis was carried out as detailed a priori in the protocol. FINDINGS: A total of 2075 individuals participated in the SPICE-19 survey from 33 medical schools. There was a significant (p < 0.0001) decrease in participants mood when comparing their mood before the pandemic to during the pandemic. Social distancing and more time at home/with family were the factors that negatively and positively respectively impacted the mood of the greatest number of participants. All areas of life included in the survey were found to have been significantly more negatively impacted than positively impacted (p < 0.0001). 931 participants wanted more support from their university. Participants were mainly seeking support with exam preparation, course material, and financial guidance. DISCUSSION: Medical and foundation schools need to prepare adequate and effective support. If no action is taken, there may be a knock-on effect on workforce planning and the health of our future workforce.

Since idiotypes are different in each tumor, a personalized vaccine has to be produced for each patient. Expression of immunoglobulins with appropriate post-translational modifications for human use often requires the use of stable mammalian cells that can be scaled-up to reach the desired level of production. We have used a noncytopathic self-amplifying RNA vector derived from Semliki Forest virus (ncSFV) to generate BHK cell lines expressing murine follicular lymphoma-derived idiotype A20 mAb. ncSFV/BHK cell lines expressed approximately 2 mg/L/24 h of A20 mAb with proper quaternary structure and a glycosylation pattern similar to that of A20 mAb produced by hybridoma cells. A20 mAb purified from the supernatant of a ncSFV cell line, or from the hybridoma, was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize Balb/c mice by administration of four weekly doses of 25 g of mAb.

In this study, we deployed a multifaceted community education programme to educate students, healthcare professionals and members of the public in rural areas of Tamil Nadu, India about the dangers of SBE, appropriate first aid measures and the dos and donts following a snakebite. An assessment of prior knowledge within these communities identified several misconceptions concerning snakes and SBE. Using a combination of direct engagement (estimated to reach over 200,000 people), information leaflets (200,000 distributed), posters, video documentaries, media and social media (>2.8 million engagements), over the course of one year (January to December 2019) we reached over 3 million people in rural Tamil Nadu (around 8% of population). Evaluation of community-based assemblies indicated that at least 90% of attendees were able to recall the key messages at the end of the events, and at least 85% were able to recall the key messages even after 12 months. Due to high demand, a one-day symposium was organised to provide clinical knowledge and training on SBE to 250 healthcare professionals in rural Tamil Nadu.

In high-income countries, the hope is to streamline the diagnostic procedure, minimize costs and make healthcare processes more efficient and faster, which, in some cases, can be more a matter of convenience than necessity. However, in resource-limited settings such as low-income countries, PoC-diagnostics might be the only viable route, when the next laboratory is hours away. Therefore, it is especially important to focus research into novel diagnostics for these countries in order to alleviate suffering due to infectious disease. In this review, the current research describing the use of PoC diagnostics in resource-limited settings and the potential bottlenecks along the value chain that prevent their widespread application is summarized. To this end, we will look at literature that investigates different parts of the value chain, such as fundamental research and market economics, as well as actual use at healthcare providers. We aim to create an integrated picture of potential PoC barriers, from the first start of research at universities to patient treatment in the field. Results from the literature will be discussed with the aim to bring all important steps and aspects together in order to illustrate how effectively PoC is being used in low-income countries. In addition, we discuss what is needed to improve the situation further, in order to use this technology to its fullest advantage and avoid leaks in the pipeline, when a promising device fails to take the next step of the valorization pathway and is abandoned.","output":"Point of Care Diagnostics in Resource-Limited Settings: A Review of the Present and Future of PoC in Its Most Needed Environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Urticaria is a disabling condition, resulting in an impaired quality of life and sleep disruption, and can have an adverse impact on work-related or school-related performance and attendance.

An important focus of cooking research to date has been on cookings association with nutrition and dietary quality. Less focus has been placed on how cooking might foster the qualities that allow for mitigation of psychosocial distress and promote well-being. Rooted in its evolutionary role in the human experience, cooking requires skills and knowledge that have the capacity to encourage aspects of well-being as described by Seligman as flourishing. Evidence for a beneficial role of cooking in psychosocial health exists, but the exploration is limited, potentially due to lack of a theoretical context to explain these benefits. From this perspective, we review the current literature showing the application of Seligmans prominent well-being model, Positive emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment (PERMA), to cooking, defined as the activity related to the preparation of food or a meal. We propose that the PERMA model as applied to cooking may function as a theoretical framework to explore psychosocial outcomes associated with cooking. Broader application of this approach may also help to further the application of positive psychology in the developing literature around psychosocial health and nutrition-related chronic diseases.","output":"Well-Being and Cooking Behavior: Using the Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment (PERMA) Model as a Theoretical Framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant is highly transmissible and spreading globally but a detailed understanding of community transmission risks in highly vaccinated populations is lacking.Methods: Between September 2020 and August 2021, we recruited 510 community contacts of 422 UK COVID-19 cases to a cohort study. A total of 7194 upper respiratory tract (URT) samples were tested from sequential daily sampling of participants for up to 20 days. We analysed transmission risk by vaccination status for 139 contacts exposed to the Delta variant. We compared viral load (VL) trajectories from fully-vaccinated cases of Delta infection (n=19) with unvaccinated Delta (n=10), Alpha (n=39) and pre-Alpha (n=49) infections.Findings: The household secondary attack rate for fully-vaccinated contacts exposed to Delta was 19.7% (95%CI:11.6-31.3%), compared with 35.7% (95%CI:16.4-61.2%) in the unvaccinated. One third of infections in Delta-exposed contacts arose from fully-vaccinated index cases and one half of infected contacts were also fully-vaccinated. Seven transmission events between fully vaccinated index-contact pairs occurred. Genomic analysis confirmed transmission pathways between fully-vaccinated individuals within three households. Peak VL was similar in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals with Delta variant infection but vaccinated Delta cases saw significantly faster VL decline than unvaccinated Alpha or Delta cases. Within infected individuals, faster VL growth was correlated with higher peak VL and slower decline.Interpretation: Although vaccination reduces the risk of Delta infection and causes some changes to viral kinetics, fully-vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections have peak URT VL similar to unvaccinated cases and can efficiently transmit infection in household settings, including to fully vaccinated contacts.Funding: National Institute for Health Research (Award:NIHR200927)Declaration of Interest: The authors declare no relevant conflicts.Ethical Approval: The study was approved by the Health Research Authority (Research Ethics Committee reference: 20/NW/0231).","output":"Community Transmission and Viral Load Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2)Variant in Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A decade ago, Nordic cooperation on security and defence matters gained momentum, having been largely absent from the map of Nordic cooperation during the Cold War and its aftermath This article analyses developments along three dimensions of Nordic cooperation: military defence (focusing on the Nordic Defence Cooperation), civil security (in the form of the 'Naga' process), and political cooperation (through the implementation of the Stoltenberg report) Three observations stand out as a result: First, that the three dimensions are intimately related against the background of a common Nordic conceptualization of security;second, that there is simultaneously variation in significant respects (such as driving forces, scope, and degree of institutionalization);and third, that Nordic security and defence cooperation has developed in the context of European and transatlantic security dynamics and cooperation The second part of the analysis seeks to interpret this picture from the analytical perspective of differentiated integration The article ends with a set of reflections on the future of Nordic security and defence cooperation in light of the Coronavirus pandemic","output":"Nordic Security and Defence Cooperation: Differentiated Integration in Uncertain Times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detection with short turn\\\\around\\\\time (TAT) is pivotal for rapid decisions regarding treatment and infection control.

Urinary bladders were harvested from 10 pig donors. Biological scaffolds were prepared by chemically removing all cellular components from urinary bladder tissue. A total of 10 female pigs underwent hemicystectomy and subsequent bladder reconstruction with BAM. The follow-up study was 6 months. Reconstructed bladders were subjected to radiological, macroscopic, histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular evaluations. Six out of ten animals survived the 6-month follow-up period. Four pigs died during observation due to mechanical failure of the scaffold, anastomotic dehiscence between the scaffold and native bladder tissue, or occluded catheter. Tissue engineered bladder function was normal without any signs of postvoid residual urine in the bladder or upper urinary tracts. Macroscopically, graft shrinkage was observed. Urothelium completely covered the luminal surface of the graft. Smooth muscle regeneration was observed mainly in the peripheral graft region and gradually decreased toward the center of the graft. Expression of urothelial, smooth muscle, blood vessel, and nerve markers were lower in the reconstructed bladder wall compared to the native bladder.

BACKGROUND The stress level of clinical nurses directly affects their physical and mental health and work efficiency. DESIGN This study was a cross-sectional investigation, which was performed following the STROBE checklist. The current study was conducted in February 2020 by selecting clinical nurses from the Zigong First People's Hospital for investigation. METHODS At the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we assessed clinical nurses with the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire, the General Self-Efficacy Scale and the Perceived Social Support Scale. Specifically, the nurses were divided into three groups: (i) Nurses supporting Wuhan; (ii) Nurses in the department of treating the COVID-19 patients in our hospital (Epidemic department); and (iii) Nurses in the general department without the COVID-19 patients in our hospital (Non-epidemic department). RESULTS A total of 1092 clinical nurses were surveyed with 94 nurses in Wuhan, 130 nurses treating COVID-19 patients in our hospital and 868 nurses working without direct contact with diagnosed COVID-19 patients. The mean stress score of all surveyed nurses was 33.15 (SD: 25.551). There was a statistically significant difference in stress response scores between different departments. Noticeably, the nurses who went to support in Wuhan showed a weaker stress response than the nurses who stayed in our hospital (mean: 19.98 (Wuhan) vs. 32.70 (Epidemic department in our hospital) vs. 34.64 (Non-epidemic department in our hospital)). In addition, stress was negatively correlated with general self-efficacy and perceived social support. CONCLUSION The present study suggested that the stress status of second-line nurse without direct contact with diagnosed COVID-19 patients was more severe than that of first-line nurses who had direct contact with COVID-19 patients.

Data analysis was performed with patient-based data based on the availability of clinical characteristics and outcomes for each individual patient from the studies. Chi square and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to report COVID-19 severity and outcomes based on neurological imaging indicators and pathophysiology. A total of 171 patients with COVID-19 having neurological complications, from 134 studies, were identified in our review. The most common neuroimaging finding was ischemic stroke (62, 36.2%) cases, followed by CNS inflammatory disorder (44, 25.7%), and hemorrhagic stroke (41, 24.0%). Around 51% of all the fatal COVID-19 cases had an ischemic stroke.

The COVID pandemic has further highlighted the connection between social determinants and the health of populations. There are frameworks and competencies to support the delivery of population health content in the entry-level DPT curriculum. Three options for integrating population health content into the DPT curriculum are presented: (1) threading the content throughout the curriculum, (2) concentrating the content in 1 or 2 identified courses, and (3) offering elective courses. Each of these strategies has benefits and challenges but threading the content throughout the curriculum provides the best opportunity to reinforce population health competencies across populations and practice settings. Experiential learning using authentic scenarios provides an ideal opportunity for students to understand population health concepts in a real-world context. Activities that incorporate interaction with other health professions broadens students perspectives of the role of different professions for achieving population health goals. Examples of learning activities are included in three competency areas, Foundations of Population Health, Prevention and Health Promotion, and Health Policy. Current societal issues provide an opportunity to enhance population health education from a meaningful perspective for students. The topic of health equity presents an opportunity to tie social and political factors of population health to social justice and health outcomes. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic puts issues of mental health, health disparities, and health systems front and center in our understanding of population health. IMPACT: Healthcare practitioners are looking at health through the lens of health equity and acknowledging the impact of social and political determinants on health to address health disparities, decrease healthcare expenditures, and respond to changes necessitated by pandemics such as COVID-19.

The ARTIC primer set amplifies 98 amplicons, which are separated only in two PCRs, across a nearly entire viral genome. The original primer set and protocol showed a fairly small amplification bias when clinical samples with relatively high viral loads were used. However, as samples viral load become low, rapid decrease in abundances of several amplicons were seen. In this report, we will show that dimer formations between some primers are the major cause of coverage bias in the multiplex PCR.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examine patients' prenatal care needs, preferences, and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the aim of supporting the development of successful models to serve the needs of pregnant patients, obstetric providers, and health care systems during this time. METHODS: This study involved qualitative methods to explore pregnant patients experiences with prenatal health care delivery at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted in-depth interviews with pregnant patients in the first and second trimester of pregnancy who received prenatal care in Cleveland, Ohio, from May to July 2020. An interview guide was used to probe experiences with health care delivery as it rapidly evolved at the onset of the pandemic. RESULTS: Although advantages of telehealth were noted, there were several concerns noted with the broad implementation of telehealth for prenatal care during the pandemic. This included concerns about monitoring the pregnancy at home; the need for additional reassurance for the pregnancy, given the uncertainties presented by the pandemic; and the ability to have effective patient-provider discussions via a telehealth visit. The need to tailor telehealth to prenatal health care delivery was noted. CONCLUSIONS: Although previous studies have demonstrated that telehealth is a flexible and convenient alternative for some prenatal appointments, our study suggests that there may be specific needs and concerns among the diverse patient groups using this modality during the pandemic. More research is needed to understand patients' experiences with telehealth during the pandemic and develop approaches that are responsive to the needs and preferences of patients.","output":"The Successes and Challenges of Implementing Telehealth for Diverse Patient Populations Requiring Prenatal Care During COVID-19: Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plants deploy cell surface receptors known as pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize non-self molecules from pathogens and microbes to defend against invaders. PRRs typically recognize microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) that are usually widely conserved, some even across kingdoms. Here, we report an oomycete-specific family of small secreted cysteine-rich (SCR) proteins that displays divergent patterns of sequence variation in the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans A subclass that includes the conserved effector PcF from Phytophthora cactorum activates immunity in a wide range of plant species. In contrast, the more diverse SCR74 subclass is specific to P. infestans and tends to trigger immune responses only in a limited number of wild potato genotypes. The SCR74 response was recently mapped to a G-type lectin receptor kinase (G-LecRK) locus in the wild potato Solanum microdontum subsp. gigantophyllum. The G-LecRK locus displays a high diversity in Solanum host species compared to other solanaceous plants. We propose that the diversification of the SCR74 proteins in P. infestans is driven by a fast coevolutionary arms race with cell surface immune receptors in wild potato, which contrasts the presumed slower dynamics between conserved apoplastic effectors and PRRs. Understanding the molecular determinants of plant immune responses to these divergent molecular patterns in oomycetes is expected to contribute to deploying multiple layers of disease resistance in crop plants.IMPORTANCE Immune receptors at the plant cell surface can recognize invading microbes. The perceived microbial molecules are typically widely conserved and therefore the matching surface receptors can detect a broad spectrum of pathogens. Here we describe a family of Phytophthora small extracellular proteins that consists of conserved subfamilies that are widely recognized by solanaceous plants. Remarkably, one subclass of SCR74 proteins is highly diverse, restricted to the late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans and is specifically detected in wild potato plants. The diversification of this subfamily exhibits signatures of a coevolutionary arms race with surface receptors in potato. Insights into the molecular interaction between these potato-specific receptors and the recognized Phytophthora proteins are expected to contribute to disease resistance breeding in potato.","output":"Divergent Evolution of PcF/SCR74 Effectors in Oomycetes Is Associated with Distinct Recognition Patterns in Solanaceous Plants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Children, who enroll in hospice, have complex mental and behavioral health (MHBH) problems. There is limited literature on patterns of these problems among children at their end of life. Using the national database of 6195 children enrolled in hospice between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013, and latent class analysis, this study identified 4 distinctive classes of children. Neurodevelopment and anxiety class (26.5% of the sample) had 41.3% of children of 15 years or older, who had an average of 1.4 MHBH comorbidities and took 17 medications; 29.1% had physical health comorbidities, and 23% were dependent on technology. In the Behavior and Neurodevelopment class (20%), 53.1% of the children were between ages 6 and 14 years, who had an average of 2 MHBH comorbidities and took 17 medications. In the Physiology class (43.4%), 65.5% of children were younger than 5 years, had 1 MHBH comorbidity, and took 19 medications. In the Mood, Behaviors, and Anxiety class (10.2%), more than 90% of children were older than 6 years, had 4 MHBH comorbidities, and took 30 medications.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Products were applied to stainless steel or ABS plastic coupons and dried overnight. Coupons were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of 5% soil load. Recovered infectious SARS-CoV-2 was quantified by TCID50 assay. Tested product efficacies ranged from <1.0 to >3.0 log10 reduction at a 2-h contact time. The log10 reduction in recovered infectious SARS-CoV-2 ranged from 0.44 to 3 log10 reduction on stainless steel and 0.25 to >1.67 log10 on ABS plastic. The most effective products tested contained varying concentrations (0.5%-1.3%) of the same active ingredient: 3-(trihydroxysilyl) propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride. Products formulated with other quaternary ammonium compounds were less effective against SARS-CoV-2 in this test. CONCLUSIONS: The residual antimicrobial products tested showed varied effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 as a function of product tested. Several products were identified as efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 on both stainless steel and ABS plastic surfaces under the conditions evaluated. Differences in observed efficacy may be due to variation in active ingredient formulation; efficacy is, therefore, difficult to predict based upon listed active ingredient and its concentration. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT: This study highlights the formulation-specific efficacy of several products against SARS-CoV-2 and may inform future development of residual antiviral products for use on non-porous surfaces.

OBJECTIVE: To assess how frequently nursing homes had shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) or staffing in weeks when they admitted COVID-positive patients, which likely made it more difficult to follow TBP, and to compare facility characteristics by admissions practices. DESIGN AND SETTING: Facility-level data from the Nursing Home COVID-19 Public File for the period between June 7, 2020 and March 7, 2021 was combined with additional data. The percentages of nursing homes that admitted COVID-positive patients and that had shortages when admitting were calculated for each week. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between facility characteristics and the likelihood of admitting COVID-positive patients. MEASUREMENTS: Facilities were categorized as having admitted COVID-positive patients in a week if one or more admissions requiring TBP were reported for that week. Facilities that reported having less than a 1-week supply of any type of PPE or being short any type of staff in a week were defined, respectively, as having a PPE shortage or staffing shortage in that week. RESULTS: Over the 40-week study period, 39% of US nursing homes admitted COVID-positive patients in at least 1 week in which they were experiencing PPE or staffing shortages. Facilities that admitted COVID-positive patients with shortages generally had lower Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services overall five-star ratings than other facilities. Only a small percentage of facilities that admitted COVID-positive patients while facing shortages were located in counties with severe shortages of PPE or staffing. In logistic regression models, shortages were not associated with COVID-positive admissions.

Clinical probability of PE was determined according to the Wells and modified Wells scoring system. CTPA was performed in 60 patients. The degree of pulmonary vascular obstruction was quantified by the Qanadli index. RESULTS Low clinical probability of PE was present in one patient (1.6%), moderate in 43 (71.6%) and high in 16 (26.6%) patients. PE was confirmed in 50 (83.3%) patients. There were 21 patients (42%) whose Quanadli index was <25%, 18 (36%) between 25%-50%, while Quanadli index was 50 in 11 patients (22%). When compared to CTPA findings, modified Wells scoring system showed 90% sensitivity [95% confidence interval (CI) 78.2%-96.6%], and 20% specificity (95% CI 3.11%-55.6%), positive predictive value (PPV) 84.9% (95% CI 72.4%-93.2%) and negative predictive value (NPV) 28.6% (95% CI 4.5%-70.7%).

While there are complex models to inform both potential health and macro-economic impact, there are few tools available to rapidly assess potential equity impacts of interventions. METHODS: We created an economic model to simulate the impact of lockdown measures in Pakistan, Georgia, Chile, UK, the Philippines and South Africa. We consider impact of lockdown in terms of ability to socially distance, and income loss during lockdown, and tested the impact of assumptions on social protection coverage in a scenario analysis. RESULTS: In all examined countries, socioeconomic status (SES) quintiles 1C3 were disproportionately more likely to experience income loss (70% of people) and inability to socially distance (68% of people) than higher SES quintiles. Improving social protection increased the percentage of the workforce able to socially distance from 48% (33%C60%) to 66% (44%C71%). We estimate the cost of this social protection would be equivalent to an average of 0.6% gross domestic product (0.1% PakistanC1.1% Chile). CONCLUSIONS: We illustrate the potential for using publicly available data to rapidly assess the equity implications of social protection and non-pharmaceutical intervention policy. Social protection is likely to mitigate inequitable health and economic impacts of lockdown. Although social protection is usually targeted to the poorest, middle quintiles will likely also need support as they are most likely to suffer income losses and are disproportionately more exposed.","output":"Exploring equity in health and poverty impacts of control measures for SARS-CoV-2 in six countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Research in recent years has explored the vocabulary size (lexical breadth) of bilingual children, but less is known about the richness of bilingual word knowledge (lexical depth), and about how knowledge of words in the two languages interact. This study explores how bilingual narrative intervention with vocabulary instruction in each language may modulate crosslinguistic influence (CLI) between the languages of bilingual kindergarten children, focusing on CLI of lexical knowledge, and which factors modulate performance. Methods: Forty-one typically developing English-Hebrew bilingual children (M = 64.63 months) participated. A bilingual adaptation of Story Champs narrative intervention program (Spencer and Petersen, 2012) was used to deliver vocabulary instruction in separate blocks of home language (HL) and school language (SL) sessions. Different intervention words were targeted in each language, but the children were tested on all target words in both languages. Lexical knowledge was assessed with a definition task four times throughout the study: prior to intervention, after each intervention block, and 4C6 weeks later. Learner characteristics (chronological age, age of onset of bilingualism and length of exposure) and proficiency in each language (standardized tests, familiarity with the vocabulary introduced in the intervention at baseline) were examined as possible modulators of performance. Results: Children showed growth in lexical breadth and depth in their HL/English after HL intervention and in lexical breadth in the SL/Hebrew following SL intervention, with CLI for semantic depth observed via a qualitative analysis, but not quantitatively. Better HL/English performance was correlated with later AoB (and shorter SL exposure) and higher HL language proficiency scores. Children with higher HL/English proficiency responded better to the SL/Hebrew intervention, gaining more than those with lower English proficiency. Children with SL/Hebrew vocabulary dominance at the outset of the study also gained more from the HL/English intervention. No correlations were found between learner characteristics and SL performance. Discussion: The current study indicates that bilingual narrative intervention with vocabulary instruction may be efficacious for improving the lexical breadth and depth of bilingual kindergarten children. It suggests that CLI may enhance bilingual childrens language learning success, and points to the importance of strengthening both languages of bilingual children.","output":"Crosslinguistic Influence (CLI) of Lexical Breadth and Depth in the Vocabulary of Bilingual Kindergarten Children C A Bilingual Intervention Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract A severe form of pneumonia, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization, broke out in China and rapidly developed into a global pandemic, with millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths reported globally.

In comparison to the healthy volunteers, where serological response was achieved by 100% subjects, patients on B-cell-targeting therapy (Ibrutinib and Rituximab) had their response dramatically impaired.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of clinical symptoms of anxiety and depression and the relationship between PCS and quality of life in patients examined at the Canadian Concussion Centre. The Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-42) and the WHO Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL-Bref) were sent to 526 adult patients diagnosed with PCS. The median with interquartile range (IQR) follow-up time was 5 (4-7) years. Of the 105 respondents, 35.2% displayed mild or greater symptoms of anxiety, depression or both. Importantly, the number of previous concussions was correlated with elevations on the DASS-42 Anxiety (p=0.030) and Depression (p=0.018) sub-scale scores, suggesting an acquired cause of symptoms. Patients with clinical elevations of depression, anxiety, or both exhibited poorer mean WHOQOL-Bref scores in each domain (p<0.001) compared to those who scored in the normal range on the DASS-42. These findings indicate that, depression and anxiety in PCS can endure for years and are associated with diminished quality of life. Consequently, depression and anxiety should be identified and treated early in PCS populations in order to optimize recovery. While the underlying etiology of depression and anxiety cannot be ascertained with certainty in the present study, the association between depression and anxiety and the number of concussions may indicate an organic explanation. In the future, quality of life measures should be incorporated into the treatment and research in PCS to improve intervention strategies and enhance understanding of the trajectory of recovery in this population.","output":"Anxiety, Depression, and Quality of Life: A Long-Term Follow-up Study of Patients with Persisting Concussion Symptoms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Larval indices such as the house index (HI), Breteau index (BI) and container index (CI) are widely used to interpret arbovirus vector density in surveillance programmes.

The present study aims to investigate the spatial distribution pattern of the infestation of Aedes aegypti, considering the data available in the Ae. aegypti Infestation Index Rapid Survey (LIRAa) for the city of Campina Grande, Paraba State in Brazil. METHODS: The global and local Moran?s indices were used in spatial analysis to measure the effects of spatial dependencies between neighbourhoods, using secondary data related to HI and BI gathered from surveillance service. RESULTS: Our analysis shows that there is a predominance of high rates of mosquito infestation, placing Campina Grande at a near-constant risk of arbovirus outbreaks and epidemics. A highly significant Moran?s index value (P < 0.001) was observed, indicating a positive spatial dependency between the neighbourhoods in Campina Grande. Using the Moran mapping and LISA mapping, the autocorrelation patterns of Ae. aegypti infestation rates among neighbourhoods have revealed hotpots that should be considered a priority to preventive actions of the entomological surveillance services. Predominance of high infestation rates and clearer relationships of these between neighbourhoods were observed between the months of May and July, the period with the highest rainfall in the city.

One of the methods used to inactivate viruses is exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation to damage their nucleic acids. While gamma (?3) rays effectively induce lesions in the RNA, envelope proteins are also highly damaged in the process. This in turn may alter their antigenic properties, affecting their capacity to induce an adaptive immune response able to confer effective protection. Here, we modeled the effect of sparsely and densely ionizing radiation on SARS-CoV-2 using the Monte Carlo toolkit Geant4-DNA. With a realistic 3D target virus model, we calculated the expected number of lesions in the spike and membrane proteins, as well as in the viral RNA. Our findings showed that ?3 rays produced significant spike protein damage, but densely ionizing charged particles induced less membrane damage for the same level of RNA lesions, because a single ion traversal through the nuclear envelope was sufficient to inactivate the virus. We propose that accelerated charged particles produce inactivated viruses with little structural damage to envelope proteins, thereby representing a new and effective tool for developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses.","output":"Monte Carlo Simulation of SARS-CoV-2 Radiation-Induced Inactivation for Vaccine Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Influence of therapeutic thoracentesis on the pleural pressure (Pp) has been discussed in many clinical studies, however reasons of Pp changes are not precisely established. The aim of the study was to use a previously elaborated virtual cardiopulmonary patient (VP) in analysis of impact of physiological factors on Pp during the procedure. METHODS Simulations were performed on VP with default values of parameters for which VP simulated the respiratory system of the average 50-year-old healthy Polish woman according to spirometric examination. Alterations of Pp and the amplitude of Pp changes related to breathing (AP) were analyzed. Model parameters related to chosen factors were deviated from their default values to analyze the degree of their impact on Pp and AP. The analysis was based on and supported by our own clinical data. RESULTS The Pp and AP alteration intensity appeared to be most sensitive to the compliances of the rib cage and mediastinum, and the nonlinearity of the dependence between the recoil pressure and the lung volume: the lower the compliances and the higher the nonlinearity were, the deeper the Pp fall during the procedure and the bigger the AP increase were observed. CONCLUSIONS Experiments in silico are very useful in analyzing sophisticated physiological and medical problems. They made it possible to show which factors are particularly responsible for changes in Pp during thoracentesis. In the future, they may be useful in establishing objective conditions under which thoracentesis needs to be stopped.","output":"The use of a virtual patient to follow pleural pressure changes associated with therapeutic thoracentesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 35-year-old woman presented with fever and mild diarrhoea without any respiratory symptoms 9 days after travelling to Japan from Wuhan, China.

Early diagnosis is essential for an appropriate patient care and infection control, so laboratory where molecular tests are held plays a main role. However, laboratory facilities for testing are limited in rural areas. Therefore, it is important to have an effective and practical point-of-care diagnostic system in order to be implemented in developing countries with limited energy access. The objective of this research is to develop an energetically autonomous point-of-care diagnostic system for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2. This design consists of a retractable system with an area of 15.79 m(2) and 3 well-distributed interior areas to guaranty appropriate sample processing. Our point-of-care diagnostic system can be installed at a fixed place (stationary), and it can also be transported to various strategic places (itinerant). The off-grid photovoltaic system feasibility was evaluated using the PVsyst software, presenting an installed capacity of 2.79 KWp, consisting of 4 monocrystalline photovoltaic modules, a 45 A charge regulator and 4 batteries (6 V, 453 Ah). The results showed a performance ratio of 0.522, with higher losses by the full battery (31.77%).

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to explore the attitudes and approaches to PPI across Europe. Eight scientific databases were systematically searched and data extracted. Data quality was assessed using a checklist based on the Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public (GRIPP2) (Staniszewska et al., Research, Involvement and Engagement, 3, 13, 2017) and the critical appraisal guidelines developed by Wright et al.

There seems to be a convergence of conceptualisations of PPI across Europe, with internationally significant areas of innovative work taking place in countries such as the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries. However, the implementation of PPI is highly uneven, and PPI is not yet firmly embedded or adequately formalised in European healthcare systems and research, possibly due to a lack of infrastructure, guidance and support.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 300 confirmed COVID-19 patients who were treated with TCM, at a designated hospital in China. The patients were categorized into three groups: TCM1, TCM2 and TCM3, who respectively received TCM interventions within 7, 8-14, and greater than 15 days of hospitalization. Different indicators such as the conversion time of pharyngeal swab nucleic acid, the conversion time of fecal nucleic acid, length of hospital stay, and inflammatory markers (leukocyte count, and lymphocyte count and percentage) were analyzed to observe the impact of early TCM interventions on these groups. RESULTS: The median conversion times of pharyngeal swab nucleic acid in the three groups were 5.5, 7 and 16 d (P < 0.001), with TCM1 and TCM2 being statistically different from TCM3 (P < 0.01). TCM1 (P < 0.05) and TCM3 (P < 0.01) were statistically different from TCM2. The median conversion times of fecal nucleic acid in the three groups were 7, 9 and 17 d (P < 0.001). Conversion times of fecal nucleic acid in TCM1 were statistically different from TCM3 and TCM2 (P < 0.01). The median lengths of hospital stay in the three groups were 13, 16 and 21 d (P < 0.001). TCM1 and TCM2 were statistically different from TCM3 (P < 0.01); TCM1 and TCM3 were statistically different from TCM2 (P < 0.01). Both leucocyte and lymphocyte counts increased gradually with an increase in the length of hospital stay in TCM1 group patients, with a statistically significant difference observed at each time point in the group (P < 0.001). Statistically significant differences in lymphocyte count and percentage in TCM2 (P < 0.001), and in leucocyte count (P = 0.043) and lymphocyte count (P = 0.038) in TCM3 were observed. The comparison among the three groups showed a statistically significant difference in lymphocyte percentage on the third day of admission (P = 0.044). CONCLUSION: In this study, it was observed that in COVID-19 patients treated with a combination of Chinese and Western medicines, TCM intervention earlier in the hospital stay correlated with faster conversion time of pharyngeal swab and fecal nucleic acid, as well as shorter length of hospital stay, thus helping promote faster recovery of the patient.

This meta-analysis was strictly focused on the influence of smoking history on the severe and critical outcomes on people with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in eight online databases before 1 February 2021. All studies meeting our selection criteria were included and evaluated. Stata 14.0 software was used to analyze the data. Results: A total of 109 articles involving 517,020 patients were included in this meta-analysis. A statistically significant association was discovered between smoking history and COVID-19 severity, the pooled OR was 1.55 (95%CI: 1.41-1.71). Smoking was significantly associated with the risk of admission to intensive care unit (ICU) (OR=1.73, 95%CI: 1.36-2.19), increased mortality (OR=1.58, 95%CI: 1.38-1.81), and critical diseases composite endpoints (OR=1.61, 95%CI: 1.35-1.93), whereas there was no relationship with mechanical ventilation. The pooled prevalence of smoking using the random effects model (REM) was 15% (95%CI: 14%-16%).

AIM: Considering the fact that the reported data in different articles for the type and prevalence of skin manifestations related to the COVID-19 pandemic are inconsistent, we have described the mechanism and type of skin lesions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this review article, we have searched the Medline database (PubMed) for the combination of the following key terms \\"Dermatological Manifestation\\", \\"cutaneous Manifestation\\", \\"Skin Manifestation\\", \\"COVID-19\\", \\"SARS-CoV-2\\". RESULTS: The prevalence of skin manifestations related to COVID-19 ranged from 0.2% to 20%. The majority of these skin lesions are maculopapular eruptions. The skin presentations related to the COVID-19 pandemic are described below. Traumatic skin conditions such as dermatitis in individuals, especially those with allergies, might initiate secondary to over-washing or rinsing with inappropriate detergents. Also, inappropriate use of personal protective equipment (mask-gloves-shield) can trigger skin lesions on the face and hands or aggravate the lesions of acne, seborrhoeic dermatitis, eczema, etc. Furthermore, cutaneous adverse drug reactions may occur during hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients. Also, psychocutaneous disorders due to acute stress can trigger or deteriorate several skin manifestations. Moreover, COVID-19 prevalence and course may be changed in patients with autoimmune or chronic inflammatory underlying skin disorders such as psoriasis, lupus erythematosus, pemphigus, scleroderma who are on immunosuppressive or biological medications to control their disorders.

METHODS: In a longitudinal study with several measurement points covering three months during the COVID-19 pandemic, about 3500 randomly selected participants representative of the German population reported on their mental health (anxiety, depression, loneliness) and health behaviors (screen time, snack consumption, physical activity). RESULTS: Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and loneliness were highest shortly after the lockdown came into effect. Over time, the symptoms were stable or went down slightly, corresponding to patterns of habituation. Among people with higher vulnerability to poor mental health during the lockdown (e.g., women), the proportion with high levels of anxiety, depression, and loneliness was considerably larger. These groups also reported fewer health-promoting behaviors. More screen time, more snacking, and less physical activity were related to higher symptoms of anxiety, depression, and loneliness across all time points. Changes in health behaviors over time mostly did not predict changes in mental health symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health and engagement in protective health behaviors was lowest at the start of the lockdown. Health behaviors mostly returned to pre-lockdown levels within three months.

Probable changes in the way of life and the corresponding shifts in consumption patterns in favor of services will also contribute to modifications in the structure of GVCs.

The latter is not equivalent either to the return of previously exported production facilities or to the re-creation of the pre-globalization economic structure and cannot be regarded as a manifestation of de-globalization tendencies. The world realized the need to strengthen international cooperation and develop measures aimed at joint preparation and a coordinated response to possible new threats. Outbreaks of protectionism prove to be temporary. The long-term trend towards international trade liberalization will continue. ? 2022.","output":"Economic Globalization and Regional Integration in the Post-covid Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Self-report multiple choice questionnaires have been widely utilized to quantitatively measure ones personality and psychological constructs. Despite several strengths (e.g., brevity and utility), self-report multiple choice questionnaires have considerable limitations in nature. With the rise of machine learning (ML) and Natural language processing (NLP), researchers in the field of psychology are widely adopting NLP to assess psychological construct to predict human behaviors. However, there is a lack of connections between the work being performed in computer science and that of psychology due to small data sets and unvalidated modeling practices. AIMS: The current article introduces the study method and procedure of phase II which includes the interview questions for the five-factor model (FFM) of personality developed in phase I. This study aims to develop the interview (semi-structured) and open-ended questions for the FFM-based personality assessments, specifically designed with experts in the field of clinical and personality psychology (phase 1), and to collect the personality-related text data using the interview questions and self-report measures on personality and psychological distress (phase 2). The purpose of the study includes examining the relationship between natural language data obtained from the interview questions, measuring the FFM personality constructs, and psychological distress to demonstrate the validity of the natural language-based personality prediction. METHODS: Phase I (pilot) study was conducted to fifty-nine native Korean adults to acquire the personality-related text data from the interview (semi-structured) and open-ended questions based on the FFM of personality. The interview questions were revised and finalized with the feedback from the external expert committee, consisting of personality and clinical psychologists. Based on the established interview questions, a total of 300 Korean adults will be recruited using a convenience sampling method via online survey. The text data collected from interviews will be analyzed using the natural language processing. The results of the online survey including demographic data, depression, anxiety, and personality inventories will be analyzed together in the model to predict individuals FFM of personality and the level of psychological distress (phase 2).","output":"Predicting Personality and Psychological Distress Using Natural Language Processing: A Study Protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Graphical Abstract [Figure: see text]","output":"Immunometabolism and potential targets in severe COVID-19 peripheral immune responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To assess the risk of postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The CONCEPTION study was a cohort, multidisciplinary study conducted at Conception University Hospital, in France, from March 17th to May 11th, 2020. Our study included all adult patients who underwent minor surgery in one of the seven surgical departments of our hospital: urology, digestive, plastic, gynecological, otolaryngology, gynecology or maxillofacial surgery. Preoperative self-isolation, clinical assessment using a standardized questionnaire, physical examination, nasopharyngeal RT-PCR and chest CT scan performed the day before surgery were part of our active prevention strategy. The main outcome was the occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection within 21 days following surgery. The COVID-19 status of patients after discharge was updated during the postoperative consultation and to ensure the accuracy of data, all patients were contacted again by telephone. RESULTS: A total of 551 patients from six different specialized surgical Departments in our tertiary care center were enrolled in our study. More than 99% (546/551) of included patients underwent a complete preoperative Covid-19 screening including RT-PCR testing and chest CT scan upon admission to the Hospital. All RT-PCR tests were negative and in 12 cases (2.2%), preoperative chest CT scans detected pulmonary lesions consistent with the diagnosis criteria for COVID-19. No scheduled surgery was postponed. One patient (0.2%) developed a SARS-CoV-2 infection 20 days after a renal transplantation. No readmission or COVID-19 -related death within 30 days from surgery was recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Minor surgery remained safe in the COVID-19 Era, as long as all appropriate protective measures were implemented. These data could be useful to public Health Authorities in order to improve surgical patient flow during a pandemic.","output":"Is minor surgery safe during the COVID-19 pandemic?

The study involved 86 individuals: 30 patients with diagnosed COVID-19, 28 people with asymptomatic infection confirmed with IgG antibodiesthe IG(+) groupand 28 individuals without any (IgG, IgE) anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodiesthe IG(?) group. In the COVID-19 group, blood was drawn four times: (1) on day 0/1 after admission to hospital (C1 group), (2) 7 days later (C7 group), (3) 14 days later (C14 group), and (4) 28 days later (C28 group). In the IG(?) and IG(+) groups, blood was drawn once. There were no significant differences in creatinine, Cys C, and uric acid between any of the analyzed groups. NGAL levels were significantly higher in IG(+) and at all time-points in the COVID-19 groups than in controls. A similar observation was made for renalase at the C7, C14, and C28 time-points. Plasma renalase, NGAL, and CysC are unrelated to kidney function in non-critically ill COVID-19 patients and those with asymptomatic infection. Renalase and NGAL are most likely related to the activation of the immune system rather than kidney function. Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a rise in plasma NGAL levels similar to those observed in symptomatic COVID-19 patients.

OBJECTIVE: To provide a nationwide analysis on hospitalized PD patients in Germany and evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using an administrative claims database covering 1468 hospitals and 5,210,432 patient hospitalizations including a total of 30,872 COVID-19+ cases between January 16 and May 15, 2020. RESULTS: Compared to 2019, hospitalizations for PD transiently decreased by up to 72.7% in 2020. COVID-19 frequency was significantly higher in the population of 64,434 PD patients (693 being COVID-19+ ) than in non-PD patients (1.1% vs. 0.6%, P < 0.001), especially in subjects with advanced age (&#8805; 65 years). Regarding established COVID-19 risk comorbidities, COVID-19+ inpatients with PD showed higher incidences than non-PD COVID-19+ subjects, particularly hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Advanced age and male sex were significantly more frequent in COVID-19+ than in COVID-19- PD patients.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional research study was conducted from October to November 2020 with the use of a web-based questionnaire consisting of 3 sections. The 1st section focused on demographic data. The 2nd section evaluated dentistry students' opinions regarding distance education during the pandemic; it comprised 8 multiple-choice questions and 1 open-ended question. The 3rd section referred to the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), which is intended to assess the stress levels.

RESULTS: The sample consisted of 919 dentistry students, reflecting a response rate of 84%. Of the total sample, 81.6% of the participants were studying at state universities and more than half were female. These students' perceived stress levels were significantly increased due to the following factors: education at a state school; insufficient technical opportunities at home/dormitory facilities; decreased support from the academic staff of the universities during distance education; and a low level of knowledge of online document usage (p < 0.05). The evaluation of the responses to the open-ended question indicated that the difficulties encountered by highly stressed students during distance education were mostly adaptationrelated (p = 0.011).

Hippocampal volume was measured using Freesurfer, and the anxiety was evaluated as the rate of change in the GAD score: (follow\\\\up C baseline)/time difference. Then, the effect of hippocampal volume on the rate of change in the anxiety or knowledge on COVID19 was evaluated based on a mediation analysis with CDRSOB as a mediator, 2000 bootstrapping, and age, sex, education, and APOEe4 as covariates. RESULT: The CI group showed significantly less knowledge of COVID19, or less anxiety change compared to the CN group, while hippocampal volume showed a significant association with knowledge of COVID19 or the rate of change in anxiety. Upon further examination, we revealed that the effect of hippocampal volume on COVID19 knowledge or the rate of change in anxiety was significantly mediated by cognitive health, indicated by CDRSOB (Figure 1). CONCLUSION: Our finding highlights the poorer knowledge of COVID19 and related risks in individuals with cognitive/memory impairments; the CDRSOB, indicative of cognitive health, significantly mediated the effect of hippocampal volume on the rate of change in anxiety or knowledge on COVID19 in our cohort. This study urges for a more effective strategy and policy about informing and educating the individual with cognitive/memory impairment on COVID19 and related risks.","output":"Cognitive health mediates the effect of hippocampal volume on COVID\\\\19?related knowledge or anxiety change during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has reached 28 million cases worldwide in eight months. The serological detection of antibodies against the virus will play a pivotal role in complementing molecular tests to improve diagnostic accuracy, contact tracing, vaccine efficacy testing and seroprevalence surveillance. Here, we aimed first to evaluate a lateral flow assay ability to identify specific IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and second, to report the seroprevalence of these antibodies among health care workers and healthy volunteer blood donors in Panama. We recruited study participants between April 30th and July 7th, 2020. For the test validation and performance evaluation, we analyzed serum samples from participants with clinical symptoms and confirmed positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, participants with other confirmed infectious diseases, and a set of pre-pandemic serum samples. We used two by two table analysis to determine the test sensitivity and specificity as well as the kappa agreement value with a 95% confidence interval. Then, we used the lateral flow assay to determine seroprevalence among serum samples from COVID-19 patients, potentially exposed health care workers, and healthy volunteer donors. Our results show this assay reached a positive percent agreement of 97.2% (95% CI 84.2-100.0%) for detecting both IgM and IgG. The assay showed a kappa of 0.898 (95%CI 0.811- 0.985) and 0.918 (95% CI 0.839-0.997) for IgM and IgG, respectively. The evaluation of serum samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients indicates a correlation between test sensitivity and the number of days since symptom onset; the highest positive percent agreement (87% (95% CI 67.0-96.3%)) was observed at []15 days post-symptom onset. We found an overall antibody seroprevalence of 11.6% (95% CI 8.5-15.8%) among both health care workers and healthy blood donors. Our findings suggest this lateral flow assay could contribute significantly to implementing seroprevalence testing in locations with active community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Performance of a point of care test for detecting IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and seroprevalence in blood donors and health care workers in Panama"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: LGBTQ2S youth are overrepresented among youth experiencing homelessness and experience significantly higher rates of mental health issues compared to heterosexual and cisgender youth. COVID-19 related challenges for LGBTQ2S youth experiencing homelessness remain unknown. To address this gap, this study aimed to understand the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on LGBTQ2S youth at risk of, and experiencing, homelessness in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada and surrounding areas. METHODS: Utilizing a mixed-methods convergent parallel design, LGBTQ2S youth experiencing homelessness were recruited to participate in virtual surveys and in-depth one-on-one interviews. Surveys included standardized measures and were administered to measure mental health outcomes and collect information on demographic characteristics, and health service use. Survey data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and statistical tests for difference of proportions. Interviews were analyzed using an iterative thematic content approach. RESULTS: Sixty-one youth completed surveys and 20 youth participated in one-on-one interviews. Quantitative and qualitative data showed that youth have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in various ways, including experiencing poor mental health, such as suicidality, depression, anxiety, and increased substance use, and lack of access to health and social support services.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study from a total of 13,138 inpatients with COVID-19 in Hubei, China, and Milan, Italy. Among them, 9,810 patients with 2 CBC records from Hubei were assigned to the training cohort. CBC parameters were analyzed as potential predictors for all-cause mortality and were selected by the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). FINDINGS: Five risk factors were derived to construct a composite score (PAWNN score) using the Cox regression model, including platelet counts, age, white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio. The PAWNN score showed good accuracy for predicting mortality in 10-fold cross-validation (AUROCs 0.92C0.93) and subsets with different quartile intervals of follow-up and preexisting diseases. The performance of the score was further validated in 2,949 patients with only 1 CBC record from the Hubei cohort (AUROC 0.97) and 227 patients from the Italian cohort (AUROC 0.80). The latent Markov model (LMM) demonstrated that the PAWNN score has good prediction power for transition probabilities between different latent conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The PAWNN score is a simple and accurate risk assessment tool that can predict the mortality for COVID-19 patients during their entire hospitalization. This tool can assist clinicians in prioritizing medical treatment of COVID-19 patients.

Thus, they might constitute meaningful biomarkers in longitudinal and interventional studies on eating behavior and body weight control. However, little is known about the physiological levels of GIHs, their intra-individual stability over time, and their interaction with other metabolic and lifestyle-related parameters. Therefore, the aim of this pilot study is to investigate the intra-individual stability of GIHs in normal-weight adults over time. Methods: Plasma concentrations of ghrelin, leptin, GLP-1 (glucagon-like-peptide), and PP (pancreatic polypeptide) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 17 normal-weight, healthy adults in a longitudinal design at baseline and at follow-up six months later. The reliability of the measurements was estimated using intra-class correlation (ICC). In a second step, we considered the stability of GIH levels after controlling for changes in blood glucose and hemoglobin A1 (HbA1c) as well as self-reported physical activity and dietary habits. Results: We found excellent reliability for ghrelin, good reliability for GLP1 and PP, and moderate reliability for leptin. After considering glucose, HbA1c, physical activity, and dietary habits as co-variates, the reliability of ghrelin, GLP1, and PP did not change significantly; the reliability of leptin changed to poor reliability. Conclusions: The GIHs ghrelin, GLP1, and PP demonstrated good to excellent testCretest reliability in healthy individuals, a finding that was not modified after adjusting for glucose control, physical activity, or dietary habits. Leptin showed only moderate to poor reliability, which might be linked to weight fluctuations, albeit small, between baseline and follow-up assessment in our study sample. Together, these findings support that ghrelin, GLP1, and PP might be further examined as biomarkers in studies on weight control, with GLP1 and PP serving as anorexic markers and ghrelin as an orexigenic marker. Additional reliability studies in obese individuals are necessary to verify or refute our findings for this cohort.","output":"Gastrointestinal Hormones in Healthy Adults: Reliability of Repeated Assessments and Interrelations with Eating Habits and Physical Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), is currently a global pandemic with nearly two million deaths to date. Though a number of vaccines have recently been approved against the virus, availability remains a big challenge, and also acceptance by most people has become a big debate. This review discusses possible/ proposed natural product remedies and some major conventional treatment options used to manage the infection and, safety concerns on the use of unproven or unapproved health products against COVID-19. An extensive literature review indicated that the influx of unproven and unapproved health products in the global market are on the rise, leading to various forms of self- medication. To this effect, there have been warnings by the United States Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organisation against the use of such products. Conventional drugs such as remdesivir, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and dexamethasone are the major proposed drugs that are currently undergoing clinical trials for the management of this disease. Efforts are being made globally in the search for possible therapeutics which may be the best way to eradicating this disease. Some countries have approved the use of natural products in the management of COVID-19, despite little or no clinical evidence on their efficacy and safety. Natural products may hold a great potential in the fight against COVID-19 but without detailed clinical trials, their potency against the virus and their safe use cannot be established. To attain this goal, extensive research followed by clinical studies are needed.

We conducted this scoping review to outline a roadmap toward cervical cancer elimination in LMICs and highlight evidence-based interventions and research priorities to accelerate cervical cancer elimination. We reviewed and synthesized literature from 2010 to 2020 on primary and secondary cervical cancer prevention strategies. In addition, we conducted expert interviews with gynecologic and infectious disease providers, researchers, and LMIC health officials. Using these data, we developed a logic model to summarize the current state of science and identified evidence gaps and priority research questions for each prevention strategy. The logic model for cervical cancer elimination maps the needs for improved collaboration between policy makers, production and supply, healthcare systems, providers, health workers, and communities. The model articulates responsibilities for stakeholders and visualizes processes to increase access to and coverage of prevention methods. We discuss the challenges of contextual factors and highlight innovation needs. Effective prevention methods include HPV vaccination, screening using visual inspection and HPV testing, and thermocoagulation. However, vaccine coverage remains low in LMICs. New strategies, including single-dose vaccination could enhance impact. Loss to follow-up and treatment delays could be addressed by improved same-day screen-and-treat technologies.

In this research, by employing full atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the interactions of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 with phosphorene and graphene nanosheets were analyzed to investigate their sensing ability against this protein. Based on the obtained results, the RBD interactions with the surface of graphene and phosphorene nanosheets do not have important effects on the folding properties of the RBD but this protein has unique dynamical behavior against each nanostructure. In the presence of graphene and phosphorene, the RBD has lower stability because due to the strong interactions between RBD and these nanostructures. This protein spreads on the surface and has lower structural compaction, but in comparison with graphene, RBD shows greater stability on the surface of the phosphorene nanosheet. Moreover, RBD forms a more stable complex with phosphorene nanosheet in comparison with graphene due to greater electrostatic and van der Waals interactions. The calculated Gibbs binding energy for the RBD complexation process with phosphorene and graphene are ?200.37 and ?83.65 kcal mol(?1), respectively confirming that phosphorene has higher affinity and sensitivity against this protein than graphene.

Structural equation modeling examined two main hypotheses cross-sectionally and over time: 1) if IS mediated associations between STSB and cannabis use frequency, and 2) if STSB mediated associations between IS and cannabis use frequency. Results: Results demonstrated significant partial mediation effects for both hypotheses. For example, indirect effects indicated that IS mediated the association between STSB and cannabis use both cross sectionally (95% CI: 0.021, 0.029) and longitudinally (95% CI: 0.006, 0.010). STSB also mediated associations between IS and cannabis use cross sectionally (95% CI: 0.015, 0.023) and longitudinally (95% CI: 0.010, 0.014). This study demonstrated that the associations between STSB, internalizing symptoms and cannabis use are complex, involving mediation in both directions.Discussion: These findings can be used to inform public health initiatives that aim to take a comprehensive approach to addressing negative health behaviors and outcomes, as it is clear that the multi-directional relationships between STSB and mental health may in-turn impact other health behaviors.

We report here the role of -glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), a constitutively expressed secretory enzyme of H. pylori, in potentiating VacA-dependent vacuolation formation in H. pylori-infected AGS and primary gastric cells. The enhancement is brought about by GGT hydrolysing glutamine present in the extracellular medium, thereby releasing ammonia which accentuates the VacA-induced vacuolation. The events of vacuolation in H. pylori wild type (WT)- and ggt-infected AGS cells were first captured and visualized by real-time phase-contrast microscopy where WT was observed to induce more vacuoles than ggt. By using semi-quantitative neutral red uptake assay, we next showed that ggt induced significantly less vacuolation in AGS and primary gastric epithelial cells as compared to the parental strain (P<0.05) indicating that GGT potentiates the vacuolating effect of VacA. Notably, vacuolation induced by WT was significantly reduced in the absence of GGT substrate, glutamine (P<0.05) or in the presence of a competitive GGT inhibitor, serine-borate complex. Furthermore, the vacuolating ability of ggt was markedly restored when co-incubated with purified recombinant GGT (rGGT), although rGGT itself did not induce vacuolation independently. Similarly, the addition of exogenous ammonium chloride as a source of ammonia also rescued the ability of ggt to induce vacuolation. Additionally, we also show that monoclonal antibodies against GGT effectively inhibited GGT activity and successfully suppressed H. pylori-induced vacuolation. Collectively, our results clearly demonstrate that generation of ammonia by GGT through glutamine hydrolysis is responsible for enhancing VacA-dependent vacuolation. Our findings provide a new perspective on GGT as an important virulence factor and a promising target in the management of H. pylori-associated gastric diseases.","output":"Instrumental Role of Helicobacter pylori -Glutamyl Transpeptidase in VacA-Dependent Vacuolation in Gastric Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Due to the progressive nature of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), hindering on health care access during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic may lead to delayed diagnosis and referral to fetal surgery centers, which may have repercussions on outcomes.

METHODS: A prospective single-center controlled open-label 2-arm randomized trial was conducted in a medical intensive care unit (ICU) from February 2018 to February 2019. Patients undergoing central venous catheterization were randomized to listening to music or not during the procedure. Patients randomized to music listened to the Music Care application via headphones. The primary outcome was the change in anxiety assessed on a 100-mm Visual Analogue Scale between the beginning and end of the catheterization procedure. Secondary outcomes included postprocedural pain. RESULTS: We included 37 patients in the musical intervention group and 35 in the standard care group. The primary reasons for intensive care unit admission were the need for a central catheter for chemotherapy for hematologic malignancy and sepsis and/or septic shock in both groups. Postprocedural anxiety and pain assessments were missing in 1 (2.7%) and 4 (11.4%) patients in the intervention and standard care groups. We found no between-group difference in change in anxiety score: median -1 (interquartile range, -3 to 0) vs 0 (-3 to 0) in the musical intervention and standard care groups (median difference, -1 [-2 to 0]) (P = .24).

Thus, influenza vaccine is recommended for Hajj pilgrims but data on its effectiveness from a large sample is unavailable. This analysis aims to assess the effectiveness of trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (TIV) among Hajj pilgrims. Patients and methods: A 'test-negative' case-control analysis using data from individual studies was conducted. Included studies involved participants from Saudi Arabia, India, Australia and the United Kingdom who attended Hajj in Makkah, Saudi Arabia in different years between 2005 and 2015. Pilgrims who developed symptoms of respiratory infection during Hajj were included in these studies. Participants' vaccination histories were recorded and respiratory samples were collected to test for influenza by PCR. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated after adjusting for potential confounders. Results: A total of 1,569 pilgrims were included in this analysis. Influenza vaccine uptake was 52.2% and the prevalence of influenza was 8.2%. The estimated overall VE was 43.4% (95% CI 11.4% to 63.9%, P= 0.01).

Licorice, not only a food additive, but also a common traditional Chinese herbal medicine, which has several pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammation, detoxification, antibacterial, antitussive, and immunomodulatory effects, especially in respiratory diseases. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, glycyrrhizin, glycyrrhizin diamine and glycyrrhizin extract have been widely studied and used in COVID-19 clinical trials. Therefore, it is a very interesting topic to explore the material basis, pharmacological characteristics and molecular mechanism of licorice in adjuvant treatment of COVID-19. In this paper, the material basis of licorice for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is deeply analyzed, and there are significant differences among different components in different pharmacological mechanisms. Glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acid inhibit the synthesis of inflammatory factors and inflammatory mediators by blocking the binding of ACE 2 to virus spike protein, and exert antiviral and antibacterial effects. Immune cells are stimulated by multiple targets and pathways to interfere with the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Liquiritin can prevent and cure COVID-19 by simulating type I interferon. It is suggested that licorice can exert its therapeutic advantage through multi-components and multi-targets. To sum up, licorice has the potential to adjuvant prevent and treat COVID-19. It not only plays a significant role in anti-inflammation and anti-ACE-2, but also significantly improves the clinical symptoms of fever, dry cough and shortness of breath, suggesting that licorice is expected to be a candidate drug for adjuvant treatment of patients with early / mild COVID-19.","output":"Traditional Uses, Pharmacological Effects, and Molecular Mechanisms of Licorice in Potential Therapy of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence proposed Janus-associated kinase (JAK) inhibitors as therapeutic targets warranting rapid investigation. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, for coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multicenter, single-blind, randomized controlled phase II trial involving patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ruxolitinib plus standard-of-care treatment (22 patients) or placebo based on standard-of-care treatment (21 patients). After exclusion of 2 patients (1 ineligible, 1 consent withdrawn) from the ruxolitinib group, 20 patients in the intervention group and 21 patients in the control group were included in the study. Treatment with ruxolitinib plus standard-of-care was not associated with significantly accelerated clinical improvement in severe patients with coronavirus disease 2019, although ruxolitinib recipients had a numerically faster clinical improvement. Eighteen (90%) patients from the ruxolitinib group showed computed tomography improvement at day 14 compared with 13 (61.9%) patients from the control group (P = .0495). Three patients in the control group died of respiratory failure, with 14.3% overall mortality at day 28; no patients died in the ruxolitinib group. Ruxolitinib was well tolerated with low toxicities and no new safety signals. Levels of 7 cytokines were significantly decreased in the ruxolitinib group in comparison to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Although no statistical difference was observed, ruxolitinib recipients had a numerically faster clinical improvement.

We studied the safety of hydroxychloroquine, alone and in combination with azithromycin, to determine the risk associated with its use in routine care in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: In this multinational, retrospective study, new user cohort studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis aged 18 years or older and initiating hydroxychloroquine were compared with those initiating sulfasalazine and followed up over 30 days, with 16 severe adverse events studied. Self-controlled case series were done to further establish safety in wider populations, and included all users of hydroxychloroquine regardless of rheumatoid arthritis status or indication. Separately, severe adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (compared with hydroxychloroquine plus amoxicillin) were studied. Data comprised 14 sources of claims data or electronic medical records from Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the USA. Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding. Cox models were fitted to estimate calibrated hazard ratios (HRs) according to drug use. Estimates were pooled where the I 2 value was less than 04. Findings: The study included 956a??374 users of hydroxychloroquine, 310a??350 users of sulfasalazine, 323a??122 users of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, and 351a??956 users of hydroxychloroquine plus amoxicillin. No excess risk of severe adverse events was identified when 30-day hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine use were compared. Self-controlled case series confirmed these findings. However, long-term use of hydroxychloroquine appeared to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality (calibrated HR 165 [95% CI 112-244]). Addition of azithromycin appeared to be associated with an increased risk of 30-day cardiovascular mortality (calibrated HR 219 [95% CI 122-395]), chest pain or angina (115 [105-126]), and heart failure (122 [102-145]). Interpretation: Hydroxychloroquine treatment appears to have no increased risk in the short term among patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but in the long term it appears to be associated with excess cardiovascular mortality. The addition of azithromycin increases the risk of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality even in the short term. We call for careful consideration of the benefit-risk trade-off when counselling those on hydroxychloroquine treatment.

Thus, a component of JMML is associated with a hyperinflammatory state and abundant innate immune cells such as neutrophils and monocytes.

We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and associated carceral risk factors among incarcerated adult men in Quebec, Canada. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study in 2021 in three provincial prisons, representing 45% of Quebecs incarcerated male provincial population. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 antibody seropositivity (Roche Elecsys? serology test). Participants completed self-administered questionnaires on sociodemographic, clinical, and carceral characteristics. The association of carceral variables with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was examined using Poisson regression models with robust standard errors. Crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. RESULTS: Between January 19 and September 15, 2021, 246 of 1,100 (22%) recruited individuals tested positive across three prisons (range 15C27%). Seropositivity increased with time spent in prison since March 2020 (aPR 2.17, 95%CI 1.53C3.07 for all vs. little time), employment during incarceration (aPR 1.64, 95%CI 1.28C2.11 vs. not), shared meal consumption during incarceration (with cellmates: aPR 1.46, 95%CI 1.08C1.97 vs. alone; with sector: aPR 1.34, 95%CI 1.03C1.74 vs. alone), and incarceration post-prison outbreak (aPR 2.32, 95% CI 1.69C3.18 vs. pre-outbreak).

However, sensitive and objective markers of these symptoms are still missing. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the association between automatically extracted speech features and NPS in patients with mild neurocognitive disorders. METHODS: Speech of 141 patients aged 65 or older with neurocognitive disorder was recorded while performing two short narrative speech tasks. NPS were assessed by the neuropsychiatric inventory. Paralinguistic markers relating to prosodic, formant, source, and temporal qualities of speech were automatically extracted, correlated with NPS. Machine learning experiments were carried out to validate the diagnostic power of extracted markers. RESULTS: Different speech variables are associated with specific NPS; apathy correlates with temporal aspects, and anxiety with voice qualityand this was mostly consistent between male and female after correction for cognitive impairment. Machine learning regressors are able to extract information from speech features and perform above baseline in predicting anxiety, apathy, and depression scores. CONCLUSIONS: Different NPS seem to be characterized by distinct speech features, which are easily extractable automatically from short vocal tasks. These findings support the use of speech analysis for detecting subtypes of NPS in patients with cognitive impairment.

Firstly, the structures and bonding states of silverCtetrylene complexes (NHECAg) and bis-silverCtetrylene complexes (NHECAg-bis) were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) at the BP86 level with the def2-SVP and def2-TZVPP basis sets. Secondly, the inhibitory capabilities of the carbene complexes (NHCCAg and NHCCAg-bis) and the two potential drugs (ribavirin and remdesivir) on human-protein ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 protease PDB6LU7 were evaluated using molecular docking simulation. The carbene ligand NHC bonds in a head-on configuration with AgCl and (AgCl)(2), whereas, the other NHE (E = Si and Ge) tetrylene ligands bond in a side-on mode to the metal fragments. The bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the NHECAg bond in the complex families follows the order of NHCCAg > NHSiCAg > NHGeCAg and NHSiCAg-bis > NHGeCAg-bis > NHCCAg-bis. The natural bond orbital analysis implies that the [NHE(Ph)AgCl] and [(NHE(Ph))(2)(AgCl)(2)] donations are derived mainly from the - and -contributions of the ligands.

Here, we established novel in silico approaches and applied to SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). First, we identified six potential allosteric modulators (SANC00302, SANC00303, SANC00467, SANC00468, SANC00469, SANC00630) from the South African Natural Compounds Database (SANCDB) bound to the allosteric pocket of Mpro that we determined in our previous work. We also checked the stability of these compounds against Mpro of laboratory strain HCoV-OC43 and identified differences due to residue changes between the two proteins. Next, we focused on understanding the allosteric effects of these modulators on each protomer of the reference Mpro protein, while incorporating the symmetry problem in the functional homodimer. In general, asymmetric behavior of multimeric proteins is not commonly considered in computational analysis. We introduced a novel combinatorial approach and dynamic residue network (DRN) analysis algorithms to examine patterns of change and conservation of critical nodes, according to five independent criteria of network centrality (betweenness centrality (BC), closeness centrality (CC), degree centrality (DC), eigencentrality (EC) and katz centrality (KC)). The relationships and effectiveness of each metric in characterizing allosteric behavior were also investigated. We observed highly conserved network hubs for each averaged DRN metric on the basis of their existence in both protomers in the absence and presence of all ligands, and we called them persistent hubs (residues 17, 111, 112 and 128 for averaged BC;6, 7, 113, 114, 115, 124, 125, 126, 127 and 128 for averaged CC;36, 91, 146, 150 and 206 for averaged DC;7, 115 and 125 for EC;36, 125 and 146 for KC). We also detected ligand specific signal changes some of which were in or around functional residues (i.e. chameleon switch PHE140). Using EC persistent hubs and ligand introduced hubs we identified a residue communication path between allosteric binding site and catalytic site. Finally, we examined the effects of the mutations on the behavior of the protein in the presence of selected potential allosteric modulators and investigated the ligand stability. The hit compounds showed various levels of stability in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro mutations, being most stable in A173V, N274D and R279C, and least stable in R60C, N151D V157I, C160S and A255V. SANC00468 was the most stable compound in the 43 mutant protein systems. We further used DRN metric analysis to define cold spots as being those regions that are least impacted, or not impacted, by mutations. One crucial outcome of this study was to show that EC centrality hubs form an allosteric communication path between the allosteric ligand binding site to the active site going through the interface residues of Domain I and II;and this path was either weakened or lost in the presence of some of the mutations. Overall, the results of this study revealed crucial aspects that need to be considered in drug discovery in COVID-19 specifically and in general for rational computational drug design purposes.","output":"Novel dynamic residue network analysis approaches to study homodimeric allosteric modulation in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and in its evolutionary mutations (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 was first reported in China and quickly spread throughout the world.

Stage (Stage IV vs Stage I HR = 3.434, P < 0.001) and risk score (HR = 1.214, P < 0.001) were sorted as independent prognostic risk factors based on multivariate cox regression. ROC curve validated that risk score was preferable to predict survival of CC patients than other risk factors. Additionally, we found some of these ten predictor DEGs were correlated significantly in statistic with tumor grade or stage, clinical T stage, clinical N stage, pathology or risk score (all P < 0.05). Part of immune cells and immune functions showed a lower activity in high risk group than low risk group which is stratified by median risk score. CONCLUSION: Our discovery showed that many RNA binding proteins involved in the progress of cervical cancer, which could probably serve as prognostic biomarkers and accelerate the discovery of treatment targets for CC patients.

In the present study, we aimed to screen microRNA (miRNA) markers in serum exosomes for differential diagnosis of high-grade glioma and intracranial lymphoma using high-throughput sequencing technology. Methods Patients with intracranial lymphoma or high-grade glioma and healthy controls were included in this study (training cohort (n = 10) and validation cohort: intracranial lymphoma (n = 10), high-grade glioma (n = 32), and healthy controls (n = 20)). After RNA was extracted from serum exosomes, the high-throughput sequencing was used to determine the expression profiles of serum exosomal miRNAs and screen the differentially expressed miRNAs. RT-qPCR was used to verify the expressions of the selected miRNAs. The differences of miRNA expressions between groups were assessed by the Kruskal-Wallis test. The diagnostic value was analyzed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results High-throughput sequencing demonstrated that 170 miRNAs, including 109 upregulated ones and 61 downregulated ones, were differentially expressed in serum exosomes between the patients with intracranial lymphoma and high-grade glioma. Compared with the healthy controls, the number of differential serum exosomal miRNAs in the high-grade glioma group and intracranial lymphoma group was 130 and 173, respectively. RT-qPCR proved that both miR-766-5p and miR-376b-5p were significantly downregulated in high-grade glioma and intracranial lymphoma patients compared with the healthy controls (all p < 0.001), and the expression of serum exosomal miR-766-5p in the intracranial lymphoma group was lower compared with the high-grade glioma group (p < 0.05). The areas under ROC curve (AUCs) of serum exosomal miR-766-5p and miR-376b-5p for the diagnosis of glioma were 0.8883 (p < 0.001) and 0.7688 (p = 0.001), respectively, and they were 0.9271 (p < 0.001) and 0.8542 (p < 0.001), respectively, for the diagnosis of intracranial lymphoma. Moreover, the AUC value of serum exosomal miR-766-5p for the differential diagnosis of glioma and intracranial lymphoma was 0.7201 (p = 0.026). Conclusions miR-766-5p and miR-376b-5p in serum exosomes might be used as auxiliary diagnostic indicators for high-grade glioma and intracranial lymphoma, and miR-766-5p might be used as a differential diagnostic marker for both diseases.","output":"High-Throughput Sequencing-Based Identification of Serum Exosomal Differential miRNAs in High-Grade Glioma and Intracranial Lymphoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This dissertation project identifies the anti-colonial and anti-racist traditions that Black and Brown Angelenos have created, specifically the artworks expressing cultural pride and solidarity with each other While other scholars have looked at Black and Latina/o/x Los Angeles together, few have looked at the trends and traditions within visual culture and art history This particular intervention is historical, but also builds from the contemporary moment we live in, where underpaid school teachers have been striking en masse, where women are proclaiming #TimesUp, where Black Lives Matter is ushering perhaps the largest social movement in U S history, and still, the movement continues to grow all over the world Furthermore, this dissertation has been informed by the COVID-19 crisis, which deeply and disproportionately impacts housing, employment, health outcomes and many other factors for people of color, especially Native Peoples, African Americans and Latinx folks in the U S As a way to reframe this political moment of pandemics, social injustice, and consciousness raising, I freedom dream through Afro-Latinx Futurism, a concept I offer that empowers Black, Latinx and Afro-Latinx people to center pleasure, rest, and joy as a visual practice in the arts and an important expression of liberation Together, this project will forge a new history of the past by offering analysis of artworks, but also, moments when people lived, fought and created together In some cases, I will highlight works of art that were not exactly made together, or directly in conversation with the other, but still work within a constellation of struggle against US imperialism and white supremacy I have conducted participatory observation fieldwork, interviews, investigated archives, made maps via Emoji Mapping and Social Explorer;I offer visual and historical analysis to demonstrate the social realities that Black and Brown creative communities have forged for the past 237 years in what is now Los Angeles (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Afro-Latinx futurism: A history of Black and brown arts from 1781-2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"All pandemics are local;so learning about the impacts of pandemics on public health and related societal issues at granular levels is of great interest.

Integration of this data with viral ChIRP-MS data from three other positive-sense RNA viruses defined pan-viral and SARS-CoV-2-specific host interactions. Functional interrogation of these factors with a genome-wide CRISPR screen revealed that the vast majority of viral RNA-binding proteins protect the host from virus-induced cell death, and we identified known and novel anti-viral proteins that regulate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. Finally, our RNA-centric approach demonstrated a physical connection between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and host mitochondria, which we validated with functional and electron microscopy data, providing new insights into a more general virus-specific protein logic for mitochondrial interactions.

Appendectomy, the surgical removal of the appendix, is performed primarily for acute appendicitis. Patients who undergo appendectomy for complicated appendicitis, defined as gangrenous or perforated appendicitis, are more likely to suffer postoperative complications. The routine use of abdominal drainage to reduce postoperative complications after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis is controversial. OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety and efficacy of abdominal drainage to prevent intraperitoneal abscess after appendectomy (irrespective of open or laparoscopic) for complicated appendicitis; to compare the effects of different types of surgical drains; and to evaluate the optimal time for drain removal. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, the World Health Organization International Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and three trials registers on 24 February 2020, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared abdominal drainage versus no drainage in people undergoing emergency open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. We also included RCTs that compared different types of drains and different schedules for drain removal in people undergoing appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently identified the trials for inclusion, collected the data, and assessed the risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess evidence certainty. We included intraperitoneal abscess as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were wound infection, morbidity, mortality, hospital stay, hospital costs, pain, and quality of life. MAIN RESULTS: Use of drain versus no drain We included six RCTs (521 participants) comparing abdominal drainage and no drainage in participants undergoing emergency open appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. The studies were conducted in North America, Asia, and Africa. The majority of participants had perforated appendicitis with local or general peritonitis. All participants received antibiotic regimens after open appendectomy. None of the trials was assessed as at low risk of bias. The evidence is very uncertain regarding the effects of abdominal drainage versus no drainage on intraperitoneal abscess at 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 3.21; 5 RCTs; 453 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or wound infection at 30 days (RR 2.01, 95% CI 0.88 to 4.56; 5 RCTs; 478 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were seven deaths in the drainage group (N = 183) compared to one in the no-drainage group (N = 180), equating to an increase in the risk of 30-day mortality from 0.6% to 2.7% (Peto odds ratio 4.88, 95% CI 1.18 to 20.09; 4 RCTs; 363 participants; low-certainty evidence). Abdominal drainage may increase 30-day overall complication rate (morbidity; RR 6.67, 95% CI 2.13 to 20.87; 1 RCT; 90 participants; low-certainty evidence) and hospital stay by 2.17 days (95% CI 1.76 to 2.58; 3 RCTs; 298 participants; low-certainty evidence) compared to no drainage. The outcomes hospital costs, pain, and quality of life were not reported in any of the included studies. There were no RCTs comparing the use of drain versus no drain in participants undergoing emergency laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. Open drain versus closed drain There were no RCTs comparing open drain versus closed drain for complicated appendicitis. Early versus late drain removal There were no RCTs comparing early versus late drain removal for complicated appendicitis. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The certainty of the currently available evidence is low to very low. The effect of abdominal drainage on the prevention of intraperitoneal abscess or wound infection after open appendectomy is uncertain for patients with complicated appendicitis. The increased rates for overall complication rate and hospital stay for the drainage group compared to the no-drainage group are based on low-certainty evidence. Consequently, there is no evidence for any clinical improvement with the use of abdominal drainage in patients undergoing open appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. The increased risk of mortality with drainage comes from eight deaths observed in just under 400 recruited participants. Larger studies are needed to more reliably determine the effects of drainage on morbidity and mortality outcomes.","output":"Abdominal drainage to prevent intra-peritoneal abscess after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents an optimization strategy based on mathematical programming to solve resource management problems regarding hospitalization of sick patients, considering emergency scenarios, such as those that can occur in a pandemic.

The empirical findings demonstrated that high unemployment rate, domestic capital formation, foreign direct investment, government spending on education and security are negatively affected by the growing level of insecurity and consequently retarded growth in the long and short run. Conversely, improved health services, equitable income distribution and productive use of public borrowing were positively correlated with security and, therefore, stimulated growth in the long and short run. Government revenue and inflation rate accelerated growth in the long run whereas their short-run effect was deleterious. The findings suggest that good governance, provision of a safe and secured environment for human capital development and businesses, improved access to social and economic services will curb violent tendencies, create jobs, reduce poverty, increase government revenue and engender long-term inclusive growth.","output":"Growth and Fiscal Effects of Insecurity on the Nigerian Economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to describe which substance use service (SUS) organizations and who within these organizations support the maintenance of policies targeted at improving substance use treatment services.

METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Europe PMC, ProQuest, and the Cochrane Central Database. The primary outcome was composite poor outcome composed of mortality and severity. The secondary outcomes were mortality and severity. RESULTS: A total of 34,390 patients from 12 studies were included in this meta-analysis.

Understanding clinician perspectives is vital for service transformation, as their views and experiences shed light on potential barriers to achieving good care, and how these might be overcome. In this study, we aimed to explore these views. Methods We used a qualitative interview design. A total of fifty participants from a range of professions across specialist and generic community mental health services across England who provide care to people with CEN took part in six focus groups and sixteen one-to-one interviews. We analysed the data using a thematic approach. Findings Main themes were: 1) Defining Best Practice, 2) Facilitators of Best Care, 3) Barriers to Best Care, 4) Systemic Challenges. Across these themes, staff highlighted in particular the need for care that was person-centred, relational, empathic, and trauma informed. However, major barriers to achieving this are stigmatising attitudes and behaviour towards people with CEN, especially in generic mental health services, lack of development of coherent service systems offering clear long-term pathways and ready access to high quality treatment, and lack of well-developed structures for staff training and support. Discussion Overall, the findings point towards clinician views as generally congruent with those of service users, reinforcing the need for priorities towards systemwide change to ensure that we can provide the best practice care for these individuals. Particularly prominent is the need to put in place system-wide training and support for clinicians working with CEN, encompassing generic as well as specialist services, and to challenge the stigma still experienced throughout the system.

The aim of this study is to evaluate differences in the patients referred to exercise stress testing in the context of COVID-19 pandemic and analyse the feasibility and results of these tests wearing a facemask. METHODS: We included all patients referred for an exercise test from 1 June to 30 September 2020 and compared them with the patients attended within the same period in 2019 before and after propensity score matching. All patients referred in 2020 wore a facemask. RESULTS: A total of 854 patients were included: 398 in the 2020 group and 456 in 2019. No significant differences in baseline characteristics of the patients were observed, with the exception of dyspnoea, which was nearly twice as high in 2020 as compared with 2019. Regarding the results of the tests, no differences were observed, with almost 80% of maximal tests, similar functional capacity and over a 20% of positive exercise tests in both groups. These results remained after propensity score matching. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has not changed the clinical profile of patients referred to exercise testing.

Countries around the world introduced severe social restrictions, and significant changes to health service provision in the first wave of the pandemic to suppress the spread of the virus and prioritize healthcare for those who contracted it. This study interviewed 48 hospital doctors who worked in Ireland during the first wave of the pandemic and investigated their conceptualizations of their own well-being during that time (MarchCMay 2020). Doctors were interviewed via Zoom? or telephone. Interview transcripts were analyzed using structured thematic analysis. Five composite narratives are presented which have been crafted to illustrate themes and experiences emerging from the data. This study found that despite the risks of contracting COVID-19, many doctors saw some improvements to their physical well-being in the first wave of the pandemic. However, most also experienced a decline in their mental well-being due to anxiety, emotional exhaustion, guilt, isolation and poor support. These findings shed light on doctor well-being during COVID-19, and the ways in which they have been affected by the pandemic, both professionally and personally.

The most prominent representatives of DNA catalysts (also known as DNA enzymes, deoxyribozymes, or DNAzymes) catalyze the site-specific cleavage of RNA substrates. Two distinct groups of RNA-cleaving DNA enzymes are the 10-23 and 8-17 enzymes. A typical RNA-cleaving DNA enzyme consists of a catalytic core and two short binding arms which form WatsonCCrick base pairs with the RNA targets. RNA cleavage is usually achieved with the assistance of metal ions such as Mg(2+), Ca(2+), Mn(2+), Pb(2+), or Zn(2+), but several chemically modified DNA enzymes can cleave RNA in the absence of divalent metal ions. A number of studies have shown the use of 10-23 DNA enzymes for modest downregulation of therapeutically relevant RNA targets in cultured cells and in whole mammals. Here we focus on mechanistic aspects of RNA-cleaving DNA enzymes and their potential to silence therapeutically appealing viral and bacterial gene targets.

Brynjolson addresses this question by focusing on the Oakland-based Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, a collective of artists and activists who produce interactive, online maps that visualize displacement, and are accompanied by oral histories. The organization mimics the networked aesthetics of sharing economy platforms, but repurposes their designs in order to critique their promises of collectivism and material impact on neighborhoods. The maps and stories produced by the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project have been used by community organizations to advocate for rent control and affordable housing, and in this way, the project suggests possibilities for art to work against displacementby using the tools of the sharing economy against itself.

METHODOLOGY A retrospective cohort study among HIV-infected patients at two intermediate hospitals. A decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was significant if it was 25% and included a change to a lower eGFR stage. New-onset RI was defined as an eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m2 . RESULTS 10 387 patients were included: 11.4% (n = 1182) experienced the decline in eGFR. Of these, 0.6% (n = 62) migrated to eGFR stages IV and V. The incidence was 4.5 (95% CI: 4.3-4.8) per 100 patient years. RI developed in 400 patients for an incidence rate of 2.4 (95% CI: 2.2-2.6) cases per 100 patient years. Risk factors with effect sizes >2.0, for decline-in-eGFR were baseline eGFR >60 (aHR = 15.6); hyperfiltration (aHR = 5.0); and pregnancy (aHR = 2.4); while for RI, they were hyperfiltration (aHR = 4.1) and pregnancy (aHR = 29). CONCLUSION The incidence of decline-in-eGFR was higher than in other sub-SSA countries, but not RI.

During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, routine SARS-CoV-2 testing in long-term care facilities in the Province of Salzburg and centralized hospitalization in the COVID-19 unit of the Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg (Austria) irrespective of symptoms was implemented. Baseline characteristics and the course of COVID-19 disease were assessed among hospitalized long-term care facility residents within the COVID-19 Registry of the Austrian Group Medical Tumor Therapy (AGMT; NCT04351529). Between the 24th of March and the 20th of April 2020, 50 COVID-19-positive residents were hospitalized. The median age was 84.5 years (range: 79-88) and the median number of comorbidities and baseline medication classes was 6 (IQR: 4-7) and 5 (IQR: 3-6), respectively. At admission, 31 residents (62%) were symptomatic, nine residents (18%) pre-symptomatic whereas ten residents (20%) remained asymptomatic. The 30-day mortality rate from hospitalization was 32% and significantly higher in symptomatic residents at admission when compared to asymptomatic residents including pre-symptomatic residents (48% [95% CI: 27-63%] versus 5% [95% CI: 0-15%], p=0.006).

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical relevance of induced sputum as an additional indicator for the current clinical discharge criteria of COVID-19 patients to prevent virus recurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty-one COVID-19 patients who met the national clinical discharge criteria were discharged from the hospital and tested daily for the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid in their pharyngeal swabs and every other day for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in their induced sputum. Once the patient's induced sputum was negative after two consecutive tests, testing was discontinued. RESULTS Among 21 discharged patients from COVID-19, the first pharyngeal swab and induced sputum tests for viral nucleic acid were positive in 3 (14.3%) and 8 (38.1%) patients respectively. Induced sputum was significantly more positive than pharyngeal swab (p < 0.05). In our cohort, all pharyngeal swabs became negative at day 7, and all induced sputa turned negative at day 11 after discharge. Interestingly, patients with negative pharyngeal swabs experienced viral relapse, whereas patients with negative induced sputum did not revert to positivity. CONCLUSIONS The detection rate of positive viral nucleic acid in induced sputum was high.

To provide insight on factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (VH), we conducted a national survey among healthcare workers, academics, and tertiary students, between 1 September 2021 and 31 December 2021. We fitted a logistic regression model to the data and examined factors associated with VH to support targeted health awareness campaigns to address public concerns and improve vaccination rates on par with global efforts. A total of 1525 respondents took part in the survey, composed of healthcare-workers (24.5%, 373/1525), academics (26.9%, 410/1525), and students (48.7%, 742/1525). Only 29% (446/1525) of the respondents were vaccinated at the time of this study.

Reasons for VH included: difficulty in the vaccination request/registration protocols (21.3%, 633/1079); bad feelings towards the vaccines due to negative social media reports/rumours (21.3%, 633/1079); personal ideology/religious beliefs against vaccination (16.7%, 495/1079); and poor confidence that preventive measures were enough to protect against COVID-19 (11%, 323/1079). Some health concerns that deterred unvaccinated respondents were: innate immunity issues (27.7%, 345/1079); allergic reaction concerns (24.6%, 307/1079); and blood clot problems in women (21.4%, 266/1079). In the multivariable model, location of respondents/geopolitical zones, level of education, testing for COVID-19, occupation/job description and religion were significantly associated with VH.

Less is known about how these delays have affected different segments of this population. Understanding the negative health consequences older adults face from delayed care will provide critical insights into the longer-term population health needs following the pandemic. METHODS: We used data from a COVID-19 substudy embedded in a nationally representative longitudinal study of older adults, the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project. Data were collected between September 14, 2020, and January 27, 2021. Two thousand six hundred seventy-two individuals responded to the survey. Using logistic and multinomial logistic regressions, we determined respondent-level characteristics associated with delayed medical care, experiencing a negative impact on physical health from delayed care, and with reporting worsening physical health during the pandemic. RESULTS: Nearly, one-third (32.8%) of older adults reported delayed medical care during the pandemic. Female sex, higher levels of education, greater concerns about the pandemic, and poorer self-rated physical health were associated with delayed medical care. Blacks and those who are 70 and older were less likely to report delayed care. Among those whose care was delayed, 76.5% reported having already recovered delayed care. Nearly one in five (17.6%) reported that delayed care negatively affected their health. Older adults with worse self-rated physical and mental health or who had not fully recovered delayed care were more likely to report perceived negative health impacts from the delay. Regardless of delayed medical care, 10.2% reported worse physical health during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: One-third of older adults experienced care delays during the pandemic. Despite high rates of care recovery, nearly one in five older adults who experienced delayed care reported being negatively affected. Strategies must be developed to reach these vulnerable patients to increase their healthcare utilization.","output":"Delayed medical care and its perceived health impact among US older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"GnRH-I and GnIH are the key neuropeptides that regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in mammals during aging. Polyamines are important aliphatic amines that are expressed in the brain and show variation with aging. The present study demonstrates evidence of variation in the level of expression of polyamines, GnRH-I and GnIH in the hypothalamus of female mice during aging. The study also suggests regulatory effects of polyamines over expression of the hypothalamic GnRH-I. The study shows a significant positive correlation between polyamines, its associated factors and GnRH-I along with significant negative correlation between polyamines, its associated factors and GnIH. This is the first study to report the effect of polyamines along with lactate or TNF- or both on GnRH-I expression in GT1-7 cell line. TNF- and lactate significantly decreased hypothalamic GnRH-I mRNA expression in GT1-7 cells when treated for 24 h. Polyamines (putrescine and agmatine) in contrast, significantly increased GnRH-I mRNA expression in GT1-7 cells when treated for 24 h. Also, polyamines increased GnRH-I mRNA expression when treated in presence of TNF- or lactate thereby suggesting its neuro-protective role. This study also found 3809 differentially expressed genes through RNA-seq done between the hypothalamic GT1-7 cells treated with putrescine only versus TNF- and putrescine. The present study suggests for the first time that putrescine treatment to TNF-primed GT1-7 cells upregulates GnRH-I expression via regulation of several pathways such as calcium ion pathway, estrogen signaling, clock genes as well as regulating other metabolic process like neuronal differentiation and neurulation.","output":"Expression of polyamines and its association with GnRH-I in the hypothalamus during aging in rodent model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prostate cancer (PRAD) is a major cause of cancer-related deaths. Current monotherapies show limited efficacy due to often rapidly emerging resistance. Combination therapies could provide an alternative solution to address this problem with enhanced therapeutic effect, reduced cytotoxicity, and delayed the appearance of drug resistance. However, it is prohibitively cost and labor-intensive for the experimental approaches to pick out synergistic combinations from the millions of possibilities. Thus, it is highly desired to explore other efficient strategies to assist experimental researches. Inspired by the challenge, we construct the transcriptomics-based and network-based prediction models to quickly screen the potential drug combination for Prostate cancer, and further assess their performance by in vitro assays. The transcriptomics-based method screens nine possible combinations. However, the network-based method gives discrepancies for at least three drug pairs. Further experimental results indicate the dose-dependent effects of the three docetaxel-containing combinations, and confirm the synergistic effects of the other six combinations predicted by the transcriptomics-based model. For the network-based predictions, in vitro tests give opposite results to the two combinations (i.e. mitoxantrone-cyproheptadine and cabazitaxel-cyproheptadine). Namely, the transcriptomics-based method outperforms the network-based one for the specific disease like Prostate cancer, which provide guideline for selection of the computational methods in the drug combination screening.

Due to their surface-activity, emulsifying properties, and foaming abilities, they can be applied in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. Enzymatic synthesis of glycolipids based on carbohydrates and free fatty acids or esters is often catalyzed using certain acyltransferases in reaction media of low water activity, e.g., organic solvents or notably Deep Eutectic Systems (DESs). Existing reports describing integrated processes for glycolipid production from renewables use many reaction steps, therefore this study aims at simplifying the procedure. By using microwave dielectric heating, DESs preparation was first accelerated considerably. A comparative study revealed a preparation time on average 16-fold faster than the conventional heating method in an incubator. Furthermore, lipids from robust oleaginous yeast biomass were successfully extracted up to 70% without using the pre-treatment method for cell disruption, limiting logically the energy input necessary for such process. Acidified DESs consisting of either xylitol or sorbitol and choline chloride mediated the one-pot process, allowing subsequent conversion of the lipids into mono-acylated palmitate, oleate, linoleate, and stearate sugar alcohol esters. Thus, we show strong evidence that addition of immobilized Candida antarctica Lipase B (Novozym 435(?)), in acidified DES mixture, enables a simplified and fast glycolipid synthesis using directly oleaginous yeast biomass.","output":"Microwave-Assisted One-Pot Lipid Extraction and Glycolipid Production from Oleaginous Yeast Saitozyma podzolica in Sugar Alcohol-Based Media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although pemphigus has recently been linked to psoriasis, the risk of emergence of pemphigus during the course of psoriasis is yet to be delineated.

Cytokine storm is an underlying condition that worsens clinical outcomes. As an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, tocilizumab is a promising treatment option for COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical predictors of mortality for critically ill COVID-19 patients receiving tocilizumab therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The retrospective cohort study was conducted in 4 centers' both wards and intensive care units between March 20 and May 20, 2020. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were consecutively drawn from medical records. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: In this study, 39 patients (28.2% female) were included, and the mortality rate was 25.6% (n = 10). There was statistically significant difference between survivor and non-survivor groups regarding age (53.0 (46.5-65.0) vs. 75.0 (68.25-81.25), respectively,P = .001), CALL score (8.0 (7.0-10.0) vs. 12.0 (9.75-13.0), P = .001), GRAM score (119.5 (99.5-142.0) vs. 155.0 (129.8-226.0), P = .004), and white blood cell count (k/mL) (5.6 (3.8-8.6) vs. 8.0 (7.6-9.3), P = .003). The patients who were on invasive mechanical ventilation at the time of tocilizumab administration had a higher mortality rate (100% vs. 25.9%, P < .001). Besides, arterial partial pressure of oxygen/ fraction of inspiratory oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio on day 7, but not on days 0, 1, and 3 of tocilizumab therapy, was associated with mortal- ity. C-reactive protein (mg/dL) tended to be lower in the survivor group; however, it was not statistically significant (68.4 (32.7-157.5) vs. 113.5 (77.7-219.0), P = .058).

The methodological quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Sensitivity and specificity were pooled. RESULTS: Sixteen studies (n = 3186 patients) were included. The risks of bias in all studies were moderate in general. Pooled sensitivity was 92% (95% CI = 86C96%), and two studies reported specificity (25% [95% CI = 22C30%] and 33% [95% CI = 23C44%], respectively). There was substantial heterogeneity according to Cochrans Q test (p < 0.01) and Higgins I(2) heterogeneity index (96% for sensitivity). After dividing the studies into two groups based on the study site, we found that the sensitivity of chest CT was great in Wuhan (the most affected city by the epidemic) and the sensitivity values were very close to each other (97%, 96%, and 99%, respectively). In the regions other than Wuhan, the sensitivity varied from 61 to 98%.

The characteristics of early CI (occurred within 72 h of admission) and late CI (occurred after 72 h of admission) and its association with mortality in COVID-19 patients is unknown. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed patients confirmed with COVID-19 in Union Hospital (Wuhan, China) from Jan 29th to Mar 15th, 2020. Clinical outcomes (discharge, or death) were monitored to April 15, 2020, the latest date of follow-up. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, as well as treatment and prognosis were collected and analyzed in patients with early, late CI and without CI. Results: A total of 196 COVID-19 patients were included for analysis. The median age was 65 years [interquartile range (IQR) 56C73 years], and 112 (57.1%) were male. Of the 196 COVID-19 patients, 49 (25.0%) patients had early and 20 (10.2%) patients had late CI, 56.6% developed Acute-Respiratory-Distress-Syndrome (ARDS) and 43 (21.9%) patients died. Patients with any CI were more likely to have developed ARDS (87.0 vs. 40.2%) and had a higher in-hospital mortality than those without (52.2 vs. 5.5%, P < 0.001). Among CI subtypes, a significantly higher risk of in-hospital death was found in patients with early CI with recurrence [19/49 patients, adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 7.184, 95% CI 1.472C35.071] and patients with late CI (adjusted OR = 5.019, 95% CI 1.125C22.388) compared to patients with early CI but no recurrence. Conclusions: CI can occur early on or late after, the initial 72 h of admission and is associated with ARDS and an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Both late CI and recurrent CI after the initial episode were associated with worse outcomes than patients with early CI alone.

Investigations on the influence of disordered residues/regions in stability and binding of spike protein with ACE2 help to understand the disease pathogenesis, which has not yet been studied. In this study, we have used molecular-dynamics simulations to characterize the structural changes in disordered regions of the spike protein that result from ACE2 binding. We observed that the disordered regions undergo disorder-to-order transition (DOT) upon binding with ACE2, and the DOT residues are located at functionally important regions of RBD. Although the RBD is having rigid structure, DOT residues make conformational rearrangements for the spike protein to attach with ACE2. The binding is strengthened via hydrophilic and aromatic amino acids mainly present in the DOTs. The positively correlated motions of the DOT residues with its nearby residues also explain the binding profile of RBD with ACE2, and the residues are observed to be contributing more favorable binding energies for the spike-ACE2 complex formation. This study emphasizes that intrinsically disordered residues in the RBD of spike protein may provide insights into its etiology and be useful for drug and vaccine discovery.","output":"Tackling Covid-19 using disordered-to-order transition of residues in the spike protein upon angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVETo provide drug material supp ly and emergency management reference for novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2infection in pharmacy staff in hospital.

Hence, we sought to describe the clinical characteristics of dialysis patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: We reviewed clinical outcomes, which consisted of clinical data extracted from the medical records of 695 registered dialysis patients at the Dialysis Center of Central Hospital of Wuhan from January 13th, 2020, to February 29th, 2020, and performed statistical analysis. According to the results, there were 447, 227 and 21 hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) and combined HD and PD (HD&PD) cases, respectively. RESULTS: During the outbreak of COVID-19, 36 dialysis patients were infected by SARS-CoV-2. Among those 36 patients, 32 (7.2%) were on HD, and 4 (1.8%) were on PD. When comparing SARS-CoV-2 infection between HD and PD, the relative risk was 4.07 (RR = 4.07, 95% CI 1.46-11.35). We noted a median age of 66 years during the observation period, and the number of male patients was 23 (63.9%). There were 15 fatal cases tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (13 cases on HD and 2 cases on PD). By comparing mortality in the same period of 2018, 2019 and 2020, the all-cause mortality of hemodialysis patients was significantly higher in 2020 (4.89%) than in either 2018 (2.55%) or 2019 (1.97%). There was no significant difference in mortality from all causes excluding COVID-19, during the same period among the 3-year period. However, during the COVID-19 outbreak, the mortality from all causes excluding COVID-19 was 2.73%, which was slightly higher than that from COVID-19 (2.16%).

However, endoscopic removal still may be possible using combined endoscopic and laparoscopic surgery (CELS). The CELS procedure allows for intra- and extraluminal manipulation of the bowel wall to facilitate polyp removal, thereby avoiding bowel resection. This study evaluated the authors' institutional experience with CELS in this patient population. METHODS Between August 2008 and October 2012, all patients referred to undergo surgery for a benign colon polyp were retrospectively reviewed for operative characteristics, pathology, and postoperative outcomes. Of 14 patients, five were considered candidates for CELS and were compared with nine patients who underwent resection. RESULTS The average patient age was similar between the two groups (CELS, 64.9 years vs. resection, 68.3 years). The mean polyp size was 2.3 cm in the CELS group and 2.9 cm in the resection group. In the CELS group, polyps were successfully removed in all cases. The mean operating room time was 159 min in the CELS group and 205 min in the resection group. The median hospital stay was 1 day in the CELS group and 5 days in the resection group. No complications occurred in the CELS group. Two patients in the resection group (22 %) experienced a wound infection. One patient had a postoperative ileus (11 %). Four patients in the CELS group had a benign adenoma. One patient had a benign frozen section evaluation, but the final pathology showed adenocarcinoma requiring a subsequent colectomy. In the resection group, six patients had a benign adenoma, and three patients had a T1N0 cancer. In the CELS group, repeat endoscopy was performed an average of 9.9 months after CELS. Two patients had a residual polyp, and two patients had new polyps in a different location. All were successfully removed. CONCLUSION For benign-appearing polyps not amenable to endoscopic techniques alone, CELS may be an alternative to formal bowel resection for carefully selected patients. The CELS procedure can be performed safely with minimal morbidity and with outcomes that compare favorably with those of formal colectomy.","output":"Combined endoscopic and laparoscopic surgery may be an alternative to bowel resection for the management of colon polyps not removable by standard colonoscopy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) has become an established standard of care in the management of surgical diseases of the spleen.

Thus, people prefer to live in single-family houses or detached houses where they have more free space in outside of the house. The aim of this study is to quantify and compare the environmental performance of a single-family house and multi-storey apartment building in Turkey throughout their life cycle with cradle-to-grave approach. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) based on ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 was used to analyse the environmental impacts of the single-family house and multi-storey apartment buildings. The functional unit was chosen as 1m 2 of floor area of a house over their lifespan (50 years). With cradle-to-grave approach of the LCA, the system boundaries for the environmental assessment covers the pre-operation, operation and post-operation stages. The results of this LCA study revealed that majority of the environmental impacts occurs at operation phase for both single-family house and multi-storey apartment. The operation stage has the highest impact with 79% and 78% share of the global warming potential (GWP) for single-family house and the multi-storey apartment, respectively. In comparison of environmental impact results, GWP of the multi-storey apartment per m 2 of floor area is 30% lower than single-family house. The environmental impacts of the operation phase have significant importance on the overall environmental performance of both single-family house and multi-storey apartment. The results showed that electricity consumption and steel usage are the main contributors of the environmental impacts coming from the operation and pre-operation phases, respectively.

The HCV genome is an RNA molecule that is approximately 9.6 kb in length and encodes a polyprotein that is cleaved proteolytically to generate at least 10 mature viral proteins. Recently, a new HCV protein named F has been described, which is synthesized as a result of a ribosomal frameshift. Little is known about the biological properties of this protein, but the possibility that the F protein may participate in HCV morphology or replication has been raised. In this work, the presence of functional constraints in the F protein was investigated. It was found that the rate of amino acid substitutions along the F protein was significantly higher than the rate of synonymous substitutions, and comparisons involving genes that represented independent phylogenetic lineages yielded very different divergence/conservation patterns. The distribution of stop codons in the F protein across all HCV genotypes was also investigated; genotypes 2 and 3 were found to have more stop codons than genotype 1. The results of this work suggest strongly that the pattern of divergence in the F protein is not affected by functional constraints.","output":"Hepatitis C virus F protein sequence reveals a lack of functional constraints and a variable pattern of amino acid substitution."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute methanol poisoning may be associated with a variety of symptoms, such as abdominal pain, blurred vision, loss of consciousness, and acute pancreatitis.

We present our single-centre nurse-led initiation and titration clinic findings from Waikato Hospital. Method: Our retrospective analysis includes 149 consecutive patients with HFrEF who were commenced on sacubitril/valsartan by the Heart Failure Clinical Nurse Specialist (HF CNS) clinic between 1 October 2018 and 30 September 2019. Statistical analyses for Wilcoxon signed-rank test (two-tailed) were performed using Prism 8. Results: Our cohort of 149 patients were predominantly male (81%) with a median age of 68. The majority were either European (72%) or Mori (25%). Two-thirds (64%) were aetiologically non-ischaemic. Mean systolic blood pressure, mean GFR, mean weight and mean serum K+ were similar at baseline and at 6 month follow-up. 69% achieved target dose and 6% had withdrawal of sacubitril/valsartan. 36% had reduction in loop diuretic dose and 18% had mineralocorticoid antagonist withdrawn. Statistically significant differences were observed with decrease in NYHA Class (z = -7.961; p &lt;.00001), decrease in NT-pro BNP (z = -6.441; p &lt;.00001) and improvement in LVEF (z = -6.052; p &lt;.00001) across the cohort. 10% (n = 15) were hospitalised for HF and 3.4% died (n = 5) within 6 months of commencing sacubitril/valsartan.

Ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed the replication of MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in cultured cells. The 90% effective concentration (EC90) of ciclesonide for SARS-CoV-2 in differentiated human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells was 0.55 M. Eight consecutive passages of 43 SARS-CoV-2 isolates in the presence of ciclesonide generated 15 resistant mutants harboring single amino acid substitutions in nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) or nsp4. Of note, ciclesonide suppressed the replication of all these mutants by 90% or more, suggesting that these mutants cannot completely overcome ciclesonide blockade. Under a microscope, the viral RNA replication-transcription complex in cells, which is thought to be detectable using antibodies specific for nsp3 and double-stranded RNA, was observed to fall in the presence of ciclesonide in a concentration-dependent manner. These observations indicate that the suppressive effect of ciclesonide on viral replication is specific to coronaviruses, highlighting it as a candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.IMPORTANCE The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is ongoing. New and effective antiviral agents that combat the disease are needed urgently. Here, we found that an inhaled corticosteroid, ciclesonide, suppresses the replication of coronaviruses, including betacoronaviruses (murine hepatitis virus type 2 [MHV-2], MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) and an alphacoronavirus (human coronavirus 229E [HCoV-229E]), in cultured cells. Ciclesonide is safe; indeed, it can be administered to infants at high concentrations. Thus, ciclesonide is expected to be a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is effective against many members of the coronavirus family.

Recruitment of trainees using a virtual platform will require communication of opportunities as well as the culture of the department and institution as well as the community. Delay of the board examinations has caused angst as well as disruption of the timing of clinical rotations but may ultimately result in a shift of how the examinations are administered. The exceptional disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic allows us to reconsider how the educational aspects of imaging can emerge as improved in the years to come.","output":"The Early Influence and Effects of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic on Resident Education and Adaptations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper discusses how robots enable occupant-safe continuous protection for students when schools reopen. Conventionally, fixed air filters are not used as a key pandemic prevention method for public indoor spaces because they are unable to trap the airborne pathogens in time in the entire room. However, by combining the mobility of a robot with air filtration, the efficacy of cleaning up the air around multiple people is largely increased. A disinfection co-robot prototype is thus developed to provide continuous and occupant-friendly protection to people gathering indoors, specifically for students in a classroom scenario. In a static classroom with students sitting in a grid pattern, the mobile robot is able to serve up to 14 students per cycle while reducing the worst-case pathogen dosage by 20%, and with higher robustness compared to a static filter. The extent of robot protection is optimized by tuning the passing distance and speed, such that a robot is able to serve more people given a threshold of worst-case dosage a person can receive.","output":"Enhancing Safety of Students with Mobile Air Filtration during School Reopening from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the case of a 60-year-old female patient with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia, who suddenly presented with a clinical picture of emotional lability, disorientation, complex visual hallucinations and persecutory delusions.

Overall survival associated with different treatment strategies were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. In the study period, 40.5% and 46.2% of patients with stage I adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, respectively, did not receive any treatment at all. Less than 11% (196/1,865) of patients with stage I-II disease underwent esophagectomy, even though surgery was associated with a better 5-year survival compared to no treatment (stage I: 47.3% [95% CI 36.2%-57.6%] vs 14.9% [95% CI: 11.2%-19.1%]; stage II: 29.3% [95% CI 20.1%-39.1%] vs 1.2% [95% CI: 0.1%-5.5%]).

Parallel to other studies, we used the new device for selected patients who were no optimal candidates for established techniques like neurosurgical clipping or endovascular coiling. We aimed to report the angiographic and clinical results of WEB implantations or combinations between WEB and coiling or intracranial stents. METHODS We reviewed the records of n = 23 interventions in 22 patients with unruptured wide-neck aneurysms (UIA) who were assigned for aneurysm treatment with the use of the WEB or adjunctive techniques. Interventional procedures and clinical and angiographic outcomes are reported for the periprocedural phase and in mid-term FU. RESULTS Of the included 22 patients, six patients needed additional coiling, intracranial stenting, or implantation of a flow diverter. WEB implantation was technically feasible in 22 out of the 23 interventions. Follow-up angiographic imaging proved total or subtotal occlusion of the aneurysm in 19 of 22 cases. Two minor recurrences remained stable during a period of 15 months. One patient with a partially thrombosed giant MCA aneurysm had a major recurrence and was retreated with a second WEB in combination with coiling.

Stress ulcers are a concern for intensive care unit (ICU) patients; PUD is also an issue for patients taking anticoagulation. Helicobacter pylori test and treat is an option for patients starting NSAID therapy, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may reduce PUD in NSAID patients and other high-risk groups. RECENT FINDINGS: There are a large number of trials that demonstrate that Helicobacter pylori eradication reduces PUD in NSAID patients. PPI is also effective at reducing PUD in this group and is also effective in ICU patients and those on anticoagulants. The effect is too modest for PPI to be recommended in everyone, and more research is needed as to which groups would benefit the most. Increasing age, past history of PUD, and comorbidity are the most important risk factors.

We wondered if the myeloid compartment was affected during Covid-19 and if monocytes and macrophages could be infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages from Covid-19 patients and controls were infected with SARS-CoV-2, and extensively investigated with immunofluorescence, viral RNA extraction and quantification, total RNA extraction followed by reverse transcription and q-PCR using specific primers, supernatant cytokines (IL-10, TNF-&#945;, IL-1?, IFN-?, TGF-?1 and IL-6), flow cytometry. The effect of M1- versus M2-type or no polarization prior to infection was assessed. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected monocytes and MDMs but their infection is abortive. Infection was associated with immunoregulatory cytokines secretion and the induction of a macrophagic specific transcriptional program characterized by the upregulation of M2-type molecules. In vitro polarization did not account for permissivity to SARS-CoV-2, since M1- and M2-type MDMs were similarly infected. In Covid-19 patients, monocytes exhibited lower counts affecting all subsets, decreased expression of HLA-DR, and increased expression of CD163, irrespective of severity.

While today more women in low- and middle-income countries give birth in health care facilities, reductions in maternal and neonatal mortality have been less than expected. This paradox may be explained by the standard and quality of intrapartum care provision which depends on several factors such as health workforce capacity and the readiness of the health system as well as access to care.

However, industrial applications using online instruments, such as submersible UV-Vis spectrophotometers, may require the use of alternative techniques to remove particle effect rather than performing a physical filtration step. Some submersible UV-Vis spectrophotometers have built-in generic particle compensation algorithms to remove the filtration step. This work studied the influence of suspended particles on the measurements of a submersible UV-Vis spectrophotometer as well as the performance of the built-in particle compensation technique under laboratory-controlled conditions. Simulated water samples were used in the combinations of standard particles from laboratory chemical and natural particles extracted from water systems with ultrapure water and treated water from a drinking water treatment plant. Particle contributions to the UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) measurements of water samples varied differently when particle types or concentrations changed. The compensated UV254, measured by the submersible instrument using the built-in generic particle compensation algorithms, was compared with laboratory UV254, analysed by the bench-top instrument with the physical filtration method. The results indicated that the built-in generic compensation algorithms of the submersible UV-Vis spectrophotometer may generate undercompensated UV254 or overcompensated UV254 for various surface waters. These findings provide in-depth knowledge about the impact of suspended particles on the measurements of submersible UV-Vis spectrophotometers; source water dependence; and why site-specific calibration is often needed to get accurate measurements.","output":"Evaluation of the impact of suspended particles on the UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) measurements using a submersible UV-Vis spectrophotometer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 severely impacted older adults and long-term care facility (LTCF) residents.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis within a retrospective cohort of hospitalized patients75 years with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to 160 Spanish hospitals. Differences between groups and factors associated with mortality among LTCF residents were assessed through comparisons and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 6,189 patients75 years, 1,185 (19.1%) were LTCF residents and 4,548 (73.5%) were community-dwelling. LTCF residents were older (median: 87.4 vs. 82.1 years), mostly female (61.6% vs. 43.2%), had more severe functional dependence (47.0% vs 7.8%), more comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index: 6 vs 5), had dementia more often (59.1% vs. 14.4%), and had shorter duration of symptoms (median: 3 vs 6 days) than community-dwelling patients (all, p<.001). Mortality risk factors in LTCF residents were severe functional dependence (aOR:1.79;95%CI:1.13-2.83;p=.012), dyspnea (1.66;1.16-2.39;p=.004), SatO2<94% (1.73;1.27-2.37;p=.001), temperature37.8oC (1.62;1.11-2.38; p=.013); qSOFA index2 (1.62;1.11-2.38;p=.013), bilateral infiltrates (1.98;1.24-2.98;p<.001), and high C-reactive protein (1.005;1.003-1.007;p<.001).

At age 20 (n = 1,180), respondents provided comprehensive self-reported information on past-year substance use, including use of legal and illicit substances (e.g., cannabinoids, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and nonmedical use of prescription drugs (e.g., opioids, tranquilizers). In adolescence (ages 13C17), limited versions of this questionnaire were administered. In childhood (ages 7C11), potential risk factors, including individual-level factors (e.g., sensation-seeking, low self-control, aggression, and internalizing symptoms) and social-environmental factors (e.g., social stressors, exposure to others substance use), were assessed. We fitted latent class models to identify classes of participants with different substance use profiles in early adulthood. The results show that polysubstance use increased between early adolescence and early adulthood. The continuation of polysubstance use was common (stability between all adjacent assessments: odds ratio >7). At age 20, more than one-third of participants reported polysubstance use (involving illicit substances, nonmedical use of prescription drugs, and cannabidiol). Four latent classes with polysubstance use were identified: (1) broad spectrum of substances; (2) cannabis and club drugs; (3) cannabis and the nonmedical use of prescription drugs; and (4) different cannabinoids. Risk factors for any polysubstance use included childhood sensation-seeking and exposure to others substance use; some childhood risk factors were differentially associated with the four classes (e.g., low self-control in childhood was associated with an increased likelihood of being in the broad spectrum class).

This issue has been brought to a head by recent devastating losses of honey bees throughout North America (so called, Colony Collapse Disorder); yet, we still have little understanding of the cause(s) of bee declines. Wild bumble bees (Bombus spp.) have also suffered serious declines and circumstantial evidence suggests that pathogen spillover from commercially reared bumble bees, which are used extensively to pollinate greenhouse crops, is a possible cause. We constructed a spatially explicit model of pathogen spillover in bumble bees and, using laboratory experiments and the literature, estimated parameter values for the spillover of Crithidia bombi, a destructive pathogen commonly found in commercial Bombus. We also monitored wild bumble bee populations near greenhouses for evidence of pathogen spillover, and compared the fit of our model to patterns of C. bombi infection observed in the field. Our model predicts that, during the first three months of spillover, transmission from commercial hives would infect up to 20% of wild bumble bees within 2 km of the greenhouse. However, a travelling wave of disease is predicted to form suddenly, infecting up to 35C100% of wild Bombus, and spread away from the greenhouse at a rate of 2 km/wk. In the field, although we did not observe a large epizootic wave of infection, the prevalences of C. bombi near greenhouses were consistent with our model. Indeed, we found that spillover has allowed C. bombi to invade several wild bumble bee species near greenhouses. Given the available evidence, it is likely that pathogen spillover from commercial bees is contributing to the ongoing decline of wild Bombus in North America. Improved management of domestic bees, for example by reducing their parasite loads and their overlap with wild congeners, could diminish or even eliminate pathogen spillover.","output":"Does Pathogen Spillover from Commercially Reared Bumble Bees Threaten Wild Pollinators?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Originated in China, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)- the highly contagious and fatal respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has already infected more than 29 million people worldwide with a mortality rate of 3.15% (according to World Health Organization's (WHO's) report, September 2020) and the number is exponentially increasing with no remedy whatsoever discovered till date.

In this two-year period, 233 cases of malaria were reportedmore than seven times the number of cases (31) reported in the previous two years. The initial outbreak response by the national malaria program emphasized top-down interventions such as active surveillance, vector control, and educative talks within the community. Despite a transient reduction in reported cases in mid-2015, transmission resurged at the end of 2015. The program responded by introducing active roles for trained community members that included door-to-door fever screening, testing with rapid diagnostic tests and treatment. Malaria cases declined significantly throughout 2016 and community-based active surveillance infrastructure helped to detect and limit a small episode of transmission in 2017. Results from qualitative research among community members revealed two key factors that facilitated their cooperation with community-based surveillance activities: motivation to help ones community; and trust among stakeholders (community health workers, their neighbors and other key figures in the community, and malaria program staff and leadership). This experience suggests that community-led interventions and the programs willingness to learn and adapt under changing circumstances can help control malaria transmission and pave the way for elimination.","output":"Malaria outbreak response in urban Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic: lessons learned for community engagement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Tobacco Cessation and Prevention TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: The United States is in an epidemic of electronic cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) which is characterized by a combination of respiratory, constitutional and gastrointestinal symptoms1. The most common presenting signs and symptoms include dyspnea, cough, fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxia, malaise, and emesis2. Two predominant patterns of acute lung injury have been recognized in EVALI: Diffuse Alveolar Damage and Organizing Pneumonia. Radiographic findings in the literature for patients diagnosed with EVALI include a pattern of bilateral and symmetric ground glass opacities with subpleural and areas of lobular sparing3. We present a unique case of severe EVALI isolated to a single lung that has not been documented in the literature and was managed conservatively. CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-year-old male with a history of vaping nicotine products presented with acute onset of dyspnea, hypoxia and tachycardia. Prior to switching to vaping, he admitted to a 7 pack-year smoking history of cigarettes. He endorsed using a Juul? vaping device for two years before switching to another product, Fume?, for 2 months prior to presentation. On physical exam, the patient was tachypneic and in severe respiratory distress with crackles in the right lung. Vital signs were significant for a heart rate of 129 and oxygen saturation of 90% on ambient air. COVID PCR and viral respiratory panel testing were negative. CT of the chest showed diffuse right sided nonspecific reticulonodular pattern with some bronchiectatic changes. Our patient requested conservative management due to financial concerns. Thus we elected to treat without antibiotics and systemic steroids. Supportive treatment included bronchodilators and supplemental oxygen. He improved clinically over the next five days despite our unusual conservative approach. A repeat CT of the chest at that time showed marked interval resolution of radiographic findings. DISCUSSION: Our case highlights that clinicians must be able to recognize that unilateral organizing pneumonia in the setting of recent vaping can be a manifestation of EVALI. Anecdotal literature supports the use of systemic glucocorticoids but an exact treatment of EVALI is not yet known1. The approach in our patient with significant hypoxia and radiographic lung involvement reinforces that supportive treatment of EVALI, as opposed to aggressive measures with empiric antibiotics and systemic glucocorticoids, can lead to similar outcomes without the risk of adverse effects of those medications. CONCLUSIONS: A conservative approach can likely decrease financial burdens for patients and medical institutions and still yield positive medical results. Further longitudinal research is required to determine the benefit of empiric treatment of EVALI and radiographic studies to database future unilateral presentations of EVALI.

We sought to determine whether the electrocardiogram (ECG) on hospital presentation provides prognostic information, specifically related to death. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective cohort study in patients with COVID-19 who had an ECG at or near hospital admission. Clinical characteristics and ECG variables were manually abstracted from the electronic health record and first ECG. Our primary outcome was death. THERE WERE: 756 patients who presented to a large New York City teaching hospital with COVID-19 who underwent an ECG. The mean age was 63.3  16 years, 37% were women, 61% of patients were nonwhite, and 57% had hypertension; 90 (11.9%) died. In a multivariable logistic regression that included age, ECG, and clinical characteristics, the presence of one or more atrial premature contractions (odds ratio [OR] 2.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-5.36, Pa?=a?.01), a right bundle branch block or intraventricular block (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.32-5.18, Pa?=a?.002), ischemic T-wave inversion (OR 3.49, 95% CI 1.56-7.80, Pa?=a?.002), and nonspecific repolarization (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.27-4.21, Pa?=a?.006) increased the odds of death. ST elevation was rare (na?=a?5 [0.7%]). CONCLUSIONS: We found that patients with ECG findings of both left-sided heart disease (atrial premature contractions, intraventricular block, repolarization abnormalities) and right-sided disease (right bundle branch block) have higher odds of death.

In the current COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of the patients experienced serious pneumonia resulting from inflammation (Acute respiratory distress syndrome/ARDS). Pathogenic infections cause cytokine release syndrome (CRS) by hyperactivation of immune cells, which in turn release excessive cytokines causing ARDS. Currently, there are no standard therapies for viral, bacterial or pathogen-mediated CRS. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate and validate the protective effects of Dehydrozingerone (DHZ) against LPS induced lung cell injury by in-vitro and in-vivo models and to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms that mediate these therapeutic effects. METHODS: The therapeutic activity of DHZ was determined in in-vitro models by pre-treating the cells with DHZ and exposed to LPS to stimulate the inflammatory cascade of events. We analysed the effect of DHZ on LPS induced inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and cell damage markers expression/levels using various cell lines. We performed gene expression, ELISA, and western blot analysis to elucidate the effect of DHZ on inflammation and its modulation of MAPK and NF-B pathways. Further, the prophylactic and therapeutic effect of DHZ was evaluated against the LPS induced ARDS model in rats. RESULTS: DHZ significantly (p<0.01) attenuated the LPS induced ROS, inflammatory cytokine, chemokine gene expression and protein release in macrophages. Similarly, DHZ treatment protected the lung epithelial and endothelial cells by mitigating the LPS induced inflammatory events in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo analysis showed that DHZ treatment significantly (p<0.001) mitigated the LPS induced ARDS pathophysiology of increase in the inflammatory cells in BALF, inflammatory cytokine and chemokines in lung tissues. LPS stimulated neutrophil-mediated events, apoptosis, alveolar wall thickening and alveolar inflammation were profoundly reduced by DHZ treatment in a rat model. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates for the first time that DHZ has the potential to ameliorate LPS induced ARDS by inhibiting cytokine storm and oxidative through modulating the MAPK and NF-B pathways. This data provides pre-clinical support to develop DHZ as a potential therapeutic agent against ARDS.","output":"Dehydrozingerone ameliorates Lipopolysaccharide induced acute respiratory distress syndrome by inhibiting cytokine storm, oxidative stress via modulating the MAPK/NF-B pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work applies a novel geometric criterion for nonlinear autonomous differential equations developed by Lu and Lu (NARWA 36:20C43, 2017) to a nonlinear SEIVS epidemic model with temporary immunity and achieves its threshold dynamics. Specifically, global-stability problems for the SEIVS model of Cai and Li (AMM 33:2919C2926, 2009) are effectively solved. The corresponding optimal control system with vaccination, awareness campaigns and treatment is further established and four different control strategies are compared by numerical simulations to contain hepatitis B. It is concluded that joint implementation of these measures can minimize the numbers of exposed and infectious individuals in the shortest time, so it is the most efficient strategy to curb the hepatitis B epidemic.

METHODS: Adults without history of SARS-CoV-2 infection from the Danish population scheduled for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were enrolled in this parallel group, phase IV study. SARS-CoV-2 Spike IgG and Spike-ACE2-receptor-blocking antibodies were measured at days 0, 21, 90 and 180. Vaccine responsiveness was categorized according to Spike IgG and Spike-ACE2-receptor-blocking levels at day 90 post-1(st) vaccination. Non-durable vaccine-response was defined as day 90 responders that no longer had significant responses by day 180. RESULTS: Of 6544 participants completing two vaccine doses (median age 64, interquartile range:54C75), 3654 (55.8%) received BTN162b2, 2472 (37.8%) mRNA-1273, and 418 (6.4%) ChAdOx1 followed by a mRNA vaccine. Levels of both types of antibodies increased from baseline to day 90 and then decreased to day 180. The decrease was more pronounced for levels of Spike-ACE2-receptor-blocking antibodies than for Spike IgG. Proportions with vaccine hypo-responsiveness and lack of durable response were 5.0% and 12.1% for Spike IgG; 12.7% and 39.6% for Spike-ACE2-receptor-blocking antibody levels, respectively. Male sex, vaccine type and number of co-morbidities were associated with all four outcomes. Additionally, age >=75y was associated with hypo-responsiveness for Spike-ACE2-receptor-blocking antibodies (adjusted odds-ratio:1.59, 95% confidence interval:1.25C2.01) but not for Spike IgG. CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity, male sex and vaccine type were risk factors for hypo-responsiveness and non-durable response to COVID-19 vaccination.

The global shortage of equipment and health care professionals, diagnostic cost, and difficulty in collecting nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) necessitate the use of an alternative specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. In this study, we investigated the use of saliva as an alternative specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Participants presenting COVID-19 symptoms and their contacts were enrolled at the COVID-19 Screening Unit of Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), from July to November 2020. Paired NPS and saliva specimens were collected from each participant. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2. Of the 596 suspected COVID-19-positive participants, 231 (38.7%) were detected as COVID-19 positive by RT-qPCR from at least 1 specimen type. Among the positive cases, 184 (79.6%) patients were identified to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on NPS and saliva samples, whereas 45 (19.65%) patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on NPS samples but negative for SARS-CoV-2 based on the saliva samples. Two (0.5%) patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on saliva samples but negative for SARS-CoV-2 based on NPS samples. The sensitivity and specificity of the saliva samples were 80.3% and 99.4%, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 detection was higher in saliva (85.1%) among the patients who visited the clinic after 1 to 5 days of symptom onset. A lower median cycle threshold (C(T)) value indicated a higher SARS-CoV-2 viral load in NPS than that in saliva for target genes among the positive specimens. The study findings suggest that saliva can be used accurately for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 early after symptom onset in clinical and community settings. IMPORTANCE As the COVID-19 pandemic erupted, the WHO recommended the use of nasopharyngeal or throat swabs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 etiology of COVID-19. The collection of NPS causes discomfort because of its invasive collection procedure. There are considerable risks to health care workers during the collection of these specimens. Therefore, an alternative, noninvasive, reliable, and self-collected specimen was explored in this study. This study investigated the feasibility and suitability of saliva versus NPS for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we showed that the sensitivity of saliva specimens was 80.35%, which meets the WHO criteria. Saliva is an easy-to-get, convenient, and low-cost specimen that yields better results if it is collected within the first 5 days of symptom onset. Our study findings suggest that saliva can be used in low-resource countries, community settings, and vulnerable groups, such as children and elderly people.","output":"Diagnostic Performance of Self-Collected Saliva Versus Nasopharyngeal Swab for the Molecular Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the Clinical Setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Qingfei Paidu (QFPD) granules have played a critical role during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China.

We designed a controlled study to compare the role of different respiratory viruses and febrile response in FS. METHODS In a prospective cohort study of 1899 pediatric emergency room patients aged 6 months-6 years with a positive respiratory virus multiplex PCR, we identified 225 patients with FSs. We first compared the distribution of respiratory viruses in age-stratified patients with FSs with that in other patients. In an embedded case-control study, we compared the febrile response in patients with FSs with that in the controls matched for age, season and the same respiratory virus. RESULTS The relative risk for FS was the highest for coronavirus OC43, 229E, and NL63 infections [RR: 3.2, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.4-7.2) and influenza A and B [RR: 2.5, 95 % CI: 1.4-4.7] as compared to those with other respiratory viral infections. The patients with FSs had a stronger febrile response of 39.2 C (difference: 0.8 C, 95 % CI: 0.5-1.2) later during hospitalization after acute care than the controls matched for the same respiratory virus. CONCLUSIONS Influenza and coronaviruses caused relatively more FS-related emergency room visits than other respiratory viruses.

Assuming limited isolation control and capacity constraints on the number of infections, an optimal quarantine control strategy that balances between the total number of infections and the overall isolation effort is derived from necessary optimality conditions. The specific optimal policy is then obtained by optimizing the switching times of this generalized strategy. In the case of a newly emerged disease, these results can be used in a data-driven receding horizon manner to improve actions as more data becomes available. The proposed approach is applied to publicly available data from the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany.

In general, by functionalizing the waveguide surface with specific antibodies layer, we make the optical sensor sensitive only to a particular virus. Unlike conventional virus detection methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), integrated refractive index (RI) optical sensors offer cheap and mass-scale fabrication of compact devices for fast and straightforward detection with high sensitivity and selectivity. Our analysis includes a wide range of wavelengths from visible to mid-infrared. We determined the strip waveguide's single-mode dimensions and the optimum dimensions that maximize the sensitivity to the virus layer attached to its surface at each wavelength. We also compared the strip waveguide to the widely used slot waveguide. Our study shows that silicon nitride strip waveguide working at lower wavelengths is the optimum choice for virus detection as it maximizes both the waveguide sensitivity (S wg ) and the figure of merit (FOM) of the sensor. Furthermore, the optimized waveguide can work for a range of viruses. Balanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) sensors were designed at different wavelengths showing high FOM at  = 450nm ranging from 500 RIU -1 up to 1231 RIU -1 with L MZI =500 m.

PCR-based methods also can detect a much wider range of EV variants, including those within species A, as well as human parechoviruses (HPeVs) that often grow poorly in vitro and which previously have been underdiagnosed by traditional methods. To exploit these developments, we developed a real-time one-step reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for the rapid and sensitive detection of EV and HPeV in clinical specimens. Two commercially available RT-PCR kits were used (method I, Platinum one-step kit; method II, Express qPCR one-step kit) with primers and probes targeting the EV and HPeV 5'-untranslated regions (5'UTR). Amplification dynamics (threshold cycle [C(T)]values and efficiencies) of absolutely quantified full-length RNA transcripts representative of EV species A to D and HPeV were similar, demonstrating the effectiveness of both assays across the range of currently described human EV and HPeV variants.

The 190 kb GpSGHV genome contains 160 open reading frames and encodes more than 60 confirmed proteins. The asymptomatic GpSGHV infection in flies can convert to symptomatic infection that is characterized by overt salivary gland hypertrophy (SGH). Flies with SGH show reduced general fitness and reproductive dysfunction. Although the occurrence of SGH is an exception rather than the rule, G. pallidipes is thought to be the most susceptible to expression of overt SGH symptoms compared to other Glossina species that are largely asymptomatic. Although Glossina salivary glands (SGs) play an essential role in GpSGHV transmission, the functions of the salivary components during the virus infection are poorly understood. In this study, we used mass spectrometry to study SG proteomes of G. pallidipes and G. m. morsitans, two Glossina model species that exhibit differential GpSGHV pathologies (high and low incidence of SGH, respectively). A total of 540 host proteins were identified, of which 23 and 9 proteins were significantly up- and down-regulated, respectively, in G. pallidipes compared to G. m. morsitans. Whereas 58 GpSGHV proteins were detected in G. pallidipes F(1) progenies, only 5 viral proteins were detected in G. m. morsitans. Unlike in G. pallidipes, qPCR assay did not show any significant increase in virus titers in G. m. morsitans F(1) progenies, confirming that G. m. morsitans is less susceptible to GpSGHV infection and replication compared to G. pallidipes.

In the case of G. m. morsitans, antiviral responses appeared to be dominant.

TMAE, equilibrated in 25 mM sodium acetate-pH 6.0 and loaded with up to 225 mg of IgG/mL, could remove IgA and IgM, with over 94% IgG recovery with preserved sub-class distribution in the flow-through. Sequential Eshmuno?-P anti-A and anti-B columns efficiently removed isoagglutinins. The C18 packing, used at up to 17 mL of S/D-IgG solution per mL, removed TnBP and Triton X-100 to less than 1 and 2 ppm, respectively. The 20% purified IgG was devoid of activated factor XI and thrombin generation activity. DISCUSSION This purification sequence yields a >99% pure, 20% (v/v) IgG product, depleted of IgA, isoagglutinins, and thrombogenic markers, and should be implementable on various IgG intermediates to help improve the supply of immunoglobulins.","output":"Process steps for the fractionation of immunoglobulin (Ig) G depleted of IgA, isoagglutinins, and devoid of in vitro thrombogenicity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Community pharmacies are among the most easily accessible health services.

Skin grafts are also frequently used to cover surgical wounds not amenable to linear closure. While all grafts have potential to contract, clinical observation suggests that antecedent thermal injury worsens contraction and impairs functional and aesthetic outcomes. This study evaluates the impact of antecedent full-thickness burn on split-thickness skin graft scar outcomes and the potential mediating factors. Full-thickness contact burns (100C, 30s) were created on the backs of anesthetized female Yorkshire Pigs. After seven days, burn eschar was tangentially excised and covered with 12/1000th inch (300m) split-thickness skin graft. For comparison, unburned wounds were created by sharp excision to fat before graft application. From 7 to 120days post-grafting, planimetric measurements, digital imaging and biopsies for histology, immunohistochemistry and gene expression were obtained. At 120days post-grafting, the Observer Scar Assessment Scale, colorimetry, contour analysis and optical graft height assessments were performed. Twenty-nine porcine wounds were analyzed. All measured metrics of clinical skin quality were significantly worse (p<0.05) in burn injured wounds. Histological analysis supported objective clinical findings with marked scar-like collagen proliferation within the dermis, increased vascular density, and prolonged and increased cellular infiltration. Observed differences in contracture also correlated with earlier and more prominent myofibroblast differentiation as demonstrated by -SMA staining. Antecedent thermal injury worsens split-thickness skin graft quality, likely by multiple mechanisms including burn-related inflammation, microscopically inadequate excision, and dysregulation of tissue remodeling. A valid, reliable, clinically relevant model of full-thickness burn, excision and skin replacement therapy has been demonstrated. Future research to enhance quality of skin replacement therapies should be directed toward modulation of inflammation and assessments for complete excision.","output":"Antecedent thermal injury worsens split-thickness skin graft quality: A clinically relevant porcine model of full-thickness burn, excision and grafting."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quantum mechanical theories are used to search and optimize the conformations of proposed small molecule candidates for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 These candidate compounds are taken from what is reported in the news and in other pre-peer-reviewed literature (e g ChemRxiv, bioRxiv) The goal herein is to provide predicted structures and relative conformational stabilities for selected drugs and ligands, in the hopes that other research groups can make use of them for developing a treatment The following six compounds are investigated: chloroquine , hydroxychloroquine , eriodictyol , silmitasertiand valproic acid br /br Initial exploration for conformations are performed at the HF/6-31G(d)//HF/6-31G(d) theory level, which are then further optimized at more rigorous theory levels (e g B97-D3BJ/cc-pVTZ//B97-D3BJ/cc-pVTZ) The resulting structures are made available via GitHub /div","output":"Conformations and Three-Dimensional Structures of Selected SARS-CoV-2 Drug Candidates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV-2, has emerged rapidly and overspread worldwide, causing a pandemic disease, COVID-19.

For this reason, assays targeting multiple regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome may be useful for a rapid traceability of either known or new variants, anyway, not all the manufacturers are able to sustain the rapid development of variants. OBJECTIVE: We tested forty nasopharyngeal swabs, resulted positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at low cycle threshold (CT < 25), with SARS-CoV-2 Variants ELITe MGB? Kit, which was designed to identify Nigerian variant, possible UK variant and South African or Brazilian variant.

The cause of preterm birth is complex, multifactorial, and likely dependent, at least in part, on the gestational age of the fetus. Intrauterine infection is frequent in preterm deliveries that occur at <32 weeks gestation; understanding how the fetus responds to proinflammatory insult will be an important step towards early preterm birth prevention. However, animal studies of infection and inflammation in prematurity commonly use older fetuses that possess comparatively mature immune systems. OBJECTIVE Aiming to characterize acute fetal responses to microbial agonist at a clinically relevant gestation, we used 92-day-old fetuses (62% of term) to develop a chronically catheterized sheep model of very preterm pregnancy. We hypothesized that any acute fetal systemic inflammatory responses would be driven by signaling from the tissues exposed to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide that is introduced into the amniotic fluid. STUDY DESIGN Eighteen ewes that were carrying a single fetus at 92 days of gestation had recovery surgery to place fetal tracheal, jugular, and intraamniotic catheters. Animals were recovered for 24 hours before being administered either intraamniotic E coli lipopolysaccharide (n = 9) or sterile saline solution (n = 9). Samples were collected for 48 hours before euthanasia and necroscopy. Fetal inflammatory responses were characterized by microarray analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS Intraamniotic lipopolysaccharide reached the distal trachea within 2 hours. Lipopolysaccharide increased tracheal fluid interleukin-8 within 2 hours and generated a robust inflammatory response that was characterized by interleukin-6 signaling pathway activation and up-regulation of cell proliferation but no increases in inflammatory mediator expression in cord blood RNA. CONCLUSIONS In very preterm sheep fetuses, lipopolysaccharide stimulates inflammation in the fetal lung and fetal skin and stimulates a systemic inflammatory response that is not generated by fetal blood cells. These data argue for amniotic fluid-exposed tissues that play a key role in driving acute fetal and intrauterine inflammatory responses.","output":"Outside-in?

However, the sensitivity of Chinese commercial rRT-PCR kits to critical SARS-CoV-2 variants remains unknown. In this study, contrived MS2 virus-like particles were used as reference materials to evaluate the analytical sensitivity of Daan, BioGerm, EasyDiagnosis, Liferiver, and Sansure kits when detecting six important variants (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron, and Fin-796H).

In the survey, participants were asked about their use of SNS at the moment of answering the survey and before lockdown. RESULTS: A statistically significant increase was found in the frequency of use of all studied SNS (Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter and Facebook) during lockdown, as well as in the number of women following appearance-focused Instagram accounts.

At the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to many restrictions, which affected seniors in care facilities in the form of severe isolation. The isolation led, among other things, to a lack of exercise, which has led to a multitude of negative effects for this target group. Serious games can potentially help by being used anywhere at any time to strengthen skills with few resources. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a serious game to strengthen motor skills (study 1) and the influence of pandemic restrictions (study 2) on seniors in care facilities. METHODS: The data on motor skills (measured by the Tinetti test) originated from an intervention study with repeated measurements that was interrupted by the pandemic conditions. Data were collected 4 times every 3 months with an intervention group (IG, training 3 times for 1 hour per week) and a control group (CG, no intervention). There were 2 substudies. The first considered the first 6 months until the pandemic restrictions, while the second considered the influence of the restrictions on motor skills. RESULTS: The sample size was 70. The IG comprised 31 (44%) participants, with 22 (71%) female and 9 (29%) male seniors with an average age of 85 years. The CG comprised 39 (56%) participants, with 31 (79%) female and 8 (21%) male seniors with an average age of 87 years. In study 1, mixed-design ANOVA showed no significant interaction between measurement times and group membership for the first measurements (F(2.136)=1.414, P<.25, partial 2=.044), but there was a significant difference between the CG (mean 16.23, SD 1.1) and the IG (mean 19.81, SD 1.2) at the third time of measurement (P=.02). In study 2 the mixed-design ANOVA (used to investigate motor skills before and after the pandemic conditions between the 2 groups) couldnt reveal any significant interaction between measurement times and group membership: F(1.67)=2.997, P<.09, partial 2=.043. However, there was a significant main effect of the time of measurement: F(1.67)=5.44, P<.02, partial 2=.075. CONCLUSIONS: During the first 6 months, the IG showed increased motor skills, whereas the motor skills of the CG slightly deteriorated and showed a statistically significant difference after 6 months. The pandemic restrictions leveled the difference and showed a significant negative effect on motor skills over 3 months. As our results show, digital games have the potential to break down access barriers and promote necessary maintenance for important skills. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of low-threshold opportunities for exercise and physical activity.

In our model, we incorporate three control variables which represent: awareness campaigns, diagnosis and psychological follow-up. The purpose of our control strategies is protecting susceptible individuals from being infected, minimizing the number of infected individuals with high and low risk within a given age group [Formula: see text] as well as reducing the number of recovered individuals with psychological complications. Pontryagins maximum principle is used to characterize the optimal controls and the optimality system is solved by an iterative method. Numerical simulations performed using Matlab, are provided to show the effectiveness of three control strategies and the effect of the order of fractional derivative on the efficiency of these control strategies. Using a cost-effectiveness analysis method, our results show that combining awareness with diagnosis is the most effective strategy.

When a new epidemic or pandemic emerges, people are faced with the challenge of sorting through a great volume of varied information. Therefore, the dissemination of high-quality web-based information is essential during this time period. The overarching aim was to investigate the quality of web-based information about preventive measures and self care methods at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: in May 2020, consumer-oriented websites written in Swedish were identified via systematic searches in Google (n = 76). Websites were assessed with inductive content analysis, the JAMA benchmarks, the QUEST tool and the DISCERN instrument. RESULTS: seven categories and 33 subcategories were identified concerning preventive measures (md = 6.0 subcategories), with few specifying a method for washing hands (n = 4), when to sanitize the hands (n = 4), and a method for sanitizing the hands (n = 1). Eight categories and 30 subcategories were identified concerning self care methods (md = 3.0 subcategories), with few referring to the national number for telephone-based counseling (n = 20) and an online symptom assessment tool (n = 16). Overall, the median total quality scores were low (JAMA = 0/4, QUEST =13/28, DISCERN = 29/80). CONCLUSIONS: at the beginning of the pandemic, substantial quality deficits of websites about COVID-19 may have counteracted the public recommendations for preventive measures. This illustrates a critical need for standardized and systematic routines on how to achieve dissemination of high-quality web-based information when new epidemics and pandemics emerge.","output":"Quality of web-based information at the beginning of a global pandemic: a cross-sectional infodemiology study investigating preventive measures and self care methods of the coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The longer-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection are uncertain.

We speculated that the COVID-19 lockdown regulations (travel restriction and alcohol ban) would affect trauma patterns. OBJECTIVES To compare the burden and nature of trauma over the COVID-19 lockdown period with the equivalent period over the past 5 years using routinely collected data from the Pietermaritzburg Metropolitan Trauma Service in KwaZulu-Natal Province, SA. METHODS All trauma patients admitted to Grey's Hospital in Pietermaritzburg between 23 March 2015 and 31 May 2020 were identified and reviewed. RESULTS A total of 8 859 trauma patients were admitted over the 6-year period, with a total of 1 676 admitted during the periods 23 March - 31 May. These 1 676 formed the study cohort. Of these patients, 998 had sustained blunt trauma, 665 penetrating trauma, and 13 a combination of blunt and penetrating trauma. A total of 14 categories of blunt trauma were reviewed, of which the three most common were assault, motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) and pedestrian vehicle accidents (PVAs). Between 23 March and 31 May 2020, a total of 23 patients were victims of blunt assault. The median number of assault victims over the equivalent period during the previous 5 years was 48. The 5 preceding years had a median of 56 MVAs and 33 PVAs, compared with 23 and 10 during the lockdown. The median number of gunshot wound (GSW) victims for the preceding years was 41, compared with 30 during the lockdown. During the lockdown, 24 stab wound victims were admitted, compared with a median of 73 for the preceding years. The proportion of females who sustained penetrating trauma and blunt assault increased significantly during the lockdown. The proportion of females sustaining a GSW or blunt trauma secondary to an MVA remained constant. CONCLUSIONS The study showed that during the period of lockdown in SA there was a significant decrease in MVAs, PVAs and interpersonal violence.

Rehabilitation care can support people to return to work. In Germany, rehabilitation care to return to work is mostly provided in specialised clinics. The aim of the Rehapro-SERVE study is to reduce work disability days by facilitating rehabilitation care planning using a digital communication platform. To investigate the feasibility, we will test the implementation of the digital platform and evaluate the study procedures. The Rehapro-SERVE study is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (BMAS) (grant number: 661R0053K1). METHOD: The feasibility study includes a two-armed unblinded block randomised controlled study (RCT) without follow-up assessments as well as an interview study. Participants for the RCT (n = 16) are primary care patients with a minimum of 4 weeks of absence from work due to musculoskeletal, oncological or psychological conditions and at high risk of early retirement. Eligibility criteria are age 40 to 60 years; minimum of 4 weeks continuous sick leave before recruitment due to musculoskeletal, mental health or oncological conditions; and being at high risk of early retirement. Patients will be recruited from 8 primary care practices in urban and rural areas in Hesse, Germany. Following baseline assessments, patients will be randomised to either digitalised care planning (treatment) or a control group. The digitalised care planning platform will include the patients primary care physicians, jobcentres and public health physicians to decide on a tailored return-to-work programme. The collaboration will be supported by a case administrator and, if considered beneficial, a social worker for the patient. An interview study will evaluate the acceptability of the study procedures and the intervention. DISCUSSION: The use of a digital communication platform enables stakeholders to exchange information and discuss rehabilitation care planning in a timely fashion. The results of the feasibility study will lead to the adaptation of study procedures for the main study.

We sought to assess the prevalence and socio-demographic associations of obesity nationwide. METHODS: We assessed the prevalence of overall obesity (body mass index 28 kg/m(2)) and abdominal obesity (waist circumference 85/90 cm for women/men) among 2.7 million community-dwelling adults aged 35 to 75 years in the China PEACE Million Persons Project from 2014 to 2018 and quantified the socio-demographic associations of obesity using multivariable mixed models. RESULTS: Age-standardized rates of overall and abdominal obesity were 14.4% (95% CI, 14.3%C14.4%) and 32.7% (32.6%C32.8%) in women and 16.0% (15.9%C16.1%) and 36.6% (36.5%C36.8%) in men. Obesity varied considerably across socio-demographic subgroups. Older women were at higher risk for obesity (eg, adjusted relative risk [95% CI] of women aged 65C75 versus 35C44 years: 1.29 [1.27C1.31] for overall obesity, 1.76 [1.74C1.77] for abdominal obesity) while older men were not. Higher education was associated with lower risk in women (eg, adjusted relative risk [95% CI] of those with college or university education versus below primary school: 0.47 [0.46C0.48] for overall obesity, 0.61 [0.60C0.62] for abdominal obesity) but higher risk in men (1.07 [1.05C1.10], 1.17 [1.16C1.19]). CONCLUSIONS: In China, over 1 in 7 individuals meet criteria for overall obesity, and 1 in 3 for abdominal obesity. Wide variation exists across socio-demographic subgroups.

The pandemic spread of this zoonotic virus has created a global health emergency and an unprecedented socioeconomic crisis. The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by SARS-CoV?2, is highly variable. Most patients (~85%) develop no or mild symptoms, while others become seriously ill, some succumbing to disease-related complications. In this review, the SARS-CoV?2 life cycle, its transmission and the clinical and immunological features of COVID-19 are described. In addition, an overview is presented of the virological assays for detecting ongoing SARS-CoV?2 infections and the serological tests for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody detection. Also discussed are the different approaches to developing a COVID-19 vaccine and the perspectives of treating COVID-19 with antiviral drugs, immunomodulatory agents and anticoagulants/antithrombotics. Finally, the cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 are briefly touched upon. While there is still much to learn about SARS-CoV?2, the tremendous recent advances in biomedical technology and knowledge and the huge amount of research into COVID-19 raise the hope that a remedy for this disease will soon be found.

Recent studies have gone some way towards unravelling the complex mechanisms underlying the heart muscle damage that occurs after viral infection. These studies have lent support to both immune and viral mediated (independent of an immune response) cardiac damage. Acute myocarditis can present in various ways, and it may be a cause of sudden death in an otherwise healthy young adult. New treatments for viral heart disease are awaited. In the meanwhile, the haemodynamic support of patients with acute left ventricular failure caused by myocarditis should be aggressive, to allow for the possibility of spontaneous recovery.

This is because macroscopic techniques characterize average responses rather than the role of individual iron centres. Here, we combine optical absorption, magnetic circular dichroism and first-principles calculations to uncover the origin of high-temperature magnetism in these superlattices and the charge-ordering pattern in the m = 3 member. In a significant conceptual advance, interface spectra establish how Lu-layer distortion selectively enhances the Fe2+  Fe3+ charge-transfer contribution in the spin-up channel, strengthens the exchange interactions and increases the Curie temperature.

Methods: A serial cross-sectional telephone survey in the general population was conducted during the first (March 2020) (n = 765) and third wave (December 2020) (n = 651) of the local outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents were asked about their level of compliance with various personal hygiene and social distancing recommendations. Results: By the third wave, mask use increased to 100%, and throughout the study periods, >90% practiced frequent hand hygiene. However, adherence to social distancing measures significantly waned over time: avoidance of social gatherings (80.5% to 72.0%), avoidance of public places/public transport (53.3% to 26.0%), avoidance of international travel (85.8% to 76.6%) (p < 0.05). The practice of ordering food takeout/home delivery, however, increased, particularly among high-income respondents. Higher education, female gender and employment status were the most consistently associated factors with adherence to COVID-19 preventive practices in the multivariable models.

In many hospitals and health care facilities, services and health care workers have been reorganized and restructured to meet the demands of the pandemic. The impact of the pandemic on hospital-based clinical pharmacists and their ability to deliver pharmaceutical care is currently unknown. Objective: This study aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital-based clinical pharmacists working in Malaysia and the implications on how clinical pharmacy is perceived as a health care service. Methods: A qualitative study was designed to meet the research objectives. Nineteen hospital-based clinical pharmacists consented and participated in one-on-one, semi-structured interviews. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using an iterative thematic analysis approach. Results: The experiences and views of the participants were reported. Three main themes were developed: 'Reassignment and other changes in clinical pharmacist roles', 'Adapting clinical pharmacy services to COVID-19', and 'The need for clinical pharmacists in the ward'. The findings indicate that in many cases, clinical pharmacy services were fully or partially withdrawn from the ward to reduce the risk of infection and to conserve the usage of personal protective equipment. Despite this, clinical pharmacists continued to support patient care in hospitals through the use of technology. The withdrawal of clinical pharmacy services, however, raises concern that the role of clinical pharmacists is still poorly recognized. Conclusion: Clinical pharmacists in hospitals continue to support patient care despite the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Greater support and recognition of their role is required in order to empower and enhance their ability to deliver pharmaceutical care.This article is protected by copyright.

To accelerate the process, in silico screening is frequently used for antigen identification.

Four different DL pathogen models were trained to predict target antigens in bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and viruses that cause infectious diseases in humans. Datasets containing antigenic and non-antigenic sequences were derived from known vaccine candidates and the Protegen database. Biological and physicochemical properties were computed for the datasets using publicly available bioinformatics tools. For each of the four pathogen models, the datasets were divided into training, validation, and testing subsets and then scaled and normalised. The models were constructed using Fully Connected Layers (FCLs), hyper-tuned, and trained using the training subset. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and AUC (Area under the Curve) were used as metrics to assess the performance of these models. The models were benchmarked using independent datasets of known target antigens against other prediction tools such as VaxiJen and Vaxign-ML. We also tested Vaxi-DL on 219 known potential vaccine candidates (PVC) from 37 different pathogens. Our tool predicted 175 PVCs correctly out of 219 sequences.

Despite the implementation of automated detection systems and previous efficiencies, including barcoding, electronic data transfer, and extensive robotics, capacities have struggled to meet the demand. Sample pooling has been suggested as an additional strategy to address this need. The greatest concern with this approach in clinical settings is the potential for reduced sensitivity, particularly detection failures with weakly positive samples. To investigate this possibility, detection rates in pooled samples were evaluated, with a focus on pools containing weakly positive specimens. Additionally, the frequencies of occurrence of weakly positive samples during the pandemic were reviewed. Weakly positive specimens, with threshold cycle (CT ) values of 33 or higher, were detected in 95% of 60 five-sample pools but only 87% of 39 nine-sample pools. The proportion of positive samples with very low viral loads rose markedly during the first few months of the pandemic, peaking in June, decreasing thereafter, and remaining level since August. At all times, weakly positive specimens comprised a significant component of the sample population, ranging from 29% to >80% for CT values above 31. In assessing the benefits of pooling strategies, however, other aspects of the testing process must be considered. Accessioning, result data management, electronic data transfer, reporting, and billing are not streamlined and may be complicated by pooling procedures. Therefore, the impact on the entire laboratory process needs to be carefully assessed prior to implementing such a strategy.","output":"Assessment of Sample Pooling for Clinical SARS-CoV-2 Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 may include flu-like symptoms or even severe respiratory distress syndrome Among the complications of the disease are pulmonary, such as respiratory failure syndrome, pneumonia due to bacterial superinfection, pneumothorax and spontaneous pneumomediastinum CLINICAL CASES: Two cases of 58 and 69 years old male patients who were admitted with symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in which computed tomography performed upon admission showed findings of pneumomediastinum and bilateral ground glass infiltrates CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is a clinical affection little frequent in patients with COVID-19 infection","output":"Spontaneous pneumomediastinum associated to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Success in conducting clinical trials during the coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic requires the ability to innovate and adapt.

In the absence of established blinding procedures, such studies require special design considerations to minimize uncertainty or bias. METHODS We describe the processes and procedures developed for blinding of plasma in \\"Veterans Affairs CoronavirUs Research and Efficacy Studies-1\\" as a prototypical study using this class of investigational therapeutic agents. Veterans Affairs CoronavirUs Research and Efficacy Studies-1 is an ongoing multicenter randomized clinical trial testing the efficacy of plasma added to conventional therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection.

BACKGROUND: In 2015, the MERS epidemic struck Korea, and ill-prepared nurses had to care for patients with MERS. Nurses experienced conflict between their fear of the disease and their work and professional ethic. DESIGN: We employed a phenomenological qualitative approach. METHODS: Inductive, qualitative, in-depth interviews were performed with 17 nurses. The study process followed the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist. RESULTS: The qualitative inductive content analysis generated seven theme clusters and 18 themes. The theme clusters were \\"Fear of Uncertainty,\\" \\"Beyond Hesitation,\\" \\"A Scene Like a Battlefield,\\" \\"Chaotic Nursing Identity,\\" \\"Buttresses for Sustainability,\\" \\"Lingering Trauma\\" and \\"Expanded Horizon of Nursing.\\" The final analysis revealed that the core theme was \\"Beyond the fear of uncertainty.\\" CONCLUSIONS: This study contrives a more in-depth, holistic understanding by describing the experiences of nurses who directly cared for patients with MERS-the first large-scale infectious disease in Korea. Although nurses saw themselves as vital caregivers, they were frightened of the disease, had to work in a harsh environment, experienced various internal conflicts and had to deal with varying forms of uncertainty. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study sheds light on the nursing situation during crises involving serious infectious diseases; to combat these, more medical facilities are needed, and staff should be proactively guided on how to care for patients.

Pooled testing provides a single laboratory test result for the entire pod, rather than a separate result for each person in the pod. During the 2020-2021 school year, an independent preschoolCgrade 12 school in Washington, DC, used pooling in a pod for weekly on-site point-of-care testing of all staff members and students. Staff members and older students self-collected anterior nares samples, and trained staff members collected samples from younger students. Overall, 12 885 samples were tested in 1737 pools for 863 students and 264 staff members from November 30, 2020, through April 30, 2021. The average pool size was 7.4 people. The average time from sample collection to pool test result was 40 minutes. The direct testing cost per person per week was $24.24, including swabs.

Although several of these viruses are zoonotic, the majority are not. Astroviruses, transmitted fecal-orally, are commonly detected in a wide diversity of bat species, are prevalent at high rates and are not thought to directly infect humans. These features make astroviruses useful in examining virus evolutionary history, epidemiology in the host, and temporal shedding trends. Our study screened for the presence of astroviruses in bats in Singapore, reconstructed the phylogenetic relations of the polymerase genes and tested for population characteristics associated with infection. Of the seven species screened, astroviruses were detected in Rhinolophus lepidus and Eonycteris spelaea. The R. lepidus sequences grouped with other Rhinolophus astrovirus sequences from China and Laos, while the Eoncyteris sequences formed a distinct clade with astroviruses from Rousettus spp. in Laos and Pteropus giganteus in Bangladesh, but not with other E. spelaea sequences. Longitudinal collections of Eonycteris feces demonstrated variable shedding. Juvenile status of bats was a risk factor for astroviruses. This study highlights the diversity of astroviruses in nectivorous and insectivorous bats in Singapore and provides a predictive framework for understanding astrovirus infection in these bats. It also suggests that in addition to host phylogenetic relatedness, host ecology, such as roosting behavior, may drive co-infections, virus maintenance and spillover.","output":"Influence of age and body condition on astrovirus infection of bats in Singapore: An evolutionary and epidemiological analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Methods designed to measure SARS-CoV-2 humoral response include virus neutralization tests to determine antibody neutralization activity. For ease of use and universal applicability, surrogate virus neutralization tests (sVNTs) based on antibody-mediated blockage of molecular interactions have been proposed. A surrogate virus neutralization test was established on a label-free immunoassay platform (LF-sVNT). The LF-sVNT analyzes the binding ability of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to ACE2 after neutralizing RBD with antibodies in serum. The LF-sVNT neutralizing antibody titers (IC50) were determined from serum samples (n=246) from COVID-19 patients (n=113), as well as the IgG concentrations and the IgG avidity indices. Although there was variability in the kinetics of the IgG concentrations and neutralizing antibody titers between individuals, there was an initial rise, plateau and then in some cases a gradual decline at later timepoints after 40 days post-symptom onset. The IgG avidity indices, in the same cases, plateaued after an initial rise and did not show a decline. The LF-sVNT can be a valuable tool in research and clinical laboratories for the assessment of the presence of neutralizing antibodies to COVID-19. This study is the first to provide longitudinal neutralizing antibody titers beyond 200 days post-symptom onset. Despite the decline of IgG concentration and neutralizing antibody titer, IgG avidity index increases, reaches a plateau and then remains constant up to 8 months post-infection. The decline of antibody neutralization activity can be attributed to the reduction in antibody quantity rather than the deterioration of antibody quality, as measured by antibody avidity.","output":"A SARS-CoV-2 Label-Free Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test and a Longitudinal Study of Antibody Characteristics in COVID-19 Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diagnostic and treatment services for non\\\\communicable diseases (NCDs) face significant challenges in the context of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

One widely used measure was lockdown; workers who could work from home were instructed to do so, and nonessential businesses C including dental clinics -- were closed for weeks or months. The purpose of this investigation was to document the incidence of fixed orthodontic appliance failures and the periodontal health status of patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment during and after the lockdown period. Methods The sample comprised 350 orthodontic patients (mean age 16.85  2.59 years; 249 female, 101 male) who underwent orthodontic and periodontal examinations in Ad?yaman, Turkey after a mean lockdown period of 103.7  21.3 days. Frequencies of orthodontic bracket, elastic ligature, molar band, and miniscrew failures and of oral ulcers were recorded and periodontal parameters were assessed. The effects of sex, age, and the bracket systems used in the patients on the frequencies of these failures were analyzed. Results It was revealed that 15.42% (n=54) of all patients had at least one bracket bonding failure and 8.16% (n=4) of the patients with miniscrew implantation had at least one miniscrew failure. The incidence of bracket bonding failure was significantly higher in men than in women. No significant relationship was found between periodontal parameters and bracket bonding failure. Plaque and gingival scores were higher than those reported for a similar population before a lockdown.

Displacement and insecurity due to conflict, natural disasters, and epidemics place women and girls at higher risk of SRHR-related morbidity and mortality and reduce the coverage of essential SRHR services. This scoping review describes the measurement tools, methods, and indicators used to measure SRHR coverage and outcome indicators in humanitarian settings in the past 15 years and presents an accessible dashboard that can be used by governments, researchers and implementing organizations to identify available SRHR measurement tools. Methods: Scientific articles published between January 2004 and May 2019 were identified using Embase, Medline, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, PAIS index as well as relevant non-peer-reviewed literature available through websites of humanitarian organizations. Publications including data from low- or middle-income countries (LMICs), focused on women and/or girls living in areas impacted by a humanitarian crisis, where data was collected within five years of the crisis were included. Indicators extracted from these publications were categorized according to validated SRHR indicators recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Measurement tools, sampling and data collection methods, gap areas (geographical, topical and contextual), and indicators were catalogued for easy access in an interactive Tableau dashboard. Results: Our search yielded 42,081 peer-reviewed publications and 2,569 non-peer-reviewed reports. After initial title and abstract screening, 385 publications met the inclusion criteria. SRHR indicators were categorized into nine domains: abortion, antenatal care, family planning, gender-based violence, HIV and sexually transmitted infections, maternal health, maternal mortality, menstrual and gynecological health, and obstetric care (delivery). A total of 65 tools and questionnaires measuring SRHR were identified, of which 25 were designed specifically for humanitarian settings. Discussion: Although SRHR was measured in humanitarian settings, several gaps in measurement were identified. Abortion and gynaecological health were not consistently measured across included studies or validated WHO indicators.

This temperature difference, known as the urban heat island (UHI) effect, results from lack of vegetation, increased impervious surfaces, excess heat released from human activities, and changing radiation and wind dynamics due to urban morphology. UHI has been found to increase heat-related illnesses, and in some instances, mortalities among vulnerable populations. Heat exposure is particularly pertinent in 2020, as stay-at-home orders and higher unemployment rates due to the COVID-19 pandemic have further exposed urban residents to local temperatures. Certain socio-economic groups that are more affected by COVID-19 are disproportionately exposed to high urban temperatures. We investigated the relationships between urban heat island intensity (UHII), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and selected socio-economic factors for Dallas, TX and Phoenix, AZ for June 2020. We used an equal-weighting approach to combine socio-economic factors obtained from 2018 US Census Bureau data to determine socio-economic vulnerability, and used Landsat 8 imagery to derive NDVI and land surface temperature.

This study aimed to characterize ICU mobilization practices during the COVID-19 pandemic for patients with and without COVID-19. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of an international point prevalence study. All ICUs across the world were eligible to participate and were required to enroll all patients in each ICU on the survey date, 27 January 2021. The primary outcome was the achievement of mobilization at the level of sitting over the edge of the bed. Independent factors associated with mobilization, including COVID-19 infection, were analyzed by multivariable analysis. RESULTS: A total of 135 ICUs in 33 countries participated, for inclusion of 1229 patients. Among patients who were not receiving mechanical ventilation (MV), those with COVID-19 infection were mobilized more than those without COVID-19 (60% vs. 34%, p < 0.001). Among patients who were receiving MV, mobilization was low in both groups (7% vs. 9%, p = .56). These findings were consistent irrespective of ICU length of stay. Multivariable analysis showed that COVID-19 infection was associated with achievement of mobilization in patients without (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 4.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.71-7.42) and with MV (aOR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.00-4.51). Factors that prevented mobilization were prone positioning in patients without MV and continuous use of neuromuscular blockade and sedation agents in patients with MV, whereas facilitating factors were the presence of targets/goals in both groups. CONCLUSION: Mobilization rates for ICU patients across the globe are severely low, with the greatest immobility observed in mechanically ventilated patients. Although COVID-19 is not an independent barrier to the mobilization of patients with or without MV, this study has highlighted the current lack of mobility practice for all ICU patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This analysis sought to evaluate the timing at which mass testing took place in relation to the known presence of a COVID-19 infection and the resulting number of infections that occurred. In 15 LTCFs that performed facility-wide testing in response to an identified case, high prevalences of additional cases in residents and staff members were found at initial testing (28.0% and 7.4%, respectively), suggesting spread of infection had already occurred by the time the first case was identified. Prevalence was also high during follow-up, with a total of 42.4% of residents and 11.8% of staff members infected overall in the response facilities. In comparison, 13 LTCFs conducted testing as a preventive strategy before a case was identified.

METHODS: From January 2013 to February 2019, 16 patients with unstable pelvic fracture were treated, including 12 males and 4 females, aged from 20 to 60 years(mean 46.5 years). According to Tile classification, there were 4 cases of type B1, 6 cases of type B2, 4 cases of type C1 and 2 cases of type C2. The fracture of all patients was closed, and the time from injury to operation was 7 to 10 days with an average of 6.2 days. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, fracture reduction quality, fracture healing time, complications and limb function during the final follow-up were evaluated in 16 patients. RESULTS: All 16 patients were followed up for 12 to 23 months (mean 19.1 months). The operation time was 60 to 180 min (mean 107.8 min). The intraoperative blood loss was 120 to 600 ml (mean 368.1 ml). The fracture healing time was 12 to 20 weeks (mean 16.3 weeks). According to Matta criteria, the fracture reduction was excellent in 6 cases, good in 8 cases and fair in 2 cases. One patient suffered from lateral femoral cutaneous nerve injury during the operation, and the lateral thigh sensation decreased after operation, which recovered after 6 months. One patient had pain stimulated by internal fixation at the iliac fossa. The symptoms were improved after the internal fixation was removed. The fractures of 16 patients were healed satisfactorily and there was no internal fixation loosening.

CONCLUSION: Closed reduction and fixation of pelvic anterior ring fracture with long reconstruction plate combined with MIPPO technique through anterior approach has the advantages of less injury, less bleeding time during operation, saving operation time, high intraoperative safety, high fracture healing rate, early functional exercise after operation, and effective treatment of pelvic anterior ring fracture.","output":"[Fixation of anterior pelvic ring fracture with long reconstruction plate combined with MIPPO technique]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The envelope glycoprotein, GP64, of the baculovirus Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is a class III viral fusion protein that mediates pH-triggered membrane fusion during virus entry. Viral fusion glycoproteins from many viruses contain a short region in the ectodomain and near the transmembrane domain, referred to as the pre-transmembrane (PTM) domain. In some cases, the PTM domain is rich in aromatic amino acids and plays an important role in membrane fusion. Although the 23-amino-acid (aa) PTM domain of AcMNPV GP64 lacks aromatic amino acids, we asked whether this region might also play a significant role in membrane fusion. We generated alanine scanning and single and multiple amino acid substitutions in the GP64 PTM domain. We specifically focused on amino acid positions conserved between baculovirus GP64 and thogotovirus GP75 proteins, as well as hydrophobic and charged amino acids. For each PTM-modified construct, we examined trimerization, cell surface localization, and membrane fusion activity. Membrane merger and pore formation were also examined. We identified eight aa positions that are important for membrane fusion activity. Critical positions were not clustered in the linear sequence but were distributed throughout the PTM domain. While charged residues were not critical or essential, three hydrophobic amino acids (L465, L476, and L480) played an important role in membrane fusion activity and appear to be involved in formation of the fusion pore. We also asked whether selected GP64 constructs were capable of rescuing a gp64null AcMNPV virus. These studies suggested that several conserved residues (T463, G460, G462, and G474) were not required for membrane fusion but were important for budding and viral infectivity.","output":"The pre-transmembrane domain of the Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus GP64 protein is critical for membrane fusion and virus infectivity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is intended to show how the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the new Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus, affects the equitable distribution of health resources in Brazil, as well as to highlight the ethical and psychological dilemmas and barriers experienced by health professionals in the context of fighting disease The present study aimed to go through knowledge about bioethical issues related to the scarcity of resources and mental health Thus, an analysis of protocols on the allocation of newly published resources in Brazil was carried out Copyright ? 2020 Alessandra Torres, Aline Aparecida Arajo Flix, Priscila Iozelina Silveira de Oliveira","output":"Choices of sofia and the pandemic of COVID-19 in Brazil: Bioethical reflections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sickness absenteeism is an area of concern in nursing and is more concerning given the recent impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare.

The measures adopted by the government to decrease the spread of the disease, have probably taken a toll on the mental health of the population [1], and especially on young people, resulting on an increase in self-harm conducts. The term self-harm is used to explain a range of behaviors, and there is much debate within the literature as to what constitutes self-harm. For the purpose of this paper, we defined it as cutting, burning, biting, or hitting done directly to the body with the intention to regulate or express emotional distress, without a suicidal purpose. Self-injurious behavior has been considered symptomatic of more complex disorders, however in the more recent years we've witnessed a rapid increase and the normalization of the conduct on younger generations [2]. Even though there is no universal criteria recognised for deliberate self-harm, the increasing tendency has led changes in the way mental health workers understand it. The last edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5), for example, now includes self-harm on section 3 as a new diagnostic entity that needs further research [3]. On our daily clinical practice and to be precise, after the lockdown imposed by the government, we've too have seen an important surge on the numbers of young patients presenting with self-harm conducts. Considering the above, we propose 2 main objectives. On a general level, we want to verify if the increasing trend observed in the clinical practice is really founded and if it is in what percentage has it increased. On the other hand, in a more specific level we want to determine if there is a significant increase in the number of patients seen for the first time in our ambulatory practice presenting self-harm as part of their symptoms. We plan a retrospective comparative study, with a study period of 6 months prior to the lockdown (September 2019 to March 2020) and 6 months after the lockdown (September 2020 to March 2021) with a total of 629 new patients between the ages of 6 to 18 years, sent to our child and adolescent mental health ambulatory service. As preliminary conclusions we can highlight that it has been an increase of 50% in the number of first visits during the 6 months after the lockdown, in relation to the 6 months prior to lockdown. To our understanding this number strongly suggests the potential influence that COVID-19 pandemic has in the mental stability of young population. Furthermore, on the search for self-harm symptoms, we have noted that other symptoms generally associated to it like anxiety, depression, eating disorders, school absences among others, have spiked significantly, a finding that will need further analysis.

In Iran, the rate of CS increased from 40.7% in 2005 to 53% in 2014. This figure is even higher in the private sector. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the CS rates in the last 2 years using the Robson Classification System in Iran. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all in-hospital electronically recorded deliveries in Iran was conducted using the Robson classification. Comparisons were made in terms of the type of hospital, CS rate, and obstetric population, and contributions of each group to the overall cesarean deliveries were reported. RESULTS: Two million three hundred twenty-two thousand five hundred women gave birth, 53.6% delivered through CS. Robson group 5 was the largest contributing group to the overall number of cesarean deliveries (47.1%) at a CS rate of 98.4%. Group 2 and 1 ranked the second and third largest contributing groups to overall CSs (20.6 and 10.8%, respectively). The latter groups had CS rates much higher than the WHO recommendation of 67.2 and 33.1%, respectively. Fetal Distress and Undefined Indications were the most common reasons for cesarean deliveries at CS rates of 13.6 and 13.4%, respectively. There was a significant variation in CS rate among the three types of hospitals for Robson groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 10. CONCLUSION: The study revealed significant variations in CS rate by hospital peer-group, especially for the private maternity units, suggesting the need for further attention and audit of the Robson groups that significantly influence the overall CS rate. The study results will help policymakers identify effective strategies to reduce the CS rate in Iran, providing appropriate benchmarking to compare obstetric care with other countries that have better maternal and perinatal outcomes.

We collected observational data, including air pollutant concentrations and meteorological parameters, during January and February from 2018 to 2021. A statistical and a numerical model were applied to identify the formation of air pollution and the impact of emission reduction on air quality. Relative humidity, wind speed, SO2, NO2, and O3 had nonlinear effects on the PM2.5 concentration in Beijing, among which the effects of relative humidity, NO2, and O3 were prominent. During the 2020 epidemic period, high pollution concentrations were closely related to adverse meteorological conditions, with different parameters having different effects on the three pollution processes. In general, the unexpected reduction of anthropogenic emissions reduced the PM2.5 concentration, but led to an increase in the O3 concentration. Multi-scenario simulation results showed that anthropogenic emission reduction could reduce the average PM2.5 concentration after the Chinese Spring Festival, but improvement during days with heavy pollution was limited. Considering that O3 enhances the PM2.5 levels, to achieve the collaborative improvement of PM2.5 and O3 concentrations, further research should explore the collaborative emission reduction scheme with VOCs and NOx to achieve the collaborative improvement of PM2.5 and O3 concentrations.

This study aimed to identify PAL changes and examine the age-specific determinants of PAL in younger and older adolescents during the COVID-19 lockdown. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study included 859 high-school students from Bosnia and Herzegovina stratified into 2 age groups: younger (N = 420, 14-16 years of age), and older adolescents (N = 439, 16-18 years of age). Participants were tested over 2 testing waves: before the COVID-19 lockdown (January 2020) and during the COVID-19 lockdown (April 2020). Variables included PAL assessed by the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents, sports factors, and parental factors. RESULTS The PAL significantly declined as a result of lockdown measures in the total sample (from 2.760.79 to 2.500.82). Larger absolute and relative decline of PAL was evidenced in younger adolescents. Sport participation positively influenced PAL before lockdown, with no significant influence during the lockdown. Older adolescents whose mothers were better educated were less likely to be in high risk group with regard to a large decline of PAL as a result of COVID lockdown (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.21-0.84). CONCLUSIONS Results of the study suggest that parental education influences health-related behaviors and that parental education is a protective factor against a decrease in PAL during the COVID-19 pandemic. Main educational agents (i.e., school and parents) should pay more attention to provide children and adolescents adequate information and develop their health literacy, which will hopefully positively impact children's PAL even in challenging situations similar to COVID-19 lockdown.

It has many negative consequences on personal, organizational, and patient care levels. This systematic review aimed to analyze research articles where psychological interventions with elements of mindfulness (PIMs) were used to support physicians in order to reduce burnout and foster empathy and well-being. Methods: Systematic searches were conducted in May 2019, within six electronic databases PubMed, EBSCOhost MEDLINE, PsycArticles, Cochrane Library, JSTOR, and Slovenian national library information system. Different combinations of boolean operators were usedmindfulness, empathy, medicine/family medicine/general practice/primary care, burnout, doctors/physicians, intervention, and support group. Additional articles were manually searched from the reference list of the included articles. Studies with other healthcare professionals (not physicians and residents) and/or medical students, and those where PIMs were applied for educational or patients treatment purposes were excluded. Results: Of 1194 studies identified, 786 screened and 139 assessed for eligibility, there were 18 studies included in this review. Regardless of a specific type of PIMs applied, results, in general, demonstrate a positive impact on empathy, well-being, and reduction in burnout in participating physicians. Compared with other recent systematic reviews, this is unique due to a broader selection of psychological interventions and emphasis on a sustained effect measurement.

A specific treatment or proper therapy is still lacking, and the investigations from across the world for proper drug/vaccine development towards disease control are in progress. The Coronavirus replication takes place by the conversion of the polypeptide into functional protein and this occurs due to the key enzyme Main protease (M(pro)). Therefore, identification of natural and effective M(pro) inhibitors could be a safe and promising approach for COVID-19 control. METHODS: The present in silico study evaluates the effect of bioactive compounds found in Eucalyptus and Corymbia species essential oil on M(pro) by docking. Molecular docking of the major seven compounds of essential oil (citronellol, alpha-terpineol, eucalyptol, d-limonene, 3-carene, o-cymene, and alpha-pinene) with M(pro) was studied by AutoDock 4.2, and the properties were analysed by PreADMET and Biovia Discovery Studio visualizer. RESULTS: The calculated parameters such as binding energy, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bond interactions of 6LU7 (M(pro)) with Eucalyptus and Corymbia volatile secondary metabolites represented its scope as an effective therapy option against covid-19. Among the docked compounds, eucalyptol shows the least binding energy without toxicity.

Intensive-care-unit (ICU)-admitted and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) patients had the highest prevalence of IFIs. MELD-score(cases), bias-score, and sample size across studies were the predictors of variance in overall-FI-estimates. Diabetes, steroid and broad-spectrum antibiotic-exposure, and multiple organ failures were the common predispositions reported in patients with FIs. CONCLUSIONS FIs impose a substantial burden in cirrhosis. ACLF and ICU-admission should be considered as a host factor for defining IFIs.

In addition, the experimental equipment in many cases cannot meet the actual conditions and the experimental cost is very high. These comprehensive factors cause the existing casing design to not meet the actual conditions and cause casing deformation, affecting the drilling operation in Tarim oil field. The finite element method is the only effective method to solve this problem at present, but the re-modelling process is time-consuming because of the changes in the parameters, such as the cement properties, casing centrality, and the casing size. In this article, an artificial intelligence method based on support vector machine (SVM) to predict the maximum stress of an off-center casing under non-uniform ground stress has been proposed. After a program based on a radial basis function (RBF)-support vector regression (SVR) (-SVR) model was established and validated, we constructed a data sample with a capacity of 120 by using the finite element method, which could meet the demand of the nine-factor -SVR model to predict the maximum stress of the casing. The results showed that the artificial intelligence prediction method proposed in this manuscript had satisfactory prediction accuracy and could be effectively used to predict the maximum stress of an off-center casing under complex downhole conditions.

Methods HSCs were obtained from feline bone marrow and replicated in vitro. Three lentiviruses were constructed, each expressing a different anti-FCoV miRNA. HSCs were stably transduced with the miRNA-expressing lentivirus vector that produced the most effective viral inhibition in a feline cell line. The effectiveness of the transduction and the expression of anti-FCoV miRNA were tested by infecting the HSCs with two different strains of FCoV. The inhibition of coronavirus replication was determined by relative quantification of the inhibition of intracellular viral genomic RNA synthesis using real-time, reverse-transcription PCR. The assessment of virus replication inhibition was determined via titration of extracellular virus using the TCID50 assay. Results Inhibition of FCoV was most significant in feline cells expressing miRNA-L2 that targeted the viral leader sequence, 48 h postinfection. miRNA-L2 expression in stably transduced HSCs resulted in 90% and 92% reductions in FIPV WSU 79-1146 genomic RNA synthesis and extracellular virus production, respectively, as well as 74% and 80% reduction in FECV WSU 79-1683 genomic RNA synthesis and extracellular virus production, respectively, as compared with an infected negative control sample producing non-targeting miRNA.

METHODS Forty-three patients were intubated with a double-lumen endobronchial tube. After positioning the patients in the lateral decubitus, one-lung ventilation was started with 100% oxygen, tidal volume 10 ml/kg without PEEP; arterial oxygen tension, plateau airway pressure, and static compliance were checked as baseline values (T0). Fifteen minutes later, same parameters were measured (T15). The tidal volume had changed to 6 ml/kg with 6 cmH2O PEEP. Fifteen minutes later, the same parameters were measured (T30). RESULTS Oxygen tension had decreased at T15 (282.1  83.4 mmHg) compared to T0 (477.2  82.4 mmHg) (P < 0.0001), but was maintained at T30 (270.4  81.9 mmHg).

CONCLUSIONS In carrying out one-lung ventilation for thoracic surgery using an endoscope, the addition of a PEEP of 6 cmH2O in the dependent lung, while reducing the tidal volume of 6 ml/kg, both oxygen tension and lung compliance are maintained without increasing the plateau airway pressure.

A range of frontline government employees work to protect public health, providing services for people engaged in animal-based livelihoods (livestock owners and butchers), and enforcing meat safety and food premises standards. In contrast to literature which emphasises the inadequacy of extension support and food safety policy implementation in low- and middle-income countries, this paper foregrounds the street-level diplomacy deployed by frontline actors operating in challenging contexts. METHODS: This research is based on semi-structured interviews with 61 government employees, including livestock extension officers/meat inspectors and health officers, across 10 randomly-selected rural and urban wards. RESULTS: Frontline actors combined formal and informal strategies including the leveraging of formal policy texts and relationships with other state employees, remaining flexible and recognising that poverty constrained peoples ability to comply with health regulations. They emphasised the need to work with livestock keepers and butchers to build their knowledge to self-regulate and to work collaboratively to ensure meat safety. Remaining adaptive and being hesitant to act punitively unless absolutely necessary cultivated trust and positive relations, making those engaged in animal-based livelihoods more open to learning from and cooperating with extension officers and inspectors. This may result in higher levels of meat safety than might be the case if frontline actors stringently enforced regulations. CONCLUSION: The current tendency to view frontline actors partial enforcement of meat safety regulations as a failure obscures the creative and proactive ways in which they seek to ensure meat safety in a context of limited resources. Their application of street-level diplomacy enables them to be sensitive to local socio-economic realities, to respect local social norms and expectations and to build support for health safety interventions when necessary. More explicitly acknowledging the role of trust and positive state-society relations and the diplomatic skills deployed by frontline actors as a formal part of their inspection duties offers new perspectives and enhanced understandings on the complicated nature of their work and what might be done to support them.

The evaluation process of VAMs is heterogeneous across countries, and it has been primarily designed for originator pharmaceuticals with confirmatory evidence collected alongside pivotal clinical trials. There is a mismatch between evidence requirements by public decision-makers and evidence generated by manufacturers of VAMs. Our objective was to develop a core evaluation framework for VAMs. METHODS: Potential benefits offered by VAMs were collected through a systematic literature review and allocated to separate domains in an iterative process. The draft list of domains and their applicability were validated during two consecutive virtual workshops by health policy experts representing countries with different economic statuses, geographical and decision-making contexts. RESULTS: Based on 158 extracted studies, the final consensus on the evaluation framework resulted in 11 value domains in 5 main clusters, including unmet medical needs, health gain (measured by health care professionals), patient-reported outcomes, burden on households, and burden on the health care system. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed framework could reduce the heterogeneity in value assessment processes across countries and create incentives for manufacturers to invest in incremental innovation.

A Healthy People 2010 objective (14-8) is to reduce the annual incidence of Lyme disease to 9.7 new cases per 100,000 population in 10 reference states where the disease is endemic (Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin). This report summarizes surveillance data for 64,382 Lyme disease cases reported to CDC during 2003-2005, of which 59,770 cases (93%) were reported from the 10 reference states. The average annual rate in these 10 reference states for the 3-year period (29.2 cases per 100,000 population) was approximately three times the Healthy People 2010 target. Persons living in Lyme disease--endemic areas can take steps to reduce their risk for infection, including daily self-examination for ticks, selective use of acaricides and tick repellents, use of landscaping practices that reduce tick populations in yards and play areas, and avoidance of tick-infested areas.","output":"Lyme disease--United States, 2003-2005."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine parvovirus (PPV) causes reproductive failure in pigs, which leads to economic losses to the industry.

We scheduled 8 repeated physical examinations with venous blood collection every 1C2 weeks from 9 September 2019 to 7 January 2020 in a panel of 70 healthy adults (aged 18C26) in Wuhan, China. We measured the individual hourly PM 2.5 concentrations, fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin (FINS) along HOMA-B and HOMA-IR. The linear mixed-effect model was conducted to evaluate the acute effect of PM 2.5 on glucose homeostasis. PM 2.5 concentrations range varied from 7.38 to 115.38 g/m3, with an average level of 38.34 g/m3. Each 10 g/m3 increment in 3-days PM 2.5 moving average was associated with a 4.19% increase in FINS (95% CI: 2.35, 6.05), 5.95% increase in HOMA-B (95% CI: 3.66, 8.26), and 3.77% increase in HOMA-IR (95% CI: 1.41, 4.64), respectively. We found the adverse effect on HOMA-IR was greater in the overweight (%Change = 7.98;95% CI: 3.54, 12.61) than in the normal-weight (%Change = 3.35;95% CI: 1.34, 5.38). And the lifestyle factors, such as exercise also showed a modification effect on the short-term association between PM 2.5 and glucose homeostasis. Conclusively, exposure to PM 2.5 for short-term, even within hours, was positively associated with elevated IR status and impaired glucose homeostasis in the healthy population. The result may suggest a plausible biological pathway underlying PM 2.5 and metabolic events. ? Short-term exposure to PM 2.5 was associated with elevated FINS, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-B. ?

Conventionally, public health is viewed as an evidence-based profession that is above politics. Yet national responses to COVID-19 in India reveal the embeddedness of health and illnesses in the larger politics of the state. Although it is still early to assess the full spectrum of damage caused by lack of central-level planning, this article argues against COVID-19 being viewed as a 'great leveller'. Rather, it suggests that we inhabit somatic societies that regularly employ the vocabulary of pathology/disease to determine social health. Moreover, the Indian experience illustrates how, even during a pandemic, 'social distancing' is not an apolitical notion. It becomes a measure for the state to co-opt scientific interventions of risk mitigation and relay them to people as a metaphor for exclusion: thereby exacerbating deeper structural inequities around which access to health and well-being of the population is organised.","output":"'Social distancing' during COVID-19: the metaphors and politics of pandemic response in India."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute kidney injury (AKI), a critical syndrome characterized by a sudden reduction of renal function, is a common disorder among elderly patients particularly in Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

Specific hemodynamic, metabolic, and molecular changes lead to increased susceptibility to injury in the aged kidney; therefore, certain causes of AKI such as the prerenal reduction in renal perfusion or vascular obstructive conditions are more common in the elderly; moreover, AKI is often multifactorial and iatrogenic. Older patients present several comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, heart failure) and are exposed to multiple medical interventions such as the use of nephrotoxic contrasts media and medications, which can also trigger AKI.

DESIGN: A retrospective, control, cohort study. SETTING: Six cancer centres in the North of England representing a combined population of 11.5 million. METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively for all diagnoses of cervical cancer during May-October 2019 (Pre-COVID cohort) and May-October 2020 (COVID cohort). Data were used to generate tools to forecast case numbers for the next 3 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Histology, stage, presentation, onset of symptoms, investigation and type of treatment. Patients with recurrent disease were excluded. RESULTS: 406 patients were registered across the study periods; 233 in 2019 and 173 in 2020, representing a 25.7% (n = 60) reduction in absolute numbers of diagnoses. This was accounted for by a reduction in the number of low stage cases (104 in 2019 to 77 in 2020). Adding these data to the additional cases associated with a temporary cessation in screening during the pandemic allowed development of forecasts, suggesting that over the next 3 years there would be 586, 228 and 105 extra cases of local, regional and distant disease, respectively, throughout England. Projection tools suggest that increasing surgical capacity by two or three cases per month per centre would eradicate this excess by 12 months and 7 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There is likely to be a significant increase in cervical cancer cases presenting over the next 3 years. Increased surgical capacity could mitigate this with little increase in morbidity or mortality. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Covid will result in 919 extra cases of cervical cancer in England alone.

We also examined the influence of the nurses socio\\\\demographic and professional characteristics on the professional quality of life. Moreover, the study examined the influence of professional quality of life on caring behaviour among the nurses amid the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: Caring is the core of the nursing profession and considered the heart of the humanistic clinical nursing practice. However, the work nature of the clinical nurses, especially during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, continues to challenge their professional quality of life and caring behaviours. The factors influencing the professional quality of life and caring behaviours of clinical nurses have not been extensively explored. DESIGN: Cross\\\\sectional, descriptive study. METHODS: A purposive sample of 375 clinical nurses in three academic medical centres in Saudi Arabia were surveyed using the professional quality of life version 5 and the short\\\\form 24\\\\item Caring Behavior Inventory from MayCAugust 2020. A standard multiple regression analysis was performed to investigate the predictors of the professional quality of life and caring behaviour. This study adhered to the recommendations of the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. RESULTS: The majority of the respondents reported average level of compassion satisfaction (57.9%), burnout (54.4%) and secondary traumatic stress (66.9%) in the professional quality of life domains. The result also showed highest degree of caring in terms of assurance of human presence while lowest in the knowledge and skills in four subscales of caring behaviour. The following variables significantly predicted compassion satisfaction: education, area of assignment and position. Age, education and religion were identified as significant predictors of burnout while religion, nationality and position were significant predictors of secondary traumatic stress. Positive and negative domains of professional quality of life influenced the caring behaviours among clinical nurses. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of the study, clinical nurses exhibited moderate level of professional quality of life and correlates to their caring behaviours. Moreover, clinical nurses demographic characteristics predicted their professional quality of life and caring behaviours.

We categorised 85,629 ICU admissions as youngest (18-64 years), older (65-79 years) and oldest ( 80 years). The oldest group accounted for 15% of admissions, the older age group 39% and the youngest group 46%. Relative to the national population, the incidence of admission rates per 10,000 population in the oldest group decreased significantly over the study period from 91.5/10,000 in 2008 to 77.5/10,000 (a relative decrease of 15%), and among the older group from 89.2/10,000 in 2008 to 75.3/10,000 in 2017 (a relative decrease of 16%). We observed significant decreases in admissions with high comorbidity (modified Charlson comorbidity index); increases in the proportion of older patients admitted who were considered 'fit' rather than frail (electronic frailty index); and decreases in admissions with a medical diagnosis.

Grossly, numerous firm masses, 0.5-2.5 cm diameter, were randomly located in the left lobe of the pancreas. Histologic examination revealed that the pancreatic mass consisted of 2 tumor cell types: mostly small round cells with a minority of epithelial cells. The small cells were arranged in nests of various sizes, which were separated by thin fibrous stroma, and had small, round, hyperchromatic nuclei, scant cytoplasm containing argyrophilic granules, and often formed rosettes. The epithelial cells formed luminal structures. Metastases were observed in the liver, greater omentum, and pancreatic, gastric, pulmonary, and mediastinal lymph nodes. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that the small cells were positive for vimentin, neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin A, cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, and trypsin, whereas the epithelial cells were positive for AE1/AE3, trypsin, CK19, and nestin.

Without extra-genital screening, many chlamydia and gonorrhea infections would be missed among MSM. Yet, many barriers exist to extra-genital testing, and, in particular, to rectal collection. Self-collection increases screening and detection of asymptomatic chlamydia and gonorrhea among at-risk MSM and transgender women. This feasibility study assessed use of rectal self-collection and its acceptance among patients and primary care providers (PCPs) at a large, general practice community health center. The primary objective of this project was to assess the feasibility of including rectal self-collection as part of an implementation study looking to embed an STI care program in a safety-net primary care setting that would shift routine screening tasks to non-provider clinical team members such as medical assistants and nurses. METHODS: Three PCPs identified and offered rectal self-collection to their MSM and transgender female patients who were due for routine or risk-based STI screening. For those patients who elected to participate in the study, the PCPs medical assistant (MA) reviewed the self-collection instructions with them as part of their routine preventive care duties, and patients collected their own sample. Patients and PCPs completed brief cross-sectional surveys assessing the self-collection process. RESULTS: Of 1191 patients with sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data on file who were seen for a medical visit by one of the three PCPs, 87 (7.3%) identified as MSM or transgender female. Seventy-five were due for rectal screening, of whom 33 (44%) were offered and completed rectal self-collection. Survey results indicated that self-collection was acceptable to and preferred over clinician-collection by both PCPs and patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that rectal self-collection is feasible as part of STI screening in a high-volume primary care setting, and can be administered as part of the clinical tasks that MAs routinely conduct. The overall acceptance by both PCPs and patients will allow the inclusion of rectal self-collection in an implementation study looking to increase STI screening at a large community health center by facilitating MA-led collection during medical provider visits and by establishing standalone nurse-led STI visits.","output":"Rectal specimen self-collection for chlamydia and gonorrhea screening: a cross-sectional feasibility study at a community health center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intramuscular injection of DNA vectors expressing the extracellular vesicle (EV)-anchoring protein Nef(mut) fused at its C-terminus to viral and tumor antigens elicit a potent, effective, and anti-tolerogenic CD8(+) T cell immunity against the heterologous antigen The immune response is induced through the production of EVs incorporating Nef(mut)-derivatives released by muscle cells In the perspective of a possible translation into the clinic of the Nef(mut)-based vaccine platform, we aimed at increasing its safety profile by identifying the minimal part of Nef(mut) retaining the EV-anchoring protein property We found that a C-terminal deletion of 29-amino acids did not affect the ability of Nef(mut) to associate with EVs The EV-anchoring function was also preserved when antigens from both HPV16 (i e , E6 and E7) and SARS-CoV-2 (i e , S1 and S2) were fused to its C-terminus Most important, the Nef(mut) C-terminal deletion did not affect levels, quality, and diffusion at distal sites of the antigen-specific CD8(+) T immunity We concluded that the C-terminal Nef(mut) truncation does not influence stability, EV-anchoring, and CD8(+) T cell immunogenicity of the fused antigen Hence, the C-terminal deleted Nef(mut) may represent a safer alternative to the full-length isoform for vaccines in humans","output":"The C-Terminal Domain of Nef(mut) Is Dispensable for the CD8(+) T Cell Immunogenicity of In Vivo Engineered Extracellular Vesicles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CD8+ T cells are crucial for anti-viral immunity, however, understanding T cell responses requires the identification of epitopes presented by Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA).

Kaolinite (turbidity agent) and humic acids (HA, model of organic matter) were used in a factorial design of experiments (Turbidity from 0 to 5 NTU, and HA from 0 to 3.5 mg/L) to investigate their effect on UVC inactivation of MS2 phage in surface water. A collimated beam (12 W) and a commercial UVC disinfection flow system (16 W) designed to provide drinking water at households were used. The UVC flow system both in the laboratory and in the field was able to achieve the reduction requirements established by WHO (LRV >3.5 for all tested conditions), confirming the good performance of the studied UVC disinfection system.

While vascular alterations have been associated with IPF previously, the contribution of lung vasculature during injury resolution and fibrosis is not well understood. To compare the role of endothelial cells (ECs) in resolving and non-resolving models of lung fibrosis, we applied bleomycin intratracheally to young and aged mice. We found that injury in aged mice elicited capillary rarefaction, while injury in young mice resulted in increased capillary density. ECs from the lungs of injured aged mice relative to young mice demonstrated elevated pro-fibrotic and reduced vascular homeostasis gene expression. Among the latter, Nos3 (encoding the enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase, eNOS) was transiently upregulated in lung ECs from young but not aged mice following injury. Young mice deficient in eNOS recapitulated the non-resolving lung fibrosis observed in aged animals following injury, suggesting that eNOS directly participates in lung fibrosis resolution. Activation of the NO receptor soluble guanylate cyclase in human lung fibroblasts reduced TGF-induced pro-fibrotic gene and protein expression. Additionally, loss of eNOS in human lung ECs reduced the suppression of TGF-induced lung fibroblast activation in 2D and 3D co-cultures. Altogether, our results demonstrate that persistent lung fibrosis in aged mice is accompanied by capillary rarefaction, loss of EC identity, and impaired eNOS expression.

The promising development of FR systems over the past years has been challenged by the outbreak of COVID-19. Whilst increased numbers and worse outcomes of cardiac arrests during the pandemic suggest a need for expansion of FR schemes, appropriate risk management is required to protect first responders and patients from contracting COVID-19. This study investigated how European FR schemes were affected by the pandemic and what measures were taken to protect patients and responders from COVID-19. METHODS: To identify FR schemes in Europe we conducted a literature search and a web search. The schemes were contacted and invited to answer an online questionnaire during the second wave of the pandemic (December 2020/ January 2021) in Europe. RESULTS: We have identified 135 FR schemes in 28 countries and included responses from 47 FR schemes in 16 countries. 25 schemes reported deactivation due to COVID-19 at some point, whilst 22 schemes continued to operate throughout the pandemic. 39 schemes communicated a pandemic-specific algorithm to their first responders. Before the COVID-19 outbreak 20 FR systems did not provide any personal protective equipment (PPE). After the outbreak 19 schemes still did not provide any PPE. The majority of schemes experienced falling numbers of accepted call outs and decreasing registrations of new volunteers. Six schemes reported of FR having contracted COVID-19 on a mission. CONCLUSIONS: European FR schemes were considerably affected by the pandemic and exhibited a range of responses to protect patients and responders. Overall, FR schemes saw a decrease in activity, which was in stark contrast to the high demand caused by the increased incidence and mortality of OHCA during the pandemic.

It shares the functionally conserved CD225 domain and multiple critical amino acid residues (Y19, F74, F77, R86 and Y98) with its human ortholog, which are essential for antiviral activity. Ectopic expression of sIFITM3 significantly inhibited non-enveloped foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection in BHK-21 cells. Furthermore, sIFITM3 blocked FMDV infection at early steps in the virus life cycle by disrupting viral attachment to the host cell surface. Importantly, inoculation of 2-day-old suckling mice with a plasmid expressing sIFITM3 conferred protection against lethal challenge with FMDV. These results suggest that sIFITM3 is a promising antiviral agent and that can safeguard the host from infection with FMDV.","output":"Swine interferon-induced transmembrane protein, sIFITM3, inhibits foot-and-mouth disease virus infection in vitro and in vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Little has been published on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) among Medicare patients at high risk (HR) of RSV complications due to age or comorbidity. METHODS: Adult patients (at least 18 years of age) with at least 1 diagnostic code for RSV were identified using the 5% US Medicare database from 2011 through 2015. Patients were required to have continuous health plan enrollment for 180 days pre- and 180 days post-RSV diagnosis (baseline and follow-up periods, respectively). HR was defined as diagnosis of chronic lung disease, congestive heart failure, or weakened immune system for 180 days during the baseline period. Patients were categorized as initially hospitalized if hospitalized within 1 day of RSV diagnosis. Logistic regression models were developed to determine predictors of initial hospitalization. Healthcare utilization and costs for 180 days pre- and post-RSV diagnosis were compared. RESULTS: The study included 756 HR patients who were initially hospitalized with RSV diagnoses. Among these, 61.7% were diagnosed in the emergency department vs 15.3% in a physicians office, with hypertension (76.3%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (53.7%), and high cholesterol (52.0%) observed as the most prevalent comorbidities. Of these, COPD, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and previous evidence of pneumonia were significant predictors of hospitalization. Other significant predictors of hospitalization included older age, hematological malignancies, stroke, and baseline healthcare resource use. Among both HR and non-HR hospitalized patients, there was a significant increase in healthcare resource utilization following hospitalization, including the number of inpatient admissions and longer hospital stays post-RSV diagnosis. The total mean all-cause healthcare costs among HR hospitalized patients increased by $9210 per patient (p < 0.0001) post-RSV diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries with RSV infections pose a significant healthcare burden as compared with non-hospitalized patients, mainly driven by higher comorbidity, higher likelihood of multiple inpatient admissions, and costly medical interventions.","output":"A Real-World Analysis of Patient Characteristics and Predictors of Hospitalization Among US Medicare Beneficiaries with Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unilateral absence of the pulmonary vein, known as pulmonary vein atresia, is a rare type of unilateral pulmonary venous hypoplasia caused by the congenital atrophy of the long pulmonary vein segments in one lung.

However, advanced applications of these technologies in architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) businesses remain nascent. While it is in demand, the use of these technologies in developing the AEC digital pedagogy and for improving professional competence have received little attention. This paper presents a set of five novel digital technologies utilising virtual and augmented reality and digital twin, which adds value to the literature by showing their usefulness in the delivery of construction courses. The project involved designing, developing, and implementing a construction augmented reality (AR), including Piling AR (PAR) and a virtual tunnel boring machine (VTBM) module. The PAR is a smartphone module that presents different elements of a building structure, the footing system, and required equipment for footing construction. VTBM is developed as a multiplayer and avatar-included module for experiencing mechanisms of a tunnel boring machine. The novelty of this project is that it developed innovative immersive construction modules, practices of implementing digital pedagogy, and presenting the capacity of virtual technologies for education.

Once during the height of the first wave of COVID-19 in Belgium, and a second time at the end of the first wave. The professional quality of life-scale 5 (PROQOL-5) was used to measure compassion fatigue, which includes burnout, compassion satisfaction and secondary trauma. Non-parametric tests were performed. RESULTS: In total, 104 participants answered the first survey, and 107 the second.

CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 46-year-old man presented to a hospital emergency department with pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, anorexia, and chills. The patient was intubated for pneumonia-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome. DIAGNOSIS: A nasopharyngeal swab specimen was positive for SARS-CoV-2, and chest radiography confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: After no improvement with mechanical ventilation and prone positioning, the patient began receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and was transferred to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation center.

In porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), the only gene at this location, ORF3, encodes a 224-residue membrane protein shown to exhibit ion channel activity and to enhance virus production. However, little is known about its intracellular trafficking or about its function during PEDV infection. In this study, two recombinant PEDVs were rescued by targeted RNA recombination, one carrying the full-length ORF3 gene and one from which the gene had been deleted entirely. These viruses as well as a PEDV encoding a naturally truncated ORF3 protein were employed to study the ORF3 protein's subcellular trafficking. In addition, ORF3 expression vectors were constructed to study the protein's independent transport. Our results show that the ORF3 protein uses the exocytic pathway to move to and accumulate in the Golgi area of the cell similarly in infected and transfected cells. Like the S protein, but unlike the other structural proteins M and N, the ORF3 protein was additionally observed at the surface of PEDV-infected cells. In addition, the C-terminally truncated ORF3 protein entered the exocytic pathway but it was unable to leave the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Consistently, a Yxx? motif essential for ER exit was identified in the C-terminal domain. Finally, despite the use of sensitive antibodies and assays no ORF3 protein could be detected in highly purified PEDV particles, indicating that the protein is not a structural virion component.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses typically express several accessory proteins. They vary in number and nature, and only one is conserved among most of the coronaviruses, pointing at an important biological function for this protein. PEDV is peculiar in that it expresses just this one accessory protein, termed the ORF3 protein. While its analogs in other coronaviruses have been studied to different extents, and these studies have indicated that they share an ion channel property, little is still known about the features and functions of the PEDV ORF3 protein except for its association with virulence. In this investigation, we studied the intracellular trafficking of the ORF3 protein both in infected cells and when expressed independently. In addition, we analyzed the effects of mutations in five sorting motifs in its C-terminal domain and investigated whether the protein, found to follow the same exocytic route by which the viral structural membrane proteins travel, is also incorporated into virions.","output":"Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus ORF3 Protein Is Transported through the Exocytic Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) which caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is a pandemic threat to global public health.

Timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is the key in containing the pandemic and breaking the chain of transmission. In low- and middle-income countries availability of testing kits has become the major bottleneck in testing. Novel methods like pooling of samples are the need of the hour. OBJECTIVE: We undertook this study to evaluate a novel protocol of pooling of RNA samples/elutes in performance of PCR for SARS CoV-2 virus. STUDY DESIGN: Extracted RNA samples were randomly placed in pools of 8 on a 96 well plate. Both individual RNA (ID) and pooled RNA RT-qPCR for the screening E gene were done in the same plate and the positivity for the E gene was seen. RESULTS: The present study demonstrated that pool testing with RNA samples can easily detect even up to a single positive sample with Ct value as high as 38. The present study also showed that the results of pool testing is not affected by number of positive samples in a pool. CONCLUSION: Pooling of RNA samples can reduce the time and expense, and can help expand diagnostic capabilities, especially during constrained supply of reagents and PCR kits for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Pooled RNA sample reverse transcriptase real time PCR assay for SARS CoV-2 infection: A reliable, faster and economical method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly around the world and poses a serious threat to human life and property. The virus has a devastating effect on the human lungs, and early detection is important to prevent transmission with COVID-19. Therefore, for stopping the further spread of COVID-19, it is important to investigate how to accurately identify COVID-19 from chest x-ray images. Although some deep convolutional neural network-based pneumonia identification methods have achieved good results, these methods do not take discriminative properties into account. Specifically, these methods have only learned the indicative features of pneumonia, but not the discriminant features. Therefore, to solve this problem, we put forward a Discriminant CNN model. By introducing an extra discriminative regularization term, the model has enough power to learn both representative and discriminative features.

We assessed whether COVID-19 worry was related to indicators of mental health and preparedness for future care, in an adult lifespan sample. METHOD: An online study (n = 485; age 18-82, M = 49.31, SD = 15.39) included measures of COVID-19 worry, depression, general anxiety, health anxiety, hostile and benevolent ageism, preparedness for future care, and demographic information. RESULTS: Age and living alone were positively associated with greater COVID-19 worry, as were health anxiety, general anxiety, benevolent ageism, and preparedness for future care needs via gathering information. A significant interaction indicated that among individuals reporting lower health anxiety, greater preference for gathering information was positively associated with greater COVID-19 worry; however, for individuals having high health anxiety, gathering information about future care was not related to COVID-19 worry, as their COVID-19 worry levels were moderately high. CONCLUSION: Older age was associated with greater COVID-19 worry, perhaps in response to the much publicized greater risk for negative outcomes in this population. In spite of this specific concern, indicators of older adults' continued mental health emerged.

Amid high rates of mental illness among public safety personnel, we interviewed a purposely selected sample of 21 paramedics from a single service in Ontario, Canada, to explore incongruence between an espoused and able-to-enact paramedic role identity. Situated in an interpretivist epistemology and using successive rounds of thematic analysis, we developed a framework for role identity dissonance wherein chronic, identity-relevant disruptive events cause emotional and psychological distress. While some participants were able to recalibrate their sense of self and understanding of the role, for others, this dissonance was irreconcilable, contributing to disability and lost time from work.

The new and fast dynamics of the pandemic are challenging the health systems of different countries. In the absence of vaccines or effective treatments, mitigation policies, such as social isolation and lock-down of cities, have been adopted, but the results vary among different countries. Some countries were able to control the disease at the moment, as is the case of South Korea. Others, like Italy, are now experiencing the peak of the pandemic. Finally, countries with emerging economies and social issues, like Brazil, are in the initial phase of the pandemic. In this work, we use mathematical models with time-dependent coefficients, techniques of inverse and forward uncertainty quantification, and sensitivity analysis to characterize essential aspects of the COVID-19 in the three countries mentioned above. The model parameters estimated for South Korea revealed effective social distancing and isolation policies, border control, and a high number in the percentage of reported cases. In contrast, underreporting of cases was estimated to be very high in Brazil and Italy. In addition, the model estimated a poor isolation policy at the moment in Brazil, with a reduction of contact around 40%, whereas Italy and South Korea estimated numbers for contact reduction are at 75% and 90%, respectively. This characterization of the COVID-19, in these different countries under different scenarios and phases of the pandemic, supports the importance of mitigation policies, such as social distancing. In addition, it raises serious concerns for socially and economically fragile countries, where underreporting poses additional challenges to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic by significantly increasing the uncertainties regarding its dynamics.","output":"Characterization of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of uncertainties, mitigation strategies, and underreporting of cases in South Korea, Italy, and Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This commentary aimed to deconstruct xenophobia and its worldwide impact, particularly on people of Asian descent, amid the global COVID-19 pandemic.

We conducted a city-level seroprevalence study in Holyoke, Massachusetts, USA to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and risk factors for seropositivity. Methods: We invited inhabitants of 2,000 randomly sampled addresses between November 5 and December 31, 2020. Participants completed questionnaires measuring sociodemographic and health characteristics, and COVID-19 exposure history, and provided dried blood spots for measurement of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies. We calculate total and subgroup seroprevalence estimates based on presence of IgG antibodies using a Bayesian procedure that incorporates uncertainty in antibody test sensitivity and specificity. We account for clustering by household and weighting based on demographic characteristics to ensure estimates represented the citys population. Findings: We enrolled 280 households including 472 individuals. 328 underwent antibody testing. The citywide seroprevalence estimate of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 13.1% (95%CI 6.9-22.3) compared to 9.8% based on publicly reported case counts. Seroprevalence was 16.1% (95%CI 6.2-31.8) among individuals identifying as Hispanic compared to 9.4% (95%CI 4.6-16.4) among those identifying as non-Hispanic white. Seroprevalence was higher among Spanish speaking households (21.9%; 95% CI 8.3-43.9) compared to English speaking households (10.2%; 95% CI 5.2-18.0) and among individuals living in high vulnerability areas (14.4%; 95% CI 7.1-25.5) compared to low vulnerability areas (8.2%; 95% CI 3.1-16.9). Interpretation: The measured SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of IgG antibodies in Holyoke was only 13.1% during the second surge of SARS-CoV-2 in this region, far from accepted thresholds for herd immunity. Already vulnerable communities were at highest risk of prior infection. Implementation of local serosurveys in tandem with proactive public health interventions that address disparities in SARS-CoV-2 exposure are crucial to ensure at-risk communities have appropriate educational materials and access to vaccines, testing, and timely treatment.","output":"Disparities in SARS-CoV-2 exposure: evidence from a citywide seroprevalence study in Holyoke, Massachusetts, USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: In life-threatening Covid-19, corticosteroids reduce mortality, suggesting that immune responses have a causal role in death. Whether this deleterious inflammation is primarily a direct reaction to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 or an independent immunopathologic process is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine SARS-CoV-2 organotropism and organ-specific inflammatory responses, and the relationships between viral presence, inflammation, and organ injury. METHODS: Tissue was acquired from eleven detailed post-mortem examinations. SARS-CoV-2 organotropism was mapped by multiplex PCR and sequencing, with cellular resolution achieved by in situ viral spike protein detection. Histological evidence of inflammation was quantified from 37 anatomical sites, and the pulmonary immune response characterized by multiplex immunofluorescence. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Multiple aberrant immune responses in fatal Covid-19 were found, principally involving the lung and reticuloendothelial system, and these were not clearly topologically associated with the virus. Inflammation and organ dysfunction did not map to the tissue and cellular distribution of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein, both between and within tissues. An arteritis was identified in the lung, which was further characterised as a monocyte/myeloid-rich vasculitis, and occurred along with an influx of macrophage/monocyte-lineage cells into the pulmonary parenchyma. In addition, stereotyped abnormal reticulo-endothelial responses, including excessive reactive plasmacytosis and iron-laden macrophages, were present and dissociated from viral presence in lymphoid tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue-specific immunopathology occurs in Covid-19, implicating a significant component of immune-mediated, virus-independent immunopathology as a primary mechanism in severe disease. Our data highlight novel immunopathological mechanisms, and validate ongoing and future efforts to therapeutically target aberrant macrophage and plasma cell responses as well as promoting pathogen tolerance in Covid-19.

Results: After critical appraisal, thirteen full journal articles were included in the study. The studies showed the most frequent cognitive impairment are attention, memory, and executive function in COVID-19 patients. Compared with healthy controls (HC) in 3 out of 4 studies, cognitive impairment was only evident in COVID-19 patients.

To address the underlying etiology, we examined postmortem thoracic lymph nodes and spleens in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and observed the absence of germinal centers, a striking reduction in Bcl-6+ germinal center B cells but preservation of AID+ B cells. Absence of germinal centers correlated with an early specific block in Bcl-6+TFH cell differentiation together with an increase in T-bet+TH1 cells and aberrant extra-follicular TNF-a accumulation. Parallel peripheral blood studies revealed loss of transitional and follicular B cells in severe disease and accumulation of SARS-CoV-2-specific \\"disease-related\\" B cell populations.

However, the observed effects may be confounded by patient factors and preventive behaviours or vaccine-related differences in testing behaviour. To assess the potential degree of confounding, we aimed to estimate differences in testing behaviour between unvaccinated and vaccinated populations. Methods We recruited 1,526 Australian adults for an online randomised study about COVID testing between October and November 2021, and collected self-reported vaccination status and three measures of COVID-19 testing behaviour. We examined the association between testing intentions and vaccination status in the cross-sectional baseline data of this trial. Results Of the 1,526 participants (mean age 31 years): 22% had a COVID-19 test in the past month and 61% ever; 17% were unvaccinated, 11% were partially vaccinated (1 dose), 71% were fully vaccinated (2+ doses). Fully vaccinated participants were twice as likely to report positive COVID testing intentions than those who were unvaccinated (p<.001). Partially vaccinated participants had less positive intentions than those fully vaccinated (p<.001) but higher intentions than those who were unvaccinated (p=.002). Discussion For all three measures vaccination predicted greater COVID testing intentions. If the unvaccinated tested at half the rate of the vaccinated, a true vaccine effectiveness of 30% could appear to be a negative observed vaccine effectiveness of -40%.

A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 855 tests were performed, of which 807 were RAT and 467 rRT-PCR. Positive RAT test was found in 336 cases (39%). False negative RAT was noted in 87 cases (10.2%). The NPV of RAT was 83.6%. The NPV ranged between 80% and 88% for the following symptoms: fever, cough, myalgia, dyspnea, dizziness, asthenia, headache, myalgia, odynophagia, flu_rhume. It varied from 64.2 to 77.8 for Ageusia, Anosmia, Arthralgia, chest pain, thrill, digestive signs. The NPV was equivalent according to age and gender. The NPV varied from 80 to 100% if the test was applied between the first and the 5th day for the onset of symptoms. Beyond this duration, it decreased to 50%. A long period of symptom onset (>5 days) increased significantly the risk of false negative RAT (OR = 2.57 IC95%: [1.38-4.82], p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Many factors may affect the performance of COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT). In fact, negative RAT should be completed by a rRT-PCR according to the the type of symptoms and the time from illness onset. KEY MESSAGES: False negative RAT rate was high.

This study examines the adoption of protective behaviors in the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak and the influence of religion on risk perception by comparing precautionary behaviors in public and in mosques. METHODS: Data were collected through an online survey of 327 Muslim men across the Aceh Province, Indonesia, from April 21, 2020, to May 2, 2020. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the paired t-test were employed to compare the uptake of protective behaviors in public and mosques. RESULTS: The adoption of protective behaviors was higher in public rather than in mosques. It further revealed that the understanding of Islamic teachings during the pandemic has influenced perceived risk and the way Muslim men comply with the protective guidelines. Those who have complete, incomplete, or no compliance of precautionary behaviors have their own interpretation of Islamic teachings that inform their individual actions to manage the risk.

DESCRIPTION: The COVID-19 was first detected in China in December of 2019 and by March 2020 spread to the United States. As this virus has been associated with severe illness, it poses a threat to vulnerable populations-including pregnant women. The obstetric population already faces multiple barriers to receiving quality healthcare due to personal, environmental and economic barriers, now challenged with the additional risks of COVID-19 exposure and limited care in times much defined by social distancing. ASSESSMENT: The current prenatal care framework requires patients to attend multiple in-office prenatal visits that can exponentially multiply depending on maternal and fetal comorbidities. To decrease the rate of transmission of the COVID-19 and limit exposure to patients, providers in Hillsborough County, Florida (and nationwide) are rapidly transitioning to telehealth. The use of a virtual care model allows providers to reduce in-person visits and incorporate virtual visits into the schedule of prenatal care. CONCLUSION: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, implementation of telehealth and telehealth have become crucial to ensure the safe and effective delivery of obstetric care. This implementation is one that will continue to require attention to planning, procedures and processes, and thoughtful evaluation to ensure the sustainability of telehealth and telehealth post COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Implementation of Obstetric Telehealth During COVID-19 and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease\\\\2019 (COVID\\\\19) has led to one of the major outbreaks in modern history. The etiological agent of COVID\\\\19 is the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\\\\2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2). SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infects the respiratory system's epithelial cells via the angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, causing from non or mild symptoms to severe viral pneumonia, and in some cases, death. Based on evolving clinical evidence, it is now unfitting to label SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 as just a respiratory virus, as lately, various reports substantiate its pathogenicity in other organs of the body, including the central nervous system (CNS). Despite conflicting results regarding ACE2 expression in brain tissue, the latest data show that ACE2 is robustly expressed by CNS cells, suggesting that CNS is a potential target for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection. Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell type within the CNS and play a role in axon guidance and synaptic support, control the blood\\\\brain barrier flow, and regulate neuroinflammation. To test if SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 can enter into the CNS via astrocytes and then elicit adverse neurological effects, we have initiated studies to test if astrocytes express ACE2 and whether SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 can infect human astrocytes via this receptor. We have found that astrocytes robustly express ACE2 at the mRNA and protein levels. We are currently testing if astrocytes are susceptible to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection, which could subsequently lead to neuronal damage and possibly account for some of the neurological symptoms observed in COVID\\\\19 patients.

Individuals infected with HIV are susceptible to serious bacterial and viral infections, such as pneumococcus and influenza, which are particularly problematic for lung health, resulting in lung injury. Additionally, HIV-infected individuals are susceptible to a number of pulmonary diseases for unknown reasons. Alcohol, the most commonly abused drug in the world, continues to exact an enormous toll on morbidity and mortality in individuals living with HIV. Chronic alcohol abuse has been shown to affect lung immunity, resulting in significant lung injury. There is a paucity of literature on the additive effects of HIV and alcohol, two diseases of immune senescence, in the lung. This chapter begins by discussing the latest literature evaluating the epidemiology of HIV, alcohol use, and lung health focusing on two prevalent infections, tuberculosis and pneumococcal pneumonia.

Although urgent and absolutely necessary, a reliable therapeutic or vaccine is still elusive and this status quo may remain for an uncertain period of time. Taken that into account, boosting up adaptive immunity through nutritional interventions may help subside this epidemic and save many lives. This review focuses on the nexus between a balanced diet and adaptive immunity, particularly, how a poor diet may lead to compromised immunity resulting in susceptibility to viral infections. Additionally, we discuss how nutrients (vitamins, minerals, trace elements) could be used as a tool to modulate immune response and thus impede viral infections. The study also summarized nutritional recommendations to combat COVID-19 in different countries and territories and dietary sources of those key nutrients. Moreover, different nutritional intervention strategies based on different age groups, physiological and medical conditions were also included, and the challenges of nutritional interventions towards the care of COVID-19 patients were also discussed. Since the availability of a drug or vaccine is still uncertain, a balanced diet or nutrient therapy could be used as a robust strategy to combat COVID-19.

PATIENTS All children (n = 195; 20% pediatric intensive care unit admissions) with positive respiratory viral isolates between April 1 and December 31, 2009. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were recorded from medical folders. Complete data were available for 175 patients (median age [interquartile range] 4.7 months [2.3-12.9 months]; 49% male). One hundred four (59.4%) patients had comorbid conditions; 30 (17%) were HIV-infected. Rhinovirus (n = 76 [39%]), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 54 [27.7%]), adenovirus (n = 30 [15.4%]), influenza A (n = 26 [13.3%]), parainfluenza (n = 23 [11.8%]), and human metapneumovirus (n = 12 [6.2%]) were most commonly isolated. Ninety-five infections (51.4%) were isolated >48 hrs after admission. Seasonal patterns were identified for respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and influenza A, whereas others occurred throughout the year. Twenty-five patients (14.3%) had more than one viral isolate. Presumed bacterial coinfection, which occurred in 68 (39%) patients (18 [26.5%] HIV-infected), was associated with significantly longer pediatric intensive care unit and hospital stays but not with mortality. Twenty patients died (11%, standardized mortality ratio 0.64).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 628 patients with HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer who underwent up-front TORS from 2007 to 2017. Patients were stratified into two cohorts based on early-stage (cT1/2) versus locally-advanced (cT3/4) tumor at presentation. RESULTS: We identified 589 patients who presented with early-stage tumors, and 39 patients with locally-advanced tumors. Of these, 73% of patients required adjuvant radiation, and 33% required adjuvant chemoradiation. There was no significant difference in the administration of adjuvant radiation or chemoradiation between the two cohorts. Patients in the locally-advanced disease cohort were significantly more likely to have Stage II/III disease by clinical and pathologic criteria by American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition criteria (p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in 5-year overall survival (OS) or recurrence-free survival (RFS) based on Kaplan-Meier survival estimates between the two cohorts (p = 0.75, 0.6, respectively), with estimated OS of 91% at 5 years, and estimated RFS of 86% at 5 years across the study population. CONCLUSIONS: Up-front TORS offers favorable survival outcomes for appropriately selected locally-advanced cases of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer. Furthermore, up-front TORS is comparably effective in allowing avoidance of adjuvant therapy, particularly chemotherapy, in both cT1/T2 and locally-advanced HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer.

In this study, a yeast two-hybrid screening experiment was conducted to identify cellular proteins interacting with HCV NS3 protein. Cytosolic 5(3)-deoxyribonucleotidase (cdN, dNT-1) was found to interact with HCV NS3 protein. Binding domains of HCV NS3 and cellular cdN proteins were also determined using the yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions between HCV NS3 and cdN proteins were further demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and confocal analysis in cultured cells. The cellular cdN activity was partially repressed by NS3 protein in both the transiently-transfected and the stably-transfected systems. Furthermore, HCV partially repressed the cdN activity while had no effect on its protein expression in the systems of HCV sub-genomic replicons and infectious HCV virions. Deoxyribonucleotidases are present in most mammalian cells and involve in the regulation of intracellular deoxyribonucleotides pools by substrate cycles. Control of DNA precursor concentration is essential for the maintenance of genetic stability. Reduction of cdN activity would result in the imbalance of DNA precursor concentrations.

METHODS: We conducted a multi-center, observational cohort study across 21 institutions in the United States (US) of adult patients with CLD and laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and May 30, 2020. We performed survival analysis to identify independent predictors of all-cause mortality and COVID-19 related mortality, and multivariate logistic regression to determine the risk of severe COVID-19 in patients with CLD. RESULTS: Of the 978 patients in our cohort, 867 patients (mean age 56.914.5 years, 55% male) met inclusion criteria. The overall all-cause mortality was 14.0% (n = 121), and 61.7% (n = 535) had severe COVID-19. Patients presenting with diarrhea or nausea/vomiting were more likely to have severe COVID-19. The liver-specific factors associated with independent risk of higher overall mortality were alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) (hazard ratio [HR] 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-4.55), decompensated cirrhosis (HR 2.91 [1.70-5.00]) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (HR 3.31 [1.53-7.16]).

While mounting evidence demonstrates the safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery for severely obese adolescents, the potential role of robotic technology has not been well defined. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to establish the safety and efficacy of robotic-assisted laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (RSG) in treating severe adolescent obesity. In addition, 30-day outcomes and hospital charges were compared to subjects undergoing RSG versus laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). METHODS A retrospective analysis of 28 subjects (14 LSG vs. 14 RSG) at a single institution was conducted. Data collection included demographics, body mass index, comorbidities, hospital length of stay (LOS), operative time, 30-day outcomes, and hospital charges. Analysis was performed using chi-square, Fisher's exact, and nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests. RESULTS There were no differences in subject demographics or comorbidities. While median operative time was longer for RSG vs. LSG (132 vs. 100 min, p = 0.0002), the median LOS for RSG compared to LSG was shorter (69.6 vs. 75.9 h, p = 0.0094). In addition, RSG-related hospital charges were higher ($56,646 vs. $49,498, p = 0.0366). No significant differences in post-operative outcomes or complications were observed.

METHODS: We investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of annual dengue incidence in Nepal from 2010 to 2019, and the impacts of seasonal meteorological conditions (mean maximum, minimum temperature and precipitation) and elevation on those patterns. RESULTS: More than 25 000 laboratory-confirmed dengue cases were reported from 2010 to 2019. Epidemiological trends suggest that dengue epidemics are cyclical with major outbreaks occurring at 2- to 3-y intervals. A significant negative relationship between dengue incidence and increasing elevation (metres above sea level) driven by temperature was observed (p<0.05) with dengue risk being greatest below 500 m. Risk was moderate between 500 and 1500 m and decreased substantially above 1500 m. Over the last decade, increased nightly temperatures during the monsoon months correlated with increased transmission (p<0.05). No other significant relationship was observed between annual dengue cases or incidence and climatological factors. CONCLUSIONS: The spatial analysis and interpretation of dengue incidence over the last decade in Nepal confirms that dengue is now a well-established public health threat of increasing importance, particularly in low elevation zones and urbanised areas with a tropical or subtropical climate.

Based on three waves of census data (2006, 2011 and 2016), combined with our spatialCtemporal urban environmental database consisting of three local datasets of urban climate and air quality, this paper assesses the impacts of social, economic and environmental factors on the logarithm of housing prices in Hong Kong through linear regression analysis. Specifically, both supply- and demand-side economic factors have significant impacts on housing prices. Demographic factors are not as significant as expected in affecting housing prices. Transportation factors have more significant effects in the short run than in the long run. Environmental factors, including the number of hot night hours, Annual Air Quality Index (AAQI) of nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and particulates with particle sizes less than 10 microns (PM(10)), significantly affect housing prices over time. The results have important implications: current policy instruments to prevent housing price escalation are focused on increasing property tax or land supply (economic factors), while little attention is paid to social or environmental factors, which are geographically heterogeneous. Our findings suggest that housing provision in the New Territories may be a feasible solution to alleviate the housing crisis as its demographic pattern, transportation connectivity and air quality are significantly different from Hong Kong Island or Kowloon Peninsula.

A prolonged state of anxiety may lead to sleeping troubles, which over time results in an increase in exhaustion. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data were collected from 440 Polish healthcare providers, including nurses and midwives, doctors, paramedics, medical assistance workers, and wardens. Three measures were used: the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (the sleeping trouble subscale) and the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (the exhaustion subscale). Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. RESULTS The obtained results fully support the hypotheses. Both the direct and indirect relationships between coronavirus anxiety and exhaustion were observed. Specifically, high coronavirus anxiety increased insomnia, which in turn contributed to the development of exhaustion. CONCLUSIONS The results are consistent with the COR theory. Prolonged coronavirus anxiety and sleeping problems depleted healthcare providers' resources and made them feel exhausted. Exhaustion among these workers can have serious consequences not only for themselves but also for the health of their patients. Therefore, research into effective ways to deal with coronavirus anxiety is needed.","output":"Coronavirus anxiety and exhaustion among Polish front-line healthcare workers - the mediation effect of insomnia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Efficient identification and isolation of patients with communicable diseases limits exposure to health care workers, other patients, and visitors. In August 2014, our team developed and implemented an algorithm to triage suspected cases of Ebola virus disease in a midwestern United States emergency department and outpatient clinics based on patient travel history and symptoms. Here, we present the lessons learned and modifications to update the tool. METHODS Two strategies were developed and utilized to properly identify, isolate, and inform on patients with suspected highly hazardous communicable diseases: 1) a robust electronic symptom and travel screen with decision support tools in the electronic medical record, and 2) the availability of workflow protocols for Ebola virus disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) once a person under investigation is identified. After action reports provided opportunities to modify the algorithm and improve the identification and isolation processes. RESULTS Since our screening and travel electronic medical record inception 5 years ago, modifications changed iteratively to further enhance the screening process. Since 2018, staff have identified 5 patients at risk for MERS; in all cases, identification occurred during the check-in process. Exposure investigations in the emergency department decreased significantly after algorithm implementation in January 2019, from 30 in 2018 to 0 in 2019. DISCUSSION Although highly hazardous communicable diseases like Ebola virus disease and MERS are of concern due to their mortality rates and limited treatment options, these same concepts may be applied to the early identification and isolation of patients suspected of having more common communicable diseases like measles and influenza, emphasizing the importance of protocol-based screening in the healthcare environment.","output":"Can You Catch It?

We aimed to conduct a multidimensional analysis of risk factors associated with the severity and mortality of patients with COVID-19 and diabetes. METHODS: In this retrospective study involving 1443 patients with COVID-19, we analyzed the clinical and laboratory characteristics and risk factors associated with disease severity in patients with COVID-19 with and without diabetes. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 and diabetes. The 84-day survival duration for critical patients with COVID-19 and diabetes who had different levels of leukocytes and neutrophils, or treated with immunoglobulin or not, was conducted using KaplanCMeier survival curves. RESULTS: Of the 1443 patients with COVID-19, 256 (17.7%) had diabetes, had a median age of 66.0 [IQR 58.0C73.8] years, and were more likely to develop severe (41.8% vs. 35.6%) and critical disease (34.0% vs. 14.9%), followed by higher mortality (21.1% vs. 7.0%), than those without diabetes. Higher levels of leukocytes (> 5.37  10(9)/L), older age, and comorbid cerebrovascular disease and chronic renal disease independently contributed to in-hospital death of patients with COVID-19 and diabetes. Leukocytes > 5.37  10(9)/L and the application of immunoglobulin were associated with shorter survival duration and lower mortality, respectively, in critical patients with COVID-19 and diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: More attention should be paid to patients with COVID-19 and diabetes, especially when they have high leukocyte counts (> 5.37  10(9)/L). Timely and adequate intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) use may reduce the mortality of critical patients with COVID-19 and diabetes.

Because of the lack of specific approved treatment, it is urgent to facilitate the cascade of further understanding of the infection biology, identification of druggable targets and the final development of effective antiviral therapies. PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway plays a vital role in regulating the infection course of many viruses. In this study, we have dissected the effects of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway on rotavirus infection using both conventional cell culture models and a 3D model of human primary intestinal organoids. We found that PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling is essential in sustaining rotavirus infection. Thus, blocking the key elements of this pathway, including PI3K, mTOR and 4E-BP1, has resulted in potent anti-rotavirus activity. Importantly, a clinically used mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, potently inhibited both experimental and patient-derived rotavirus strains. This effect involves 4E-BP1 mediated induction of autophagy, which in turn exerts anti-rotavirus effects. These results revealed new insights on rotavirus-host interactions and provided new avenues for antiviral drug development.","output":"PI3K-Akt-mTOR axis sustains rotavirus infection via the 4E-BP1 mediated autophagy pathway and represents an antiviral target"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study was designed to assess factors associated with a high level of knowledge about influenza among displaced persons and labor migrants in Thailand.

Serum samples were obtained from 122 women referred for fetal echocardiography between 2006 and 2018. We quantified CVB IgG and IgM levels, with titers  15.0 U/mL considered positive and measured neutralizing antibodies for three CVB serotypes: CVB1, CVB3, and CVB4. Using data from the national enterovirus surveillance system, we compared the annual exposure rates for each serotype in our cohort to infections reported across the United States. 98 pregnancies with no genetic defects were included. Overall, 29.6% (29/98) had positive IgG and 4.1% (4/98) of women had positive CVB IgM titers. To explore first-trimester CVB exposure, we focused exclusively on the 26 women with positive IgG and negative IgM titers. 61.5% (16/26) had neutralizing antibodies against a single serotype and 38.5% (10/26) against multiple CVB serotypes. CVB4 neutralizing antibodies were the most common (65.4%, 17/26), followed by CVB3 (53.9%, 14/26) and CVB1 (30.8%, 8/26).

Here, we investigated expression patterns of a series of proteolytic enzymes in several human respiratory cell types on mRNA level in an attempt to better understand the fate of inhaled biopharmaceuticals. METHODS The mRNA expression of proteolytic enzymes (i.e., carboxypeptidases: CPA1, CPA2, CPB, CPM; gamma-glutamyltransferases: GGT1, GGT2; angiotensin-converting enzymes: ACE, ACE2; aminopeptidases: APA, APB, APN, APP1, APP2, APP3; endopeptidases: 24.11 (neprilysin), 24.15 (thimet oligopeptidase), 24.18 (meprin A); enteropeptidase; trypsin 1, trypsin 2; neutrophilic elastase; dipeptidyl peptidase 4; gamma-glutamylhydrolase) was investigated by semiquantitative RT-PCR in human bronchial (hBEpC, Calu-3, 16HBE14o-) and alveolar (A549) epithelial cells, respectively.

Here, we estimate the infection-fatality risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in New York City, NY, USA, the first epidemic centre in the USA, where the infection-fatality risk remains unclear. METHODS: In this model-based analysis, we developed a meta-population network model-inference system to estimate the underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in New York City during the 2020 spring pandemic wave using available case, mortality, and mobility data. Based on these estimates, we further estimated the infection-fatality risk for all ages overall and for five age groups (<25, 25-44, 45-64, 65-74, and &#8805;75 years) separately, during the period March 1 to June 6, 2020 (ie, before the city began a phased reopening). FINDINGS: During the period March 1 to June 6, 2020, 205a??639 people had a laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 and 21a??447 confirmed and probable COVID-19-related deaths occurred among residents of New York City. We estimated an overall infection-fatality risk of 139% (95% credible interval 104-177) in New York City. Our estimated infection-fatality risk for the two oldest age groups (65-74 and &#8805;75 years) was much higher than the younger age groups, with a cumulative estimated infection-fatality risk of 0116% (00729-0148) for those aged 25-44 years and 0939% (0729-119) for those aged 45-64 years versus 487% (337-689) for those aged 65-74 years and 142% (102-181) for those aged 75 years and older. In particular, weekly infection-fatality risk was estimated to be as high as 672% (552-801) for those aged 65-74 years and 191% (147-219) for those aged 75 years and older. INTERPRETATION: Our results are based on more complete ascertainment of COVID-19-related deaths in New York City than other places and thus probably reflect the true higher burden of death due to COVID-19 than that previously reported elsewhere.

Early cholecystectomy has many reported advantages. Operation-related morbidity and mortality have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, our aim is to present our general clinical approach to patients who were diagnosed with AC during the pandemic and our percutaneous cholecystostomy experience during this period. METHODS: This study included 72 patients who were presented to our hospital's emergency room between March 11 and May 31, 2020, with AC. Patients were divided into three groups based on their treatment: outpatients (Group 1), inpatients (Group 2) and patients undergoing percutaneous cholecystostomy (Group 3). These three groups were compared by their demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: There were 36 (50%) patients in Group 1, 25 (34.7%) patients in Group 2, and 11 (15.3%) patients in Group 3. The demographic characteristics of the patients were similar. The CRP and WBC levels of the patients in Group 3 were significantly higher compared to the other groups. Moreover, the wall of the gallbladder was thicker and the size of the gallbladder was larger in Group 3. Patients had percutaneous cholecystostomy at the median of 3.5 days and the length of hospital stay was longer compared to Group 2 (3.9 days versus 9.2 days, p=0.00). The rate of re-hospitalization after discharge was similar in Group 2 and Group 3, but none of the patients in Group 1 required hospitalization. None of 72 patients developed an emergency condition requiring surgery, and there was no death. CONCLUSION: Although many publications emphasize that laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) can be performed with low morbidity at the first admission in acute cholecystitis, it is a clinical condition that can be delayed in the COVID-19 pandemic and other similar emergencies. Thus, percutaneous cholecystostomy should be effectively employed, and its indications should be extended if necessary (e.g., younger patients, patients with lower CCI or ASA).

Currently, three vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use only. However much of the pathogenesis observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection remains elusive. To gain insight into the contribution of individual accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, we used our recently described reverse genetics system approach to successfully engineer recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2, where we individually removed viral 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, and 8 ORF proteins, and characterized these recombinant viruses in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate differences in plaque morphology, with ORF deficient (ORF) viruses producing smaller plaques than those of the wild-type (rSARS-CoV-2/WT). However, growth kinetics of ORF viruses were like those of rSARS-CoV-2/WT. Interestingly, infection of K18 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice with the ORF rSARS-CoV-2 identified ORF3a and ORF6 as the major contributors of viral pathogenesis, while ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF8 rSARS-CoV-2 induced comparable pathology to rSARS-CoV-2/WT. This study demonstrates the robustness of our reverse genetics system to generate rSARS-CoV-2 and the major role for ORF3a and ORF6 in viral pathogenesis, providing important information for the generation of attenuated forms of SARS-CoV-2 for their implementation as live-attenuated vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Despite great efforts put forward worldwide to combat the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to be a human health and socioeconomic threat. Insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and contribution of viral proteins to disease outcome remains elusive. Our study aims to determine the contribution of SARS-CoV-2 accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins in viral pathogenesis and disease outcome, and develop a synergistic platform combining our robust reverse genetics system to generate recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 with a validated rodent model of infection and disease. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and ORF6 contribute to lung pathology and ultimately disease outcome in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice, while ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8 have little impact on disease outcome. Moreover, our combinatory platform serves as the foundation to generate attenuated forms of the virus to develop live-attenuated vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Contribution of SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins to viral pathogenicity in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Universities struggle to provide meaningful education and mentorship to Native American students, especially in STEM fields such as archaeology and geography.

Art forms produced between March and July 2020, and available in the public sphere - traditional media, social media and public spaces - were collated. The data consisted of comedy, cartoons, songs, murals and textile designs. Three key functions emerged from analysis: health promotion (comedy, cartoons, songs); disease prevention (masks); and improving the aesthetics of the healthcare environment (murals). Textile designs performed broader socio-cultural functions of memorialising and political advocacy. Similar to earlier HIV/AIDS and Ebola arts interventions in other African countries, these Ghanaian COVID art forms translated public health information on COVID-19 in ways that connected emotionally, created social awareness and improved public understanding. However, some art forms had limitations: for example, songs that edutained using fear-based strategies or promoting conspiracy theories on the origins and treatment of COVID-19, and state-sponsored visual art that represented public health messaging decoupled from socio-economic barriers to health protection.

This study aimed to examine the mediating role of rumination and the moderating role of mindfulness in the association between social media exposure (SME) to COVID-19 information and psychological distress. The results from online questionnaire responses of 439 college students from two universities in Wuhan, Hubei Province, showed that rumination mediated the association between SME and psychological distress.

Finally, we compare and evaluate on the performance and accuracy of the aforementioned models' simulations. Methods: Three epidemiological models are used to forecast the true growth of COVID-19 case counts by accounting for asymptomatic infections in Singapore. They are the exponential model, SEIR model with hospitalization dynamics (SEIHRD), and the SEIHRD model with inclusion of asymptomatic cases (SEAIHRD). Results: Simulation results of all three models reflect underestimation of COVID-19 cases in Singapore during the early stages of the pandemic.

This study aims to investigate the effects of daily air pollution exposure on acute pediatric asthma exacerbation risk using a repeated-measures design. METHODS: We conducted a panel study of 40 children aged 8-16 years with moderate-to-severe asthma. We deployed the Biomedical REAI-Time Health Evaluation (BREATHE) Kit developed in the Los Angeles PRISMS Center to continuously monitor personal exposure to particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 m (PM2.5), relative humidity and temperature, geolocation (GPS), and asthma outcomes including lung function, medication use, and symptoms for 14 days. Hourly ambient (PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3)) and traffic-related (nitrogen oxides (NOx) and PM2.5) air pollution exposures were modeled based on location. We used mixed-effects models to examine the association of same day and lagged (up to 2 days) exposures with daily changes in % predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and % predicted peak expiratory flow (PEF), count of rescue inhaler puffs, and symptoms. RESULTS: Participants were on average 12.0 years old (range: 8.4-16.8) with mean (SD) morning %predicted FEV1 of 67.9% (17.3%) and PEF of 69.1% (18.4%) and 1.4 (3.5) puffs per day of rescue inhaler use.

Aim To understand the views of general practitioners and community nurses providing end-of-life care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design and Setting A web-based, UK-wide questionnaire survey circulated via professional general practice and community nursing networks during September and October 2020. Method Responses were analysed using descriptive statistics and an inductive thematic analysis. Results Valid responses were received from 559 individuals (387 community nurses, 156 General Practitioners (GPs) and 16 unspecified role), from all regions of the UK. The majority reported increased involvement in providing community end-of-life care. Contrasting and potentially conflicting roles emerged between GPs and community nurses. There was increased use of remote consultations, particularly by GPs. Community nurses took greater responsibility in most aspects of end-of-life care practice, particularly face-to-face care, but reported feeling isolated. For some GPs and community nurses, there has been considerable emotional distress. Conclusion Primary healthcare services are playing a critical role in meeting increased need for end-of-life care in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The HCP serves as the first line of defense against this pandemic, what if we faced a significant loss in their number? And what if our HCP was going through a deep dark depression? The condition would be terrifying not only for now but also in the future. This raises the need for an intensified International collaboration, that mainly supports the HCP. We are throwing by challenging moments, and it is clear that social distancing, cooperation, hygiene awareness and abide by the recommendation and help of all governments, as well as obtaining the support of international organizations could be an excellent tool for preventing an increase in the number of cases, principally in countries and regions were COVID-19 is in the early stage of the epidemic.

Methods: Using an individual-based model, we simulated the spread of COVID-19 in Daegu. An individual can be infected through close contact with infected people in a household, at work/school, and at religious and social gatherings. We created a synthetic population from census sample data. Then, 9,000 people were randomly selected from the entire population of Daegu and set as members of the hotspot of the Shincheonji church. We did not take into account population movements to and from other regions in South Korea. Results: Using the individual-based model, the cumulative confirmed cases in Daegu through March 26, 2020, were reproduced, and it was confirmed that the hotspot had a different probability of infection than non-hotspot areas.

Methods: In total, 2782 patients were enrolled between March 2020 and December 2020, including 2106 patients (first wave) and 676 patients (second wave) in the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. The first wave patients were divided into two groups with 1474 patients used to train the model, and 632 to validate it. The 676 patients in the second wave were used to test the model. Age, 17 blood analytes and Brescia chest X-ray score were the variables processed using a Random Forests classification algorithm to build and validate the model.

METHODS: We conducted an open-label, phase 3 trial (NCT04252664) in hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, evidence of pulmonary infiltrates, and oxygen saturation >94% on room air. Patients were randomly assigned to receive RDV (5 or 10 days) or standard of care (SOC). RDV was dosed intravenously at 200 mg on day 1, 100 mg daily thereafter. Adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities were evaluated through the day 11 data cut; safety data through day 28 will be presented at the meeting. RESULTS: 584 patients were randomized and treated (5d RDV: n=191; 10d RDV, n=193; SOC: n=200). Baseline characteristics were balanced among groups; median (range) age was 57y (12-95y), 39% were female and 19% Black, 39% had arterial hypertension, 15% hyperlipidemia, 11% asthma. Briefly, across both the 5d and 10d arms, RDV was well tolerated with a similar rate of Grade 3 or 4 AEs and fewer SAEs compared to SOC (Table). AEs more common with RDV vs SOC included nausea, headache, and hypokalemia. Overall, across the 3 arms, incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation and death were low and no clinically relevant changes in laboratory parameters were observed. In addition, median changes in renal and liver function tests from baseline were not statistically significant between the RDV 5d and RDV 10d groups compared to the SOC only group at d14 (Table 1).

Therefore, it is worth considering the use of currently available drugs to protect COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: We review the current experience of conventional cardiovascular drugs [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, anticoagulants, acetosalicylic acid, antiarrhythmic drugs, statins] as well as some other drug classes (antidiabetic drugs, vitamin D and NSAIDs) frequently used by older patients with cardiovascular diseases. Data were sought from clinical databases for COVID-19 and appropriate key words. Conclusions and recommendations are based on a consensus among all authors. RESULTS: Several cardiovascular drugs have a potential to protect patients with COVID-19, although evidence is largely based on retrospective, observational studies. Despite propensity score adjustments used in many analyses observational studies are not equivalent to randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Ongoing RCTs include treatment with antithrombotics, pulmonary vasodilators, RAAS-related drugs, and colchicine. RCTs in the acute phase of COVID-19 may not, however, recognise the benefits of long term anti-atherogenic therapies, such as statins. CONCLUSIONS: Most current cardiovascular drugs can be safely continued during COVID-19. Some drug classes may even be protective.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate medical students online video-viewing patterns as well as to identify features associated with their class style preferences in precision medicine courses. METHODS: A mixed methods research design was used. Part of the cognitive load of the class content of acute liver failure was shifted to a 10-minute pre-class online video learning which was further reduced using threshold concept strategy. In the 2019 academic year, all fifth-year medical students who had viewed the pre-class video were invited to take a survey on their learning process and four class style expectations for the upcoming in-person class. For each round of medical students, teaching assistants helped collect anonymous survey data before the class. The teacher then adjusted the in-person class as part of precision medical education. Furthermore, the researchers coded the video-viewing patterns through an action log transformation, along with the questionnaire results, for analysis. MannCWhitney U and KruskalCWallis tests were employed to compare group differences. Qualitative data were content-coded through a descriptive approach using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Of the 130 medical students, 114 (87.7%) joined the pre-class video learning, 113 (86.9%) responded to the questionnaires, and 87 (66.9%) provided their comments. Most medical students preferred the class styles of a thorough introduction (42.5%) and concept orientation (44.2%). High-engagement viewing patterns were associated with difficult concepts and the provision of comments. Class style expectation and video-viewing patterns did not demonstrate significant linkages. A majority of the substantial comments initiated thought-provoking questions after the online video learning. CONCLUSION: Association between medical students preferred class styles and online video-viewing patterns was not necessarily linked. However, medical teachers are recommended to modify class styles based on medical students expectations after pre-class learning, thereby providing precision medical education. KEY MESSAGE: Implementing precision medical education in the blended class is feasible. Online video learning is an ideal platform for balancing the dilemma between increasing the cognitive load of class content and the practice of precision medical education. The association between medical students preferred class styles and online video-viewing patterns was not clearly seen.","output":"Pre-class online video learning and class style expectation: patterns, association, and precision medical education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current approaches of drugs repurposing against 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have not proven overwhelmingly successful and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to cause major global mortality.

NS5A is endowed with pleotropic activities, which overlap with several proteins from SARS-CoV-2. HCV NS5B and SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 are RNA polymerases that share homology in the nucleotide uptake channel. We thus tested whether SARS-COV-2 would be susceptible these anti-HCV drugs. DCV consistently inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells, in the hepatoma cell line (HuH-7) and in type II pneumocytes (Calu-3), with potencies of 0.8, 0.6 and 1.1 M, respectively.

Moreover, SFV/DCV combination (1:0.15 ratio) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with EC50 of 0.7:0.1 M in Calu-3 cells. SFV and DCV prevented virus-induced neuronal apoptosis and release of cytokine storm-related inflammatory mediators, respectively. Both drugs inhibited independent events during RNA synthesis and this was particularly the case for DCV, which also targeted secondary RNA structures in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

Pigeon paramyxovirus type-1 (PPMV-1) is a notifiable disease-causing high morbidity and mortality with severe nervous symptoms. Clinical represented tissue specimens were collected from 50 infected pigeon flocks in eight governorates. All samples were examined bacteriologically (isolation, identification and serotyping) for E. coli, Salmonella spp., S. aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) was accomplished for all isolates using a disk-diffusion test. For viral identification, RT-PCR specific oligonucleotide primers were used for distinguishing of Avian influenza virus, PPMV-1 and PPMV-3. Neurological manifestations were observed in pigeons flocks mainly in winter and autumn. The mortality rate in eight governorates was about 50% in 10 flocks and other houses mortality rate was ranged from 10 to 20%. Post mortem examination have shown hemorrhagic enteritis, soft and friable brain tissues and/or hemorrhages. The percentage of isolated bacteria E. coli, Salmonella spp., S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 75%, 75%, 50% and 18.75%; respectively. The antibiotic resistance pattern for bacterial isolates showed resist to ampicillin, amoxicillin- clavulinic acid, teteracyclin, ceftriaxone, doxycycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and ceftazidine with different result for each type of bacteria, while Salmonella spp., isolates showed only a highly intermediate result for ciprofloxacin. Eight samples are positive with 16% to PPMV-1. Also, sample No.5,6,9 was co-infected with different types of bacterial isolates in addition to NDV.

Since MCs can infiltrate solid tumors and promote or limit tumor growth, a possible polarization of MCs to pro-tumoral or anti-tumoral phenotypes has been proposed and remains as a challenging research field. Here, we review the recent evidence regarding the complex relationship between MCs and tumor cells. In particular, we consider: (1) the multifaceted role of MCs on tumor growth suggested by histological analysis of tumor biopsies and studies performed in MC-deficient animal models; (2) the signaling pathways triggered by tumor-derived chemotactic mediators and bioactive lipids that promote MC migration and modulate their function inside tumors; (3) the possible phenotypic changes on MCs triggered by prevalent conditions in the tumor microenvironment (TME) such as hypoxia; (4) the signaling pathways that specifically lead to the production of angiogenic factors, mainly VEGF; and (5) the possible role of MCs on tumor fibrosis and metastasis. Finally, we discuss the novel literature on the molecular mechanisms potentially related to phenotypic changes that MCs undergo into the TME and some therapeutic strategies targeting MC activation to limit tumor growth.","output":"Mast CellCTumor Interactions: Molecular Mechanisms of Recruitment, Intratumoral Communication and Potential Therapeutic Targets for Tumor Growth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate the association of Alzheimer's disease-related and inflammation-related cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers with freezing of gait (FOG) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: The study population included well-characterized PD patients with FOG (PD-FOG), without FOG (PD-NoFOG) and healthy controls (HC). CSF was collected using standard protocols. Three Alzheimer's disease-related markers and 10 inflammation-related markers were measured in a Luminex 200 platform. Differences in marker expression across groups were evaluated with multivariate linear models. Results: CSF was collected from PD-FOG (N=12), PD-NoFOG (N=20) and HC (N=11) for analysis. Age was not significantly different between the three groups. Duration of PD was not significantly different between the two PD groups. After adjusting for covariates and multiple comparisons, the anti-inflammatory marker, fractalkine, was significantly decreased in the PD groups compared to HC (P=0.022), and further decreased in PD-FOG compared to PD-NoFOG or HC (P=0.032).

Conclusions: We found high levels of A{beta}42 in PD-FOG patients and cross-sectional data which supports an increase over time from early to advanced state. We also found low levels of fractalkine which might suggest anti-inflammatory effect. This is the first time an association between fractalkine and FOG has been shown.

Meanwhile, there is growing consensus across scientific disciplines that fish plays a crucial role in food and nutrition security. However, this fish as food perspective has yet to translate into policy and development funding priorities. We argue that the traditional framing of fish as a natural resource emphasizes economic development and biodiversity conservation objectives, whereas situating fish within a food systems perspective can lead to innovative policies and investments that promote nutrition-sensitive and socially equitable capture fisheries and aquaculture. This paper highlights four pillars of research needs and policy directions toward this end. Ultimately, recognizing and working to enhance the role of fish in alleviating hunger and malnutrition can provide an additional long-term development incentive, beyond revenue generation and biodiversity conservation, for governments, international development organizations, and society more broadly to invest in the sustainability of capture fisheries and aquaculture.

Methods: We assessed the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) areas under the curve (AUC) values, along with the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPVs), and negative predictive values (NPVs), of each assay using a validation sample set of 172 COVID-19 sera and 185 negative controls against a validated S1-immunofluorescence as a reference method. The three assays displaying the highest AUCs were selected for further serodetection of 2033 sera of a large population-based cohort. Results: In the validation analysis (pre-test probability: 48.1%), Roche N, Roche S and Euroimmun showed the highest discriminant accuracy (AUCs: 0.99, 0.98, and 0.98) with PPVs and NPVs above 96% and 94%, respectively.

Previous studies showed that high doses of vitamin C administration had conflicting results on clinical outcomes in patients with severe sepsis, burns, and trauma. Because of the high incidence and morbidity/mortality with severe pneumonia, we aimed to investigate the effect of administration of high dose vitamin C in critically ill patients with severe pneumonia. METHODS: Eighty critically ill patients with pneumonia were enrolled in this randomized double-blinded clinical trial. Patients with a CURB-65 score > 3, one major criterion, or  3 minor criteria were considered as severe pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned to intervention or placebo groups receiving standard treatment plus 60 mg/kg/day vitamin C as a continuous infusion or normal saline in the same volume correspondingly for 96 h. Serum levels of vitamin C were noted at baseline and 48 h after vitamin C administration. Duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, PaO(2)/FiO(2), and mortality rate were noted for all patients till the 28th day. Any complications related to the vitamin C administration were recorded. RESULTS: Duration of mechanical ventilation and vasopressor use were significantly lower in the intervention group (p: < 0.001 and 0.003, respectively). Baseline levels of vitamin C in both groups did not have a significant difference but its levels increased in the intervention group and decreased in the control group during the study period. Mortality rate insignificantly decreased in the intervention group (p = 0.17). Three patients showed hypotension and tachycardia during the administration of vitamin C which was self-limited with decreasing the dose of vitamin C. Our results showed that the intravenous administration of a relatively high dose of vitamin C to critically ill patients with severe pneumonia was safe and could decrease the inflammation, duration of mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor use without any significant effect on mortality.

Older adults with dementia are a vulnerable patient group therefore it was predicted that this patient demographic would have poorer outcomes and high mortality rates. Ward 24 is an organic old age psychiatry ward in University Hospital Monklands, Lanarkshire for patients with advanced dementia. Older adults have been found to have atypical presentations and non-specific symptoms in COVID-19, however given COVID is still a new and evolving disease, little is known about the impact on dementia patients. The 4C mortality score was designed to predict in-hospital mortality for hospitalised COVID-19 patients using a number of clinical parameters. METHOD: Data were collected retrospectively from all inpatients on ward 24 testing positive for COVID-19 between October and December 2020. Data were collected using online MIDIS entries, paper notes, NEWS charts and Clinical Portal. A 4C mortality score was calculated for each patient using an online calculator based on the data collected. RESULT: 15 patients tested positive for COVID-19; 47% male and 53% female, age range between 64 and 92 years old. 67% of patients had 3 or more comorbidities and 89% had either a high or very high 4C mortality score. Mortality from COVID-19 was 13% and 20% of patients required oxygen. 27% of patients were asymptomatic, these patients also had the lower risk mortality scores. 67% presented with pyrexia, 33% had a cough and 13% had breathlessness. Non-specific symptoms were also seen; 53% had fatigue, 20% had diarrhoea and 20% had unresponsive episodes. Post COVID delirium was seen in 20% of patients. CONCLUSION: Mortality rates were lower than expected, indicating that the 4C mortality score might not be appropriate to use in this patient demographic due to confounding factors. Atypical symptoms were common in patients, with a variability of clinical presentations within the patient demographic. These findings suggest the importance of having a low threshold for COVID-19 infection even in the absence of typical symptoms. Development of an alternative risk stratification tool would be beneficial for this patient group, with further studies needed on a larger scale to facilitate this.","output":"Confusion and a cough: an experience of COVID-19 in dementia patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to analyse the outcomes of ultrasound (US) guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with renal lesions and to compare our outcomes with published results of ablations carried out when using computed tomography (CT) guidance. This retrospective study evaluated RFA of 36 renal tumours in 32 patients (M = 21, F = 11). The mean patient age was 70 years (range, 39-89 years). Ablations were performed by using either multi-tined applicators or cooled and/or cluster applicators under US guidance. Applicator size varied from 2-5 cm, depending on the size of the index tumour. Conscious sedation was administered by an anesthetist. Follow-up imaging by using contrast-enhanced CT was performed 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after RFA, and yearly thereafter. The mean tumour follow-up time was 12 months (range, 1-35 months). The mean tumour size was 2.7 cm (range, 1-5 cm). Primary effectiveness was achieved in 31 cases (86.1%), with patients in 5 cases (11.1%) demonstrating residual disease. Three patients had repeated sessions, which were technically successful. The remaining 2 patients were not re-treated because of patient comorbidities. As a result, secondary effectiveness was achieved in 34 patients (94.4%). In 1 patient, a new lesion developed in the same kidney but remote from the 2 prior areas of treatment. Hydrodissection was performed in 3 patients (8.3%), manipulation or electrode repositioning in 11 patients (30.6%), and ureteric cooling in 1 patient (2.8%). Minor and major complications occurred in 3 (8.3%) and 3 (8.3%) patients, respectively. Correlation coefficients were calculated for distance from skin to tumour and risk of complication as well as compared with primary and secondary effectiveness.

This case report confirms the previously described thrombotic involvement of vasa vasorum in COVID-19. The occurrence of the synchronous damage involving both the lumen surface (endothelial dysfunction, endotheliitis and endothelial detachment) and the adventitia (inflammation and occlusive thrombosis of vasa vasorum) could be the key points related to the fatal outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 patients.

There is an emerging body of evidence on the importance of everyday environmental exposures regarding the mental health of city inhabitants. For example, contemplative landscapes, through a series of neuroscience experiments, were shown to trigger improved mood and restoration of attention. While the Contemplative Landscape Model (CLM) for scoring landscape views was applied to single images, its suitability was never tested for walking paths and areas with a diversity of viewpoints. This study aims to fill this gap using the high-density downtown of Singapore, also known as a City in a Garden for its advanced urban greening strategies, as a case study. In this study, 68 360 photos were taken along four popular walking paths every 20 m. A photo set of 204 items was created by extracting three view angles from each photo. Each of them was independently scored by three experts and average CLM scores for each view and path were obtained. The results were then fed into an open-source Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) for visualization. Cohens kappa agreement between experts scores was computed. The outcomes were mapped to facilitate the identification of the most contemplative viewpoints and paths. Moreover, specific contemplative landscape patterns have been distinguished and assessed allowing the recommendation of design strategies to improve the quality of viewpoints and paths. The inter-rater agreement reached substantial to perfect values. CLM is a reliable and suitable tool that enables the fine-grained assessment and improvement of the visual quality of the urban living environments with consideration of the mental health and well-being of urbanites. It can be used at a larger scale owing to 360 photos taken from the pedestrians point of view. Utilizing spatially explicit maps in QGIS platforms enables a wider range of visualizations and allows for spatial patterns to be revealed that otherwise would have remained hidden.

In the era of information explosion, it is challenging for users to find interesting and valuable information in massive videos rapidly. As valuable tools to solve information overload, recommendation algorithms can provide users with exciting information from a large amount of data. However, the traditional recommendation algorithms either recommend items according to the user's attribute information (e.g., content-based recommendation algorithm) or according to the user's history score (e.g., collaborative filtering algorithm). Without considering the COVID-19 epidemic situation, how to recommend effective prevention and control of epidemic knowledge. Users who hardly pay attention to the new coronavirus information need to recommend the necessary prevention and control knowledge and the latest epidemic development. For users who often view the relevant videos, it is also needed to control the recommendation list's contents to ensure diversity. Methods: To solve the above problem, we propose a novel adaptive recommendation algorithm that can consider user preferences and the epidemic situation's development and recommend valuable videos to users. Results: We have tested on four different datasets, and we choose two classic recommendation algorithms, namely user-based collaborative filtering algorithm and item-based collaborative filtering algorithm, to compare with our adaptive recommendation algorithm. The results show that, compared with the traditional algorithm, our algorithm can not only recommend videos that meet the user's taste but also consider the transmission of widespread science knowledge in the case of an epidemic situation. The recommended video information can be dynamically adjusted according to the user characteristics to ensure the recommendation list's diversity.

RESULTS: We found that type I interferon signaling (IFNA2, TLR8, IFNA1, IFNAR1, TLR9, IRF7, ISG15, APOBEC3G, and MX1) and genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines (IL12B, IL15, IL6, IL12A and IL1B) and chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL11 and CXCL10) were upregulated in patients with MM and SC disease. Moreover, we found that IFNA1, apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G), and Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) were significantly downregulated (P < 0.05) in the SC group compared to the MM group. We also observed that microRNA (miR)-155 and miR-130a levels were markedly higher in the MM group compared to the SC group. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with the activation of host antiviral genes. Induction of the IFN system appears to be particularly important in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, as decreased expression of IFNA1, APOBEC3G and FADD genes in SC patients, relative to MM patients, may be associated with disease progression.","output":"Differentially expressed immune response genes in COVID-19 patients based on disease severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to analyze baseline socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with an increased likelihood of mortality in men and women with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We conducted a retrospective cohort study (PRECOVID Study) on all 4412 individuals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Aragon, Spain, and followed them for at least 30 days from cohort entry. We described the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of all patients of the cohort. Age-adjusted logistic regressions models were performed to analyze the likelihood of mortality based on demographic and clinical variables. All analyses were stratified by sex. Old age, specific diseases such as diabetes, acute myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure, and dispensation of drugs like vasodilators, antipsychotics, and potassium-sparing agents were associated with an increased likelihood of mortality. Our findings suggest that specific comorbidities, mainly of cardiovascular nature, and medications at the time of infection could explain around one quarter of the mortality in COVID-19 disease, and that women and men probably share similar but not identical risk factors. Nonetheless, the great part of mortality seems to be explained by other patient- and/or health-system-related factors.

Different performance evaluation metrics (precision, sensitivity, specificity, AUC, accuracy, etc.) make selecting the best performance model difficult. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an ensemble-based multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method for selecting top performance machine learning technique(s) for COVID-19 cough classification. We use four cough datasets, namely Cambridge, Coswara, Virufy, and NoCoCoDa to verify the proposed method. At first, our proposed method uses the audio features of cough samples and then applies machine learning (ML) techniques to classify them as COVID-19 or non-COVID-19. Then, we consider a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method that combines ensemble technologies (i.e., soft and hard) to select the best model. In MCDM, we use the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for ranking purposes, while entropy is applied to calculate evaluation criteria weights. In addition, we apply the feature reduction process through recursive feature elimination with cross-validation under different estimators. The results of our empirical evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models. We see that when the proposed method is used for analysis using the Extra-Trees classifier, it has achieved promising results (AUC: 0.95, Precision: 1, Recall: 0.97).","output":"Machine learning for detecting COVID-19 from cough sounds: An ensemble-based MCDM method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Purpose To investigate the effect of prior ischemic stroke on the outcomes of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to describe the incidence, clinical features, and risk factors of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) following COVID-19. Methods In this population-based retrospective study, we included all the hospitalized positive patients with COVID-19 at Wuhan City from December 29, 2019 to April 15, 2020. Clinical data were extracted from administrative datasets coordinated by the Wuhan Health Commission. The propensity score matching and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to adjust the confounding factors. Results There are 36,358 patients in the final cohort, in which 1,160 (3.2%) had a prior stroke. After adjusting for available baseline characteristics, patients with prior stroke had a higher proportion of severe and critical illness and mortality. We found for the first time that the premorbid modified Rankin Scale (MRS) grouping (odds ratio [OR] = 1.796 [95% CI 1.334C2.435], p < 0.001) and older age (OR = 1.905 [95% CI 1.211C3.046], p = 0.006) imparted increased risk of death. AIS following COVID-19 occurred in 124 (0.34%) cases, and patients with prior stroke had a much higher incidence of AIS (3.4%). Logistic regression analyses confirmed an association between the severity of COVID-19 with the incidence of AIS. COVID-19 patients with AIS had a significantly higher mortality compared with COVID-19 patients without stroke and AIS patients without COVID-19. Conclusions Coronavirus disease 2019 patients with prior stroke, especially those with the higher premorbid MRS or aged, have worse clinical outcomes. Furthermore, COVID-19 increases the incidence of AIS, and the incidence is positively associated with the severity of COVID-19.","output":"Association Between Ischemic Stroke and COVID-19 in China: A Population-Based Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adeno-Viren erzeugen akute Erk?ltungskrankheiten, Konjunktivitis, Keratitis, Meningitis, Zystitis und Gastroenteritis.

In fact, viral microRNAs can alter cell physiology and act on the immune system; moreover, cellular microRNAs can regulate the virus cycle, influencing positively or negatively viral replication. Accordingly, microRNAs can represent diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of infectious processes and a promising approach for designing targeted therapies. In the past 18 months, the COVID-19 infection from SARS-CoV-2 has engaged many researchers in the search for diagnostic and prognostic markers and the development of therapies. Although some research suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 genome can produce microRNAs and that host microRNAs may be involved in the cellular response to the virus, to date, not enough evidence has been provided. In this paper, using a focused bioinformatic approach exploring the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 is able to produce microRNAs sharing a strong sequence homology with the human ones and also that human microRNAs may target viral RNA regulating the virus life cycle inside human cells. Interestingly, all viral miRNA sequences and some human miRNA target sites are conserved in more recent SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs).

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk from April 10, 2020, to April 14, 2020. Participants' internet use (in terms of the extent of receiving information pertaining to COVID-19), risk awareness (whether any immediate family members, close friends or relatives, or people in local communities tested positive for COVID-19), demographics (sex, age, ethnicity, income, education level, marital status, and employment status), as well as their engagement in preventative behaviors and testing were assessed. RESULTS: Our data included 979 valid responses from the United States.

Design, Setting and Participants: Retrospective cohort study using electronic health records from 9 US children's hospitals for individuals <21 years-old who underwent reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 between March 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021 and had at least 1 encounter in the 3 years before testing. Exposure: SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity. Main Outcomes and Measures: We identified syndromic (symptoms), systemic (conditions), and medication PASC features in the 28-179 days following the initial test date. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were obtained for 151 clinically predicted PASC features by contrasting PCR-positive with PCR-negative groups using proportional hazards models, adjusting for site, age, sex, testing location, race/ethnicity, and time-period of cohort entrance. We estimated the incidence proportion for any syndromic, systemic or medication PASC feature in the two groups to obtain a burden of PASC estimate. Results: Among 659,286 children in the study sample, 59,893 (9.1%) tested positive by PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Most were tested in outpatient testing facility (50.3%) or office (24.6%) settings. The most common syndromic, systemic, and medication features were loss of taste or smell (aHR 1.96 [95% CI 1.16-3.32), myocarditis (aHR 3.10 [95% CI 1.94-4.96]), and cough and cold preparations (aHR 1.52 [95% CI 1.18-1.96]).

A higher strength of association for PASC was identified in those cared for in the ICU during the acute illness phase, children less than 5 years-old, and individuals with complex chronic conditions. Conclusions and Relevance: In this large-scale, exploratory study, the burden of pediatric PASC that presented to health systems was low.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this research was to collect data on SARS-CoV-2 viral load and to examine potential infection risks of people exposed to the virus in publicly accessible non-healthcare environments on a university campus. METHODS: Air and surface samples were collected using wetted wall cyclone bioaerosol samplers and swab kits, respectively, in a longitudinal environmental surveillance program from August 2020 until April 2021 on the University of Michigan Ann Arbor campus. Quantitative rRT-PCR with primers and probes targeting gene N1 were used for SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification. The RNA concentrations were used to estimate the probability of infection by quantitative microbial risk assessment modeling and Monte-Carlo simulation. RESULTS: In total, 256 air samples and 517 surface samples were collected during the study period, among which positive rates were 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively. Point-biserial correlation showed that the total case number on campus was significantly higher in weeks with positive environmental samples than in non-positive weeks (p = 0.001). The estimated probability of infection was about 1 per 100 exposures to SARS-CoV-2-laden aerosols through inhalation and as high as 1 per 100,000 exposures from contacting contaminated surfaces in simulated scenarios. SIGNIFICANCE: Viral shedding was demonstrated by the detection of viral RNA in multiple air and surface samples on a university campus. The low overall positivity rate indicated that the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 at monitored locations was low. Risk modeling results suggest that inhalation is the predominant route of exposure compared to surface contact, which emphasizes the importance of protecting individuals from airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other respiratory infectious diseases.

Whole UV-inactivated SARS-CoV (UV-V), bearing multiple epitopes and proteins, is a candidate vaccine against this virus. However, whole inactivated SARS vaccine that includes nucleocapsid protein is reported to induce eosinophilic infiltration in mouse lungs after challenge with live SARS-CoV. In this study, an ability of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists to reduce the side effects of UV-V vaccination in a 6-month-old adult BALB/c mouse model was investigated, using the mouse-passaged Frankfurt 1 isolate of SARS-CoV. Immunization of adult mice with UV-V, with or without alum, resulted in partial protection from lethal doses of SARS-CoV challenge, but extensive eosinophil infiltration in the lungs was observed. In contrast, TLR agonists added to UV-V vaccine, including lipopolysaccharide, poly(U), and poly(IC) (UV-V+TLR), strikingly reduced excess eosinophilic infiltration in the lungs and induced lower levels of interleukin-4 and -13 and eotaxin in the lungs than UV-V-immunization alone. Additionally, microarray analysis showed that genes associated with chemotaxis, eosinophil migration, eosinophilia, and cell movement and the polarization of Th2 cells were upregulated in UV-V-immunized but not in UV-V+TLR-immunized mice. In particular, CD11b(+) cells in the lungs of UV-V-immunized mice showed the upregulation of genes associated with the induction of eosinophils after challenge. These findings suggest that vaccine-induced eosinophil immunopathology in the lungs upon SARS-CoV infection could be avoided by the TLR agonist adjuvants. IMPORTANCE Inactivated whole severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) vaccines induce neutralizing antibodies in mouse models; however, they also cause increased eosinophilic immunopathology in the lungs upon SARS-CoV challenge. In this study, the ability of adjuvant Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists to reduce the side effects of UV-inactivated SARS-CoV vaccination in a BALB/c mouse model was tested, using the mouse-passaged Frankfurt 1 isolate of SARS-CoV. We found that TLR stimulation reduced the high level of eosinophilic infiltration that occurred in the lungs of mice immunized with UV-inactivated SARS-CoV. Microarray analysis revealed that genes associated with chemotaxis, eosinophil migration, eosinophilia, and cell movement and the polarization of Th2 cells were upregulated in UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-immunized mice. This study may be helpful for elucidating the pathogenesis underlying eosinophilic infiltration resulting from immunization with inactivated vaccine.","output":"Effects of Toll-like receptor stimulation on eosinophilic infiltration in lungs of BALB/c mice immunized with UV-inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus vaccine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has induced a massive shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) across the United States.

Thus, we aimed to identify patient-level factors, readily available at the bedside, associated with the risk of in-hospital mortality within 28 days from commencement of invasive mechanical ventilation (28-day IMV mortality) in patients with COVID-19. Methods: Prospective observational cohort study in 148 intensive care units in the global COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium . Patients with clinically suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from February 2 nd through December 29th, 2020, requiring IMV. No study-specific interventions were performed. Patient characteristics and clinical data were assessed upon ICU admission, the commencement of IMV and for 28 days thereafter. We primarily aimed to identify time-independent and time-dependent risk factors for 28-day IMV mortality. Results: : A total of 1713 patients were included in the survival analysis, 588 patients died in hospital within 28 days of commencing IMV (34.3%). Cox-regression analysis identified associations between the hazard of 28-day IMV mortality with age (HR 1.27 per 10-year increase in age, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.37, P<0.001), PEEP upon commencement of IMV (HR 0.78 per 5-cmH 2 O increase, 95% CI 0.66-0.93, P=0.005).

We report that while the bat progenitor viral strain RaTG13 shows some pre-adaption to binding hACE2, it also exhibits stronger overall affinity to bACE2. However, while the early emergent human strains and later VOCs exhibit robust binding to both hACE2 and bACE2, the delta and omicron variants exhibit evolutionary adaption of binding to hACE2.

Years of life lost is therefore widely used as a more relevant metric, however, such calculations in the context of COVID-19 are all biased upwards: patients dying from COVID-19 are typically multimorbid, having far worse life expectation than the general population. These questions are quantitatively investigated using a unique Hungarian dataset that contains individual patient level data on comorbidities for all COVID-19 deaths in the country. To account for the comorbidities of the patients, a parametric survival model using 11 important long-term conditions was used to estimate a more realistic years of life lost. As of 12 May, 2021, Hungary reported a total of 27,837 deaths from COVID-19 in patients above 50 years of age. The usual calculation indicates 10.5 years of life lost for each death, which decreases to 9.2 years per death after adjusting for 11 comorbidities. The expected number of years lost implied by the pre-pandemic life table is 11.1 years. The years of life lost due to COVID-19 in Hungary is therefore 12% or 1.3 years per death lower when accounting for the comorbidities and is below its expected value, but how this should be interpreted is still a matter of debate.

Here we analyzed the impact of age on viral vector and inactivated virus vaccines' effectiveness, the main platforms used in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: We report a retrospective longitudinal study of 75,919,840 Brazilian vaccinees from January 18 to July 24, 2021, evaluating documented infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19-related hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death. Negative binomial regression models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics were used for VE estimation. FINDINGS: The overall analyzes of full vaccination showed VE against hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death of 914% (95%CI:901C925), 911% (95%CI:889C929) and 923% (95%CI:905C937) for Vaxzevria and 712% (95%CI:700C724), 722% (95%CI:702C740) and 737% (95%CI:721C752) for CoronaVac, respectively. VE for all outcomes is progressively lower with age. In fully-Vaxzevria-vaccinated individuals aged <60 years, VE against death was 96.5% (95%CI:82.1C99.3) versus 685% (95%CI:400C834) in those 90 years. Among fully-CoronaVac-vaccinated individuals, VE against death was 84.8% (95%CI:77.1C89.9) in those <60 years compared to 63.5 (95%CI 58.7C67.7) for vaccinees aged 80C89 years and 486%; (95%CI:350C593) for individuals aged 90 years. Post-vaccination daily cumulative incidence curves for all outcomes showed increased risk from younger to elder decades of life. There was no increase in the incidence of hospitalisation for individuals <60 years vaccinated during the same period as those aged 90 years. INTERPRETATION: Although both vaccines have been effective in protecting against infection, hospitalization and death; Vaxzevria and CoronaVac demonstrated high effectiveness against severe outcomes for individuals up to 79 years of age.

Based on the propagation characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, rapid and accurate detection of complete virions from clinical samples and the environment is critical for assessing infection risk and containing further COVID-19 outbreaks. However, currently applicable methods cannot achieve large-scale clinical application because of factors such as the high viral load, cumbersome virus isolation steps, demanding environmental conditions, and long experimental periods. In this study, we developed an immunomolecular detection method combining capture of the viral spike glycoprotein with monoclonal antibodies and nucleic acid amplification via quantitative reverse transcription PCR to rapidly and accurately detect complete virions. Results: : After constructing a novel pseudovirus, screening for specific antibodies, and optimizing the detection parameters, the assay achieved a limit of detection of 9  10 2 transduction units/mL of viral titer with high confidence (~95%) and excellent stability against human serum and common virus/pseudovirus. The coefficients of variation were 1.0C2.0% for intra-assay and inter-assay analyses, respectively. Compared with reverse transcription-PCR, the immunomolecular method more accurately quantified complete virions. SARS-CoV-2/pseudovirus was more stable on plastic and paper than on aluminum and copper in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus under different conditions, and complete virions were detected up to 96 h after they were applied to these surfaces (except for copper), although the titer of the virions was greatly reduced. Conclusions: : Convenient, inexpensive, and accurate complete virus detection can be applied in many fields, such as monitoring the infectivity of convalescent and post-discharge patients and assessing high-risk environments (isolation rooms, operating rooms, patient living environments, and cold chain logistics). This method can also be used to detect intact virions such as those of hepatitis B and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza, and the partial pulmonary virus, which may further improve the accuracy of diagnoses and facilitate individualized and precise treatments.","output":"Immunomolecular Assay Based on Selective Virion Capture by Spike Antibody and Viral Nucleic Acid Amplification for Detecting Intact SARS-CoV-2 Particles (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Summary of Notifiable Infectious Diseases and Condition-United States, 2013 (hereafter referred to as the summary) contains the official statistics, in tabular and graphic form, for the reported occurrence of nationally notifiable infectious diseases and conditions in the United States for 2013.

PARTICIPANTS: 1450 English-speaking adult participants in the AmeriSpeak Panel. AmeriSpeak is a probability-based panel designed to be representative of households in the USA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of probable generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) using the GAD-7 and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) using the four-item PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) checklist. Both outcomes were stratified by demographics and COVID-19-related stressors. RESULTS: The majority of participants were female (51.8%), non-Hispanic white (62.9%) and reported a household saving of $5000 or more. Those between 18 and 29 years old were the largest age group (38.1%) compared with 40C59 years (32.0%) and 60 years or more (29.9%). The prevalence of probable GAD was 10.9% (95% CI 9.1% to 13.2%) and the prevalence of PTSS was 21.7% (95% CI 19.1% to 24.6%). Among participants reporting five or more COVID-19-related stressors, the prevalence of probable GAD was 20.5% (95% CI 16.1% to 25.8%) and the prevalence of PTSS was 35.7% (95% CI 30.2% to 41.6%).

There is preliminary evidence that pandemic severity, cultural values, restrictions imposed by governments, and Internet usage may all influence the emergence of PTSD symptomatology. In this study, possible linear- and non-linear associations between these factors and the prevalence of PTSD symptoms across 35 countries were examined based on data from existing research. Evidence was found for a positive logarithmic relationship between the COVID-19 case-fatality ratio and PTSD (p = 0.046), a positive logarithmic relationship between power distance and PTSD (p = 0.047), and a trend toward a negative quadratic association with Internet usage (p = 0.051). No significant cross-national effect was observed for government restrictiveness. These findings suggest that strategies aimed at minimizing COVID-19 deaths, and at ensuring equitable access to essential resources, may be of use in reducing the emergence of PTSD symptoms at a population level during this pandemic.","output":"The Contributions of Pandemic Severity, Government Stringency, Cultural Values and Internet Usage to Post-traumatic Stress Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Analysis of Data From 35 Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The iconic red crown of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is made of its spike (S) glycoprotein. The S protein is the Trojan horse of coronaviruses, mediating their entry into the host cells. While SARS-CoV-2 was becoming a global threat, scientists have been accumulating data on the virus at an impressive pace, both in terms of genomic sequences and of three-dimensional structures. On April 21st, the GISAID resource had collected 10,823 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences. We extracted from them all the complete S protein sequences and identified point mutations thereof. Six mutations were located on a 14-residue segment (929-943) in the fusion core of the heptad repeat 1 (HR1). Our modeling in the pre- and post-fusion S protein conformations revealed, for three of them, the loss of interactions stabilizing the post-fusion assembly. On May 29th, the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences in GISAID were 34,805. An analysis of the occurrences of the HR1 mutations in this updated dataset revealed a significant increase for the S929I and S939F mutations and a dramatic increase for the D936Y mutation, which was particularly widespread in Sweden and Wales/England. We notice that this is also the mutation causing the loss of a strong inter-monomer interaction, the D936-R1185 salt bridge, thus clearly weakening the post-fusion assembly.","output":"D936Y and Other Mutations in the Fusion Core of the SARS-Cov-2 Spike Protein Heptad Repeat 1 Undermine the Post-Fusion Assembly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evidence suggests that healthcare professionals are at an increased risk of dying by suicide, with anaesthetists at particularly high risk. However, much of the data on which this is based are historical. With a focus on the epidemiology and methods used, we conducted a systematic review of evidence regarding suicide and suicidal behaviour among anaesthetists to provide a more contemporary summary. The systematic review process was adapted from a previous similar study in veterinary surgeons and was consistent with recommended guidance. We identified 54 articles published in or after 1990 that had anaesthetist-specific data and met the inclusion criteria. Seven of these reported epidemiological data, of which four were published after 2000. Although none of the more recent studies reported standardised mortality rates specific to suicide in anaesthetists, the proportion of anaesthetists dying by suicide was increased with respect to comparator groups, which is consistent with previous findings. Eleven studies that included information on suicidal behaviour reported suicidal ideation in 3.2-25% of individuals (six studies) and suicide attempts in 0.5-2% (four studies). Studies reporting methods of suicide highlighted the use of anaesthetic drugs, particularly propofol, supporting the suggestion that the increased risk of suicide in anaesthetists may be related to the availability of the means.

An autologous homologous skin construct (AHSC) that uses the endogenous regenerative capacity of healthy skin has been developed to treat cutaneous defects, with a single application. The ability of AHSC to close VLUs with a single treatment was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm feasibility study to test the hypothesis that AHSC treatment will result in wound closure by providing healthy autologous tissue to the wound bed. METHODS: Ten VLUs were treated with a single application of AHSC. A 1.5 cm(2) full-thickness skin harvest from the proximal calf was collected and sent to a Food and Drug AdministrationCregistered facility, where it was processed into AHSC and returned to the provider within 48 hours. AHSC was spread evenly across the wound and dressed with silicone. The primary endpoint was wound closure rate at 12 weeks. Wound closure was followed with 3-dimensional planimetry, and closure was confirmed by a panel of plastic surgeons. Additional endpoints followed for 12 weeks included graft take, harvest site closure, adverse event rate, complications, and patient-reported pain. RESULTS: All 10 VLUs demonstrated successful graft take as evidenced by graft persisting in wound and harvest site closure. Eight VLUs exhibited complete closure within 12 weeks. One VLU that failed to heal with a prior split thickness skin graft closed within 13.5 weeks with AHSC. The mean time of closure was 34 days (95% confidence interval, 14C53). Pain improved by closure confirmation visit. There was 1 serious adverse event unrelated to the product or procedure.

These problems can lead to psychological problems. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis to ascertain the present impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance among nurses. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. The following databases were searched: PubMed, CHINAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, MedRxiv and Google Scholar, from January 2020 up to 26th October 2020. Prevalence rates were pooled with meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was tested using I-squared (I2) statistics. RESULTS: A total of 93 studies (n = 93,112), published between January 2020 and September 2020, met the inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of stress was assessed in 40 studies which accounted for 43% (95% CI 37-49). The pooled prevalence of anxiety was 37% (95% CI 32-41) in 73 studies. Depression was assessed in 62 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 35% (95% CI 31-39). Finally, 18 studies assessed sleep disturbance and the pooled prevalence was 43% (95% CI 36-50). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis found that approximately one third of nurses working during the COVID-19 epidemic were suffering from psychological symptoms. This highlights the importance of providing comprehensive support strategies to reduce the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak among nurses under pandemic conditions.

This study aimed to compare the maneuverability of three different SPASs: the Covidien SILS-port, Storz Endocone, and glove port. A clear acrylic box with artificial skin placed at the bottom was used to mimic the abdominal wall and cavity. The three SPASs were placed from below, and a 10-mm endoscope and 5-mm instrument were introduced. A motion analysis system consisting of 18 cameras and motion analysis software were used to track the movement of the endoscope and instrument, to determine the volume of the cone-shaped, three-dimensional figures over which movement was possible, with higher values indicating greater maneuverability. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for the analysis. The maneuverability of the endoscope alone was significantly higher in the glove port system than in the other two SPASs. When inserting an additional instrument, the maneuverability significantly decreased in the SILS-port and Endocone, but not in the glove port.

These stressors are laid on top of a resident selection process already under duress with exploding application and interview numbers-the latter likely to be exacerbated with the widespread shift to virtual interviewing. Leveraging their trainee perspective, the authors propose enforcing a cap on the number of interviews that applicants may attend through a novel interview ticket system (ITS). Specialties electing to participate in the ITS would select an evidence-based, specialty-specific interview cap. Applicants would then receive unique electronic tickets-equal in number to the cap-that would be given to participating programs at the time of an interview, when the tickets would be marked as used. The system would be self-enforcing and would ensure each interview represents genuine interest between applicant and program, while potentially increasing the number of interviews-and thus match rate-for less competitive applicants. Limitations of the ITS and alternative approaches for interview capping, including an honor code system, are also discussed. Finally, in the context of capped interview numbers, the authors emphasize the need for transparent pre-interview data from programs to inform applicants and their advisors on which interviews to attend; learning from prior experiences and studies on virtual interviewing; adherence to best practices for interviewing; and careful consideration of how virtual interviews may shift inequities in the resident selection process.","output":"A Novel Ticket System for Capping Residency Interview Numbers: Reimagining Interviews in the COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The collection and sharing of accurate data is paramount to the fight against COVID-19. However, the health system in many countries is fragmented. Furthermore, because no one was prepared for COVID-19, manual information systems have been put in place in many health facilities to collect and record COVID-19 data. This reality brings many challenges such as delay, inaccuracy and inconsistency in the COVID-19 data collected for the control and monitoring of the pandemic.

The lessons learned from the 2003 SARS outbreak indicate that knowledge and attitudes about infectious diseases are related to panic among the population, which may further complicate efforts to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Misunderstandings may result in behaviors such as underestimation, panic, and taking ineffective measures to avoid infection; these behaviors are likely to cause the epidemic to spread further. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to assess public health perceptions and misunderstandings about COVID-19 in China, and to propose targeted response measures based on the findings to control the development of the epidemic. METHODS: The study was conducted in April 2020 through an online survey, with participants in 8 provinces in Eastern, Central, and Western China. We designed a questionnaire with a health knowledge section consisting of 5 questions (4 conventional questions and 1 misleading question) on clinical features of and preventive measures against COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, chi-square analysis, binary logistic regression, and Mantel-Haenszel hierarchical analysis were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In total, 4788 participants completed the survey and the mean knowledge score was 4.63 (SD 0.67), gained mainly through experts (76.1%), television (60.0%), newspapers (57.9%), and opinions (46.6%) and videos (42.9%) from social media.

A total of 124 compounds were screened in Formula 9002A, and four constituents including salidroside, gastrodin, niacinamide, and umbelliferone were screened as potential active components for the treatment of AD by network pharmacology. Among them, salidroside and gastrodin showed higher relevance with AD targets, such as ESR1 and AR. The pharmacokinetic study showed that they could be absorbed and identified in plasma; the half-life and mean residence times of salidroside and gastrodin in plasma were nearly increased 2-fold by the administration of Formula 9002A compared with those by the administration of a monomer, indicating the extended action time of active compounds in vivo. Formula 9002A exerted the efficacy in the treatment of AD mainly by regulating APP, GSK3, ESR1, and AR targets based on the anti--amyloid protein deposition, anti-oxidation and anti-apoptosis pathways.

We previously generated an attenuated viral variant, YAC-MHV3, which induces a subclinical disease and recovery within 15 days. In contrast, the L2-MHV3 strain induces the development of a fulminant hepatitis, leading to death within 3 days. In this paper, we document intrahepatic and splenic T cell subpopulations involved in the hepatitis process and viral elimination identified in attenuated or pathogenic MHV3-infected C57BL/6 mice. Percentages of intrahepatic CD4+ cells decreased in attenuated YAC-MHV3-infected mice, while they increased in mice infected with pathogenic L2-MHV3, compared with uninfected animals. Moreover, in YAC-MHV3-infected mice, the percentages of intrahepatic CD8+ cells slightly decreased at 24 h pi, then increased until 15 days pi. In contrast, the CD4/CD8 ratios of splenic lymphoid subpopulations increased in the first days of infection and returned to normal values at 15 days pi. Intrahepatic NK1.1+ ? TCRinter cells decreased in both virally infected groups of mice, while CD4+ ? TCRinter LFA-1high cells increased in L2-MHV3-infected mice, in contrast with what was seen in YAC-MHV3-infected mice. However, these cells became anergic following Con A or PHA stimulation. Ex vivo studies showed that only the intrahepatic CD8+ cells that were increased in YAC-MHV3-infected mice could be stimulated by lectins. In addition, in vitro viral infections revealed that L2-MHV3 viral infection led to an increase of intrahepatic CD4+ ? TCRinter cells in the absence of CD8+ cells only. These results indicate that the attenuated phenotype of the YAC-MHV3 virus is related to two different mechanisms: the first involves no increase of intrahepatic CD4+ ?

Methods: In this study, electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Chinese database) were searched to obtain relevant studies including information on severe patients. Publication bias analysis, sensitivity analysis, prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio, diagnosis odds ratio calculation, and visualization graphics were achieved through software Review Manager 5.3, STATA 15, Meta-DiSc 1.4 and R. Results: Data of 3.547 patients from 24 studies was included in this study. The results revealed that patients with chronic respiratory system diseases (pooled positive likelihood 6.07, 95% CI: 3.12-11.82), chronic renal disease (4.79, 2.04-11.25), cardiovascular disease (3.45, 2.19-5.44), and symptoms of the onset of chest tightness (3.8, 1.44-10.05), shortness of breath (3.18, 2.24-4.51), and diarrhea (2.04, 1.38-3.04) exhibited increased probability of progressing to severe illness. C-reactive protein, ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate increased a lot in severe patients compared to non-severe. Yet it was found that clinical features including fever, cough, headache, and so on, as well as some comorbidities have little warning value. Conclusions: The clinical features, and laboratory examination could be used to estimate the process of infection in COVID-19 patients. The findings contribute to the more efficient prediction of serious illness for patients with COVID-19 to reduce mortality.

Abdominal closure complications are strongly associated with suture technique and material, in addition to other factors related to the patient and type of surgery performed. The traditional technique is to place the fascia sutures 1 cm apart and at least 1 cm away from the fascia edge. A Swedish study described a new technique of placing the sutures 5 mm apart and 5 mm away from the fascia edge, resulting in lower rates of abdominal wound complications. This study has a number of limitations. There is a need for improved quality evidence to convince the surgical community to change the closure technique of abdominal wounds aiming to reduce morbidity, which is exemplified in incisional hernias and other various postop complications. METHODS: This is a 1:1 randomized, controlled, patient- and assessor-blinded, parallel design, superiority trial, with a primary endpoint of incisional hernia at 1 year. The study will be conducted at AUBMC over a 3-year period. Patients planned for a non-emergent midline laparotomy for general surgery or vascular procedure will be randomized to either fascia closure technique. In order to detect a drop of 12% in the incidence of incisional hernia, with 80% power and an alpha of 0.05, we will need to recruit 114 patients per arm. After adjusting for loss to follow-up, target recruitment is 274 subjects. We will compare both arms for the primary, secondary, and exploratory outcomes, using chi-square or t test as appropriate. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression will be done. DISCUSSION: This trial will assess postop complications following abdominal midline wound closures via two different suturing techniques. This trial will generate evidence-based conclusions that will allow surgeons to assess the role of a new abdominal closure technique in decreasing short- and long-term postoperative complications, for a commonly performed procedure.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA NSTI is a life-threatening diagnosis. Delay to diagnosis and surgical management is associated with increased mortality. METHODS We searched 6 databases from inception through November 2017. We included English-language studies reporting diagnostic accuracy of testing or LRINEC Score. Outcome was NSTI confirmed by surgery or histopathology. Two reviewers screened all citations and extracted data independently. Summary measures were obtained from the Hierarchical Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic model. RESULTS From 2,290 citations, we included 23 studies (n = 5982). Of physical examination signs, pooled sensitivity and specificity for fever was 46.0% and 77.0% respectively, for hemorrhagic bullae 25.2% and 95.8%, and for hypotension 21.0% and 97.7%. Computed tomography (CT) had sensitivity of 88.5% and specificity of 93.3%, while plain radiography had sensitivity of 48.9% and specificity of 94.0%. Finally, LRINEC  6 had sensitivity of 68.2% and specificity of 84.8%, while LRINEC  8 had sensitivity of 40.8% and specificity of 94.9%. CONCLUSIONS Absence of any 1 physical examination feature (eg, fever or hypotension) is not sufficient to rule-out NSTI. CT is superior to plain radiography. LRINEC had poor sensitivity, and should not be used to rule-out NSTI. Given the poor sensitivity of these tests, a high clinical suspicion warrants early surgical consultation for definitive diagnosis and management.","output":"Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infection: Diagnostic Accuracy of Physical Examination, Imaging, and LRINEC Score: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: People with chronic pain may be particularly vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic COVID-19, and psychological flexibility may protect them. This study investigates psychological functioning in the context of COVID-19, including fear and avoidance in the context of COVID-19, specifically its association with daily functioning, and the role of psychological flexibility, among people with chronic pain. Methods: Responses from 555 adults with chronic pain were collected through a cross-sectional online survey and analysed. Results: Eight out of ten participants reported significant depression and nearly nine out of ten reported significant functional impairment. COVID-19-related fear and avoidance significantly correlated with pain, pain-related disability, depression, and work and social adjustment (r=18-.32), as well as psychological flexibility processes, including pain acceptance, self-as-context, and committed action, |r|=.13-.30. COVID-19-related fear and avoidance and COVID-19-related interference were significant predictors of some measures of daily functioning beyond demographics and pain, =.09-.14. However, these associations weakened when psychological flexibility processes were factored into the models, with fear of COVID-19 no longer being a significant predictor of pain-related disability or depression, and COVID-19 avoidance no longer a significant predictor of depression. Conclusions: The psychological functioning in the context of COVID-19 appears to be negatively associated with daily functioning in people with chronic pain, and is statistically significant in this regard. Psychological flexibility may have a role in these associations for people with chronic pain in the pandemic.

Analysis of the intra-host single-nucleotide variations (iSNVs) in SARS-CoV-2 genomes at spatio-temporal scales can provide insights on the consequence of RNA editing on the establishment, spread and functional outcomes of the virus. In this study, using 1,347 transcriptomes of COVID-19 infected patients across various populations, we find variable prevalence of iSNVs with distinctly higher levels in Indian population. Our results also suggest that iSNVs can likely establish variants in a population.

This study aimed to test the hypothesis that plasma exosomes promote angiogenesis in irradiated tissue by mediating the immune microenvironment. First, we explored the impact of IR on macrophages. We found that cell viability and capacity for promoting angiogenesis were decreased in irradiated macrophages compared to control macrophages. Then, we isolated and characterized rat plasma-derived exosomes (RP-Exos) which were defined as 40C160 nm extracellular vesicles extracted from rat plasma. Afterward, we evaluated the effects of RP-Exos on the behaviors of irradiated macrophages. Our results show that RP-Exos promoted cell proliferation. More importantly, we found that RP-Exos stimulated the immune microenvironment in a manner that improved the angiogenesis-related genes and proteins of irradiated macrophages. The supernatant of macrophage cell cultures was used as conditioned medium to treat human primary umbilical vein endothelial cells, further confirming the pro-angiogenic ability of macrophages receiving RP-Exo intervention. RP-Exos were used in vivo to treat irradiated skin or calvarial defects in irradiated Sprague-Dawley male rats.

DESIGN: The IRIS study is a mixed-methods, community-based, qualitative evaluation of recently arrived im/migrant womens access to sexual and reproductive care. In-depth, semistructured interviews were conducted by trained multilingual and multicultural interviewers with lived migration experience in the participants preferred language. SETTING: Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada from July 2018 to January 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Data collected from community focus groups (four groups, n=29) of both service providers and im/migrant women was used. Following this, qualitative interviews with service providers (n=10) and im/migrant women (n=47) were conducted. Eligible participants self-identified as women; were aged 18C49 and had arrived in Canada from another country. Eligible providers were employed in the health, social or legal sectors working with im/migrant women. RESULTS: The wait period resulted in mistrust and internalised stigma for racialised im/migrant women, for whom the policy resulted in feeling undeserving of care. Resulting administrative burden produced delays and unmet need for care, particularly related to sexual and reproductive healthcare and childrens health. Unexpected costs meant difficult choices between survival and care. Negative health outcomes included the inability to family plan, difficulties during pregnancy, as well as hardships related not being able to seek help for sick children. Community-based organisations provided support in many areas but could not fill all gaps produced by this policy. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight severe, yet commonly overlooked, health inequities produced by a mandatory health coverage wait period within a purportedly universal healthcare system.

Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have become very important to reduce morbidity and mortality. At this point, inactivated vaccines are important because the straightforward process of existing infrastructure used for several licensed human vaccines can be used for SARS-CoV-2. Inactive vaccines provide an antigenic presentation similar to that when they encounter invasive virus particles of the immune system. In this study, in vitro and in vivo safety and efficacy analyzes of lyophilized vaccine candidates inactivated by gamma-irradiation were performed.

Injury to the spleen, among other factors, contribute to persons with SCD being particularly susceptible to infection. Infants and very young children are especially vulnerable. The 'Co-operative Study of Sickle Cell Disease' observed an incidence rate for pneumococcal septicaemia of 10 per 100 person-years in children under the age of three years. Vaccines, including customary pneumococcal vaccines, may be of limited use in this age group. Therefore, prophylactic penicillin regimens may be advisable for this population. This is an update of a Cochrane Review which was first published in 2002, and previously updated, most recently in 2017. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis against pneumococcus in children with SCD receiving antibiotic prophylaxis compared to those without in relation to: 1. incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection; 2. mortality (as reported in the included studies); 3. drug-related adverse events (as reported in the included studies) to the individual and the community; 4. the impact of discontinuing at various ages on incidence of infection and mortality. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which is comprised of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and also two clinical trials registries: ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Registry Platform (not in 2020 given access issues relating to Covid-19 pandemic). Additionally, we carried out hand searching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 25 January 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic antibiotics to prevent pneumococcal infection in children with SCD with placebo, no treatment or a comparator drug. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS The standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane were used. Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. The authors used the GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS Six trials were identified by the searches, of which three trials were eligible for inclusion. A total of 880 children, who were between three months to five years of age at randomization were included. The included studies were conducted in centres in the USA and in Kingston, Jamaica. In trials that investigated initiation of penicillin on risk of pneumococcal infection, the odds ratio was 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.86) (two trials, 457 children) (low-certainty evidence), while for withdrawal the odds ratio was 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 2.71) (one trial, 400 children) (low-certainty evidence). Adverse drug effects were rare and minor. Rates of pneumococcal infection were found to be relatively low in children over the age of five years. Overall, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was judged to be low. The results from the risk of bias assessment undertaken identified two domains in which the risk of bias was considered to be high, these were incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) (two trials) and allocation concealment (selection bias) (one trial). Domains considered to have a low risk of bias for all three trials were selective reporting (reporting bias) and blinding (performance and detection bias). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The evidence examined was determined to be of low certainty and suggests that prophylactic penicillin significantly reduces risk of pneumococcal infection in children with homozygous SCD, and is associated with minimal adverse reactions. Further research may help to determine the ideal age to safely withdraw penicillin.","output":"Prophylactic antibiotics for preventing pneumococcal infection in children with sickle cell disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Mathematical, statistical, and computational models provide insight into the transmission mechanisms and optimal control of healthcare-associated infections. To contextualize recent findings, we offer a summative review of recent literature focused on modeling transmission of pathogens in healthcare settings. RECENT FINDINGS: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic shift in the modeling landscape as the healthcare community has raced to characterize the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and develop effective interventions. Inequities in COVID-19 outcomes have inspired new efforts to quantify how structural bias impacts both health outcomes and model parameterization. Meanwhile, developments in the modeling of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridioides difficile, and other nosocomial infections continue to advance. Machine learning continues to be applied in novel ways, and genomic data is being increasingly incorporated into modeling efforts. SUMMARY: As the type and amount of data continues to grow, mathematical, statistical, and computational modeling will play an increasing role in healthcare epidemiology. Gaps remain in producing models that are generalizable to a variety of time periods, geographic locations, and populations. However, with effective communication of findings and interdisciplinary collaboration, opportunities for implementing models for clinical decision-making and public health decision-making are bound to increase.","output":"Modeling transmission of pathogens in healthcare settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is considered the most important cause of death from infectious disease in developed countries.

METHOD: We evaluated 33 patients with CAP-associated sepsis admitted to the emergency room and followed in the medical wards. Severity assessment scores (CURB-65, PSI, APACHE II, SOFA) and serologic markers (HMGB-1, RAGE, sRAGE) were evaluated on admission. RESULTS: Thirty patients with a diagnosis of CAP-associated sepsis were enrolled in the study within 24 hours after admission. Fourteen (46.6%) had pandemic (H1N1) influenza A virus, 2 (6.6%) had seasonal influenza A and 14 other diagnoses. Of the patients in the study group, 16 (53.3%) had a fatal outcome. ARDS was observed in 17 (56.6%) and a total of 22 patients had severe sepsis on admission (73%). The SOFA score showed the greatest difference between surviving and non-surviving groups (P = .003) with similar results in ARDS patients (P = .005). sRAGE levels tended to be higher in non-surviving (P = .058) and ARDS patients (P = .058). Logistic regression modeling demonstrated that SOFA (P = .013) and sRAGE (P = .05) were the only variables that modified the probability of a fatal outcome. CONCLUSION: The association of elevated sRAGE with a fatal outcome suggests that it may have an independent causal effect in CAP. SOFA scores were the only clinical factor with the ability to identify surviving and ARDS patients.","output":"Soluble RAGE as a severity marker in community acquired pneumonia associated sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The purpose of this review is to describe the epidemiology of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), disparities in organisation and outcome, recent advances in treatment and ongoing controversies.

Characterizing metabolic reprogramming in the TME (Tumor Microenvironment) is of emerging importance in ongoing cancer research and therapy development. Recent developments in mass spectrometry (MS)-based technologies allow simultaneous characterization of metabolic features of tumor, stroma, and immune cells in the TME. However, they only measure a subset of metabolites and cannot provide in situ measurements. Computational methods such as flux balance analysis (FBA) have been developed to estimate metabolic flux from bulk RNA-seq data and have recently been extended to single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. However, it is unclear how reliable the results are, particularly in the context of tissue TME characterization. To investigate this question and fill the analytical gaps, we developed a computational program METAFlux (METAbolic Flux balance analysis), which extends the FBA framework to infer metabolic fluxes from either bulk or single-cell transcriptomic TME data. We benchmarked the prediction accuracy of METAFlux using the exometabolomics data generated on the NCI-60 cell lines and observed significant improvement over existing approaches. We tested METAFlux in bulk RNA-seq data obtained from various tumor types including those in the TCGA. We validated previous knowledge, e.g., lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) has higher glucose uptake than lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We also found a novel subset of LUAD samples with unique metabolic profiles and distinct survival outcome. We further examined METAFlux on scRNA-seq data obtained from coculturing tumor cells with CAR-NK cells and observed high consistency between the predicted and the experimental (i.e., Seahorse extracellular) flux measurements. Throughout our investigation, we discovered various modes of metabolic cooperation and competition between various cell-types in TMEs, which could lead to further target discovery and development.","output":"Characterizing metabolism from bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data using METAFlux"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) following novel coronavirus-2019 (nCoV-19) vaccination is a rare adverse effect.

SOURCE MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and ProQuest Dissertations were searched from inception to 29 June 2017 for studies that investigated the effects of interventions with potential to humanize care of the critically ill on the following outcomes: empathy among critical care professionals, anxiety among relatives, and burnout and compassion fatigue in either group. We defined a humanizing intervention as one with substantial potential to increase physical or emotional proximity to the patient. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and data quality. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Twelve studies addressing four discrete interventions (liberal visitation, diaries, family participation in basic care, and witnessed resuscitation) and one mixed intervention were included. Ten studies measured anxiety among 1,055 relatives. Two studies measured burnout in 288 critical care professionals. None addressed empathy or compassion fatigue. Eleven of the included studies had an overall high risk of bias. No pooled estimates of effect were calculated as a priori criteria for data synthesis were not met. CONCLUSIONS We found insufficient evidence to make any quantitative assessment of the effect of humanizing interventions on any of these psychologic outcomes. We observed a trend towards reduced anxiety among family members who participated in basic patient care, liberal visitation, and diary keeping.

Our methodology embraces and leverages the expert knowledge of the target users, children and their parents, about their sun protection practices to directly influence the design of our mobile just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI). The objectives of this paper are to describe our research procedures and summarize primary findings incorporated into developing our JITAI modules. METHODS: We conducted 3 rounds of iterative co-design workshops with design expert KidsTeam UW children (N: 11C12) and subject expert children and their parents from local communities in California (N: 22C48). Iteratively, we thematically coded the qualitative data generated by participants in the co-design sessions to directly inform design specifications. RESULTS: Three themes emerged: (1) preference for non-linear educational format with less structure,; (2) situations not conducive for prioritizing sun protection; and (3) challenges, barriers, and ambiguity relating to sun protection to protect oneself and ones family. Based on the design ideas and iterative participant feedback, three categories of modules were developed: personalized and interactive data intake module, narrative-education module with augmented reality experiment, person/real-time tailored JITAI, and assessment modules. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first projects that maximally engage children and parents as co-designers to build a technology to improve sun protection with iterative and intentional design principles. Our scalable approach to design a mobile JITAI to improve sun protection will lay the foundation for future public health investigators with similar endeavors.

The relative prevalence of pneumonia types (community acquired, hospital acquired, ventilator associated) and causative pathogens is not well described in patients with respiratory failure. METHODS This was a prospective observational cohort study conducted in the medical ICU (34 beds) of Barnes-Jewish Hospital, an academic referral center of 1,300 beds from January 2016-December 2016. All patients who were prospectively adjudicated to have respiratory failure and pneumonia (RFP) regardless of pneumonia type were classified into one of four microbiologic categories: pathogen negative, antibiotic-susceptible pathogen (according to ceftriaxone susceptibility), antibiotic-resistant pathogen, and viruses. The primary outcomes assessed were the hospital mortality rate and inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy (IIAT) for non-viral pathogens. RESULTS Among 364 consecutive patients with RFP, 63 (17.3%) had organisms that were antibiotic susceptible, 104 (28.6%) had antibiotic-resistant organisms, 118 (32.4%) were pathogen negative, and 79 (21.7%) had viral infections. For these categories, IIAT occurred in 3.2%, 21.2%, 0.8%, and 0, respectively (p < 0.001). Vasopressor-requiring shock was present in 61.9%, 72.1%, 68.6%, and 67.1%, respectively (p = 0.585), and the hospital mortality rates were 27.0%, 48.1%, 31.4%, and 36.7%, respectively (p = 0.020). Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified IIAT as an independent predictor of in-hospital death (adjusted odds ratio 5.28; 95% confidence interval 2.72-10.22; p = 0.012). Male gender, increasing Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores, greater age, and the presence of shock also predicted death. CONCLUSIONS Microbiologic categorization of patients with RFP suggests that antibiotic-resistant pathogens and viruses are associated with the highest mortality rates. Vasopressor-requiring shock was common regardless of the microbiologic categorization of RFP. Future development and use of rapid diagnostics and novel therapeutics targeting specific RFP pathogens may allow more timely administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and enhance antibiotic stewardship practices.","output":"A Prospective One-Year Microbiologic Survey of Combined Pneumonia and Respiratory Failure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Leading to a sustained epidemic spread with >2,000,000 confirmed human infections, including >100,000 deaths, COVID-19 was caused by SARS-CoV-2 and resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis, which brought more challenges to the patients treatment. The S-glycoprotein, which recognized as the key factor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell, contains two functional domains: an ACE2 receptor binding domain and a second domain necessary for fusion of the coronavirus and cell membranes. FURIN activity, exposes the binding and fusion domains, is essential for the zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it has been reported that ACE2 is likely to be the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, FURIN enzyme and ACE2 receptor were expressed in airway epithelia, cardiac tissue, and enteric canals, which considered as the potential target organ of the virus. However, report about the expression of FURIN and ACE2 in oral tissues was limited. Methods In order to investigate the potential infective channel of new coronavirus in oral cavity, we analyze the expression of ACE2 and FURIN that mediate the new coronavirus entry into host cells in oral mucosa using the public single-cell sequence datasets. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining experiment was performed to confirm the expression of ACE2 and FURIN in the protein level. Results The bioinformatics results indicated the differential expression of ACE2 and FURIN on epithelial cells of different oral mucosal tissues and the proportion of FURIN-positive cells was obviously higher than that of ACE2-positive cells. IHC experiments revealed that both the ACE2-positive and FURIN-positive cells in the target tissues were mainly positioned in the epithelial layers, partly expressed in fibroblasts, which further confirm the bioinformatics results. Conclusions Based on these findings, we speculated that SARS-CoV-2 could effectively invade oral mucosal cells though two possible routes: binding to the ACE2 receptor and fusion with cell membrane activated by FURIN protease. Our results indicated that oral mucosa tissues are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, which provides valuable information for virus-prevention strategy in clinical care as well as daily life.","output":"Significant expression of FURIN and ACE2 on oral epithelial cells may facilitate the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, the world has been facing an outbreak of a new disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Our patients suffering from chronic inflammatory rheumatism (CIR), a group of autoimmune pathologies treated by immunosuppressant medication, are particularly concerned. Actions taken -particularly quarantine and its effects on the normal activities, habits or livelihoods of many people -also have a significant impact. There is little information on the impact of the lockdown in patients with CIR with data measured prospectively, in a standardized way, before and during the first lockdown period. Objectives: The objective of this ancillary study was to evaluate the psychological impact of the first lockdown period (anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, catastrophizing.) as well as the evolution of disease activity in patients suffering from CIR. Methods: At two French university hospitals, adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) according to the ACR-EULAR 2010 criteria, spondyloarthritis (SpA) fulfilling the ASAS 2009 criteria and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) according to the Caspar 2006 criteria were consecutively included in the Catastrophism in Chronic Inflammatory Rheumatism (CRIC) study from September 2019. Sociodemographic data, information on the disease and its treatments were collected as well as questionnaires on disease activity (DAS28, CDAI, BASDAI), function (HAQ), quality of life (SF12, EQ5D), anxiety and depression (HADS, GAD7), insomnia (ISI) and catastrophizing scores (PCS). These data were collected prospectively at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. In this ancillary study, data from patients with an assessment before and during lockdown were analyzed. Statistical analyses were descriptive with a paired Student's T-test. Results: In all, 140 patients (49 RA, 69 SpA and 22 PsA) were evaluated before and during lockdown. The median age was 53.5 [44-63] years and 60.7% were women;74 patients (53.2%) were professionally active and 102 (72.9%) were living as couples. The majority of patients (92.9 %) had a disease lasting more than 2 years. Concerning treatments, 63 (45%) were treated by bDMARD monotherapy, 40 (28.5%) by bDMARD+ csDMARD, 17 (12.1%) by csDMARD monotherapy and 2 patients by tsDMARD;90.7% were not taking any corticosteroids and 8.6% were taking 5 mg/d;30% were on NSAIDs.

The most common reason for vaccination hesitancy is fear of preexisting comorbidities, followed by fear of side effects and doctors' negative advice. Factors associated with vaccination willingness were as follows: with liver transplantation, the main source of information on COVID-19 vaccines was from medical doctors, scientists, and scientific journals, with at least college-level education, positive intention toward influenza vaccination during the current season, perceived importance of vaccination for SOT recipients, and having been vaccinated against influenza during the last season.

Aim: In this study, we aimed to: (1) explore the possible changes in migraine frequency, severity, and days with acute medication intake during quarantine period; (2) evaluate possible differences in migraine outcomes in consideration of lifestyle changes, emotions, pandemic diffusion, and COVID-19 infection. Methods: We interviewed patients who were included in the observational Italian Headache Registry (Registro Italiano Cefalee, RICE), retrospectively collecting information on main headache features, lifestyle factors, emotions, individual infection status, and perception of COVID-19 for 2 months before (pre-quarantine) and after the beginning of the quarantine (quarantine). Inclusion criteria were: age > 18, diagnosis of migraine without aura, migraine with aura and chronic migraine, last in-person visit more than 3 months preceding the beginning of quarantine.

Conclusions: Migraine patients showed a mild improvement of migraine features, probably attributable to resilient behavior toward pandemic distress. Disgust regarding the contagion whereas potentially favoring defensive behavior, could potentially worsen migraine. The spontaneous limitation of migraine burden during quarantine could favor patient follow-up via the use of telemedicine visits, reliable diaries, and frequent remote contacts.","output":"Investigating the Effects of COVID-19 Quarantine in Migraine: An Observational Cross-Sectional Study From the Italian National Headache Registry (RICe)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Emergence of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants requires more efficient control measures to limit nosocomial transmission and maintain healthcare capacities during pandemic waves. The relative importance of different strategies is unknown. Methods: We developed an agent-based model and compared the impact of personal protective equipment (PPE), screening of healthcare workers (HCWs), contact tracing of symptomatic HCWs, and HCW cohorting on nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The model was fit on hospital data, assuming 90% effective PPE use in COVID-19 wards. Intervention effects on the effective reproduction number (R), HCW absenteeism and the proportion of infected individuals among tested individuals (positivity rate) were estimated for a more transmissible variant. Findings: Introduction of a variant with 56% higher transmissibility increased - all other variables kept constant - R from 0.4 to 0.65 (+63%) and nosocomial transmissions by 303%, mainly because of more transmissions caused by pre-symptomatic patients and HCWs. Compared to baseline, PPE use in all hospital wards (assuming 90% effectiveness) reduced R by 85% and absenteeism by 57%. Screening HCWs every three days with perfect test sensitivity reduced R by 67%, yielding a maximum test positivity rate of 5%. Screening HCWs every three or seven days assuming time-varying test sensitivities reduced R by 9% and 3%, respectively. Contact tracing reduced R by at least 32% and achieved higher test positivity rates than screening interventions. HCW cohorting reduced R by 5%. Interpretation: PPE use in all hospital wards and regular screening of HCWs seem most effective in preventing nosocomial transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 variants with higher transmissibility.","output":"Interventions to control nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2: a modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCCIN:

response, control and enforcement, and cultural traits of different populations. This study aims to identify significant factors behind the unequal distribution of identified cases and deaths in different countries. Our studys objective is comparative analysis and identification of relations between the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, population characteristics, and government response. METHODS: The top 18 countries worst hit by COVID-19 cases were identified. The data metrics, such as the number of cases, deaths, fatality rates, tests, average life expectancy, and population, were collected and consolidated. RESULTS: Countries with significant percentage of the older population are vulnerable to a high number of deaths due to COVID-19. Developed countries have higher per capita testing, whereas testing is less intensive in developing/underdeveloped countries. There is a consensus among health experts that COVID-19 has higher fatality rates for people above 60, however, with further age, this increases exponentially. Countries with higher life expectancy are also high-income countries, and the best course of action would be to provide specialized support to self-isolate for people of ages 75 and above. CONCLUSION: The behaviour of disease occurring at a large scale and interaction with different populations is studied to understand and differentiate the factors and measures that successfully inhibited the pandemic. The study benchmarks different countries based on their performance and efforts against the pandemic and provides some useful insights on the efficiency of their governance and potential to improve & ramp up their programs. The economic status and existing healthcare infrastructure as they are the key factors in determining the countrys ability to contain and minimize the losses from this pandemic.","output":"Analyzing COVID-19 pandemic for unequal distribution of tests, identified cases, deaths, and fatality rates in the top 18 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Obtaining a definitive neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) diagnosis may take years. The natural history of choroidal neurofibromas in NF1 is unknown. This study evaluates a predominantly pediatric patient cohort for ocular features in NF1, including presence and progression of choroidal abnormalities, to determine their natural history, relationship to other NF1 features, and additive value in NF1 diagnosis. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 106 patients referred for Ophthalmic monitoring or diagnosis of NF1 between January 2012 and December 2018. Clinical records and Near-Infrared Reflectance (NIR) Optical Coherence Tomography imaging were analyzed for prevalence and progression of choroidal neurofibromas on NIR, and relation to other NF1 diagnostic criteria. Results: 54.7% of patients referred had a confirmed NF1 diagnosis, and 45.4% were NF1 suspects. First ophthalmic review resulted in an additional 6.6% patients meeting the diagnostic criteria, and 14.2% later developed sufficient features (total n = 80). Choroidal neurofibromas were present in 75.7% of patients that had NIR imaging and met diagnostic criteria, and detected in the absence of, or prior to Lisch nodules in 13.5%. Progression in the size and number of choroidal neurofibromas occurred in 26 eyes (32.5%) of 14 patients (35.0%), all under 16 years old. Patients without choroidal neurofibromas at first examination never developed them over the study period. Conclusion: Choroidal neurofibromas, detected by NIR imaging, are common in NF1, present early with frequent progression, and represent an additional tool to aid NF1 diagnosis in young children.","output":"The presence and progression of choroidal neurofibromas in a predominantly pediatric population with neurofibromatosis type-1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disorder that often occurs in people over 65 years old. As advanced AD is difficult to manage, accurate diagnosis of the disorder is critical. Previous studies have revealed effective deep learning methods of classification. However, deep learning methods require a large number of image datasets. Moreover, medical images are affected by various environmental factors. In the current study, we propose a deep learning-based method for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is less sensitive to different datasets for external validation, based upon F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT). RESULTS: The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of our proposed network were 86.09%, 80.00%, and 92.96% (respectively) using our dataset, and 91.02%, 87.93%, and 93.57% (respectively) using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We observed that our model classified AD and normal cognitive (NC) cases based on the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), where pathological changes occur in AD. The performance of the GAP layer was considered statistically significant compared to the fully connected layer in both datasets for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (p < 0.01). In addition, performance comparison between the ADNI dataset and our dataset showed no statistically significant differences in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model demonstrated the effectiveness of AD classification using the GAP layer. Our model learned the AD features from PCC in both the ADNI and Severance datasets, which can be seen in the heatmap. Furthermore, we showed that there were no significant differences in performance using statistical analysis.","output":"Multi-slice representational learning of convolutional neural network for Alzheimer's disease classification using positron emission tomography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global community needs to be aware of the potential psychosocial consequences that may be experienced by health care workers who are actively managing patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Here, we evaluate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in patients awaiting renal transplantation and determine whether seroconverted patients with ESKD have durable and functional neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Serum samples were obtained from 164 patients with ESKD by August 2020. Humoral immune responses were evaluated by SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 subunit and nucleoprotein semiquantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotype neutralization assay. All patients with ESKD with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed infection (n = 17) except for 1 individual seroconverted against SARS-CoV-2. Overall seroprevalence (anti-S1 and/or anti-N IgG) was 36% and was higher in patients on hemodialysis (44.2%). A total of 35.6% of individuals who seroconverted were asymptomatic. Seroconversion in the absence of a neutralizing antibody (nAb) titer was observed in 12 patients, all of whom were asymptomatic. Repeat measurements at a median of 93 days from baseline sampling revealed that most individuals retained detectable responses although a significant drop in S1, N and nAb titers was observed. Patients with ESKD, including those who develop asymptomatic disease, routinely seroconvert and produce detectable nAb titers against SARS-CoV-2. Although IgG levels wane over time, the neutralizing antibodies remain detectable in most patients, suggesting some level of protection is likely maintained, particularly in those who originally develop stronger responses.","output":"Neutralizing Antibody Responses After SARS-CoV-2 Infection in End-Stage Kidney Disease and Protection Against Reinfection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the implementation of strict quarantine and adjunct health measures, Fiji was largely spared from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In April 2021, the arrival of the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in a major outbreak that is only now under control. The country enacted swift countermeasures to reduce population movement, but the delta variant gained a foothold in the peri-urban areas of the largest city, Suva, and from there spread to other major urban centres of the largest island, Viti Levu. A very effective vaccination campaign has since been implemented resulting in a rate of two-dose vaccination, above 70%, that exceeds many higher income countries and, as of late October 2021, the numbers of COVID-19 cases were in decline. Fijian life, especially in rural settings, is based on hierarchical but supportive community structures and the responsibilities that flow from community membership, for example, attending large funerals, mitigated against the organised and systematic control response instituted by the Fijian Ministry of Health and Medical Services, including vaccination, and the other Government agencies.

METHODS Right knees of 8-week-old male Wistar rats were injected with 1 mg MIA in 50 l saline and left knees were injected with 50 l saline as controls. After 1, 2, and 3 weeks (n = 5 at each time point), changes in cartilage morphology and composition were quantified using equilibrium partitioning of an ionic contrast agent microfocal computed tomography (CT), and changes in subchondral and trabecular bone were assessed by standard CT. ROS were characterized by in vivo fluorescence imaging at 1, 11, and 21 days (n = 5 at each time point). Three weeks following fluorescence imaging, alterations in knee joint vascularity were quantified with CT after perfusion of a vascular contrast agent. RESULTS Femoral cartilage volume, thickness, and proteoglycan content were significantly decreased in MIA-injected knees compared with control knees, accompanied by loss of trabecular bone and erosion of subchondral bone surface. ROS quantities were significantly increased 1 day after MIA injection and subsequently decreased gradually, having returned to normal by 21 days. Vascularity in whole knees and distal femora was significantly increased at 21 days after MIA injection. CONCLUSION Contrast-enhanced CT and fluorescence imaging were combined to characterize articular cartilage, subchondral bone, vascularization, and ROS, providing unprecedented 3-dimensional joint imaging and quantification in multiple tissues during OA progression. These advanced imaging techniques have the potential to become standardized methods for comprehensive evaluation of articular joint degeneration and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy.","output":"Quantitative imaging of cartilage and bone morphology, reactive oxygen species, and vascularization in a rodent model of osteoarthritis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tuberculosis is one of the dangerous infectious diseases, killing over a million people worldwide each year.

Telehealth systems that include health coaching and remote monitoring are making inroads in managing chronic conditions and may be especially suited for older populations. OBJECTIVE: This literature review aimed to investigate the current status of health coaching interventions incorporating telehealth technology and the associated effectiveness of this intervention to deliver health care with an emphasis on older adults (aged 65 and older). METHODS: A literature review was conducted to identify the research conducted on health coaching combined with remote monitoring for delivering health care to older adults. The Ovid MEDLINE and CINAHL databases were queried using a combination of relevant search terms (including middle aged, aged, older adult, elderly, health coaching, and wellness coaching). The search retrieved 196 papers published from January 2010 to September 2019 in English. Following a systematic review process, the titles and abstracts of the papers retrieved were screened for applicability to health coaching for older adults to define a subset for further review. Papers were excluded if the studied population did not include older adults. The full text of the 42 papers in this subset was then reviewed, and 13 papers related to health coaching combined with remote monitoring for older adults were included in this review. RESULTS: Of the 13 studies reviewed, 10 found coaching supported by telehealth technology to provide effective outcomes. Effectiveness outcomes assessed in the studies included hospital admissions/re-admissions, mortality, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level, body weight, blood pressure, physical activity level, fatigue, quality of life, and user acceptance of the coaching program and technology. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth systems that include health coaching have been implemented in older populations as a viable intervention method for managing chronic conditions with mixed results. Health coaching combined with telehealth may be an effective solution for providing health care to older adults.

The reopening of America and restarting of interventional techniques and elective surgical procedures has started. Unfortunately, with resurgence in some states, restrictions are once again being imposed. In addition, even during the Phase II and III of reopening, chronic pain patients and interventional pain physicians have faced difficulties because of the priority selection of elective surgical procedures.Chronic pain patients require high intensity care, specifically during a pandemic such as COVID-19. Consequently, it has become necessary to provide guidance for triaging interventional pain procedures, or related elective surgery restrictions during a pandemic. OBJECTIVES The aim of these guidelines is to provide education and guidance for physicians, healthcare administrators, the public and patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our goal is to restore the opportunity to receive appropriate care for our patients who may benefit from interventional techniques. METHODS The American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) has created the COVID-19 Task Force in order to provide guidance for triaging interventional pain procedures or related elective surgery restrictions to provide appropriate access to interventional pain management (IPM) procedures in par with other elective surgical procedures. In developing the guidance, trustworthy standards and appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest were applied with a section of a panel of experts from various regions, specialties, types of practices (private practice, community hospital and academic institutes) and groups. The literature pertaining to all aspects of COVID-19, specifically related to epidemiology, risk factors, complications, morbidity and mortality, and literature related to risk mitigation and stratification was reviewed. The evidence -- informed with the incorporation of the best available research and practice knowledge was utilized, instead of a simplified evidence-based approach. Consequently, these guidelines are considered evidence-informed with the incorporation of the best available research and practice knowledge. RESULTS The Task Force defined the medical urgency of a case and developed an IPM acuity scale for elective IPM procedures with 3 tiers. These included emergent, urgent, and elective procedures. Examples of emergent and urgent procedures included new onset or exacerbation of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), acute trauma or acute exacerbation of degenerative or neurological disease resulting in impaired mobility and inability to perform activities of daily living. Examples include painful rib fractures affecting oxygenation and post-dural puncture headaches limiting the ability to sit upright, stand and walk. In addition, urgent procedures include procedures to treat any severe or debilitating disease that prevents the patient from carrying out activities of daily living. Elective procedures were considered as any condition that is stable and can be safely managed with alternatives. LIMITATIONS COVID-19 continues to be an ongoing pandemic. When these recommendations were developed, different stages of reopening based on geographical regulations were in process. The pandemic continues to be dynamic creating every changing evidence-based guidance. Consequently, we provided evidence-informed guidance. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges in IPM creating needless suffering for pain patients.

The lack of a vaccine, as well as preventive and therapeutic strategies, emphasize the need to develop new strategies to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission and pathogenesis. Since mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 share a common genus, lessons learnt from MHV and SARS-CoV could offer mechanistic insights into SARS-CoV-2. This review provides a comprehensive review of MHV in mice and SARS-CoV-2 in humans, thereby highlighting further translational avenues in the development of innovative strategies in controlling the detrimental course of SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, we have focused on various aspects, including host species, organotropism, transmission, clinical disease, pathogenesis, control and therapy, MHV as a model for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 as well as mouse models for infection with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. While MHV in mice and SARS-CoV-2 in humans share various similarities, there are also differences that need to be addressed when studying murine models.

The Antibiotic Self-Stewardship Time Out Program (SSTOP) evaluated the implementation at VAMCs of an Antibiotic Timeout 3 days after the initiation of antibiotics to encourage providers to review continued use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Methods Sites launched the SSTOP note templates in a rolling fashion from June 2019-March 2020. Clinical pharmacists largely drove the implementation. The vancomycin note template was implemented at 6 of 8 sites and the antipseudomonal note template across 4 of 8 sites. Two sites were unable to launch the note templates due to lack of resources, however they utilized SSTOP principles/guided tools. From Sept 2019-Nov 2020 we conducted post-launch qualitative interviews with Antibiotic Stewardship Program (ASP) champions involved in implementation across the 8 VAMCs. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed for thematic content. Results Feedback from ASP providers suggests prescribers had mixed reviews on the note template, but overall liked the process and deemed it to be straightforward. Many valued the algorithm, indicating it was helpful in both thinking about antibiotics prior to initiation, and identification of appropriate antibiotics. Barriers included staffing (e.g., rotating residents/turnover), surgery service, information technology (IT) support, COVID-19, and the need to remind providers to use the template. Facilitators consisted of strong stewardship, local champions (e.g., ID Fellow), medicine service, and SSTOP data feedback reports. Recommendations largely centered on improvements to the note template usability and to SSTOP feedback reports (e.g., inclusion of patient/provider-level data). Conclusion Overall, the SSTOP note templates were considered acceptable and straightforward. By guiding providers to prescribe more appropriate antibiotics, they act as influencers for practice change, and may strengthen provider/ASP relations. Plans for continued utilization of the note templates after the project concludes suggest SSTOP may serve as a way to achieve sustainable promotion of antibiotic use improvements.

However, the mechanism of NG\\\\induced enhanced HIV\\\\1 transmission is unknown. METHODS: (a) The cervical tissues were exposed to NG, and cytokine induction was monitored by measuring cytokine proteins in culture supernatants and cytokine mRNAs in tissues. (b) Transcription and replication of HIV\\\\1 in TZM\\\\bl, U1, and ACH2 cells were measured by Beta\\\\Gal activity and p24 proteins in the supernatant, respectively. (c) HIV\\\\1 transmission was assayed in an organ culture system by measuring transmitted HIV\\\\1 in supernatant and HIV\\\\1 gag mRNA in the tissues. (d) Transcriptome analysis was done using second generation sequencing. RESULTS: (a) NG induced membrane ruffling of epithelial layer, caused migration of CD3+ cells to the intraepithelial region, and induced high levels of inflammatory cytokines IL\\\\1 and TNF\\\\. (b) NG\\\\induced supernatants (NGIS) increased HIV\\\\1 transcription, induced HIV\\\\1 from latently infected cells, and increased transmission of HIV\\\\1 across cervical mucosa. (c) Transcriptome analysis of the epithelial layer of the tissues exposed to NG, and HIV\\\\1 showed significant upregulation of CXCL10 and IL8. IL\\\\1 increased the induction of CXCL10 and IL\\\\8 expression in cervical mucosa with a concomitant increase in HIV\\\\1 transmission. CONCLUSION: We present a model in which IL\\\\1 produced from cervical epithelium during NG exposure increases CXCL10 and IL8 in epithelia.

Cardiac impairment has been reported to varying degrees by varying methodologies in cross-sectional studies. Using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), we investigated the 12-month trajectory of cardiac impairment in individuals with Long Covid. Methods 534 individuals with Long Covid underwent baseline CMR (T1 and T2 mapping, cardiac mass, volumes, function, and strain) and multi-organ MRI at 6 months (IQR 4.3,7.3) since first post-COVID-19 symptoms and 330 were rescanned at 12.6 (IQR 11.4, 14.2) months if abnormal findings were reported at baseline. Symptoms, standardised questionnaires, and blood samples were collected at both timepoints. Cardiac impairment was defined as one or more of: low left or right ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF and RVEF), high left or right ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV and RVEDV), low 3D left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS), or elevated native T1 in []3 cardiac segments. A significant change over time was reported by comparison with 92 healthy controls. Results The technical success of this multiorgan assessment in non-acute settings was 99.1% at baseline, and 98.3% at follow up, with 99.6% and 98.8% for CMR respectively. Of individuals with Long Covid, 102/534 [19%] had cardiac impairment at baseline; 71/102 had complete paired data at 12 months. Of those, 58% presented with ongoing cardiac impairment at 12 months. High sensitivity cardiac troponin I and B-type natriuretic peptide were not predictive of CMR findings, symptoms, or clinical outcomes. At baseline, low LVEF, high RVEDV and low GLS were associated with cardiac impairment. Low LVEF at baseline was associated with persistent cardiac impairment at 12 months. Conclusion Cardiac impairment, other than myocarditis, is present in 1 in 5 individuals with Long Covid at 6 months, persisting in over half of those at 12 months. Cardiac-related blood biomarkers are unable to identify cardiac impairment in Long COVID.

These essential functions of 3CLpro and PLpro in virus duplication make these proteases a promising target for discovering potential therapeutic candidates and possible treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study aimed to screen a unique set of protease inhibitors library against 3CLpro and PLpro of the SARS-CoV-2. A molecular docking study was performed using PyRx to reveal the binding affinity of the selected ligands and molecular dynamic simulations were executed to assess the three-dimensional stability of protein-ligand complexes. The pharmacodynamics parameters of the inhibitors were predicted using admetSAR. The top two ligands (Nafamostat and VR23) based on docking scores were selected for further studies. Selected ligands showed excellent pharmacokinetic properties with proper absorption, bioavailability and minimal toxicity. Due to the emerging and efficiency of remdesivir and dexamethasone in healing COVID-19 patients, ADMET properties of the selected ligands were thus compared with it.

In Indonesia, a home food gardening program was initiated in the early 2010s to optimally utilize home yards for improving the adequacy of food consumption and nutrition intake of households. In the present challenging situation of Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in home gardens to help mitigate food insecurity caused by food supply chain disruptions and the emergence of physical and economic barriers that limit access to food. This paper is a review of pertinent literature to find out the characteristics of home gardens and home gardening program in Indonesia and then examine their contribution to each pillar of food security: availability, access, utilization, and stability. The experiences of home gardens worldwide are reviewed to understand the global context of home gardens and food security. Literature reviews found a positive impact of home gardening program on food availability, access, and utilization. However, improving food stability through a home food gardening program is still a challenging task. This finding implies that the positive contribution of the home food gardening program to household food security is largely limited to the program period. Nevertheless, the program is still an important strategy to address food insecurity and nutrition deficiency of low-income households. Future research should assess factors affecting the sustainability of the program to derive viable models applicable in diverse circumstances. There is a need for research to assess the value and importance of home gardens as a coping strategy to reduce vulnerability and food insecurity in the present global Covid-19 pandemic. ? 2021, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

Test & Trace partnered with numerous organizations to direct mobile COVID-19 testing from concept through implementation to reduce COVID-19-related health inequities. PROGRAM Test & Trace employs a community-informed mobile COVID-19 testing model to deliver testing to the hardest-hit, underserved communities. Community partners, uniquely knowledgeable of the residents they serve, are engaged as decision makers and operational partners in mobile COVID-19 testing delivery. IMPLEMENTATION Through several mobile testing methods, community partners choose testing locations and tailor outreach to their community. Test & Trace assumes logistical responsibility for mobile testing but defers critical programmatic decisions and community engagement to partners. Integral to the success of this program is responsive, bidirectional communication. EVALUATION During the reporting period of December 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021, Test & Trace's community-informed mobile COVID-19 testing model provided testing to 150351 unique patients and processed 274083 tests in total. The available outcomes data and qualitative feedback provided by community partners illustrate that this intervention, combined with robust governmental investment, successfully ensured that NYC-identified, low-resource neighborhoods had greater access to COVID-19 testing. DISCUSSION Making community partners decision makers reduced inequities in access to testing for communities of color. In addition, the model has served as the framework for Test & Trace's community-informed mobile COVID-19 vaccination program, operated in concert with NYC's Vaccine Command Center, and is a foundation for addressing health inequities at scale, including during public health crises.","output":"Community-Informed Mobile COVID-19 Testing Model to Addressing Health Inequities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives We aimed to evaluate the characteristics and management outcomes of patients who developed tracheal stenosis after invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) due to COVID-19 in this study. Design, settings and participants The data of 7 patients with tracheal stenosis and 201 patients without tracheal stenosis after IMV due to COVID-19 between March 2020 and October 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Interventions Flexible bronchoscopy was performed for the diagnosis of tracheal stenosis and the evaluation of the treatment's effectiveness and rigid bronchoscopy was applied for the dilatation of tracheal stenosis. Measurements and Main Results In the follow-up period, tracheal stenosis was observed in 7 of 208 patients (2 women, 5 men, 3.3%). The patients were divided into two groups as patients with tracheal stenosis (n=7) and patients without tracheal stenosis (n=201). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and comorbidities (p > 0.05). The mean duration of IMV of the patients with tracheal stenosis was longer than patients without tracheal stenosis (27.9  13 vs 11.2  9 days, p < 0.0001, respectively). Three (43%) of the stenoses were web-like and four (57%) of them were complex type stenosis. The mean length of the stenoses was 1.81  0.82 cm.

The epidemic gradually started in Italy at the end of February 2020, and by May 31, 2020, 232,664 cases and 33,340 deaths were confirmed. As a result of this pandemic, the Italian Ministerial Decree issued on March 11, 2020, enforced lockdown; therefore, many social, recreational, and cultural centers remained closed for months. In Apulia (southern Italy), all non-urgent hospital activities were suspended, and some wards were closed, with a consequent reduction in the use of the water network and the formation of stagnant water. This situation could enhance the risk of exposure of people to waterborne diseases, including legionellosis. The purpose of this study was to monitor the microbiological quality of the water network (coliforms, E. coli, Enterococci, P. aeruginosa, and Legionella) in three wards (A, B and C) of a large COVID-19 regional hospital, closed for three months due to the COVID-19 emergency. Our study revealed that all three wards' water network showed higher contamination by Legionella pneumophila sg 1 and sg 6 at T1 (after lockdown) compared to the period before the lockdown (T0). In particular, ward A at T1 showed a median value = 5600 CFU/L (range 0-91,000 CFU/L) vs T0, median value = 75 CFU/L (range 0-5000 CFU/L) (p-value = 0.014); ward B at T1 showed a median value = 200 CFU/L (range 0-4200 CFU/L) vs T0, median value = 0 CFU/L (range 0-300 CFU/L) (p-value = 0.016) and ward C at T1 showed a median value = 175 CFU/L (range 0-22,000 CFU/L) vs T0, median value = 0 CFU/L (range 0-340 CFU/L) (p-value < 0.001). In addition, a statistically significant difference was detected in ward B between the number of positive water samples at T0 vs T1 for L. pneumophila sg 1 and sg 6 (24% vs 80% p-value < 0.001) and for coliforms (0% vs 64% p-value < 0.001). Moreover, a median value of coliform load resulted 3 CFU/100 ml (range 0-14 CFU/100 ml) at T1, showing a statistically significant increase versus T0 (0 CFU/100 ml) (p-value < 0.001).

INSUFFICIENT GUIDANCE ON THE USE OF DONOR HUMAN MILK AND THE ROLE OF HUMAN MILK BANKS IN THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE: COVID-19 clinical management guidelines in seven countries in Southeast Asia are not aligned with WHO recommendations despite the lack of evidence of transmission through either breastmilk or breastfeeding. The use of safe donor human milk accessed through human milk banks is also insufficiently recommended, even in countries with an existing human milk bank, leading to a gap in evidence-based management of COVID-19. This highlights long-standing challenges as well as opportunities in the safe, equitable, and resilient implementation of human milk banks in the region. CONCLUSIONS: This statement reflects the expert opinion of the Regional Human Milk Bank Network for Southeast Asia and Beyond on the need to revisit national guidelines based on the best evidence for breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic, to incorporate human milk bank services in national obstetric and newborn care guidelines for COVID-19 where possible, and to ensure that operations of human milk banks are adapted to meet the needs of the current pandemic and to sustain donor human milk supply in the long-term.

We assessed the efficacy and durability of a virtual, multidisciplinary \\"GDMT Team\\" on medical therapy prescription for HFrEF. METHODS AND RESULTS Consecutive hospitalizations in patients with HFrEF40% were prospectively identified from February 3 to March 1, 2020 (usual care group) and March 2 to August 28, 2020 (intervention group). Patients with critical illness, de-novo HF, and SBP<90mmHg were excluded. In the intervention group, a pharmacist-physician GDMT Team provided optimization suggestions to treating teams based on an evidence-based algorithm. The primary outcome was a GDMT optimization score, the net of positive (+1 for new initiations or up-titrations) & negative therapeutic changes (-1 for discontinuations or down-titrations) at hospital discharge. Serious in-hospital safety events were assessed. Among 278 consecutive encounters with HFrEF, 118 met eligibility criteria; 29 (25%) received usual care and 89 (75%) received the GDMT Team intervention. Among usual care encounters, there were no changes in GDMT prescription during hospitalization. In the intervention group, -blocker (72% to 88%; P=0.01), ARNI (6% to 17%; P=0.03), MRA (16% to 29%; P=0.05), and triple therapy (9% to 26%; P<0.01) prescriptions increased during hospitalization. After adjustment, the GDMT Team was associated with an increase in GDMT optimization score (+0.58; 95% CI: +0.09 to +1.07; P=0.02). There were no serious in-hospital adverse events.

In addition, the emergence of novel SARS CoV2 variants increases the threat of uncontrolled dissemination and additional antiviral therapies are urgently needed for effective containment. In previous in vitro studies Echinacea purpurea demonstrated strong antiviral activity against enveloped viruses, including SARS CoV2. In this study, we examined the potential of Echinacea purpurea in preventing and treating respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and in particular, SARS CoV2 infections. Methods: 120 healthy volunteers (m,f, 18 to 75 years) were randomly assigned to Echinacea prevention or control group without any intervention. After a run-in week, participants went through 3 prevention cycles of 2, 2 and 1 months with daily 2400mg Echinacea purpurea extract (Echinaforce, EF). The prevention cycles were interrupted by breaks of 1 week. Acute respiratory symptoms were treated with 4000 mg EF for up to 10 days, and their severity assessed via a diary. Naso/oropharyngeal swabs and venous blood samples were routinely collected every month and during acute illnesses for detection and identification of respiratory viruses, including SARS CoV2 via RT qPCR and serology. Results: Summarized over all phases of prevention, 21 and 29 samples tested positive for any virus in the EF and control group, of which 5 and 14 samples tested SARS-CoV-2 positive (RR=0.37, Chi square test, p=0.03). Overall, 10 and 14 symptomatic episodes occurred, of which 5 and 8 were COVID 19 (RR=0.70, Chi-square test, p>0.05). EF treatment when applied during acute episodes significantly reduced the overall virus load by at least 2.12 log10 or approx. 99% (t test, p<0.05), the time to virus clearance by 8.0 days for all viruses (Wilcoxon test, p=0.02) and by 4.8 days for SARS CoV2 (p>0.05) in comparison to control. Finally, EF treatment significantly reduced fever days (1 day vs 11 days, Chi square test, p=0.003) but not the overall symptom severity. There were fewer COVID-19 related hospitalizations in the EF treatment group (N=0 vs N=2). Discussion/Conclusion: EF exhibited antiviral effects and reduced the risk of viral RTIs, including SARS CoV2. By substantially reducing virus loads in infected subjects, EF offers a supportive addition to existing mandated treatments like vaccinations. Future confirmatory studies are warranted.

We present a case of disseminated histoplasmosis in an immunocompetent patient previously diagnosed with sarcoidosis. METHODS/CASE REPORT: A 69-year-old obese male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and long-standing sarcoidosis was admitted to the hospital for several months of intermittent fevers and pancytopenia. His sarcoidosis was diagnosed 21 years prior, initially involving the lungs and eventually showing cardiac involvement, requiring a pacemaker. He had been treated with methotrexate and prednisone. His recent medical history was also significant for COVID-19 infection, diagnosed 3 months before admission. His fevers were initially attributed to sarcoidosis and his pancytopenia to methotrexate. However, his symptoms continued despite discontinuation of his medications, and further workup was initiated. Computed tomography showed hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy, concerning for a lymphoproliferative disorder. The patient underwent a bone marrow biopsy that showed noncaseating granulomas and microorganisms consistent with histoplasmosis on fungal stain. Bone marrow cultures were not possible as the marrow was inaspirable. The patient subsequently underwent a lymph node biopsy with both morphology and culture identifying histoplasmosis. Urine and serum histoplasma antigen also returned positive. The patients overall clinical picture was consistent with disseminated histoplasmosis and he was administered intravenous Amphotericin B for 3 weeks followed by oral itraconazole for 1 year. One month follow-up after discharge showed significant improvement in the patients condition.

Poor awareness and access to effective diagnosis have led to this enormous disease burden, calling for point-of-care, minimally invasive diagnosis methods. Here, an end-to-end quantitative approach for a new kind of diagnosis has been developed, comprising identification of optimal biomarkers, design of the sensor, and simulation of the diagnostic circuit. Using miRNA expression data in the public domain, we identified circulating miRNA biomarkers specific to cervical cancer using multi-tier screening. Synthetic riboregulators called toehold switches specific for the biomarker panel were then designed. To predict the dynamic range of toehold switches for use in genetic circuits as biosensors, we developed a generic grammar of these switches, and built a multivariate linear regression model using thermodynamic features derived from RNA secondary structure and interaction. The model yielded predictions of toehold efficacy with an adjusted R2 = 0.59. Reaction kinetics modelling was performed to predict the sensitivity of the second-generation toehold switches to the miRNA biomarkers. Simulations showed a linear response between 10nM and 100nM before saturation.

Whether hospitalization rates and in-hospital mortality were affected by the pandemic in patients with acute symptomatic heart failure (HF) was investigated in this study. METHODS AND RESULTS: Administrative data provided by 67 German Helios hospitals were examined for patients with a main discharge diagnosis of HF using ICD codes. Urgent hospital admissions per day were compared for a study period (13 March-21 May 2020) with control intervals in 2020 (1 January-12 March) and 2019 (13 March-21 May), resulting in a total of 13 484 patients excluding all patients with laboratory-proven COVID-19 infection. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated using Poisson regression. Generalized linear mixed models were used for univariable and multivariable analysis to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality. The number of admissions per day was lower in the study period compared to the same year [IRR 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-0.73, P < 0.01] and the previous year control group (IRR 0.73, 95% CI 0.70-0.76, P < 0.01). Age was similar throughout the intervals, but case severity increased in terms of distribution within New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes and comorbidities. Within the study period, 30-day rates for urgent hospital readmissions were higher compared to the same year but not the previous year control group. In-hospital mortality was 7.3% in the study period, 6.1% in the same year (P = 0.03) and 6.0% in the previous year control group (P = 0.02). In multivariable analysis, age, NYHA class and other predictors of fatal outcome were identified but hospitalization during the study period was not independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Our data showed a significant reduction of urgent hospital admissions for HF with increased case severity and concomitant in-hospital mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Identifying causes of reduced inpatient treatment rates is essential for the understanding and valuation with regard to future optimal management of patients with HF.","output":"In-hospital care in acute heart failure during the COVID-19 pandemic: insights from the German-wide Helios hospital network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and related quarantine orders will impact the mental health of millions of individuals in the United States.

In this study, we identify the spike protein subunits that contain antigenic determinants and examine the neutralization capacity of polyclonal sera from a cohort of patients that tested qRT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. Using an ELISA format, we assessed binding of human sera to spike subunit 1 (S1), spike subunit 2 (S2) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike. To functionally identify the key target of neutralizing antibody, we depleted sera of subunit-specific antibodies to determine the contribution of these individual subunits to the antigen-specific neutralizing antibody response.

The advent of emicizumab as a prophylactic treatment has led to a reduction in bleed frequency and a significant improvement in overall quality of life. No research to date has examined the nature of this improvement on treated individuals and their families. AIMS: The Emi & Me study aims to capture the real\\\\life experience of using emicizumab for PwHi and their families. METHODS: Participants were recruited through treatment centres, social media and by word of mouth. Each participant and a family member, if available, took part in a semistructured qualitative interview. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. All elements of the study were reviewed by local statutory authorities and informed consent was sought from all participants. RESULTS: Fifteen PwHi, mean age 27.2 years (range 8C63 years), most with a family member, participated in a single qualitative interview online (n = 13), by telephone (n = 1) or in person (n = 1). Mean time on emicizumab was 2.26 years (range 1C5 years). Six major themes emerged: bleeds; pain; treatment burden; control; freedom (for both PwHi and family members) and missed potential. Emicizumab prophylaxis has delivered significant improvements in the lives of the participants. Despite these improvements, some participants felt that their pre\\\\existing physical disabilities and the lack of physiotherapy provision had prevented them achieving similar improvements in their functional ability. CONCLUSION: This study shows that in reducing bleeds, pain and treatment burden, emicizumab had given PwHi greater control over their condition, allowing a sense of freedom they had not experienced with factor VIII or bypassing agent prophylaxis. However, for emicizumab to be truly effective, there is a need to ensure the continued availability and accessibility of robust multidisciplinary support services. Without this, it is unlikely that PwHi will realize the life\\\\changing potential offered either by emicizumab or any other novel treatment approach.

They are of interest due to their roles in fatty acid synthesis and their potential to modify plant seed oils through biotechnology. Fatty acyl-ACP thioesterases (FAT) are divided into two families, i.e., FATA and FATB, according to their amino acid sequence and substrate specificity. The high oil content in Jatropha curcas L. seed has attracted global attention due to its potential for the production of biodiesel. However, the detailed effects of JcFATA and JcFATB on fatty acid biosynthesis and plant growth and development are still unclear. In this study, we found that JcFATB transcripts were detected in all tissues and organs examined, with especially high accumulation in the roots, leaves, flowers, and some stages of developing seeds, and JcFATA showed a very similar expression pattern. Subcellular localization of the JcFATA-GFP and JcFATB-GFP fusion protein in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts showed that both JcFATA and JcFATB localized in chloroplasts. Heterologous expression of JcFATA and JcFATB in Arabidopsis thaliana individually generated transgenic plants with longer roots, stems and siliques, larger rosette leaves, and bigger seeds compared with those of the wild type, indicating the overall promotion effects of JcFATA and JcFATB on plant growth and development while JcFATB had a larger impact. Compositional analysis of seed oil revealed that all fatty acids except 22:0 were significantly increased in the mature seeds of JcFATA-transgenic Arabidopsis lines, especially unsaturated fatty acids, such as the predominant fatty acids of seed oil, 18:1, 18:2, and 18:3. In the mature seeds of the JcFATB-transgenic Arabidopsis lines, most fatty acids were increased compared with those in wild type too, especially saturated fatty acids, such as 16:0, 18:0, 20:0, and 22:0. Our results demonstrated the promotion effect of JcFATA and JcFATB on plant growth and development, and their possible utilization to modify the seed oil composition and content in higher plants.","output":"Heterologous Expression of Jatropha curcas Fatty Acyl-ACP Thioesterase A (JcFATA) and B (JcFATB) Affects Fatty Acid Accumulation and Promotes Plant Growth and Development in Arabidopsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections cause Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and induce a specific antibody response. Serological assays detecting IgG against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein are useful to monitor the immune response after infection or vaccination. The objective of our study was to evaluate the clinical performance of the Siemens SARS-CoV-2 IgG (sCOVG) assay. Methods: Sensitivity and specificity of the Siemens sCOVG test were evaluated on 178 patients with SARS-CoV-2-infection and 160 pre-pandemic samples in comparison with its predecessor test COV2G. Furthermore, correlation with virus neutralization titers was investigated on 134 samples of convalescent COVID-19 patients. Results: Specificity of the sCOVG test was 99.4% and sensitivity was 90.5% (COV2G assay 78.7%; p<0.0001). S1-RBD antibody levels showed a good correlation with virus neutralization titers (r=0.843; p<0.0001) and an overall qualitative agreement of 98.5%. Finally, median S1-RBD IgG levels increase with age and were significantly higher in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (median levels general ward: 25.7 U/ml; intensive care: 59.5 U/ml) than in outpatients (3.8 U/ml; p<0.0001). Conclusions: Performance characteristics of the sCOVG assay have been improved compared to the predecessor test COV2G. Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD IgG levels could be used as a surrogate for virus neutralization capacity.

Access to routine viral load testing is crucial to identify women with unsuppressed viral load early in pregnancy and to provide timely intervention to improve viral suppression. This study aimed to determine the coverage of maternal viral load monitoring nationally, focusing on viral load testing, documentation of viral load test results, and viral suppression (viral load < 50 copies/mL). At the time of this study, the first-line regimen for women initiating ART during pregnancy was non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI)-based regimen. METHODS Between 1 October and 15 November 2019, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 15- to 49-year-old pregnant women attending antenatal care in 1589 nationally representative public health facilities. Data on ART status, viral load testing and viral load test results were extracted from medical records. Logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with coverage of viral load testing. RESULTS Of 8112 participants eligible for viral load testing, 81.7% received viral load testing, and 94.1% of the viral load test results were documented in the medical records. Of those who had viral load test results documented, 74.1% were virally suppressed. Women initiated on ART during pregnancy and who received ART for three months had lower coverage of viral load testing (73%) and viral suppression (56.8%) compared with women initiated on ART before pregnancy (82.8% and 76.1%, respectively). Initiating ART during pregnancy rather than before pregnancy was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving a viral load test during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio = 1.6, 95% confidence interval: 1.4-1.8). CONCLUSIONS Viral load result documentation was high; viral load testing could be improved especially among women initiating ART during pregnancy. The low viral suppression among women who initiated ART during pregnancy despite receiving ART for three months highlights the importance of enhanced adherence counselling during pregnancy. Our finding supports the WHO recommendation that a Dolutegravir-containing regimen be the preferred regimen for women who are newly initiating ART during pregnancy for more rapid viral suppression.","output":"Coverage of maternal viral load monitoring during pregnancy in South Africa: Results from the 2019 national Antenatal HIV Sentinel Survey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cause of glaucoma in 131 enucleated eyes from 128 cats was determined in a retrospective histologic study.

However, Corona has also triggered a rethinking of the values, meaning and purpose of work content and behavioral norms. This paper aims to identify and analyse management failures observed and experiences made during the Corona pandemic. Based on these findings recommendations for good leadership practices are given. By literature research reported experiences from physicians and nurses were analysed related to working conditions, motivation-to-work, and satisfaction with incentive systems. Furthermore, interviews with clinical staff working under Corona conditions were realised based on a structured questionnaire. The workload of nursing has increased significantly due to economization: from 2005 to 2017, the number of treatment cases increased by 12%, while at the same time, the number of beds decreased by 9.4% and the length of stay shortened from 8.4 to 7.3 days. The accumulated nursing overtime in German hospitals alone is equivalent to 17,800 full-time employees. During the Corona crisis the working situation especially for nurses facilitating patients ventilated on the intensive care unit has dramatically worsened: additional overtime, high patient mortality, resource-intensive and stressful care requirements lead to prostration and mental exhaustion. As a consequence of this tremendous work burden for nurses and physicians during the Corona pandemic up to 30% of these occupational groups gave voice to inadequate working conditions and utter their intention to quit their jobs. Demotivation and a flight into professions remote from medicine are a reaction of many physicians and nurses to years of leadership failures in hospitals and politics, as well as an increasing economization of medicine. Between 68 and 82% of physicians cite the cost pressure associated with rationing as a source of dissatisfaction with their professional situation. It is up to management to learn from these findings, implement the necessary measures and provide family-friendly working conditions for occupational groups working at the bed-side. A value-based leadership model that takes into account the specific conditions prevailing in the healthcare industry was developed and serves as a compass in meeting and overcoming this challenge.

Vitamin D is important for the functioning of the musculoskeletal, immune and respiratory systems, which are relevant determinants of secondary health conditions in SCI. An insufficiency should be treated with vitamin D supplementation. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the optimal dosage and duration of vitamin D supplementation for individualised and long-term management of the vitamin D status in the context of SCI. This paper presents the protocol for the vitamin D supplementation in chronic spinal cord injury (VitD-SCI) trial that aims to investigate the effect of a 12-month intake of vitamin D supplementation on vitamin D status as well as on several secondary parameters among individuals with a chronic SCI. METHODS AND ANALYSES: The VitD-SCI trial is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, parallel-group, superiority trial, conducted at the Swiss Paraplegic Centre. A total of 45 participants living with an SCI for at least 3 years (chronic SCI) and a vitamin D insufficiency at the first study visit, will be randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups.

Imperfections in planning vaccine acquisition and difficulties in implementing distribution among the population, however, have hampered the control of the virus so far. Methods We propose a new mathematical model to estimate the impact of vaccination delay against COVID-19 on the number of cases and deaths by the disease in Brazil. We apply the model to Brazil as a whole and to the State of Sao Paulo, the most affected by COVID-19 in Brazil. We simulated the model for the populations of the State of Sao Paulo and Brazil as a whole, varying the scenarios related to vaccine efficacy and compliance from the populations. Results The model projects that, in the absence of vaccination, almost 170 thousand deaths and more than 350 thousand deaths until the end of 2021 for Sao Paulo and Brazil, respectively. If in contrast, Sao Paulo and Brazil had enough vaccine supply and so started a vaccination campaign in January with the maximum vaccination rate, compliance and efficacy, they could have averted more than 112 thousand deaths and 127 thousand deaths, respectively. In addition, that for each month of delay the number of deaths increases monotonically in a logarithm fashion, for both the State of Sao Paulo and Brazil as a whole. Conclusions Our model shows that the current delay in the vaccination schedules that is observed in many countries has serious consequences in terms of mortality by the disease and should serve as an alert to health authorities to speed the process up such that the highest number of people to be immunized is reached in the shortest period of time.","output":"Modelling the Impact of Delaying Vaccination Against SARS-CoV-2 Assuming Unlimited Vaccines Supply"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In response to global concerns about the largest Ebola virus disease (EVD), outbreak to-date in West Africa documented healthcare associated transmission and the risk of global spread, the International Society of Chemotherapy (ISC) Infection Control Working Group created an Ebola Infection Control Readiness Checklist to assess the preparedness of institutions around the globe.

Nearly all (149; 92 %) were directly involved in Ebola preparedness activities. Whilst, 54 % indicated that their hospital would need to handle suspected and proven Ebola cases, the others would subsequently transfer suspected cases to a specialized centre. CONCLUSION: The results from our survey reveal that the general preparedness levels for management of potentially suspected cases of Ebola virus disease is only partially adequate in hospitals. Hospitals designated for admitting EVD suspected and proven patients had more frequently implemented Infection Control preparedness activities than hospitals that would subsequently transfer potential EVD cases to other centres. Results from this first international survey provide a framework for future efforts to improve hospital preparedness worldwide.

This single-center, open-label randomized clinical trial with a 7-arm parallel-group design was conducted in Dhaka Medical College (DMC) Hospital. A total of 189 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS CoV-2 positive cases aged 12C90 years with symptoms was sequentially enrolled following randomization. Nasopharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2 was tested against PVP-I nasal irrigation (NI) at diluted concentrations of 0.4%, 0.5% and 0.6%, and PVP-I nasal spray (NS) at diluted concentrations of 0.5% and 0.6%. All groups were compared to the corresponding controls (distilled water). Written informed consent was ensured before participation. All procedures were conducted in after ethical clearance from the Ethical Review Board and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Viral clearance in a repeat RT-PCR (qualitative) was the primary outcome, and occurrence of any adverse event following administration of testing drug was considered as the secondary outcome. Analysis was performed using SPSS (Version 26). All cases were randomized into seven groups and each group consists of 27-patient. Mean age of the cases 43.98  12.67 years (SD). All strength of NI were effective in nasopharyngeal clearance compared to the control (0.4%, p = 0.006; 0.5%, p < 0.001; and 0.6%, p = 0.018). Similarly, all strength of the NS is also effective than control (0.5%, p = < 0.001; and 0.6%, p  0.001). Highest nasopharyngeal clearance was observed in patients using 0.5% NI (n = 25, 92.6%, p = 0.018). Nasal irritation was the single most adverse event recorded in this trial and found in two patients using 0.4%, and 0.6% PVP-I NI, respectively.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. In Pakistan, the spread of the virus is on the rise with the number of infected people and causalities rapidly increasing. In the absence of proper vaccination and treatment, to reduce the number of infections and casualties, the only option so far is to educate people regarding preventive measures and to enforce countrywide lock-down. Any strategy about the preventive measures needs to be based upon detailed analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak and accurate scientific predictions. In this paper, we conduct mathematical and numerical analysis to come up with reliable and accurate predictions of the outbreak in Pakistan. The time-dependent Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model is used to fit the data and provide future predictions. The turning point of the peak of the pandemic is defined as the day when the transmission rate becomes less than the recovering rate. We have predicted that the outbreak will reach its maximum peak occurring from late May to 9 June with unrecovered number of Infectives in the range 20000-47000 and the cumulative number of infected cases in the range of 57500-153100. The number of Infectives will remain at the lower end in the lock-down scenario but can rapidly double or triple if the spread of the epidemic is not curtailed and localized.

As several recent reports have described the onset of thyroid dysfunction in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, we performed a systematic review to assess the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 as this information could be clinically relevant for the management of these patients. Methods: A comprehensive computer literature search using PubMed/Medline and Cochrane databases was performed until November 14, 2020 to search original articles evaluating thyroid dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Information about thyroid dysfunction assessed by thyroid function test was retrieved by the eligible articles. Qualitative analysis (systematic review) only was performed whether a significant heterogeneity of data was detected. Results: Seven studies including 1237 patients with COVID-19 were included. A significant heterogeneity across the studies was found. Most COVID-19 patients were euthyroid with TSH levels in the normal range (from 44 to 94% of the COVID-19 patients assessed in the included studies). The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in COVID-19 patients (defined as abnormal thyroid function tests) largely varies among the included studies between 13 and 64% of COVID-19 patients as well as clinical presentation. A positive correlation between thyroid dysfunction and clinical severity of COVID-19 was reported. Conclusion: Literature data show that thyroid dysfunction is present in a significant percentage of patients with COVID-19. Assessment of thyroid function may be considered in symptomatic COVID-19 patients to have a baseline before introducing thyroid-interfering drugs and those requiring high-intensity care. Further, well-designed studies are needed to better elucidate the impact of COVID-19 on thyroid function and inform thyroid function testing and thyroid dysfunction management in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Low yields of H2O2 and a narrow range of appropriate pH values have been two major drawbacks for electro-Fenton (EF) process. Herein, metal-free electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) were developed with nitrogen and sulfur co-doped electrochemically exfoliated graphene (N, S-EEGr) electrocatalysts, which was confirmed as an outstanding bifunctional catalyst for synchronous generation and activation of H2O2 via (2 + 1) e- consecutive reduction reactions. Specifically, two elements (N, S) in metal-free N, S-EEGr-CF cathode synergize to promote the formation of H2O2 followed by its activation. With N, S-EEGr-CF cathode, phenol of initial 50 mg L-1 could be effectively removed within pH 3-11 and 6.25 mA cm-2, and 100% removal efficiency could be achieved within 15-min even at neutral pH. The pseudo-first-order rate constant for phenol removal in metal-free EAOPs with N,S-EEGr-CF at neutral pH was 10 times higher than that with EF process. Detection of active species, coupled with decay kinetics with specific trapping agents, confirmed that OH was the dominant oxidizing species promoting removal efficiencies of organics (phenol, antibiotics and dyes) at pH 3 and pH 7. In the actual wastewater treatment, the synergistic effect of bifunctional catalyst would also be used for improving the degradation efficiency of organics. Thus, the metal-free EAOPs with N,S-EEGr-CF cathode may serve as an alternative in wastewater treatment with a broadened range of solution pH values and avoiding Fe2+ (catalyst) addition.","output":"Generation of hydroxyl radicals by metal-free bifunctional electrocatalysts for enhanced organics removal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A pandemic is a moment in which the overlap of the cultural and natural dimensions of reality becomes visible.

This is the first report for the electrochemical activity of favipiravir and its electroanalytical sensing. For this purpose, the effect of cationic surfactant, CTAB was demonstrated on the enhanced accumulation of favipiravir at the surface of cathodically pretreated boron-doped diamond (CPT-BDD) electrode. At first, the electrochemical properties of favipiravir were investigated in the surfactant-free solutions by the means of cyclic voltammetry. The compound presented a single oxidation step which is irreversible and adsorption controlled. A systematic study of various operational conditions, such as electrode pretreatment, pH of the supporting electrolyte, concentration of CTAB, accumulation variables, and instrumental parameters on the adsorptive stripping response, was examined using square-wave voltammetry. An oxidation signal at around +1.21 V in Britton-Robinson buffer at pH 8.0 containing 610(-4) M CTAB allowed to the adsorptive stripping voltammetric determination of favipiravir (after 60 s accumulation step at open-circuit condition). The process could be used in the concentration range with two linear segments of 0.01-0.1 g mL(-1) (6.410(-8)-6.410(-7) M) and 0.1-20.0 g mL(-1) (6.410(-7) M-1.310(-4) M).

To examine the link between these concepts, we propose an econophysics asset exchange model with the surplus stock of the wealthy. The wealthy are one of the two exchange agents and have more assets than the poor. Our simulation model converts the surplus contribution rate of the wealthy to a new variable parameter alongside the saving rate and introduces the total exchange (flow) and rank correlation coefficient (metabolism) as new evaluation indexes, adding to the Gini index (disparities), thereby assessing both wealth distribution and the relationships among the disparities, flow, and metabolism. We show that these result in a gamma-like wealth distribution, and our model reveals a trade-off between limiting disparities and vitalizing the market. To limit disparities and increase flow and metabolism, we also find the need to restrain savings and use the wealthy surplus stock. This relationship is explicitly expressed in the new equation introduced herein. The insights gained by uncovering the root of disparities may present a persuasive case for investments in social security measures or social businesses involving stock redistribution or sharing.","output":"Wealth disparities and economic flow: Assessment using an asset exchange model with the surplus stock of the wealthy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Personality traits have been found to be related to a variety of health outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine how personality traits were associated with adjustment to the COVID pandemic in college students. The sample included 484 first-year university students (76% female) attending a northeastern university who completed the Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality assessment at the beginning of a semester that was disrupted by the COVID pandemic. Using a phone-based app, students completed daily ratings of mood, perceived stress levels, and engagement in a number of health promotion activities (exercise, mindfulness, adequate sleep, etc.) throughout the semester both before and after the onset of the pandemic (e.g., a within-person longitudinal design). Results, as expected, showed that mood and wellness indices generally declined during the COVID period, although stress levels actually decreased. Further, irrespective of COVID, improved mood, less perceived stress and greater participation in health promotion activities were significantly associated with a number of personality traits including neuroticism (lower), extraversion (higher), agreeableness (higher), and conscientiousness (higher). Of primary interest, mixed-effects models were used to test how major personality traits interacted with any changes in daily ratings from the pre-COVID to COVID period. Significant interactions terms were found suggesting differential impacts of the COVID epidemic for students with low versus high levels of particular traits. Higher levels of extraversion, for example, were found to be related to decreases in mood as the pandemic progressed in contrast to those with lower extraversion, for whom there was a slight increase in mood over time.

A policy designer needs to consider multiple objectives, policy levers, and behavioral responses from strategic actors who optimize for their individual objectives. Moreover, real-world policies should be explainable and robust to simulation-to-reality gaps, e.g., due to calibration issues. Existing approaches are often limited to a narrow set of policy levers or objectives that are hard to measure, do not yield explicit optimal policies, or do not consider strategic behavior, for example. Hence, it remains challenging to optimize policy in real-world scenarios.

We validate our framework on optimizing the stringency of US state policies and Federal subsidies during a pandemic, e.g., COVID-19, using a simulation fitted to real data. We find that log-linear policies trained using RL significantly improve social welfare, based on both public health and economic outcomes, compared to past outcomes. Their behavior can be explained, e.g., well-performing policies respond strongly to changes in recovery and vaccination rates. They are also robust to calibration errors, e.g., infection rates that are over or underestimated.

We created a Latin-American initiative with emerging leaders (EL) from the Interamerican Society of Cardiology (IASC) with the objective to perform multiple systematic reviews of NTDs and other infectious diseases affecting the heart: The NET-Heart Project. OBJECTIVE: To describe the rationale and design considerations of the NET-Heart project. METHODS: The NET-Heart Project is a collaborative work of the IASC EL program. The main objective of the NET-Heart project is to systematically evaluate the available evidence of NTDs and other infectious diseases and their cardiovascular involvement. As a secondary objective, this initiative aims to offer recommendations and potential diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms that can aid the management of cardiovascular complications of these infectious diseases. After an expert discussion 17 initial infectious diseases were selected, for each disease we created one working group. The project was structured in different phases: Systematic review, brainstorming workshops, analysis and results, manuscript writing and recommendations and evaluation of clinical implications. CONCLUSION: The NET-Heart project is an innovative collaborative initiative created to assess burden and impact of NTDs and other infectious diseases in CVD.

We also call for recognition that economic damage can be as great as, or more severe than, the pandemic itself, which needs to be taken into account when weighing risk of withholding vaccines. We discuss how in the modern world, we know enough to make and deploy safe vaccines in as little as a few weeks. There are multiple types of vaccines now, and each type should be handled differently. We have nucleotide (RNA & DNA), component protein, killed, whole killed, live recombinant, and live attenuated vaccines today. Particularly in a crisis, nucleotide vaccines can be released immediately. Component, killed, and whole killed can also be rolled out rapidly. Live vaccines can be examined and released much more quickly than they are. This is not 1955, we know far more about vaccines and immunology today.

However, their effects and specific mechanisms in nephroblastoma have not been previously investigated, to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, in the present study, the mRNA and protein expression levels of HOXB2 and NUSAP1 were determined in nephroblastoma cells using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. Furthermore, cell transfection experiments were carried out to knock down NUSAP1 and overexpress HOXB2 in nephroblastoma cell lines. The proliferative, invasive and migratory abilities of nephroblastoma cells were assessed by MTT, EdU, colony formation, wound healing and Transwell assays. In addition, the JASPAR website was used to predict the association between HOXB2 and NUSAP1, which was further verified by dual-luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Finally, the expression levels of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway-related proteins were measured by western blot analysis. The results showed that the expression of NUSAP1 was abnormally upregulated in nephroblastoma cell lines. However, NUSAP1 silencing attenuated the proliferation, invasion and migration abilities of nephroblastoma cells. The results also suggested that HOXB2 could transcriptionally activate NUSAP1. Therefore, HOXB2 overexpression abrogated the inhibitory effect of NUSAP1 silencing on the proliferation and metastasis of nephroblastoma cells, possibly via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The aforementioned findings indicated that HOXB2 may upregulate NUSAP1 to promote the proliferation, invasion and migration of nephroblastoma cells via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.","output":"Transcription factor HOXB2 upregulates NUSAP1 to promote the proliferation, invasion and migration of nephroblastoma cells via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Talking only about the acute phase of COVID-19 infection is not enough.

We herein report the clinical course and cytokine profiles of a patient with severe SARS-CoV-2-related encephalopathy presenting aphasia. CASE PRESENTATION: An 81-year-old man developed acute consciousness disturbance and status epileptics several days after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Following treatment with remdesivir and dexamethasone, his consciousness and epileptic seizures improved; however, amnestic aphasia and agraphia remained. Two months after methylprednisolone pulse and intravenous immunoglobulin, his neurological deficits improved. We found increased levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), but not IL-2 and IL-10 in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the levels of serum IL-6 and MCP-1 were much higher than those in the CSF. The level of IL-8 in the CSF after immunotherapy was four times higher than that before immunotherapy. CONCLUSION: The cytokine profile of our patient was similar to that seen in severe SARS-CoV-2-related encephalopathy. We demonstrated (i) that the characteristic aphasia can occur as a focal neurological deficit associated with SARS-CoV-2-related encephalopathy, and (ii) that IL8-mediated central nervous system inflammation follows systemic inflammation in SARS-CoV-2-related encephalopathy and can persist and worsen even after immunotherapy.

Concise, persuasive messaging is crucial, particularly given substantial levels of vaccine hesitancy in the UK. Our aim was to test which types of written information about COVID-19 vaccination, in addition to a statement of efficacy and safety, might increase vaccine acceptance. METHODS: For this single-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial, we aimed to recruit 15 000 adults in the UK, who were quota sampled to be representative. Participants were randomly assigned equally across ten information conditions stratified by level of vaccine acceptance (willing, doubtful, or strongly hesitant). The control information condition comprised the safety and effectiveness statement taken from the UK National Health Service website; the remaining conditions addressed collective benefit, personal benefit, seriousness of the pandemic, and safety concerns. After online provision of vaccination information, participants completed the Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (outcome measure; score range 7-35) and the Oxford Vaccine Confidence and Complacency Scale (mediation measure). The primary outcome was willingness to be vaccinated. Participants were analysed in the groups they were allocated. p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. The study was registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN37254291. FINDINGS: From Jan 19 to Feb 5, 2021, 15 014 adults were recruited. Vaccine hesitancy had reduced from 269% the previous year to 169%, so recruitment was extended to Feb 18 to recruit 3841 additional vaccine-hesitant adults. 12 463 (661%) participants were classified as willing, 2932 (156%) as doubtful, and 3460 (184%) as strongly hesitant (ie, report that they will avoid being vaccinated for as long as possible or will never get vaccinated). Information conditions did not alter COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in those willing or doubtful (adjusted p values >070). In those strongly hesitant, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was reduced, in comparison to the control condition, by personal benefit information (mean difference -149, 95% CI -216 to -082; adjusted p=00015), directly addressing safety concerns about speed of development (-091, -158 to -023; adjusted p=00261), and a combination of all information (-086, -153 to -018; adjusted p=00313). In those strongly hesitant, provision of personal benefit information reduced hesitancy to a greater extent than provision of information on the collective benefit of not personally getting ill (-097, 95% CI -164 to -030; adjusted p=00165) or the collective benefit of not transmitting the virus (-101, -168 to -035; adjusted p=00150). Ethnicity and gender were found to moderate information condition outcomes. INTERPRETATION: In the approximately 10% of the population who are strongly hesitant about COVID-19 vaccines, provision of information on personal benefit reduces hesitancy to a greater extent than information on collective benefits. Where perception of risk from vaccines is most salient, decision making becomes centred on the personal. As such, messaging that stresses the counterbalancing personal benefits is likely to prove most effective. The messaging from this study could be used in public health communications. Going forwards, the study highlights the need for future health campaigns to engage with the public on the terrain that is most salient to them.

We describe the organization and results of the network, known as ECMOnet. METHODS: The network consisted of 14 ICUs with ECMO capability and a national call center. The network was set up to centralize all severe patients to the ECMOnet centers assuring safe transfer. An ad hoc committee defined criteria for both patient transfer and ECMO institutions. RESULTS: Between August 2009 and March 2010, 153 critically ill patients (53% referred from other hospitals) were admitted to the ECMOnet ICU with suspected H1N1. Sixty patients (48 of the referred patients, 49 with confirmed H1N1 diagnosis) received ECMO according to ECMOnet criteria. All referred patients were successfully transferred to the ECMOnet centers; 28 were transferred while on ECMO. Survival to hospital discharge in patients receiving ECMO was 68%. Survival of patients receiving ECMO within 7 days from the onset of mechanical ventilation was 77%. The length of mechanical ventilation prior to ECMO was an independent predictor of mortality.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study. Children aged 1C18 years with SDB prescribed PAP at The Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Canada) were evaluated for PAP adherence. Demographics, medical history and PAP adherence data during four consecutive 3-month time periods from December 2019 to December 2020 were collected. These four time periods included i) prior to COVID-19 lockdown, ii) during the first three months of lockdown, iii) summer and iv) return to school period.

RESULTS: A total of 149 children (61.7% male, mean (SD) age=12.8  4.1 years, BMI (SD) z-score=1.451.43) were enrolled. Compared to prior to lockdown, the median (IQR) of percentage of PAP usage 4 hours and average nightly usage of PAP declined significantly during the summer and return to school periods (p<0.001 for all).

We studied the connection between NETs and COVID-19 severity and progression. We conducted a prospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients (n = 33) and age- and sex-matched controls (n = 17). We measured plasma myeloperoxidase (MPO)-DNA complexes (NETs), platelet factor 4, RANTES, and selected cytokines. Three COVID-19 lung autopsies were examined for NETs and platelet involvement. We assessed NET formation ex vivo in COVID-19 neutrophils and in healthy neutrophils incubated with COVID-19 plasma. We also tested the ability of neonatal NET-inhibitory factor (nNIF) to block NET formation induced by COVID-19 plasma. Plasma MPO-DNA complexes increased in COVID-19, with intubation (P < .0001) and death (P < .0005) as outcome. Illness severity correlated directly with plasma MPO-DNA complexes (P = .0360), whereas Pao 2/fraction of inspired oxygen correlated inversely (P = .0340). Soluble and cellular factors triggering NETs were significantly increased in COVID-19, and pulmonary autopsies confirmed NET-containing microthrombi with neutrophil-platelet infiltration.

The literature is unclear whether loneliness during COVID-19 is similar to those of non-pandemic seasons. This study examined the expression of loneliness on Twitter during COVID-19 pandemic, and identified key areas of loneliness across diverse communities. METHODS: Twitter was searched for feeds that were:(1) in English; (2) posted from May 1, 2020 to July 1, 2020; (3) posted by individual users (not organisations); and (4) contained the words 'loneliness' and 'COVID-19'. A machine-learning approach (Topic Modeling) identified key topics from the Twitter feeds; Hierarchical Modeling identified overarching themes. Variations in the prevalence of the themes were examined over time and across the number of followers of the Twitter users. RESULTS: 4492 Twitter feeds were included and classified into 3 themes: (1) Community impact of loneliness during COVID-19; (2) Social distancing during COVID-19 and its effects on loneliness; and (3) Mental health effects of loneliness during COVID-19. The 3 themes demonstrated temporal variations. Particularly in Europe, Theme 1 showed a drastic reduction over time, with a corresponding rise in Theme 3.

This phenomenon, also known as (positive) affective touch, is likely to be the basis of affiliative interactions with conspecifics by promoting inter-individual bindings. Previous studies on healthy humans have demonstrated that affective touch can remarkably impact behavior. For instance, by administering the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) paradigm, the embodiment of a fake hand enhances after a slow, affective touch compared to a fast, neutral touch. However, results coming from this area are not univocal. In addition, there are no clues in the existing literature on the relationship between affective touch and the space around our body. To overcome these lacks, we carried out two separate experiments where participants underwent a RHI paradigm (Experiment 1) and a Visuo-Tactile Interaction task (Experiment 2), designed to tap into body representation and peripersonal space processing, respectively. In both experiments, an affective touch (CT-optimal, 3 cm/s) and neutral touch (CT-suboptimal, 18 cm/s) were delivered by the experimenter on the dorsal side of participants hand through a skin to skin contact. In Experiment 1, we did not find any modulation of body representationnot at behavioral nor at a physiological levelby affective touch. In Experiment 2, no visuo-tactile spatial modulation emerged depending upon the pleasantness of the touch received. These null findings are interpreted in the light of the current scientific context where the real nature of affective touch is often misguided, and they offer the possibility to pave the way for understanding the real effects of affective touch on body/space representation.","output":"Bliss in and Out of the Body: The (Extra)Corporeal Space Is Impervious to Social Pleasant Touch"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Digital X-ray radiogrammetry (DXR) calculates peripheral bone mineral density (BMD) from hand radiographs. The short-term precision for direct DXR has been reported to be highly satisfactory. However, long-term precision for this method has not been examined. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the long-term in-vitro precision for the new direct digital version of DXR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in-vitro precision for direct DXR was tested with cadaver phantoms on four different X-ray systems at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and in one machine also at 12 months. At each time point, 31 measurements were performed. RESULTS: The in-vitro longitudinal precision for the four radiographic systems ranged from 0.22 to 0.43% expressed as coefficient of variation (CV%). The smallest detectable difference (SDD) ranged from 0.0034 to 0.0054 g/cm(2). CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro long-term precision for direct DXR was comparable to the previous reported short-term in-vitro precision for all tested X-ray systems. These data show that DXR is a stable method for detecting small changes in bone density during 6C12 months of follow-up.","output":"Long-term in-vitro precision of direct digital X-ray radiogrammetry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: To investigate clinical implications of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) positivity detected in COVID-19 patients during follow up.

Following the patterns of other coronaviruses (CoVs), particularly those infecting the respiratory tract, neurological manifestations have been reported in patients with Covid-19. Such manifestations highlight the neurovirulence of this severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV2. In order to collect all available information on the implications and mechanisms of infections by respiratory CoVs, a systematic review was designed following the PRISMA protocol. The following PICO strategy (patient, problem, or population; intervention; comparison, control, or comparator; outcomes) was adopted: P included healthy individuals, patients, and animal models susceptible to human-specific viruses; I included molecular, cell culture, and comparative experimental studies; C included healthy, diseased, and immunized conditions; and O represented the virulence and pathogenicity of respiratory CoVs and their effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Searches were conducted in PubMed databases from March 30 to April 1, 2020. Results indicate the involvement of the CNS in infections with various CoVs. Infection typically begins in the airway epithelia with subsequent alveolar involvement, and the virus then spreads to the CNS via neuronal contacts with the recruitment of axonal transport.

We provide the basic properties of the model and compute the basic reproduction number R 0that plays an important role in the outcome of the disease. After, assuming continuous measurement of newly COVID-19 reported cases, deceased and recovered individuals, the EnKf approach is used to estimate the unmeasured variables and unknown COVID-19 transmission rates using real data of the current COVID-19 pandemic in Cameroon.

Primary pleural squamous cell carcinoma (PPSCC) is a rare malignancy; thus, a related PE is extremely rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 49-year-old female patient was admitted to Northern Jiangsu Peoples Hospital owing to chest tightness, cough, and breathing difficulty that persisted for 3 days. Following admission, a computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography revealed an embolism in the main pulmonary artery, upper and lower pulmonary artery branch. The patient was treated with alteplase, warfarin, and antibiotics. Over the following year, she experienced recurrent chest pain and tightness and breathing difficulty, with multiple CT pulmonary angiography revealing thrombosis in the right and left main pulmonary artery. No abnormalities were observed in surrogate markers of autoimmune diseases, tumor antigen testing, or ultrasonography; thus, the cause of recurrent PE was not identified. Subsequently, a positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) examination revealed diffuse heterogeneous thickening of the right pleura and substantially increased glucose metabolism. A CT-guided pleural biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination of the pleura eventually revealed a diagnosis of PPSCC. CONCLUSIONS: PPSCC is a rare tumor that lacks specific clinical manifestations and is difficult to detect with imaging techniques. The occurrence of PE as the primary manifesting symptom in a patient with PPSCC is extremely rare. Thus, malignant tumors should be considered in patients with no risk factors for PE and/or in those with recurrent PE. An immediate diagnosis and adequate intervention can be achieved with increased awareness of this diagnosis and subsequent related examinations.","output":"Rare cause of repeated pulmonary embolism: a case of primary pleural squamous cell carcinoma and literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The emergent COVID-19 has impacted unprecedentedly to all classes of people. Slum-dwellers knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) toward COVID-19 are currently poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate the KAP toward COVID-19 among slum dwellers resided in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. METHODS: A cross-sectional offline survey was carried out enrolling 406 slum dwellers (53.2% male; mean age = 44.9 years [SD = 12.1]; age range = 18C85 years) between August and September, 2020. The face to face interview was conducted to collect data from six selected slum areas in Dhaka City using convenience sampling. The questionnaire consisted of informed consent along with questions concerning observational checklists, socio-demographics and KAP. RESULTS: A sizeable minority were observed without wearing face masks during the survey periods (18.2%) and a vast portion (97.5%) without any hand protection. The mean scores of KAP were 6.1  2.6 (out of 17), 12.3  1.7 (out of 14) and 9.8  1.6 (out of 12), respectively. Moreover, the KAP were strongly and positively correlated with each other.

However, it is unclear whether and how advice-seekers differ from other users. Our research addresses this gap by identifying key characteristics of r/suboxone users that predict advice-seeking behavior. Objective: The objective of this analysis is to identify and describe advice-seekers on Reddit for buprenorphine-naloxone use using text annotation, social network analysis, and statistical modeling techniques. Methods: We collected 5258 posts and their comments from Reddit between 2014 and 2019. Among 202 posts which met our inclusion criteria, we annotated each post to determine which were advice-seeking (n = 137) or not advice-seeking (n = 65). We also annotated each posting users buprenorphine-naloxone use status (current versus formerly taking and, if currently taking, whether inducting or tapering versus other stages) and quantified their connectedness using social network analysis. To analyze the relationship between Reddit users advice-seeking and their social connectivity and medication use status, we constructed four models which varied in their inclusion of explanatory variables for social connectedness and buprenorphine use status. Results: The stepwise model containing total degree (p = 0.002), using: inducting/tapering (p < 0.001), and using: other (p = 0.01) outperformed all other models. Reddit users with fewer connections and who are currently using buprenorphine-naloxone are more likely to seek advice than those who are well-connected and no longer using the medication, respectively. Importantly, advice-seeking behavior is most accurately predicted using a combination of network characteristics and medication use status, rather than either factor alone. Conclusions: Our findings provide insights for the clinical care of people recovering from opioid use disorder and the nature of online medical advice-seeking overall. Clinicians should be especially attentive (e.g., through frequent follow-up) to patients who are inducting or tapering buprenorphine-naloxone or signal limited social support.","output":"Identifying and Characterizing Medical Advice-Seekers on a Social Media Forum for Buprenorphine Use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a case of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in a patient asymptomatically co-infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Water in the environment can be a source of infection linked to outbreaks and environmental transmission in hospitals. Water safety in hospitals remains a challenge. This article has summarized available scientific literature to obtain an overview of outbreaks linked to water-containing hospital equipment and strategies to prevent such outbreaks. METHODS: We made a list of water-containing hospital equipment and devices in which water is being used in a semi-closed circuit. A literature search was performed in PubMed with a search strategy containing the names of these medical devices and one or more of the following words: outbreak, environmental contamination, transmission, infection. For each medical device, we summarized the following information: the function of the medical device, causes of contamination, the described outbreaks and possible prevention strategies. RESULTS: The following water-containing medical equipment or devices were identified: heater-cooler units, hemodialysis equipment, neonatal incubators, dental unit waterlines, fluid warmers, nebulizers, water traps, water baths, blanketrol, scalp cooling, and thermic stimulators. Of the latter three, no literature could be found. Of all other devices, one or more outbreaks associated with these devices were reported in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: The water reservoirs in water-containing medical devices can be a source of microbial growth and transmissions to patients, despite the semi-closed water circuit. Proper handling and proper cleaning and disinfection can help to reduce the microbial burden and, consequently, transmission to patients. However, these devices are often difficult to clean and disinfect because they cannot be adequately opened or disassembled, and the manufacturers cleaning guidelines are often not feasible to execute. The development of equipment without water or fluid containers should be stimulated. Precise cleaning and disinfection guidelines and instructions are essential for instructing healthcare workers and hospital cleaning staff to prevent potential transmission to patients.","output":"Outbreaks of healthcare-associated infections linked to water-containing hospital equipment: a literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, the Indonesian government has arranged the learning process during the Covid-19 Pandemic to be carried out simultaneously online So there needs to be an adaptation related to learning strategies in order to be able to carry out the driving learning process properly In the teaching and learning process in student geography education, there is a need for online student-centered learning One execution is to utilize the Project-Based Learning Show within the application of geography learning methodologies online The reason for the think about was to test the online Venture Based Learning Show on understudy learning results The subjects of this consider were understudies of Geography Instruction lesson 2019, FKIP UniversitasJember, which comprised of 2 classes Course A was characterized as the test lesson and course B as the control course The comes about of the evaluation are within the frame of information which is at that point analyzed utilizing the t-test with the assistance of the SPSS 16 0 for Windows program The comes about of this ponder demonstrate that theres a critical impact of utilizing the Project-Based Learning Demonstrate within the application of the online Geography Learning strategy","output":"Implementation of the use of project-based learning models in the application of online geography learning strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The effects of presbyphonia are compounded by the decline in respiratory function that occurs with age. Commonly recommended exercises to optimize the use of respiratory muscles during speech, such as diaphragmatic breathing, are unlikely to be intensive enough to induce respiratory changes and impact vocal function. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of adding a targeted intervention, respiratory muscle strength training, to voice exercises in a sample of patients with presbyphonia. METHODS/DESIGN In this prospective, randomized-controlled trial, 12 participants received either (1) vocal function exercises (VFE), (2) VFE combined with inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST), or (3) VFE combined with expiratory muscle strength training (EMST). Data collected prior to and following 4 weekly intervention sessions included respiratory measures (pulmonary function and respiratory muscle strength) and voice measures (videostroboscopy, acoustic, auditory-perceptual, aerodynamic, and self-assessment measures). RESULTS Participants who received IMST improved their voice quality during connected speech (smoothed cepstral peak prominence and ratings of overall voice quality) and their scores on the three self-assessment questionnaires with large to very large within-group effect sizes (|d| = 0.82-1.61). In addition, participants in the IMST group reduced their subglottal pressure with a large effect size (d = -0.92). Participants who received EMST improved their maximum expiratory strength and smoothed cepstral peak prominence with large effect sizes (d = 0.80 and 0.99, respectively) but had limited improvements in other outcomes. Participants who received only VFE decreased their amount of vocal fold bowing, improved their voice quality on a sustained vowel (amplitude perturbation quotient), and improved their Glottal Function Index score with large effect sizes (|d| = 0.74-1.00). CONCLUSION Preliminary data indicate that adding IMST to voice exercises may lead to the greatest benefits in patients with presbyphonia by promoting improved subglottal pressure control as well as increasing air available for phonation, resulting in improved self-assessment outcomes.","output":"Respiratory Muscle Strength Training to Improve Vocal Function in Patients with Presbyphonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemics are disruptive events that have profound consequences for society and the economy.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate breakthrough coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in vaccinated people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) on DMT. METHODS: PwMS on DMT diagnosed with COVID-19 after full vaccination were identified from an existing Cleveland Clinic COVID-19 registry, supplemented by provider-identified cases. Demographics, disease history, DMTs, comorbidities, exposures, vaccination status, and COVID-19 outcomes were confirmed by review of the electronic medical record.

DESIGN: Non-randomised controlled cluster trial with three measurements: at baseline (T0), after the intervention at 9 months (T1) and after 1-year follow-up (T2). SETTING: Half-day elementary schools in Lower Austria (Austria). PARTICIPANTS: Third-grade pupils from twenty-two schools in the intervention group (IG) and thirty-two schools in the control group (CG) participated in the study. Data were analysed for 569 to 598 pupils in the IG and for 545 to 613 in the CG, depending on the time of measurement. RESULTS: The consumption of tap water increased in the IG from baseline to T1 and then decreased again at T2, but this was similar in the CG (no statistically significant difference in the time trend between the IG and CG). Similar results were seen for tap water consumption in the mornings. The proportion of children who only drank tap water on school mornings increased significantly from baseline to T1 in the IG compared to the CG (P = 0020). No difference in the changes over time occurred between the groups for the proportion of pupils drinking approximately one bottle of tap water during school mornings. CONCLUSIONS: Not only the children in the IG but also those in the CG drank more tap water after 1 school year than at the beginning. The measurement of drinking habits in the CG may have been intervention enough to bring about changes or to initiate projects.","output":"Evaluation of the H2NOE Water Schools programme to promote water consumption in elementary schoolchildren: a non-randomised controlled cluster trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2019, COVID-19 emerged as a severe respiratory disease that is caused by the novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease has been associated with high mortality rate, especially in patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular and kidney diseases. This could be attributed to dysregulated immune responses and severe systemic inflammation in COVID-19 patients. The use of effective antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and modulation of the immune responses could be a potential therapeutic strategy for COVID-19. Studies have shown that natural phenolic compounds have several pharmacological properties, including anticoronavirus and immunomodulatory activities.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein trimer mediates virus entry into host cells and cytopathic effects. We studied the contribution of several S glycoprotein features to these functions, focusing on those that differ among related coronaviruses. Acquisition of the furin cleavage site by the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein decreased virus stability and infectivity, but greatly enhanced the ability to form lethal syncytia. Notably, the D614G change found in globally predominant SARS-CoV-2 strains restored infectivity, modestly enhanced responsiveness to the ACE2 receptor and susceptibility to neutralizing sera, and tightened association of the S1 subunit with the trimer. Apparently, two unique features of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, the furin cleavage site and D614G, have evolved to balance virus infectivity, stability, cytopathicity and antibody vulnerability. Although the endodomain (cytoplasmic tail) of the S2 subunit was not absolutely required for virus entry or syncytium formation, alteration of palmitoylated cysteine residues in the cytoplasmic tail decreased the efficiency of these processes. As proteolytic cleavage contributes to the activation of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, we evaluated the ability of protease inhibitors to suppress S glycoprotein function. Matrix metalloprotease inhibitors suppressed S-mediated cell-cell fusion, but not virus entry. Synergy between inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases and TMPRSS2 suggests that both proteases can activate the S glycoprotein during the process of syncytium formation. These results provide insights into SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein-host cell interactions that likely contribute to the transmission and pathogenicity of this pandemic agent. IMPORTANCE The development of an effective and durable SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is essential for combating the growing COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein is the main target of neutralizing antibodies elicited during virus infection or following vaccination. Knowledge of the spike glycoprotein evolution, function and interactions with host factors will help researchers to develop effective vaccine immunogens and treatments. Here we identify key features of the spike glycoprotein, including the furin cleavage site and the D614G natural mutation, that modulate viral cytopathic effects, infectivity and sensitivity to inhibition. We also identify two inhibitors of host metalloproteases that block S-mediated cell-cell fusion, which contributes to the destruction of the virus-infected cell.","output":"Spike glycoprotein and host cell determinants of SARS-CoV-2 entry and cytopathic effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Simulation-based surgical training (SBST) is key to securing future surgical expertise. Proficiency-based training (PBT) in laparoscopy has shown promising results on skills transfer. However, time constraints and limited possibilities for distributed training constitute barriers to effective PBT. Home-based training may provide a solution to these barriers and may be a feasible alternative to centralized training in times of assembly constraints. METHODS: We randomly assigned first-year trainees in abdominal surgery, gynecology, and urology to either centralized instructor-regulated training (CIRT) or home-based self-regulated training (HSRT) in laparoscopy. All participants trained on portable box trainers providing feedback on metrics and possibility for video reviewing. Training in both groups was structured as PBT with graded proficiency exercises adopted from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS). The HSRT group trained at home guided by online learning materials, while the CIRT group attended two training sessions in the simulation center with feedback from experienced instructors. Performance tests consisted of handCeye and bimanual coordination, suture and knot-tying, and FLS exercises. We analyzed passing rates, training time and distribution, and test performances. RESULTS: Passing rates were 87% and 96% in the CIRT and HSRT group, respectively. HSRT facilitated distributed training and resulted in greater variation in training times. Task times for handCeye and bimanual coordination were significantly reduced between pretest and posttest in both groups. Trainees maintained their posttest performances at the 6-month retention test. Our analyses revealed no significant inter-group differences in performances at pretest, posttest, or retention test. Performance improvements in the two groups followed similar patterns. CONCLUSION: CIRT and HSRT in laparoscopy result in comparable performance improvements. HSRT in laparoscopy is a feasible and effective alternative to CIRT when offered inside a supportive instructional design. Further research is needed to clarify trainees preferences and explore facilitators and barriers to HSRT.","output":"Remote training in laparoscopy: a randomized trial comparing home-based self-regulated training to centralized instructor-regulated training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among various health assessment tools for industrial workers, Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) is one of the most popular tools.

These agents, along with non-scintigraphic biomarkers from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have provided an opportunity to investigate the pathogenesis, prodromal changes and time course of the disease in living individuals. The current understanding of the neuropathological changes of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) continuum is now known to begin up to 25 years prior to the onset of clinical symptomatology. The opportunities afforded by in-vivo biomarkers of AD, whether by CSF examination or PET, have transformed the design of AD therapeutic trials by shifting focus to the preclinical stages of disease. Future disease modifying therapies, should they be forthcoming, will rely heavily on the use of approved biomarkers or biomarkers currently under investigation to confirm the presence of target pathology. Understanding the progressive neuropathological changes that occur in Alzheimer's Disease, and how scintigraphic findings relate to these changes will serve the interpreting physician to fully appreciate the implications of their findings and provide a basis to interpret their examinations. The recently adopted National Institute of Ageing - Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) guidelines define post mortem AD neuropathological changes as a composite score based upon three elements. These elements are the extent of involvement (spread) by cerebral amyloid based on the progression model defined by the Thal amyloid phases, the extent of involvement (spread) by neurofibrillary tangles (composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins) based on the progression model defined by Braak and, thirdly, the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) score, which describes the density of neuritic amyloid plaques based on certain key locations in the neocortex.

However, only few treatment options are available for patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). Siponimod has recently been approved for use in patients with active forms of SPMS (who experience clinical relapses or new lesions on MRI superimposed on secondary progression independent of relapse activity). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive review on the mechanism of action, efficacy, safety, cost effectiveness and patient adherence with siponimod. METHODS: We performed a PubMed search using the search terms: siponimod, secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, sphingosine 1-phosphate modulators. Titles and abstract were screened and selected for relevance to the key section of this article. FINDINGS: Siponimod is an oral sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulator with selectivity to S1PR-1 and 5. Modulation of this receptor on lymphocytes causes its internalization and degradation, preventing their egress from lymphoid tissues to the blood. In the pivotal Phase 3 randomized controlled trial EXPAND, siponimod was superior to placebo in reducing the risk of disability progression confirmed at 3 and 6 months, as well as the development of new MRI lesions and the rate of brain volume loss. Secondary analysis also showed a benefit on measures of cognitive functioning. The risk of lymphopenia and first-dose bradycardia appears to be lower with siponimod compared to non-selective S1P1R modulators. Different CYP2C9 genotypes affect the metabolism of siponimod; hence, genetic testing is required to adapt the titration and final dose accordingly. CONCLUSION: Long-term extension and real-world studies will allow further evaluation of efficacy and safety in this population. Future research should focus on better defining SPMS, and identifying biomarkers of progression and outcome measures of treatment response in this category of patients.","output":"Clinical Evaluation of Siponimod for the Treatment of Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis: Pathophysiology, Efficacy, Safety, Patient Acceptability and Adherence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus, designated as \\"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2\\" (SARS-CoV-2), is a new coronavirus that has evolved as a global pandemic recently, and it has created a widespread interest in coronaviruses causing human infections.

Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 variants isolated in the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic that were deleted of the ORF8 gene have been associated to milder symptoms and better disease outcome. This minireview summarizes the current knowledge on the SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 protein in perspective to its potential as antiviral target and with special emphasis on the biochemical, biophysical and structural aspects of its molecular biology.","output":"Lost in deletion: The enigmatic ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic went down in history as a pandemic caused by corona-viruses that emerged in 2019 and spread rapidly around the world. The different symptoms of COVID-19 made it difficult to understand which variables were more influential on the diagnosis, course and mortality of the disease. Machine learning models can accurately assess hidden patterns among risk factors by analyzing large-datasets to quickly predict diagnosis, prognosis and mortality of diseases. Because of this advantage, the use of machine learning models as decision support systems in health services is increasing. The aim of this study is to determine the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 disease with blood-gas data using the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) decision-tree-model, one of the machine learning methods, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. This study was carried out on a total of 686 patients with COVID-19 (n = 343) and non-COVID-19 (n = 343) treated at Erzincan-Mengcek-Gazi-Training and Research-Hospital between April 1, 2020 and March 1, 2021. Arterial blood gas values of all patients were obtained from the hospital registry system. While the total-accuracyratio of the decision-tree-model was 65.0% in predicting the prognosis of the disease, it was 68.2% in the diagnosis of the disease. According to the results obtained, the low ionized-calcium value (< 1.10 mM) significantly predicted the need for intensive care of COVID-19 patients. At admission, low-carboxyhemoglobin (< 1.00%), high-pH (> 7.43), low-sodium (< 135.0 mM), hematocrit (< 40.0%), and methemoglobin (< 1.30%) values are important biomarkers in the diagnosis of COVID-19 and the results were promising. The findings in the study may aid in the early-diagnosis of the disease and the intensive-care treatment of patients who are severe. The study was approved by the Ministry of Health and Erzincan University Faculty of Medicine Clinical Research Ethics Committee.","output":"Prediction of diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 disease by blood gas parameters using decision trees machine learning model: a retrospective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"End-to-end question answering (QA) requires both information retrieval (IR) over a large document collection and machine reading comprehension (MRC) on the retrieved passages.

This article proposes a decision-making approach for preferable medicine selection using picture fuzzy set (PFS), DempsterCShafer (DCS) theory of evidence and grey relational analysis (GRA). PFS is an extended version of the intuitionistic fuzzy set, where in addition to membership and non-membership grade, neutral and refusal membership grades are used to solve uncertain real-life problems more efficiently. Hence, we attempt to use it in this article to solve the mentioned problem. Previously, researchers considered the neutral membership grade of the PFS similar to the other two membership values (positive and negative) as applied to the decision-making method. In this study, we explore that neutral membership grade can be associated with probabilistic uncertainty which is measured using DCS theory of evidence and FUSH operation is applied for the aggregation purpose. Then GRA is used to measure the performance among the set of parameters which are in conflict and contradiction with each other. In this process, we propose an alternative group decision-making approach by the evidence of the neutral membership grade which is measured by the DCS theory and the conflict and contradiction among the criteria are managed by GRA.

The data were collected at four different physician response units and three admitting hospitals in a German EMS system. Patients with respiratory failure due to acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute cardiopulmonary oedema were enrolled. A total of 545 patients were eligible for the final analysis. Patients were treated with oxygen supplementation, non-invasive ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation. The primary outcomes were defined as changes in the clinical parameters and the in-hospital course. The secondary outcomes included time efficiency, peri-interventional complications, treatment failure rate, and side-effects. Oxygenation under phNIV improved equally to endotracheal intubation (ETI), and more effectively in comparison to standard oxygen therapy (SOT) (paO(2) SOT vs. non-invasive ventilation (NIV) vs. ETI: 82 mmHg vs. 125 mmHg vs. 135 mmHg, p-value SOT vs. NIV < 0.0001). In a matched subgroup analysis phNIV was accompanied by a reduced time of mechanical ventilation (phNIV: 1.8 d vs. ETI: 4.2 d) and a shortened length of stay at the intensive care unit (3.4 d vs. 5.8 d).

Education, which in recent years increasingly tied itself to notions of global culture and markets, is deeply threatened by these changes to the natural environment.

Only with a sufficiently fundamental level of analysis can society reorganise its systems of learning and scientific inquiry to this rapidly changing environment. Drawing on evolutionary biology, we argue that institutional and individual structures and processes are recapitulations of evolutionary cellular development. Understanding the impact of Covid-19 on cells presents an invitation to consider the larger-scale cultural recapitulations of similar mechanisms and structures, and this has implications for the ways education might most effectively deploy technology. Whilst universities seek to maintain their existing structures, practices and business models, a cellular evolutionary approach points to the necessity for fundamental rethinking of intellectual life and learning.

Although experts suggest that its increase during the COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with worse health outcomes for people with obesity, a thorough analysis of the main findings and gaps is still needed when relating to this subject. OBJECTIVE: We aim to answer three questions: (1) How does weight stigma manifest in the COVID-19 pandemic? (2) How can weight stigma affect people with overweight or obesity in times of COVID-19? (3) What are the perceptions and experiences of weight stigma during the pandemic in individuals who experience overweight or obesity? METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of studies addressing weight stigma and the COVID-19 pandemic in electronic databases (Medline/PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, PsycInfo, BVS/Lilacs, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and OpenGrey) published until 10th August 2021. All relevant studies were reviewed in full by two researchers. In addition, a narrative synthesis of the data was performed. RESULTS: The results included 35 studies out of 8,090 records and identified 13 original research publications, 14 text and opinion papers, and 6 narrative reviews. The results revealed the presence of weight stigma in the media, healthcare settings, interpersonal relationships, and public campaigns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The evidence of increasing weight stigma in the COVID-19 outbreak is limited, though. Many weight discrimination consequences were described during this time, such as impairment in accessing healthcare, worst COVID-19 outcomes, and maladaptive eating. However, only maladaptive behaviours and decline in mental health outcomes were demonstrated empirically in all age groups. This effect occurred regardless of body mass index, but people with high body weight were more likely to experience weight stigma. For some people with obesity, weight stigma in the pandemic has made activities of daily routine difficult. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that weight stigma in the COVID-19 pandemic occurs in several settings; moreover, although weight discrimination impacts mental health, whether before or during the pandemic, this influence between the pandemic and pre-pandemic scenario is still unclear. Therefore, more research is required in this field while the pandemic lasts, especially with people with obesity. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: Overall, people with overweight or obesity are more vulnerable to weight stigma than individuals without overweight. In addition, weight stigma refers to discrimination or prejudice based on a persons weight and relates to several consequences, for instance, poor healthcare treatment and mental health problems. In the COVID-19 outbreak, these weight stigma effects tend to become even more critical because they may be associated with unfavourable COVID-19 outcomes and eating disorder risks. Thus, it is crucial to investigate how weight stigma occurs during the pandemic and its impact on health, mainly for the most affected people. We investigated 35 studies published between 2019 and 2021 to map and explore how weight stigma was manifested and the related consequences for people with overweight or obesity in the COVID-19 pandemic. Only about a third of them were quantitative or qualitative, limiting the evidence of weight stigma in the COVID-19 context. The available evidence suggests that weight stigma manifests in several settings such as media, healthcare, public campaigns, and is more common in people with excess weight. However, weight discrimination experiences before or during the pandemic were associated with adverse psychological and behavioural consequences across all age groups, regardless of body weight. For some people with obesity, for instance, weight stigma made it difficult to accomplish their activities of daily routine. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether weight stigma has increased in the pandemic, thus, more studies are required, especially about people with overweight or obesity.

However, while glycosylation at most sites was dispensable for gB expression and fusogenicity, inactivation of N154 and N700 affected gB processing by furin cleavage and surface localization. Although all single mutants were functional in cellCcell fusion and viral entry, simultaneous inactivation of all six N-glycosylation sites severely impaired fusion activity and viral entry, suggesting a critical role of N-glycans for maintaining gB structure and function.","output":"Influence of N-glycosylation on Expression and Function of Pseudorabies Virus Glycoprotein gB"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

The disability derived from ABI can include considerable difficulties in upper-limb use due to somatosensory deficits. One of the assessments most commonly used to evaluate ABI is the Nottingham Sensory Assessment (NSA); however, there is no complete psychometric analysis or standardized version in Spanish. We aimed to develop and validate a Spanish version of the stereognosis component of the NSA for evaluating Spanish adults with ABI via a single-center, observational, cross-sectional study. The Spanish version of the NSA was developed in two steps. The first was based on the standardization and collection of normative data in 120 asymptomatic participants. For the second, we recruited 25 participants with ABI to establish concurrent criterion-related validity, internal consistency, and floor/ceiling effects. Criterion validity was assessed against two-point discrimination and tactile-localization tests. Our normative data showed significant differences among the various age groups (p < 0.05), supporting the validity of the Spanish-version assessment. For the ABI sample, we also found further evidence of validity with Spearmans rho coefficient between the total scores and the two-point discrimination and tactile-localization tests, which showed low and moderate correlations (rho = 0.50C0.75, p < 0.05). Internal consistency was excellent, with a Cronbachs alpha of 0.91. No ceiling or floor effects were found. We conclude that the stereognosis component of the NSA in its Spanish version is a valid scale that can be used to comprehensively and accurately assess stereognosis capacity in adults with ABI. As a low-cost evaluation, this assessment has great potential to be widely used in clinical practice and research settings.","output":"Validation of Spanish Erasmus-Modified Nottingham Sensory Assessment Stereognosis Scale in Acquired Brain Damage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its main negative regulator, Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1), are at the interface between redox and intermediary metabolism. Nrf2 activation is protective in models of human disease and has benefits in clinical trials. Consequently, the Keap1/Nrf2 protein complex is a drug target. However, in cancer Nrf2 plays a dual role, raising concerns that Nrf2 activators may promote growth of early neoplasms. To address this concern, we examined the role of Nrf2 in development of colorectal adenomas by employing genetic, pharmacological, and metabolomic approaches. We found that colorectal adenomas that form in Gstp(?/?): Apc(Min/+) mice are characterized by altered one-carbon metabolism and that genetic activation, but not disruption of Nrf2, enhances these metabolic alterations. However, this enhancement is modest compared to the magnitude of metabolic differences between tumor and peri-tumoral tissues, suggesting that the metabolic changes conferred by Nrf2 activation may have little contribution to the early stages of carcinogenesis. Indeed, neither genetic (by Keap1 knockdown) nor pharmacological Nrf2 activation, nor its disruption, affected colorectal adenoma formation in this model. We conclude that pharmacological Nrf2 activation is unlikely to impact the early stages of development of colorectal cancer.","output":"Nrf2 activation does not affect adenoma development in a mouse model of colorectal cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Multiple long-term care (LTC) reports over the last 30 years issued similar recommendations for improvement across Canadian LTC homes. Our primary objective was to identify the most common recommendations made over the past 10 years. Our secondary objective was to estimate the total cost of studying LTC issues repeatedly over the past 30 years. Methods The qualitative and cost analyses were conducted in Canada from July to October 2020. Using a list of reports, inquiries and commission from The Royal Society of Canada Working Group on Long-Term Care, we coded recurrent recommendations in LTC reports. We contacted the sponsoring organizations for a cost estimate, including direct and indirect costs. All costs were adjusted to 2020 Canadian dollar values. Results Of the 80 Canadian LTC reports spanning the years of 1998 to 2020, twenty-four (30%) were based on a national level and 56 (70%) were focused on provinces or municipalities. Report length ranged from 4 to 1491 pages and the median number of contributors was 14 (interquartile range, IQR, 5-26) per report. The most common recommendation was to increase funding to LTC to improve staffing, direct care and capacity (67% of reports). A median of 8 (IQR 3.25-18) recommendations were made per report. The total cost for all 80 reports was estimated to be $23,626,442.78. Interpretation Problems in Canadian LTC homes and their solutions have been known for decades. Despite this, governments and non-governmental agencies continue to produce more reports at a monetary and societal cost to Canadians.","output":"Recommendations from long-term care reports, commissions, and inquiries in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To examine data in support of the viral hypothesis of atopic disease. DATA SOURCES: We retrieved review articles and original research from MEDLINE, OVID, and PubMed (1950-June 2009) that addressed our topic of interest, using the terms respiratory virus, asthma, IgE, atopy, and viral-induced wheeze. STUDY SELECTION: Articles were selected for their relevance to viruses and their role in asthma. RESULTS: Much of the data in support of the viral role in asthma focuses on rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. Epidemiologic studies have used factors such as day-care and family size as surrogates for infection in studies that support and negate the role of viruses in the development of asthma. A large volume of literature supports the theory that virus exacerbates preexisting asthma by setting off the inflammatory cascade. No mechanistic studies fully explain how viral infections can translate or exacerbate atopic disease. We provide information from our mouse model that suggests that dendritic cells, IgE, and Fc?RI are critical to the induction of atopy. Studies of patients taking antiviral agents (eg, ribavirin or palvizumab) support the notion that interfering with respiratory viral infections may decrease the development of atopy. CONCLUSIONS: Many studies suggest strongly that viral infections may predispose patients to the development of asthma and other atopic diseases. Further, mechanistic studies are necessary to allow for the development of targeted therapeutics to prevent the translation of viral into atopic disease.","output":"The role of viruses in the development and exacerbation of atopic disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Kangaroo mother care (KMC) is a proven intervention for improving intact survival in low birthweight babies. Despite the evidence, its adoption and implementation have been low. Availability of mothers for the first few days of life is a specific challenge at outborn units. We used a quality improvement (QI) approach to implement and sustain KMC in stable low birthweight babies (<2000 g) from a baseline of 2.7 hours/baby/day to 6 hours/baby/day (prolonged KMC) over a period of 2 years in our unit through a series of Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles. METHODS: All babies with birth weight <2000 g not on any respiratory support or jaundice were eligible. The key quantitative outcome was KMC hours/baby/day. A QI team consisting of nurses, nursing in charge and consultants of the unit was formed. The potential barriers for prolonged KMC were evaluated using fishbone analysis. A variety of parent-centric measures (provision of bed to mothers apart from KMC chairs, foster KMC, structured KMC counselling through a video, making KMC an integral part of treatment order) were introduced and subsequently tested by multiple PDSA cycles. Data on the duration of KMC per day were measured by bedside nurses on a daily basis. RESULTS: A total of 134 motherCbaby dyads were enrolled over 2 years. The mean gestation (SD) and mean birth weight (SD) were 33 (2) weeks and 1557 (295) g, respectively. 78 (58%) babies were outborns. We implemented prolonged KMC over 9 months and sustained it over the next 18 months. KMC duration increased from a median of 2.7 hours/baby/day from baseline to a median of 7.4 hours/baby/day after implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged KMC could be implemented and sustained over 2 years by implementing parent-centric best practices even in a predominant outborn unit.","output":"Sustaining prolonged kangaroo mother care in stable low birthweight babies over 2 years in a predominant outborn unit: a quality improvement approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 and caused a global pandemic of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). More than 170 million cases have been reported worldwide with mortality rate of 1-3%. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 by molecular testing is limited to acute infections, therefore serological studies provide a better estimation of the virus spread in a population. This study aims to evaluate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the major city of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia during the sharp increase of the pandemic, in June 2020. Serum samples from non-COVID patients (n=432), patients visiting hospitals for other complications and confirmed negative for COVID-19, and healthy blood donors (n=350) were collected and evaluated using an in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The overall percentage of positive samples was 7.80% in the combined two populations (n=782). The seroprevalence was lower in the blood donors (6%) than non-COVID-19 patients (9.25%), p = 0.0004. This seroprevalence rate is higher than the documented cases, indicating asymptomatic or mild unreported COVID-19 infections in these two populations. This warrants further national sero-surveys and highlights the importance of real-time serological surveillance during pandemics.","output":"Seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Riyadh City during the early increase of COVID-19 infections in Saudi Arabia, June 2020"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:O}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(D,[["render",P]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/32.md","filePath":"drive/32.md"}'),R={name:"drive/32.md"},z=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{E as __pageData,z as default};
