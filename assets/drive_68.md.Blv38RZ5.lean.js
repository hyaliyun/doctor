Increased burnout rates are associated with chronic health condition risk and adverse organizational outcomes. It remains unclear whether sleep is associated to burnout in clinicians treating COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional electronic survey was distributed via email across 3 hospital listserves from September to November, 2020. Clinicians delivering direct care to COVID-19 patients were eligible. Clinician burnout was measured using a single item from AHRQs Mini-Z survey. We assessed sleep using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Binary logistic regressions were used to determine the relationship between PSQI global score (global sleep quality) and burnout, controlling for age, race/ethnicity, gender, length of time employed, whether clinical role changed during COVID-19, and anxiety. In a separate model, we investigated the association between burnout and independent PSQI subcomponents: 1) sleep duration (Hours of sleep per night), and 2) subjective sleep quality (How would you rate your sleep quality overall) entered together, with the above covariates. RESULTS: The final sample included 315 clinicians, predominantly nurses (57% White, 15% Hispanic/Latino, 89% female). Burnout symptoms were reported by 61.6%, and poor global sleep quality (PSQI global score >5) in 84.4% of participants. Poor global sleep quality (PSQI global score >5 vs. 5) was significantly associated with the presence of burnout symptoms (OR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.20C5.28, p=0.015). In the secondary model, self-reported sleep quality (rating of fairly or very bad vs. rating of fairly or very good) was significantly associated with burnout (OR: 4.13, 95% CI: 2.33C7.32, p<0.05), whereas short sleep duration (<6 h vs. 6 h) was not (OR: 0.726, 95% CI: 0.41C1.30, p=0.28). CONCLUSION: Poor sleep quality is common and associated with increased burnout in clinicians delivering care to COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, sleep quality appears to be more strongly related to burnout than sleep duration. Increased evidence about the negative implications of poor sleep and burnout are emerging. Interdisciplinary efforts aimed at promoting effective sleep quality in clinicians during this pandemic may lead to improvements in long-term clinician physical and psychological health.

The surveillance of seropositive individuals serves as an indicator to the extent of infection spread and provides an estimation of herd immunity status among population. Reports from different countries investigated this issue among healthcare workers (HCWs) who are \\"at risk\\" and \\"sources of risk\\" for COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 among HCWs in one of the COVID-19 referral centers in Makkah, Saudi Arabia using three different serological methods. Methods: In-house developed enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), commercially available electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA), and microneutralization (MN) assay were utilized to determine the seroprevalence rate among the study population. 204 HCWs participated in the study. Both physicians and nurses working in the COVID-19 and non COVID-19 areas were included. Twelve out of 204 were confirmed cases of COVID-19 with variable disease severity. Samples from recovered HCWs were collected four weeks post diagnosis. Results: The overall seroprevalence rate was 6.3% (13 out of 204) using the in-house ELISA and MN assay and it was 5.8% (12 out of 204) using the commercial ECLIA. Among HCWs undiagnosed with COVID-19, the seroprevalence was 2% (4 out 192). Notably, neutralizing antibodies were not detected in 3 (25%) out 12 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Conclusions: Our study, similar to the recent national multi-center study, showed a low seroprevalence of SARS-Cov-2 antibodies among HCWs. Concordance of results between the commercial electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA), in-house ELISA and MN assay was observed. The in-house ELISA is a promising tool for the serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, seroprevalence studies may underestimate the extent of COVID-19 infection as some cases with mild disease did not have detectable antibody responses.","output":"Seroprevalence of Neutralizing Antibodies to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among Healthcare Workers in Makkah, Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Planar UV-C LEDs still suffer from low efficiency, mainly due to substrate crystalline quality, p doped conductivity and extraction efficiency. One possible way to overcome partly these issues is to realize the whole UV structure on AlGaN pyramids by selective area growth in order to benefit from the advantages of such structures, i.e. the dislocation filtering and the semi polar planes. We present here a detailed study about the epitaxy of AlGaN nano-sized pyramids by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) on patterned templates presenting different holes apertures and pitches as 1.5 m and 4 m or 100 nm and 250 nm respectively. While increasing the Al content, their height decreases while the thickness of the deposition on the mask increases whatever the design of the mask. Those changes of the pyramid shapes and deposition are directly linked to the properties of Al adatoms, i.e. low Al diffusion length. Using the conventional growth mode for the epitaxy of those pyramids did not permit the incorporation of Al from the base of the pyramids to their truncated apex. Its presence was concentrated on the edges and top of the pyramids. On the contrary, a pulsed growth mode, coupled with a strongly reduced pitch, allowed an incorporation of Al since the base of the nanopyramid, and a decrease of the deposition height on the mask. These results can be explained by the desorption of Ga species, due to the presence of H2 in the reactor chamber during the step without the metal precursors, leading to a higher Al/Ga ratio. It is even enhanced inside the holes by the reduced pitch.","output":"Selective area growth of AlGaN nanopyramids by conventional and pulsed MOVPE."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibodies, and the B cell and plasma cell populations responsible for their production, are key components of the human immune systems response to SARS-CoV-2, which has caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

There is limited research on the vaccination rates against COVID-19 in patients with SMI. AIMS: The objective of the present study is to explore vaccination rates and co-relations in patients with SMI, attending community mental health services, namely the Mobile Mental Health Units (MMHUs) in rural Greece. METHOD: All treatment engaged patients with SMI (schizophrenia-spectrum or bipolar disorder) with two MMHUs (MMHU of Kefalonia, Zakynthos and Ithaca, [MMHU KZI] and MMHU of the prefectures of Ioannina and Thesprotia [MMHU I-T]) in rural Greece were enrolled prospectively over a six-month period. The MMHU I-T had adopted a more proactive approach to patients' vaccination, by informing patients and caregivers for its benefits. RESULTS: Data were analyzed for 197 patients with SMI. The overall vaccination rate was 68.5% and did not differ from the respective rates in the general population. There were no differences in vaccination rates among patients attending the two MMHUs, nor among patients with different diagnoses (schizophrenia spectrum disorders or bipolar disorder). Vaccination was not associated with gender, educational level, history of alcohol and substance abuse, illness duration, or number of previous hospitalizations, whereas the effect size of age was moderate. In more than half non-vaccinated patients the refusal to get vaccinated was associated with fears and concerns as well as false beliefs that are encountered in the general population. CONCLUSION: In the present sample of treatment-engaged rural patients vaccination rates against COVID-19 appear to be satisfactory. There were no differences in vaccination rates with regard to the interventions that were applied to enhance vaccination. It seems that other forms of intervention should be applied to reluctant patients to modify their attitudes toward vaccination.","output":"Vaccination rates against COVID-19 in patients with severe mental illness attending community mental health services in rural Greece"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Primary ciliary dyskinesis (PCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with impaired mucociliary clearance caused by defects in ciliary structure and function.

METHODS Quantitative EEG parameters delta/alpha ratio (DAR), brain symmetry index (BSI) and directional BSI (BSIdir) were derived from 62-channel resting-state EEG recordings in 39 adults within three weeks after a first-ever ischemic hemispheric stroke. FM-UE scores were acquired within three weeks (FM-UEbaseline) and at 26 weeks poststroke (FM-UEw26). Linear regression analyses were performed using a forward selection procedure to predict FM-UEw26. RESULTS BSI calculated over the theta band (BSItheta) ( = -0.40; p = 0.013) was the strongest EEG-based predictor regarding FM-UEw26. BSItheta ( = -0.27; p = 0.006) remained a significant predictor when added to a regression model including FM-UEbaseline, increasing explained variance from 61.5% to 68.1%. CONCLUSION Higher BSItheta values, reflecting more power asymmetry over the hemispheres, predict more upper limb motor impairment six months after stroke. Moreover, BSItheta shows additive prognostic value regarding FM-UEw26 next to FM-UEbaseline scores, and thereby contains unique information regarding upper extremity motor recovery.

Flux, a period of uncertainty before the establishment of new direction, can be considered part of building DNA. What is new, due to structural disruptions in the way we work, is the rate and regularity of flux, reflected in obsolescence, vacancy, and impermanent use. Covid-19 has instantly accelerated this disruption. Retail failure has increased with even more consumers moving online. While employees have been working from home, rendering the traditional office building in the central business district, at least temporarily, obsolete. This article reflects on the situation by reporting findings from an 18-month research project into the practice of planning adaptation in the English built environment. Original findings based on interviews with a national sample of local authority planners, combined with an institutional analysis of planning practice since the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act, suggest that the discipline of planning in England is struggling with the reality of flux. There is a demand for planning to act faster, due to the speed of change in the built environment, and liberal political concerns with planning regulation. This is reflected in relaxations to permitted development rules and building use categories. However, participants also indicate that there is a concurrent need for the planning system to operate in a more measured way, to plan the nuanced complexity of a built environment no longer striated by singular use categories at the local level. This notion of flux suggests a process of perpetual change, turbulence, and volatility. However, our findings suggest that within this process, there is a temporal dialectic between an accelerating rate of change in the built environment and a concomitant need to plan in a careful way to accommodate adaptation. We situate these findings in a novel reading of the complex adaptive systems literature, arguing that planning practice needs to embrace uncertainty, rather than eradicate it, in order to enable built environment adaptation. These findings are significant because they offer a framework for understanding how successful building adaptation can be enabled in England, moving beyond the negativity associated with the adaptation of buildings in recent years. This is achieved by recognizing the complex interactions involved in the adaptation process between respective stakeholders and offering an insight into how respective scales of planning governance can coexist successfully.","output":"Planning Adaptation: Accommodating Complexity in the Built Environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severity of COVID-19 has resulted in a global rush to find the right antiviral treatment to conquer the pandemic and to treat patients.

We compared the time from symptoms onset to ED arrival, the number of neurologic consultations completed in the ED, patients diagnosed with AIS, patients receiving acute treatment and hospital mortality. RESULTS: During January-April 2020, we found an increase in the proportion of stroke patients arriving at the ED within 6 h of symptom onset: 68-100% per month during the study period, compared with 28-42% per month in the previous years.

DESIGN: A two-wave online survey conducted one week apart during the national lockdown (April, 2020). MEASURES: A sample of 477 UK residents completed baseline measures from the reasoned action approach (experiential attitudes, instrumental attitudes, injunctive norms, descriptive norms, capacity, autonomy, and intention) and perceived susceptibility for each of the following recommended behaviours: limiting leaving home, keeping at least 2 m away from other people when outside and when inside shops, not visiting or meeting friends or other family members, and washing hands when returning home. Self-reported compliance with each of the recommended behaviours was assessed one week later. RESULTS: Rates of full compliance with the recommended behaviours ranged from 31% (keeping at least 2 m away from other people when inside shops) to 68% (not visiting or meeting friends or other family members). Capacity was a significant predictor of compliance with each of the five recommended behaviours. Increasing age and intentions were also predictive of compliance with three of the behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to increase compliance with the recommended behaviours to prevent the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, especially those relating to social distancing, need to bolster people's intentions and perceptions of capacity.

Donor candidates were subjected to conventional sperm analysis according to WHO criteria. Moreover, they answered a standardized questionnaire regarding their last week PA (IPAQ), with PA expressed in metabolic equivalents (METs)-min/week. Donors were classified into 4 groups: low, moderate, high and very high PA. Specific sports were included in the questionnaire. Semen samples from 43 accepted donors were used in artificial insemination by donor (AID) and IVF. The fertilization rates (FR) and pregnancy rates (PR) were studied. RESULTS: Semen volume, sperm concentration, progressive spermatozoa, non-progressive spermatozoa, total motile progressive spermatozoa and sperm morphology were similar in the four PA groups.

Intermediate AMD is a risk factor for progression to advanced stages categorised as geographic atrophy (GA) and neovascular AMD. However, rates of progression to advanced stages vary between individuals. Recent advances in imaging and computing technologies have enabled deep phenotyping of intermediate AMD. The aim of this project is to utilise machine learning (ML) and advanced statistical modelling as an innovative approach to discover novel features and accurately quantify markers of pathological retinal ageing that can individualise progression to advanced AMD. METHODS: The PINNACLE study consists of both retrospective and prospective parts. In the retrospective part, more than 400,000 optical coherent tomography (OCT) images collected from four University Teaching Hospitals and the UK Biobank Population Study are being pooled, centrally stored and pre-processed. With this large dataset featuring eyes with AMD at various stages and healthy controls, we aim to identify imaging biomarkers for disease progression for intermediate AMD via supervised and unsupervised ML. The prospective study part will firstly characterise the progression of intermediate AMD in patients followed between one and three years; secondly, it will validate the utility of biomarkers identified in the retrospective cohort as predictors of progression towards late AMD. Patients aged 55C90 years old with intermediate AMD in at least one eye will be recruited across multiple sites in UK, Austria and Switzerland for visual function tests, multimodal retinal imaging and genotyping. Imaging will be repeated every four months to identify early focal signs of deterioration on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) by human graders. A focal event triggers more frequent follow-up with visual function and imaging tests. The primary outcome is the sensitivity and specificity of the OCT imaging biomarkers. Secondary outcomes include sensitivity and specificity of novel multimodal imaging characteristics at predicting disease progression, ROC curves, time from development of imaging change to development of these endpoints, structure-function correlations, structure-genotype correlation and predictive risk models. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies in intermediate AMD to combine both ML, retrospective and prospective AMD patient data with the goal of identifying biomarkers of progression and to report the natural history of progression of intermediate AMD with multimodal retinal imaging.","output":"Developing and validating a multivariable prediction model which predicts progression of intermediate to late age-related macular degenerationthe PINNACLE trial protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Chest examination by auscultation is essential in patients with COVID-19, especially those with poor respiratory conditions, such as severe pneumonia and respiratory dysfunction, and intensive cases who are intubated and whose breathing is assisted with a ventilator. However, proper auscultation of these patients is difficult when medical workers wear personal protective equipment and when it is necessary to minimize contact with patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to design and develop a low-cost electronic stethoscope enabling ear-contactless auscultation and digital storage of data for further analysis. The clinical feasibility of our device was assessed in comparison to a standard electronic stethoscope. METHODS: We developed a prototype of the ear-contactless electronic stethoscope, called Auscul Pi, powered by Raspberry Pi and Python. Our device enables real-time capture of auscultation sounds with a microspeaker instead of an earpiece, and it can store data files for later analysis. We assessed the feasibility of using this stethoscope by detecting abnormal heart and respiratory sounds from 8 patients with heart failure or structural heart diseases and from 2 healthy volunteers and by comparing the results with those from a 3M Littmann electronic stethoscope. RESULTS: We were able to conveniently operate Auscul Pi and precisely record the patients' auscultation sounds. Auscul Pi showed similar real-time recording and playback performance to the Littmann stethoscope. The phonocardiograms of data obtained with the two stethoscopes were consistent and could be aligned with the cardiac cycles of the corresponding electrocardiograms. Pearson correlation analysis of amplitude data from the two types of phonocardiograms showed that Auscul Pi was correlated with the Littmann stethoscope with coefficients of 0.3245-0.5570 for healthy participants (P<.001) and of 0.3449-0.5138 among 4 patients (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Auscul Pi can be used for auscultation in clinical practice by applying real-time ear-contactless playback followed by quantitative analysis. Auscul Pi may allow accurate auscultation when medical workers are wearing protective suits and have difficulties in examining patients with COVID-19.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A questionnaire, including the Pittsburgh sleep quality index, the insomnia severity index, the perceived stress scale and COVID-19 fear index was distributed to the undergraduate students through the online platforms of South Valley University during the period of 1st to 15th June 2020. RESULTS: Of a total respondent sample of 2,474 students, 24.5% had high-perceived stress levels, 31.3% had clinical insomnia, and about 80% were identified as generally poor sleepers by the PSQI. Being female, having a chronic disease, having a sleep disorder before the quarantine, or consuming caffeine were the main factors associated with high stress levels, clinical insomnia, and poor sleep quality. Also, levels of fear of COVID-19 were higher among people with high stress levels, clinical insomnia, and poor sleep quality.

METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE (1966CAugust 2004) and InternationalPharmaceutical Abstracts (1970CAugust 2004) databases with the search terms daptomycin, LY146032, and lipopeptide antibiotics. Abstracts of the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy and documents submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration were also reviewed. RESULTS: Phase III study results suggest no difference in efficacy or tolerability between daptomycin 4 mg/kgIV QD and vancomycin or semisynthetic penicillins for complicated skin and skin-structure infections. Animal studies suggest daptomycin may be useful for the treatment of endocarditis. Daptomycin is not indicated for pneumonia, with poorer outcomes than conventional treatment It is available as an IV medication and exhibits 92% plasma protein binding in vitro. In healthy adult humans, daptomycin has a volume of distribution of 0.1 Ukg and a plasma elimination half-life of 9 hours, and is eliminated primarily by renal excretion (54%). In patients with reduced renal function, including those receiving hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, the dose interval should be 48 hours. No dosage adjustment appears to be necessary for mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The use of daptomycin in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been assessed. The most commonly reported adverse events include constipation, nausea, injection-site reactions, headache, and diarrhea. Patients should also be monitored regularly for skeletal muscle toxicity.

The current healthcare ecosystem, which is centered on the treatment of established foot disease, often fails to adequately control key reversible risk factors to prevent diabetic foot ulcers leading to unacceptable high foot disease amputation rate, 40% recurrence of ulcers rate in the first year, and high hospital admissions. Thus, the latest diabetic foot ulcer guidelines emphasize that a paradigm shift in research priority from siloed hospital treatments to innovative integrated community prevention is now critical to address the high diabetic foot ulcer burden.

Here, we performed a detailed characterization of age-related pathophysiological changes in the mouse neuromuscular system. METHODS: Young, adult, middle-aged, and old (1, 4, 14, and 24-30 months old, respectively) C57BL/6J mice were used. Motor behavioural and electrophysiological tests and histological and immunocytochemical procedures were carried out to simultaneously analyse structural, molecular, and functional age-related changes in distinct cellular components of the neuromuscular system. RESULTS: Ageing was not accompanied by a significant loss of spinal motoneurons (MNs), although a proportion (~15%) of them in old mice exhibited an abnormally dark appearance. Dark MNs were also observed in adult (~9%) and young (~4%) animals, suggesting that during ageing, some MNs undergo early deleterious changes, which may not lead to MN death. Old MNs were depleted of cholinergic and glutamatergic inputs (~40% and ~45%, respectively, P < 0.01), suggestive of age-associated alterations in MN excitability. Prominent microgliosis and astrogliosis [~93% (P < 0.001) and ~100% (P < 0.0001) increase vs. adults, respectively] were found in old spinal cords, with increased density of pro-inflammatory M1 microglia and A1 astroglia (25-fold and 4-fold increase, respectively, P < 0.0001). Ageing resulted in significant reductions in the nerve conduction velocity and the compound muscle action potential amplitude (~30%, P < 0.05, vs. adults) in old distal plantar muscles. Compared with adult muscles, old muscles exhibited significantly higher numbers of both denervated and polyinnervated neuromuscular junctions, changes in fibre type composition, higher proportion of fibres showing central nuclei and lipofuscin aggregates, depletion of satellite cells, and augmented expression of different molecules related to development, plasticity, and maintenance of neuromuscular junctions, including calcitonin gene-related peptide, growth associated protein 43, agrin, fibroblast growth factor binding protein 1, and transforming growth factor-?1. Overall, these alterations occurred at varying degrees in all the muscles analysed, with no correlation between the age-related changes observed and myofiber type composition or muscle topography.

This systematic review and metaCanalysis aims to identify the prevalence and risk factors of postpartum among the women in Middle East countries. METHODS: We searched published articles from Web of Science, EMBASE, PubMed and Cochrane electronic databases to establish study articles. Articles regarding postpartum depression prevalence and associated factors among women in the Middle East were included in this systematic review and metaCanalysis. A randomCeffect model was used for estimation of pooled postpartum depression prevalence with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and forest plot. Presence of heterogeneity was checked by Cochran's (Q) test, and funnel plots and Eggers statistical tests were used to assess publication bias. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies were included in this systematic review. The studies were conducted in different countries of the Middle East between 2006 and 2020, nine of the included studies were crossCsectional studies and six were cohort studies. The overall pooled estimate of the prevalence of postpartum depression in the Middle East mothers was very high 27% (95% CI 0.19C0.35). The common risk factors reported based on our review were poor economic, pregnancy associated complications, low education, unplanned pregnancy, housewife, inadequate social support from family members and the feeding by formula. Poor economic and complication during pregnancy presented a significant relationship regarding postpartum depression in metaCanalysis. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of postpartum depression in the Middle East was higher than other regions of the world.

One complication to addressing this service delivery challenge is the wide heterogeneity of HIV burden and healthcare access across the U.S. It is unclear how the effectiveness and efficiency of expanded PrEP will depend on different baseline ART coverage. METHODS We used a network-based model of HIV transmission for men who have sex with men (MSM) in San Francisco. Model scenarios increased varying levels of PrEP coverage relative under current empirical levels of baseline ART coverage and two counterfactual levels. We assessed the effectiveness of PrEP with the cumulative percent of infections averted (PIA) over the next decade and efficiency with the number of additional person year needed to treat (NNT) by PrEP required to avert one HIV infection. RESULTS In our projections, only the highest levels of combined PrEP and ART coverage achieved the EHE goals. Increasing PrEP coverage up to 75% showed that PrEP effectiveness was higher at higher baseline ART coverage. Indeed, the PIA was 61% in the lowest baseline ART coverage population and 75% in the highest. The efficiency declined with increasing ART (NNT range from 41 to 113). CONCLUSIONS Improving both PrEP and ART coverage would have a synergistic impact on HIV prevention even in a high baseline coverage city like San Francisco.

Primary outcomes C LOS, CPAP requirement, intensive care (ICU) admission, intubation and death C were compared between those who received ACE-I/ARB concurrently with their COVID-19 treatment and those who did not. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-squared test and odds ratio (OR).ResultsOf 521 patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (median age 59 years, 62.6% male), 183 (35.1%) required CPAP, 108 (20.7%) were admitted to ICU, 60 (11.5%) were intubated and 41 (7.9%) died. In total, 151 (29%) were on ACE-I/ARB treatment, most commonly for hypertension. There was no difference in median LOS between those on ACE-I/ARB treatment and those not (11 and 10 days respectively, p=0.20). There was no difference between CPAP requirement (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.71C1.56), admission to intensive care (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50C1.36), intubation (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43C1.58) and death (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.53C2.11) between the two groups (p>0.05).ConclusionThere was no difference in clinical outcomes between COVID-19 patients on ACE-I/ARB and those who were not, in particular with regards to need for non-invasive and invasive ventilation.

However, severe acute respiratory disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is common and associated with mortality in patients who require hospitalization. The etiology of susceptibility to severe lung injury remains unclear. Angiotensin II, converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) from angiotensin I and metabolized by ACE 2 (ACE2), plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of lung injury. ACE2 is identified as an essential receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to enter the cell. The binding of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 leads to the exhaustion and down-regulation of ACE2. The interaction and imbalance between ACE and ACE2 result in an unopposed angiotensin II. Considering that the ACE insertion (I)/deletion (D) gene polymorphism contributes to the ACE level variability in general population, in which mean ACE level in  carriers is approximately twice that in II carriers, we propose a hypothesis of genetic predisposition to severe lung injury in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. It is plausible that the ACE inhibitors and ACE receptor blockers may have the potential to prevent and to treat the acute lung injury after SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially for those with the ACE genotype associated with high ACE level.","output":"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Gene Polymorphism and Severe Lung Injury in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article is a brief overview of the results of the current stage of study of the dynamics of infectious processes in the modern urban environment in Protvino (Russia) with the help of 3D-model of the town, made in the paradigm of the Digital Earth Data for the period 2011-2016 (38791 events) were used Spatial and temporal resolution building-day was achieved It is demonstrated that infectious diseases rates even in neighboring buildings can vary significantly from one to another The presence of buildings with both significantly higher and significantly lower rates of infectious diseases is shown Such significant discrepancies between rates are difficult to explain by local ecological factors like air and water pollutions because of the generalized nature of their impact on such a small area The example of the global dynamics of COVID-19 demonstrates the need to study both specific and non-specific factors for the local epidemic process Prospectives of the future researches are discussed briefly ? 2020 for this paper by its authors Use permitted under Creative Commons License Attribution 4 0 International (CC BY 4 0)","output":"Infectious dynamics in urban 3d-environment: Challenges and possibilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to unprecedented strain on healthcare facilities across the United States. Accurately identifying patients at an increased risk of deterioration may help hospitals manage their resources while improving the quality of patient care. Here we present the results of an analytical model, PICTURE (Predicting Intensive Care Transfers and other UnfoReseen Events), to identify patients at a high risk for imminent intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, respiratory failure, or death with the intention to improve prediction of deterioration due to COVID-19. We compare PICTURE to the Epic Deterioration Index (EDI), a widespread system which has recently been assessed for use to triage COVID-19 patients. Methods The PICTURE model was trained and validated on a cohort of hospitalized non-COVID-19 patients using electronic health record data from 2014-2018. It was then applied to two hold-out test sets: non-COVID-19 patients from 2019 and patients testing positive for COVID-19 in 2020. PICTURE results were aligned to the EDI for head-to-head comparison via Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUROC) and Area Under the Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC). We compared the models' ability to predict an adverse event (defined as ICU transfer, mechanical ventilation use, or death) at two levels of granularity: (1) maximum score across an encounter with a minimum lead time before the first adverse event and (2) predictions at every observation with instances in the last 24 hours before the adverse event labeled as positive. PICTURE and the EDI were also compared on the encounter level using different lead times extending out to 24 hours. Shapley values were used to provide explanations for PICTURE predictions. Results PICTURE successfully delineated between high- and low-risk patients and consistently outperformed the EDI in both of our cohorts. In non-COVID-19 patients, PICTURE achieved an AUROC (95% CI) of 0.819 (0.805 - 0.834) and AUPRC of 0.109 (0.089 - 0.125) on the observation level, compared to the EDI AUROC of 0.762 (0.746 - 0.780) and AUPRC of 0.077 (0.062 - 0.090). On COVID-19 positive patients, PICTURE achieved an AUROC of 0.828 (0.794 - 0.869) and AUPRC of 0.160 (0.089 - 0.199), while the EDI scored an AUROC of 0.792 (0.754 - 0.835) and AUPRC of 0.131 (0.092 - 0.159). The most important variables influencing PICTURE predictions in the COVID-19 cohort were a rapid respiratory rate, a high level of oxygen support, low oxygen saturation, and impaired mental status (Glasgow coma score). Conclusion The PICTURE model is more accurate in predicting adverse patient outcomes for both general ward patients and COVID-19 positive patients in our cohorts compared to the EDI. The ability to consistently anticipate these events may be especially valuable when considering a potential incipient second wave of COVID-19 infections. PICTURE also has the ability to explain individual predictions to clinicians by ranking the most important features for a prediction. The generalizability of the model will require testing in other health care systems for validation.","output":"Validation and comparison of PICTURE analytic and Epic Deterioration Index for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is effective in managing patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused by large-vessel occlusions and allows for valuable histological analysis of thrombi. However, whether bridging therapy (pretreatment with intravenous thrombolysis before MT) provides additional benefits in patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effects of direct MT and bridging therapy, and to elucidate the correlation between thrombus composition and stroke subtypes. Seventy-three patients with acute ischemic stroke who received MT, were eligible for intravenous thrombolysis, and had MCA occlusion were included. We matched 21 direct MT patients with 21 bridging therapy patients using propensity score matching and compared their 3rd-month clinical outcomes. All MCA thrombi (n = 45) were histologically analyzed, and the red blood cell (RBC) and fibrin percentages were quantified. We compared the clot composition according to stroke etiology (large-artery atherosclerosis and cardioembolism) and intravenous thrombolysis application. The baseline characteristics showed no difference between groups except for a higher atrial fibrillation rate and NIHSS score on admission in the direct MT group. We performed a supportive analysis using propensity score matching but could not find any differences in the functional outcome, mortality, and intracerebral hemorrhage. In the histological clot analysis, the cardioembolic clots without intravenous thrombolysis pretreatment had higher RBC (P = 0.042) and lower fibrin (P = 0.042) percentages than the large-artery atherosclerosis thrombi. Similar findings were observed in the thrombi treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (P = 0.012). In conclusion, there was no difference in the functional outcomes between the direct MT and bridging therapy groups. However, randomized trials are needed to elucidate the high ratio of cardioembolism subtype in our group of patients. The histological MCA thrombus composition differed between cardioembolism and large-artery atherosclerosis, and this finding provides valuable information on the underlying pathogenesis and thrombus origin.","output":"Bridging Therapy Versus Direct Mechanical Thrombectomy in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke due to Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion: A Clinical-Histological Analysis of Retrieved Thrombi."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pneumonia caused by coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, has been spread around the world already becoming a pandemic. Unfortunately, there is not yet a specific vaccine or effective antiviral drug for treating COVID-19. Many of these patients deteriorate rapidly and require intubation and are mechanically ventilated, which is causing the collapse of the health system in many countries due to lack of ventilators and intensive care beds. In this document we review two simple adjuvant therapies to administer, without side effects, and low cost that could be useful for the treatment of acute severe coronavirus infection associated with acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). VitaminC, a potent antioxidant, has emerged as a relevant therapy due to its potential benefits when administered intravenous. The potential effect of vitaminC in reducing inflammation in the lungs could play a key role in lung injury caused by coronavirus infection. Another potential effective therapy is ozone: it has been extensively studied and used for many years and its effectiveness has been demonstrated so far in multiples studies. Nevertheless, our goal is not to make an exhaustive review of these therapies but spread the beneficial effects themselves. Obviously clinical trials are necessaries, but due to the potential benefit of these two therapies we highly recommended to add to the therapeutic arsenal.","output":"Dos terapias conocidas podran ser efectivas como adyuvantes en el paciente crtico infectado por COVID-19./ Dos terapias conocidas podran ser efectivas como adyuvantes en el paciente crtico infectado por COVID-19./ Two known therapies could be useful as adjuvant therapy in critical patients infected by COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"True to its nature of a (hopefully) once in a lifetime event, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a tsunami of trademark applications including the terms COVID, Coronavirus, and other medical and pandemic-management related terms.

We assess neighborhood racial disparities in arrests after COVID-19 stay-at-home orders in Boston, Charleston, Pittsburgh, and San Francisco census tracts (January 2019CAugust 2020). Using interrupted time series models with census tract fixed effects, we report arrest rates across tract racial and ethnic compositions.

Although arrest rates steadily increased thereafter, most tracts did not reach pre-pandemic arrest levels. However, despite declines in nearly all census tracts, the magnitude of racial inequities in arrests remained unchanged. During the initial weeks of the pandemic, arrest rates declined significantly in areas with higher Black populations, but average rates in Black neighborhoods remained higher than pre-pandemic arrest rates in White neighborhoods. These findings support urban policy reforms that reconsider police capacity and presence, particularly as a mechanism for enforcing public health ordinances and reducing racial disparities.

Therefore, in the present study, we aimed at investigating the ability of emotion recognition in PwMS from faces wearing masks. We enrolled a total of 42 cognitively normal relapsingCremitting PwMS and a matched group of 20 healthy controls (HCs). Participants underwent a facial emotion recognition task in which they had to recognize from faces wearing or not surgical masks which of the six basic emotions (happiness, anger, fear, sadness, surprise, disgust) was presented. Results showed that face masks negatively affected emotion recognition in all participants (p < 0.001); in particular, PwMS showed a global worse accuracy than HCs (p = 0.005), mainly driven by the no masked (p = 0.021) than the masked (p = 0.064) condition. Considering individual emotions, PwMS showed a selective impairment in the recognition of fear, compared with HCs, in both the conditions investigated (masked: p = 0.023; no masked: p = 0.016). Face masks affected negatively also response times (p < 0.001); in particular, PwMS were globally hastier than HCs (p = 0.024), especially in the masked condition (p = 0.013). Furthermore, a detailed characterization of the performance of PwMS and HCs in terms of accuracy and response speed was proposed. Results from the present study showed the effect of face masks on the ability to process facial emotions in PwMS, compared with HCs. Healthcare professionals working with PwMS at the time of the COVID-19 outbreak should take into consideration this effect in their clinical practice. Implications in the everyday life of PwMS are also discussed.","output":"What Is Hidden behind the Mask?

The purpose of this current study is to assess the preventive, supportive and awareness-building steps taken during the COVID-19 pandemic for international students in China, that will be useful for planning such a behavioral change campaign in the potential pandemic situation in other parts of the world. METHODS: We conducted an online-based e-questionnaire survey among 467 international students in China through WeChat. The data collection duration was from February 20, 2020 to March 10, 2020 and we focused on their level of awareness, satisfaction, and trust in authorities regarding pandemic measures. Simple bivariate statistics was used to describe the background characteristics of the respondents along with adoption of the partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) as the final model to demonstrate the relationship between the variables. RESULTS: In our study, the leading group of the respondents were within 31 to 35 years age group (39.82%), male (61.88%), living single (58.24%) and doctoral level students (39.8%). The preventive and supportive measures taken by students and/or provided by the respective institution or authorities were positively related to students satisfaction and had an acceptable strength ( = 0.611, t = 9.679, p < 0.001). The trust gained in authorities also showed an acceptable strength ( = 0.381, t = 5.653, p < 0.001) with a positive direction. Again, the personnel awareness building related to both students satisfaction ( = 0.295, t = 2.719, p < 0.001) and trust gain ( = 0.131, t = 1.986, p < 0.05) in authorities had a positive and acceptable intensity. Therefore, our study clearly demonstrates the great impact of preventive and supportive measures in the development of students satisfaction (R(2) = 0.507 indicating moderate relationship). The satisfied students possessed a strong influence which eventually helped in building sufficient trust on their institutions (R(2) = 0.797 indicating above substantial relationship). CONCLUSIONS: The worldwide student group is one of the most affected and vulnerable communities in this situation. So, there is a profound ground of research on how different states or authorities handle such situation. In this study, we have depicted the types and magnitude of care taken by Chinese government and educational institutions towards international students to relieve the panic of pandemic situation.

When tested for, the diagnosis and treatment of influenza are often delayed due to the slow turnaround times of centralised laboratory PCR testing. Newer molecular systems, have comparable accuracy to laboratory PCR testing, and can generate a result in under 1 hour, making them potentially deployable as point-of-care tests (POCTs). High-quality evidence for the impact of routine POCT for influenza on clinical outcomes is, however, currently lacking. This large pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial aims to address this evidence gap. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The FluPOC trial is a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial evaluating adults admitted to a large teaching hospital and a district general hospital with an acute respiratory illness, during influenza season and defined by Public Health England. Up to 840 patients will be recruited over up to three influenza seasons, and randomised (1:1) to receive either POCT using the FilmArray respiratory panel, or routine clinical care. Clinical and infection control teams will be informed of the results in real time and where influenza is detected clinical teams will be encouraged to offer neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) treatment in accordance with national guidelines. Those allocated to standard clinical care will have a swab taken for later analysis to allow assessment of missed diagnoses. The outcomes assessment will be by retrospective case note analysis. The outcome measures include the proportion of influenza-positive patients detected and appropriately treated with NAIs, isolation facility use, antibiotic use, length of hospital stay, complications and mortality.

The MLPA reaction is preceded by a preamplification step which ensures the detection of both RNA and DNA viruses with the same specificity and sensitivity as individual monoplex real-time reverse transcription-PCRs. The RespiFinder assay was validated with 144 clinical samples, and the results of the assay were compared to those of cell culture and a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-specific immunochromatography assay (ICA). Compared to the cell culture results, the RespiFinder assay showed specificities and sensitivities of 98.2% and 100%, respectively, for adenovirus; 96.4% and 100%, respectively, for human metapneumovirus; 98.2% and 100%, respectively, for influenza A virus (InfA); 99.1% and 100%, respectively, for parainfluenza virus type 1 (PIV-1); 99.1% and 80%, respectively, for PIV-3; 90.1% and 100%, respectively, for rhinovirus; and 94.6% and 100%, respectively, for RSV.

Patient variables were age, sex, hospital location, and severity of symptoms based on the NIHSS. We reviewed the results of CT of the head, CTA, CTP, and MR imaging examinations and classified a case as imaging-positive if any of the imaging studies yielded a result that related to the clinical indication for the study. Both year-to-year and sequential comparisons were performed between pandemic and prepandemic months. RESULTS A statistically significant decrease was observed in monthly stroke code volumes accompanied by a statistically significant increased proportion of positive imaging findings during the pandemic compared with the same months in the prior year (P < .001) and prepandemic months in the same year (P < .001). We also observed statistically significant increases in average NIHSS scores (P = .045 and P = .03) and the proportion of inpatient stroke codes (P = .003 and P = .03). CONCLUSIONS During our pandemic period, there was a significantly decreased number of stroke codes but simultaneous increases in positivity rates, symptom severity, and inpatient codes.

Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to assess prevalence and epidemiological characteristics of CPV-2 in domestic dogs in mainland China. METHODS: In this study, Chinese and English literature on CPV-2 epidemiology published between January 2006 and December 2019 was evaluated. Regarding meta-analysis, the random-effect model was employed by forest plot with 95% of confidence interval. The number of CPV-2 infections was identified and the pooled prevalence of infection, as well as the epidemiological characteristics, was calculated using meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 39 studies (data from 137,844 dogs) met the evaluation criteria and were used in our study. The pooled prevalence of CPV-2 infection in mainland China was 36%.

Leveraging rich Swedish register data, we connect all students and teachers in Sweden to their families and study the impact of moving to online instruction on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. We find that, among parents, exposure to open rather than closed schools resulted in a small increase in PCR-confirmed infections (odds ratio [OR] 1.17; 95% CI [CI95] 1.03 to 1.32). Among lower-secondary teachers, the infection rate doubled relative to upper-secondary teachers (OR 2.01; CI95 1.52 to 2.67). This spilled over to the partners of lower-secondary teachers, who had a higher infection rate than their upper-secondary counterparts (OR 1.29; CI95 1.00 to 1.67).

It is intriguing to note that the profile-based approach is promising and holds high potential in this regard. To further improve protein remote homology detection, a key step is how to find an optimal means to extract the evolutionary information into the profiles. Results: Here, we propose a novel approach, the so-called profile-based protein representation, to extract the evolutionary information via the frequency profiles. The latter can be calculated from the multiple sequence alignments generated by PSI-BLAST. Three top performing sequence-based kernels (SVM-Ngram, SVM-pairwise and SVM-LA) were combined with the profile-based protein representation. Various tests were conducted on a SCOP benchmark dataset that contains 54 families and 23 superfamilies. The results showed that the new approach is promising, and can obviously improve the performance of the three kernels. Furthermore, our approach can also provide useful insights for studying the features of proteins in various families. It has not escaped our notice that the current approach can be easily combined with the existing sequence-based methods so as to improve their performance as well.

The paper examines three variants of the PEPN-GRN method, which mainly differ by the way the scores of network edges are computed using evidence types. The proposed method is evaluated on the benchmark DREAM4 in silico data sets and a real time series data set of E. coli from the DREAM5 challenge. The PEPN-GRN_v3 variant (the third variant of the PEPN-GRN approach) sought to learn the weights of evidence types in accordance with their contribution to the activation and inhibition gene regulation process. The learned weights help understand the time-shifted and inverted time-shifted relationship between regulator and target gene. Thus, PEPN-GRN_v3, along with the inference of network edges, also provides a functional understanding of the gene regulation process.","output":"PEPN-GRN: A Petri net-based approach for the inference of gene regulatory networks from noisy gene expression data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antecedentes y objetivo: La forma ms eficaz de controlar la gravedad y la tasa de mortalidad de la enfermedad del nuevo coronavirus (COVID-19) es mediante enfoques de diagnstico sensibles y un protocolo de tratamiento adecuado.

Background and aim: The most effective way to control severity and mortality rate of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is through sensitive diagnostic approaches and an appropriate treatment protocol. We aimed to identify the effect of adding corticosteroid and Tocilizumab to a standard treatment protocol in treating COVID-19 patients with chronic disease through hematological and lab biomarkers. Materials and methods: This study was performed retrospectively on 68 COVID-19 patients with chronic disease who were treated by different therapeutic protocols. The patients were categorized into four groups: control group represented the patients lab results at admission before treatment protocols were applied; group 1 included patients treated with anticoagulants, Hydroxychloroquine, and antibiotics; group 2 comprised patients treated with Dexamethasone; and group 3 included patients treated with Dexamethasone and Tocilizumab. Results: The WBC and neutrophil counts were increased significantly in group 3 upon the treatment when they were compared with patients in group 1 (p= 0.004 and p= 0.001, respectively). The comparison of C-reactive Protein (CRP) level at admission was higher in group 3 than in group 1 with p= 0.030. After 10 days of treatment, CRP level was decreased in all groups, but in group 3 it was statistically significant (p= 0.002).

Methods: The data on infection monitoring, obtained by 2,192 swabs, were reported and compared among 253 patients, 722 clinical professionals and 232 other hospital workers. The number of admissions and neurorehabilitation sessions performed in the period from March-May 2020 was compared with those of the same period in 2019. Results: Four patients and three clinical professionals were positive for COVID-19 infection. Six out of these seven people were from the same ward. Several measures were taken to handle the infection, putting in place many restrictions, with a significant reduction in new admissions to the hospital (p < 0.001). However, neither the amount of neurorehabilitation for inpatients (p = 0.681) nor the effectiveness of treatments (p = 0.464) were reduced when compared to the data from 2019. Conclusions: Our data show that the number of infections was contained in our hospital, probably thanks to the protocols adopted for reducing contagion and the environmental features of our wards.

We combine this approach with a likelihood-based loss that includes predictions at every time step within an individual's history, rather than just including one term per individual. The combination of this loss and model results in an interpretable approach to dynamic survival, requiring less fine tuning than existing methods, while still achieving good predictive performance.

Metal artifact reduction has been successfully demonstrated in coil mass cases, but only in a small series. We attempted to objectively and subjectively evaluate the feasibility of metal artifact reduction with various metallic objects and coil lengths. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reprocessed the flat detector CT data of 28 patients (15 men, 13 women; mean age, 55.6 years) after they underwent endovascular treatment (20 coiling  stent placement, 6 liquid embolizers) or shunt drainage (n = 2) between January 2009 and November 2011 by using a metal artifact reduction correction algorithm. We measured CT value ranges and noise by using region-of-interest methods, and 2 experienced neuroradiologists rated the degrees of improved imaging quality and artifact reduction by comparing uncorrected and corrected images. RESULTS After we applied the metal artifact reduction algorithm, the CT value ranges and the noise were substantially reduced (1815.3  793.7 versus 231.7  95.9 and 319.9  136.6 versus 45.9  14.0; both P < .001) regardless of the types of metallic objects and various sizes of coil masses. The rater study achieved an overall improvement of imaging quality and artifact reduction (85.7% and 78.6% of cases by 2 raters, respectively), with the greatest improvement in the coiling group, moderate improvement in the liquid embolizers, and the smallest improvement in ventricular shunting (overall agreement, 0.857).

However, little is known about the psychiatric profiles of individuals who are at risk. It is well-established that individuals affected by substance use disorders frequently suffer from depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and experiences of childhood trauma. The aim of this study is to determine whether this pattern of psychiatric disturbance is also present in individuals at risk for exercise addiction. METHODS: Individuals exercising for 10+ h/week were divided into those at risk and not at risk for exercise addiction based on their scores on the Exercise Dependence Scale (EDS). Demographic data and scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), a measure for ADHD in adults and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) were also gathered. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-three individuals agreed to participate in the study, and completed the questionnaires. Twenty-nine (23.6%) of these individuals were classed as at risk for exercise addiction. There was a statistically significant difference between the at-risk and not at-risk groups on the combined dependent variable after controlling for hours of exercise per week, F((3, 95))= 10.198, p = 0.00, Wilk's  = 0.756, partial 2 = 0.244.

METHODS: We used diagnostic procedure combination (DPC) database to analyze the data of 1,774 patients from 305 institutions between April 2016 and March 2019. To analyze the situations associated with first-line BEV use during concurrent TMZ (temozolomide)-radiotherapy, we compared TMZ alone and TMZ-BEV groups. RESULTS: Of the 1,774 patients with GBM, tumor removal by craniotomy was performed in 1,572 (88.6%) patients, and stereotactic biopsy was performed in 156 (8.8%) patients. A total of 1,229 (69.3%) patients underwent radiotherapy, and 1,287 (72.5%) patients underwent chemotherapy.

METHODS: In 17 US centers researchers collected clinical data and nasal swabs from infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis. Trained parents collected nasal swabs 3 weeks after hospitalization and, when healthy, during the summer and 1 year after hospitalization. We applied 16S rRNA gene sequencing to all nasal swabs. We used joint modeling to examine the relation of longitudinal nasal microbiota abundances to the risk of recurrent wheezing. RESULTS: Among 842 infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis, there was 88% follow-up at 3 years, and 31% had recurrent wheezing. The median age at enrollment was 3.2 months (interquartile range, 1.7-5.8 months).

Methods This cross-sectional study was performed in the National Heart Foundation Hospital & Research Institute of Bangladesh from April 29 to July 20, 2020. HCP employed in this hospital who experienced fever or respiratory symptoms or came in close contact with COVID-19 patients at home or their workplace were included in this study. The presence of COVID-19 disease was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal samples. A total of 394 HCP were sampled and 139 had a positive corona test. Structured interviews were conducted to document symptoms for all HCP with confirmed COVID-19. Data analysis was performed in July 2020. Results Out of 1,409 HCP, 139 subjects tested positive for COVID-19. Among the HCP, infection rate was 9.86%. The mean age of the study population was 34.0811.11 years (range: 20-69 yrs), of whom 82 (59%) were female. Most of this cohort were nurses (56 [40.3%]) and physicians (25 [18%]), and the remaining 58 (41.7%) were other staff. The mean duration of onset of symptoms to test was 2.892.07 days. The most common symptoms were fever (84.2%), fatigue (56.1%), cough (54%), body ache (39.6%), headache, and anosmia (38.8%). Most subjects had mild disease (125 [93%]), three (2.1%) of the HCP had moderate disease and one (0.7%) had severe disease. Ten of the HCP (7.2%) were asymptomatic. Most of them were treated either by ivermectin plus azithromycin or ivermectin plus doxycycline. Only 20 (14.4%) of the HCP were hospitalized, while others were treated either in home isolation (59.7%) or in institutional isolation (25.9%). Recovery was almost uneventful except one healthcare worker who died. Conclusion Most HCP had mild symptoms and a few of them were asymptomatic also. HCP with mild COVID-19 symptoms may be treated in home or institutional isolation. As they are a vulnerable group for infection, providing adequate protection to HCP is absolutely mandatory to safeguard them from this pandemic.","output":"Clinical Presentation, Management and In-Hospital Outcome of Healthcare Personnel With COVID-19 Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Crisis and disruption are often unpredictable and can create opportunities for crime During such times, policing may also need to meet additional challenges to handle the disruption The use of social media by officials can be essential for crisis mitigation and crime reduction In this paper, we study the use of Twitter for crime mitigation and reduction by UK police (and associated) agencies in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic Our findings suggest that whilst most of the tweets from our sample concerned issues that were not specifically about crime, especially during the first stages of the pandemic, there was a significant increase in tweets about fraud, cybercrime and domestic abuse There was also an increase in retweeting activity as opposed to the creation of original messages Moreover, in terms of the impact of tweets, as measured by the rate at which they are retweeted, followers were more likely to spread the word when the tweet was content-rich (discussed a crime specific matter and contained media), and account holders were themselves more active on Twitter Considering the changing world we live in, criminal opportunity is likely to evolve To help mitigate this, policy makers and researchers should consider more systematic approaches to developing social media communication strategies for the purpose of crime mitigation and reduction during disruption and change more generally We suggest a framework for so doing","output":"Show this thread: policing, disruption and mobilisation through Twitter.

This study assessed the effect of COVID-19 on length of stay (LOS), same-day discharge rates, and other markers of resource use after elective total shoulder arthroplasty. A total of 508 consecutive patients undergoing elective primary total shoulder arthroplasty between 2019 and 2021 were identified and divided into 2 cohorts: pre-COVID (March 2019CMarch 2020; n = 263) and post-COVID (May 2020CMarch 2021; n = 245). No elective shoulder arthroplasties were performed at our practice between 18 March and 11 May 2020. Outcome measures included LOS, same-day discharge, discharge location, and 90-day emergency department (ED) visits, readmissions and reoperations. There were no significant differences in baseline preoperative patient characteristics. Shoulder arthroplasty performed post-COVID was associated with a shorter LOS (12 vs. 16 h, p = 0.017) and a higher rate of same-day discharge (87.3 vs. 79.1%, p = 0.013). The rate of discharge to skilled nursing facilities was similarly low between the groups (1.9 vs. 2.0%, p = 0.915). There was a significant reduction in the rate of 90-day ED visits post-COVID (7.4 vs. 13.3%, p = 0.029), while there were no differences in 90-day reoperation (2.0 vs. 1.5%, p = 0.745) or readmission rates (1.2 vs. 1.9%, p = 0.724).

There is evidence that obesity-related conditions may increase the severity of COVID-19 disease, especially in those below the age of 60. However, there has been limited research on mortality rate based on body mass index (BMI) in the older adult population, defined as age over 65. The objective of this study was to characterize outcomes in older adults infected with COVID-19 based on BMI. Study design and methods It is a single-center retrospective cohort study of older adults with COVID-19 infection. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes assessed were oxygen requirements, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, and hospital length of stay. Data were analyzed with the Students t-test, Fishers exact test, and multiple logistic regression analyses as appropriate. Results A total of 290 patients were included in this study. The mean age was 77.6 years. The median BMI was >30 kg/m2. The primary outcome of hospital mortality occurred in 49.7% of patients. BMI was not found to be a predictor of mortality. Age 75-79 and age  85 were associated with an increased risk of mortality (OR: 2.58; 95% CI: 1.15 - 5.79; OR: 3.17; 95% CI: 1.35 - 7.44, respectively). Patients with a BMI < 18.5, BMI 18.5 - 25, and age  85 were less likely to require mechanical ventilation (OR: 0.06; 95% CI: 0.00 - 0.83; OR:0.11; 95% CI: 0.02 - 0.64 and OR:0.28; 95% CI: 0.09 - 0.92, respectively).

Children living in rural areas and in the poorest households suffer the most from stunting across the country-43.2% in rural areas and 51.4% in the lowest wealth quintile. As a continuing public health concern, it is essential that stunting prevention is a national priority in order to ensure human capital development, especially among the poorest households. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of a medium quantity of a lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS) combined with unconditional cash transfers and social and behavior change communication (SBCC) on reduction of stunting in children aged 6 to 23 months. METHODS: A 5-arm cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted in the district of Rahim Yar Khan in Punjab, Pakistan. The intervention packages will be (1) cash only, (2) cash with LNS, (3) cash with SBCC, and (4) cash with SBCC and LNS. The control arm will receive routine standard of care. We will enroll children at 6 months of age and follow up on a monthly basis up to 24 months of age. A total of 2000 children, 400 in each arm, will be enrolled to detect a 20% reduction in the prevalence of stunting among children aged 24 months. Length, weight, food intake, compliance to interventions, morbidities, and other relevant data will be collected at enrollment and on a monthly basis over the period of 18 months. The process evaluation will assess acceptability of the interventions and potential barriers to implementation through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with the target population and relevant stakeholders. Furthermore, a cost analysis will be conducted to assess the cost-effectiveness of each intervention package. RESULTS: The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Aga Khan University in Pakistan on January 4, 2017. Data collection began in May 2017 and was completed in July 2019. Data analyses are yet to be completed. This study will explore the effectiveness of intervention packages comprised of cash transfers from Benazir Income Support Programme with or without additional LNS and SBCC in preventing childhood stunting. We expect the results to be published in peer-reviewed journals by autumn of 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this trial will provide robust evidence as to which intervention packages can have significant effects on linear growth of children and design effective intervention packages to prevent stunting in children aged 6 to 23 months.

Cross-syndrome comparisons of neural dynamics may help determine whether altered motion processing is a general marker of atypical development or condition-specific. Here, we assessed group differences in N2 peak amplitude (previously proposed as a marker of motion-specific processing) in typically developing (n = 57), autistic (n = 29) and dyslexic children (n = 44) aged 6-14 years, in two global motion tasks. High-density EEG data were collected while children judged the direction of global motion stimuli as quickly and accurately as possible, following a period of random motion. Using a data-driven component decomposition technique, we identified a reliable component that was maximal over occipital electrodes and had an N2-like peak at ~160 msec. We found no group differences in N2 peak amplitude, in either task. However, for both autistic and dyslexic children, there was evidence of atypicalities in later stages of processing that require follow up in future research. Our results suggest that early sensory encoding of motion information is unimpaired in dyslexic and autistic children. Group differences in later processing stages could reflect sustained global motion responses, decision-making, metacognitive processes and/or response generation, which may also distinguish between autistic and dyslexic individuals.","output":"Global motion evoked potentials in autistic and dyslexic children: A cross-syndrome approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), needs better treatment options both at antiviral and anti-inflammatory levels. It has been demonstrated that the aminothiol cysteamine, an already human applied drug, and its disulfide product of oxidation, cystamine, have anti-infective properties targeting viruses, bacteria, and parasites. To determine whether these compounds exert antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2, we used different in vitro viral infected cell-based assays. Moreover, since cysteamine has also immune-modulatory activity, we investigated its ability to modulate SARS-CoV-2-specific immune response in vitro in blood samples from COVID-19 patients. We found that cysteamine and cystamine decreased SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) in Vero E6 cells. Interestingly, the antiviral action was independent of the treatment time respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, cysteamine and cystamine significantly decreased viral production in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells. Finally, cysteamine and cystamine have an anti-inflammatory effect, as they significantly decrease the SARS-CoV-2 specific IFN- production in vitro in blood samples from COVID-19 patients. Overall, our findings suggest that cysteamine and cystamine exert direct antiviral actions against SARS-CoV-2 and have in vitro immunomodulatory effects, thus providing a rational to test these compounds as a novel therapy for COVID-19.","output":"Cysteamine with In Vitro Antiviral Activity and Immunomodulatory Effects Has the Potential to Be a Repurposing Drug Candidate for COVID-19 Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.","output":"Author Correction: Neurological immunotherapy in the era of COVID-19 - looking for consensus in the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The specialty of anesthesiology has made extraordinary advances in anesthesia safety.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1827 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized within the Yale-New Haven Health System (YNHHS) between March 14, 2020 and April 23, 2020. Clinical characteristics, liver tests (AST, ALT, ALP, TBIL, albumin) at three time points (pre-infection baseline, admission, peak hospitalization), and hospitalization outcomes (severe COVID-19, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, death) were analyzed.

Here, CSF was tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and compared to controls and patients with known neurotropic pathogens. METHODS: CSF from twenty-seven consecutive patients with COVID-19 and neurological symptoms was assayed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and unbiased metagenomic sequencing. Assays for blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown (CSF:serum albumin ratio (Q-Alb)), and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-15, IL-16, monocyte chemoattractant protein ?1 (MCP-1) and monocyte inhibitory protein C 1 (MIP-1)) were performed in 23 patients and compared to CSF from patients with HIV-1 (16 virally suppressed, 5 unsuppressed), West Nile virus (WNV) (n = 4) and 16 healthy controls (HC). RESULTS: Median CSF cell count for COVID-19 patients was 1 white blood cell/L; two patients were infected with a second pathogen (Neisseria, Cryptococcus neoformans). No CSF samples had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA by either detection method. In patients with COVID-19 only, CSF IL-6, IL-8, IL-15, and MIP-1 levels were higher than HC and suppressed HIV (corrected-p < 0.05).

We need to revisit and sort out the clinical characteristics of these patients at the beginning of the global COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We collected data from confirmed COVID-19 patients from two military-run field hospitals and classified them into the rheumatic disease group and no rheumatic disease groups, and the latter was further distinguished by ARD and non-ARD. We compared the primary outcome, which we defined as mortality, and the secondary outcome, which we defined as the ICU occupancy rate, the duration of hospitalization and the duration of viral clearance, between the patients with and without rheumatic diseases after PSM. A study-level meta-analysis of four studies was conducted on the mortality of the COVID-19 patients with and without rheumatic diseases. RESULTS: A total of 4353 COVID-19 patients were included in our cohort study; 91 had rheumatic diseases. The mean age of the entire cohort was 59.37, and 2281 (52.40%) patients were female. The mortalities after PSM were 1.11% and 3.46% in the rheumatic diseases and no rheumatic disease groups, respectively. The ICU occupancy rates after PSM were 2.22% and 4.61% in the rheumatic diseases and no rheumatic disease groups. The duration of hospitalization and viral clearance in the rheumatic disease group were 15.97 and 43.69, respectively; moreover, the same parameters in the no rheumatic diseases after PSM were 15.48 and 45.48.

RESULTS: MCI can be empirically detected using a short-ITI protocol. We show that the ITI modulates the spatial learning of AD mice without affecting the formation of spatial memory. Finally, a simple classification algorithm such as logistic regression on WM data can give an accurate prediction of the cognitive dysfunction of a specific mouse. CONCLUSION: MCI can be detected as well predicted simultaneously with the onset of A? deposition in the hippocampus in AD mouse model. The mild cognitive impairment prediction can be used for assessing the efficacy of a treatment.","output":"Detection and Prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Alzheimer's Disease Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The suicide rate in Hong Kong has increased significantly over the past four decades. Population subgroups such as the elderly or economically-distressed are reported to be more vulnerable than others to suicidal behaviors, while changing suicide methods (such as charcoal burning which emerged in 1998), has also contributed significantly to increasing suicide rates. However, the extent of the contribution of different factors to changes in suicide rate remains unclear. This paper reported on a decomposition analysis of the epidemiological profile of suicide in Hong Kong between 1976 and 2015, specifically considering factors underlying the increasing suicide rate over this period. Completed death registry information was available from the Census and Statistics Department of the Hong Kong SAR for this investigation. We compared absolute and relative contributions of gender, age and suicide method to rate changes over time. Changes in suicide rate were generally underpinned by more than one factor. Population aging in a rapidly-aging city contributed significantly to suicide rate increases, whilst jumping from a height had the greatest influence on rate changes throughout the study period. Suicides by male aged 25C34 years and 45C54 years were more likely to be triggered by economic factors, compared with the other gender-age subgroups. The decomposition approach provided a comprehensive understanding about how socioeconomic factors and suicide methods interacted to influence over-time suicide patterns. This research supports development of more focused suicide prevention measures to reduce suicide rate.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical regulators of the pathologic inflammatory milieu in liver fibrosis (LF). Herein, we explored whether and how KD repressed development of LF via DC regulation and verified the pathway involved in the process. Given our analysis, both KD and adoptive transfer of KD-conditioned DC conspicuously reduced hepatic histopathological damage, proinflammatory cytokines release and extracellular matrix deposition in CCl(4)-induced LF mice. Of note, KD restrained the LF-driven rise in CD86, MHC-II, and CCR7 levels and, simultaneously, upregulated PD-L1 expression on DCs specifically, which blocked CD8(+)T cell activation. Additionally, KD reduced DC glycolysis, maintained DCs immature, accompanied by IL-12 decrease in DCs. Inhibiting DC function by KD disturbed the communication of DCs and HSCs with the expression or secretion of -SMA and Col-I declined in the liver. Mechanistically, KD suppressed the phosphorylation of PI3K-AKT driven by LF or PI3K agonist, followed by enhanced nuclear transport of FoxO1 and upregulated interaction of FoxO1 with the PD-L1 promoter in DCs. PI3K inhibitor or si-IL-12 in DC could relieve LF, HSC activation and diminish the effect of KD. In conclusion, KD suppressed DC maturation with promoted PD-L1 expression via PI3K-AKT-FoxO1 and decreased IL-12 secretion, which blocked activation of CD8(+)T cells and HSCs, thereby alleviating liver injury and fibro-inflammation in LF.","output":"For the Topic C The New Therapeutic Approaches, Biomarkers and Molecular Mechanisms of Organ Fibrosis and COVID19 Rehabilitation Kinsenoside attenuates liver fibro-inflammation by suppressing dendritic cells via the PI3K-AKT-FoxO1 pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic poses an additional challenge to countries with planned national elections in 2020.

The release of NET components from neutrophils is involved in the suppression of pathogen diffusion. Development of NETs around target microbes leads to disruption of the cell membrane, eventuating in kind of cell death that is called as NETosis. The very first step in the process of NETosis is activation of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase upon signaling by innate immune receptors. Afterwards, produced Reactive oxygen species (ROS) trigger protein-arginine deiminase type 4, neutrophil elastase, and myeloperoxidase to generate decondensed chromatin and disrupted integrity of nuclear membrane. Subsequently, decondensed chromatin is mixed with several enzymes in the cytoplasm released from granules, leading to release of DNA and histones, and finally formation of NET. Several reports have indicated that NETosis might contribute to the immune responses through limiting the dissemination of microbial organisms. In this review, we discuss recent advances on the role of neutrophils, NETs, and their implications in the pathogenesis of microbial infections.

In a controlled, multicenter clinical trial called REPLATINUM that was prematurely halted due to COVID-19, data from 17 patients with third line or beyond SCLC was analyzed. Moving forward, REPLATINUM(restrated) has added SARS-CoV-2 exclusion criteria. Our aim was to explore the efficacy of RRx-001 in REPLATINUM and to assess the statistical assumptions of the REPLATINUM(restrated) trial in order to inform future clinical development in SCLC. Methods: Patients in REPLATINUM were randomized to receive 1 of 2 arms: 1) carboplatin AUC 5 IV on day 1 or cisplatin 60 mg/m2 IV on day 1 plus etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV on days 1 through 3 every 21 days for up to 4 cycles or 2) 4 mg of RRx-001 administered sequentially with 4 cycles of a platinum doublet (cisplatin or carboplatin plus etoposide as outlined above). Progression Free Survival (PFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint based on a blinded independent central review (BICR). Results: The trial was suspended prematurely after 17 patients had been enrolled due to widespread COVID-19 exposure with the plan to restart the trial. The decision to restart the trial has provided an opportunity to examine the data for preliminary evidence of treatment efficacy. At the time that the REPLATINUM trial was halted, there were 11 patients enrolled on the control arm and 6 on the investigational arm. The BICR assessed median PFS was approximately 7.1 months for RRx-001 + platinum doublet and 3.5 months for the platinum doublet alone based on the truncated database. The BICR assessed PFS hazard ratio was approximately 0.5. OS medians were approximately 8.2 and 6.3 months for RRx-001 +platinum doublet and platinum doublet alone, respectively. Additionally, patients on the RRx001 + platinum doublet-treated experimental arm experienced less toxicity than patients on the platinum doublet-treated control arm. Conclusions: Despite the small sample size, preliminary results from REPLATINUM suggest a trend toward a favorable primary outcome and improved safety in RRx-001-treated patients and support the validity of the statistical assumptions that underlie the REPLATINUM(restrated) trial.

INTRODUCTION: Since 2019 December, a rapid increase in a cluster of Pneumonia cases has been identified in Wuhan, China.1 Which was then determined by the International Committee on the taxonomy of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the disease named Coronavirus (COVID-19) with an unknown etiology.2 The novel coronavirus (2019 n-CoV) outbreak has been informed to the World Health Organization (WHO), which further added as it was caused by the novel beta coronavirus that belongs to the family Coronaviridae.3 Which is genetically similar to SARS-CoV, which is responsible for the SAR outbreak in 2002.4 The 2019 coronavirus is a global emergency, the WHO declared global emergencies only five times that is for Swine flu (2009), Ebola, Polio (2014), Zika virus (2016), Kivu Ebola (2018-2020), Coronavirus (2019-2020).5 This family of viruses causes the common cold and named for the spike proteins on its surface that make it look like a crown or a star.6 The first few cases were associated with a wholesale seafood market, which made us understand that Zoonotic (meaning transmitted from animal to human). Later, the pathogen's precise details have been noticed that the COVID-19 is as much like the SARS and MERS.9 The initial treatment is given to COVID-19 was similar to the SARS and MERS, but the results are not much as expected, so the treatment is still symptomatic.10 Pneumonia, particularly the inflammation in the alveoli or the bronchi, can be caused by both the microbes and the virus that invade the lung tissue and make breathing difficult by filling the alveoli with fluid and pus.11 The alveoli are the major site for transferring the O2 into the bloodstream and CO2 out from the body.12 So it makes breathing difficult at times, and it may be either single or double pneumonia meaning it may affect a single lung or both.13 The pneumonia symptoms may include coughing, shortness of breath, fastening of heart rate, sweating, fever, dehydration, and appetite loss. Once the virus is inside the cell, it starts to replicate.26,27 The information in the viral RNA is used to produce all the viral proteins (polyproteins), including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the S-protein, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, papain-like protease, helicase, glycoprotein, and accessory proteins.28 The genetic RNA is also replicated, and all the viral components are assembled, and finally virus buds out from the host cell.29 Initially, the virus replicates in the upper respiratory tract (cough and fever), and in most cases, the human immune system can fight it and defeat it.","output":"Prediction of COVID-19 severity associated with Pneumonia by chest CT scan and Serological results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Besides balancing burdens and benefits of intensive care, ethical conflicts in the process of decision-making should also be recognised. This calls for an ethical analysis relevant to clinicians. The aim was to analyse ethically difficult situations in the process of deciding whether a patient is admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Analysis using the Dilemma method and wide reflective equilibrium, on ethnographic data of 45 patient cases and 96 stakeholder interviews in six UK hospitals. ETHICAL ANALYSIS: Four moral questions and associated value conflicts were identified. (1) Who should have the right to decide whether a patient needs to be reviewed? Conflicting perspectives on safety/security. (2) Does the benefit to the patient of getting the decision right justify the cost to the patient of a delay in making the decision? Preventing longer-term suffering and understanding patients values conflicted with preventing short-term suffering and provision of security. (3) To what extent should the intensivist gain others input? Professional independence versus a holistic approach to decision-making. (4) Should the intensivist have an ongoing duty of care to patients not admitted to ICU? Short-term versus longer-term duty to protect patient safety. Safety and security (experienced in a holistic sense of physical and emotional security for patients) were key values at stake in the ethical conflicts identified. The life-threatening nature of the situation meant that the principle of autonomy was overshadowed by the duty to protect patients from harm. The need to fairly balance obligations to the referred patient and to other patients was also recognised. CONCLUSION: Proactive decision-making including advance care planning and escalation of treatment decisions may support the inclusion of patient autonomy. However, our analysis invites binary choices, which may not sufficiently reflect reality. This calls for a complementary relational ethics analysis.","output":"Ethical conflicts during the process of deciding about ICU admission: an empirically driven ethical analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) four-dimensional (4D) flow is a type of phase-contrast (PC) MRI that uses blood flow encoded in 3 directions, which is resolved relative to 3 spatial and temporal dimensions of cardiac circulation.

Lactoferrin is a crucial local immunity protein in the oral cavity with important antimicrobial activity. The aim of this study was to prospectively investigate salivary lactoferrin secretion levels and Candida colonization in oral lichen planus patients treated with fluocinolone acetonide 0.1% in orabase. METHODS Saliva samples were collected from 15 oral lichen planus subjects who had never received topical steroid treatment prior to this study and 15 healthy volunteers to determine their salivary lactoferrin levels using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and to investigate the presence of oral Candida species at baseline and 3 months after treatment with fluocinolone acetonide 0.1% in orabase. Statistical analysis was performed to compare lactoferrin secretion and Candida colonization levels between the groups using the Mann-Whitney U test for independent data or the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test for paired data. RESULTS The salivary lactoferrin secretion level was not significantly different between the control group and oral lichen planus patients or between before and after treatment with fluocinolone acetonide 0.1% in orabase (P > 0.05). Candida was detected in 11 (73.33%) healthy volunteers, 8 (53.33%) oral lichen planus patients before treatment, and 9 (60%) oral lichen planus patients after treatment with fluocinolone acetonide 0.1% in orabase. There was no significant difference in Candida counts between the groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION Our study indicates that using fluocinolone acetonide 0.1% in orabase to treat oral lichen planus for 3 months did not affect salivary lactoferrin protein secretion or Candida carriage.

On-going elective theatre capacity remains problematic and so we adapted our service so that all patients presenting acutely with an obstructing ureteric calculus were initially listed for shockwave lithotripsy (SWL). This included patients traditionally expected to have poor outcomes. Furthermore, patients with no stone clearly visible on a plain radiograph would still be listed with an intention to treat should the stone be visible upon fluoroscopic screening at the lithotripter. We also adopted a more flexible approach to our normal protocol for delivery not to exceed two sessions before listing for ureteroscopic surgery (URS). Materials & Methods: Data was retrospectively collected for all patients listed with an intention to treat obstructing ureteric calculi with SWL from the 17th March to 20th October 2020. Patients would be treated using the onsite Storz Modulith SLX-F2 lithotripter where pre-treatment fluoroscopic screening was available. Patients would routinely be listed for 2 sessions of SWL and a Consultant Endourologist would decide whether to proceed with further SWL or URS. Patients with intolerable pain or sepsis would undergo prior insertion of a percutaneous nephrostomy. Results: The stone free rate for 110 patients treated with up to 2 sessions of SWL was 52.7%. If further sessions were delivered the stone free rate increased to 68.2%, following an average of 1.7 further sessions over an average of 21.5 days. Offering further SWL inferred an average cost saving of 888.40-1708.40 per patient by avoiding the additional cost of URS in 17 patients. Our very unselected cohort included 32% with 2 or more poor prognostic factors (upper ureteric, size >10mm, >1000 Hounsfield Units). These patients had a stone free rate of 62.9% following all sessions, compared to 70.7% of those with <2 poor prognostic factors. Only 3 patients listed for SWL with no stone visible on XR KUB were unable to be treated as no stone could be localised on fluoroscopic screening. However 20 patients thought to have non visible stones were able to be treated, and 75% of these patients were stone free after all sessions, avoiding theatre bookings in 15 patients. Conclusions: Offering our SWL service to all patients with obstructing ureteric stones has lightened the burden on theatre demand. Offering multiple sessions is effective, can be delivered in a timely manner and further reduces the need for URS at a lower cost. In addition fluoroscopic screening can be considered to identify stones not visible on XR KUB allowing more patients to be treated with SWL further avoiding theatre bookings.","output":"Outcomes of a modified Shock Wave Lithotripsy (SWL) service offering multiple sessions and including patients with poor prognostic factors during the Coronavirus pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on Intermedia Agenda Setting (IAS), the current study examines how official media and semi-privatized commercial media on the Weibo platform covered the COVID-19 pandemic in China.

The guidelines were prepared following the Standard Operational Procedure for a European Stroke Organisation guideline document and according to GRADE methodology. As a basic principle, we defined TIA clinically and pragmatically for generalisability as transient neurological symptoms, likely to be due to focal cerebral or ocular ischaemia, which last less than 24 hours. High risk TIA was defined based on clinical features in patients seen early after their event or having other features suggesting a high early risk of stroke (e.g. ABCD2 score of 4 or greater, or weakness or speech disturbance for greater than five minutes, or recurrent events, or significant ipsilateral large artery disease e.g. carotid stenosis, intracranial stenosis). Overall, we strongly recommend using dual antiplatelet treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin short term, in high-risk non-cardioembolic TIA patients, with an ABCD2 score of 4 or greater, as defined in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We further recommend specialist review within 24 hours after the onset of TIA symptoms. We suggest review in a specialist TIA clinic rather than conventional outpatients, if managed in an outpatient setting. We make a recommendation to use either MRA or CTA in TIA patients for additional confirmation of large artery stenosis of 50% or greater, in order to guide further management, such as clarifying degree of carotid stenosis detected with carotid duplex ultrasound. We make a recommendation against using prediction tools (eg ABCD2 score) alone to identify high risk patients or to make triage and treatment decisions in suspected TIA patients as due to limited sensitivity of the scores, those with score value of 3 or less may include significant numbers of individual patients at risk of recurrent stroke, who require early assessment and treatment.

Plasma level of BNP was increased with increasing New York Heart Association grade and apelin level was decreased. Apelin level was lower in HF patients with NYHA grade IV than in controls and non-HF patients. Apelin level had 75% diagnostic value for HF, and BNP level had 96.8% diagnostic value. At a cutoff of 6.44 ng/mL apelin level, sensitivity was 69.3%, and specificity 97.1%. However, the diagnostic of apelin for NYHA II patients was higher than that of BNP (99.6% vs. 96.1%). These results suggested that apelin might be particularly useful in association with BNP in mild HF patients.","output":"Increased plasma level of apelin with NYHA grade II and III but not IV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) requires behavioral changes such as physical distancing (e.g., staying a 6-foot distance from others, avoiding mass gatherings, reducing houseguests), wearing masks, reducing trips to nonessential business establishments, and increasing hand washing. Like other health behaviors, COVID-19 related behaviors may be related to risk representations. Risk representations are the cognitive responses a person holds about illness risk such as, identity (i.e., label/characteristics of risk), cause (i.e., factors causing condition), timeline (i.e., onset/duration of risk), consequences (i.e., intrapersonal/interpersonal outcomes), behavioral efficacy (i.e., if and how the condition can be controlled/treated), and illness risk coherence (i.e., extent to which representations, behaviors, and beliefs are congruent). The current study applies the Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM-SR) to evaluate how risk representations may relate to COVID-19 protective and risk behaviors. METHODS: Participants include 400 workers from Amazon's Mechanical Turk aged &#8805; 18 years and US residents. Participants completed an online survey measuring risk representations (B-IPQ) and COVID-19 related behaviors, specifically, physical distancing, hand washing, and shopping frequency. RESULTS: Risk coherence, consequences, timeline, emotional representation, and behavioral efficacy were related to risk and protective behaviors.

The first influenza pandemic of this century was declared in April of 2009, with the emergence of a novel H1N1 IAV strain (H1N1pdm) in Mexico and USA. Understanding the extent and causes of biases in codon usage is essential to the understanding of viral evolution. A comprehensive study to investigate the effect of selection pressure imposed by the human host on the codon usage of an emerging, pandemic IAV strain and the trends in viral codon usage involved over the pandemic time period is much needed. RESULTS: We performed a comprehensive codon usage analysis of 310 IAV strains from the pandemic of 2009. Highly biased codon usage for Ala, Arg, Pro, Thr and Ser were found. Codon usage is strongly influenced by underlying biases in base composition. When correspondence analysis (COA) on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) is applied, the distribution of IAV ORFs in the plane defined by the first two major dimensional factors showed that different strains are located at different places, suggesting that IAV codon usage also reflects an evolutionary process. CONCLUSIONS: A general association between codon usage bias, base composition and poor adaptation of the virus to the respective host tRNA pool, suggests that mutational pressure is the main force shaping H1N1 pdm IAV codon usage. A dynamic process is observed in the variation of codon usage of the strains enrolled in these studies. These results suggest a balance of mutational bias and natural selection, which allow the virus to explore and re-adapt its codon usage to different environments. Recoding of IAV taking into account codon bias, base composition and adaptation to host tRNA may provide important clues to develop new and appropriate vaccines.","output":"Pandemic influenza A virus codon usage revisited: biases, adaptation and implications for vaccine strain development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has focused attention on two issues that have been of ongoing discussion and public health concern in the United States: continued declines in blood product utilization coupled with even larger declines in blood donation collection In April 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued recommendations that included a reduction of the then deferral period for men who have sex with men (MSM) from 12 months to 3 months from last sexual contact with a man 1 These changes were long in the making and were issued following a dramatic decrease in blood product availability following the COVID19-related significant and abrupt drop in blood donation The authors present the rationale that the reduction to three months deferral rather than elimination ofthe deferral entirely ignores scientifically rigorous studies indicating that the blood screening assays currently in use have a documented HIV-positive detection period of, most conservatively, 7 to 10 days, thereby reducing the risk of transfusiontransmitted HIV infection to the transfusion recipient to significantly less than that of more common, noninfectious disease complications from transfusion, such as those caused by circulatory overload 2 5 The authors' platform includes immediately implementing a universal, selfreported, risk-based deferral questionnaire that affords the opportunity for blood collection organizations to bring in new and subsequently return blood donors, alleviating some ofthe stress on the collection side by increasing the eligible blood donor population","output":"Individual Risk-Based Assessment for Blood Donation in the United States-Is It Time?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over 300 million students around the world saw their education interrupted due to COVID-19 Like never before, schools and universities have the tools to ensure the continuation of education, even when schools are closed Teachers, students, and families collaborate to make online learning success;however, how prepared were students and teachers for distance learning?

Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of home antigen tests compared with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and viral culture by days from illness onset, as well as user acceptability. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study was conducted from January to May 2021 in San Diego County, California, and metropolitan Denver, Colorado. The convenience sample included adults and children with RT-PCR-confirmed infection who used self-collected home antigen tests for 15 days and underwent at least 1 nasopharyngeal swab for RT-PCR, viral culture, and sequencing. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the daily sensitivity of home antigen tests to detect RT-PCR-confirmed cases. Secondary outcomes included the daily percentage of antigen test, RT-PCR, and viral culture results that were positive, and antigen test sensitivity compared with same-day RT-PCR and cultures. Antigen test use errors and acceptability were assessed for a subset of participants. Results: This study enrolled 225 persons with RT-PCR-confirmed infection (median [range] age, 29 [1-83] years; 117 female participants [52%]; 10 [4%] Asian, 6 [3%] Black or African American, 50 [22%] Hispanic or Latino, 3 [1%] Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 145 [64%] White, and 11 [5%] multiracial individuals) who completed 3044 antigen tests and 642 nasopharyngeal swabs. Antigen test sensitivity was 50% (95% CI, 45%-55%) during the infectious period, 64% (95% CI, 56%-70%) compared with same-day RT-PCR, and 84% (95% CI, 75%-90%) compared with same-day cultures. Antigen test sensitivity peaked 4 days after illness onset at 77% (95% CI, 69%-83%). Antigen test sensitivity improved with a second antigen test 1 to 2 days later, particularly early in the infection. Six days after illness onset, antigen test result positivity was 61% (95% CI, 53%-68%). Almost all (216 [96%]) surveyed individuals reported that they would be more likely to get tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection if home antigen tests were available over the counter. Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this cohort study of home antigen tests suggest that sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 was moderate compared with RT-PCR and high compared with viral culture. The results also suggest that symptomatic individuals with an initial negative home antigen test result for SARS-CoV-2 infection should test again 1 to 2 days later because test sensitivity peaked several days after illness onset and improved with repeated testing.","output":"Comparison of Home Antigen Testing With RT-PCR and Viral Culture During the Course of SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-1) was of importance in the pathogenesis of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). To determine whether knockdown of TGF-1 gene expression could facilitate the control of PRRSV infection, specific sequences for expressing shRNA targeted to porcine TGF-1 gene were synthesized and cloned into pSilencer 3.1-H1 neovector. Then they were used to transfect peripheral blood mononuclear cells of Tibetan pig (Tp-PBMCs) followed by PRRSV inoculation. The positive recombinant plasmids were screened for inhibition of TGF-1 gene expression by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Conversely, the mRNA level of PRRSV in shRNA treated Tp-PBMCs dramatically decreased, and there were significant increases of the transcription of immune genes, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interferon-alpha (IFN-), interferon-gamma (IFN-), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), Myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88) (MyD88), and interleukin-27p28 (IL-27p28). However, the expressions of IL-8 and IL-10 genes significantly reduced in comparison to the control infected cells. In addition, transfection with the shRNA plasmids significantly elevated the viability of immune cells. Therefore the knockdown of TGF-1 gene expression by shRNA not only inhibits the replication of PRRSV but also improves immune responsiveness following viral infection, suggesting a novel way to facilitate the control of PRRSV infection in pigs.","output":"Silence of TGF-1 gene expression reduces prrsv replication and potentiates immunity of immune cells of tibetan pig"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to highlight the efforts made by the Brazilian Courts of Accounts (CAs) during the COVID-19 pandemic to collaborate with its jurisdictional authorities, civil servants, and society to face its effects Descriptive and qualitative research was carried out, analyzing the legislation issued by the CAs to evaluate their actions Among the findings, it was observed that the CM took administrative and pedagogical measures to protect the public, such as the suspension or restriction of face-to-face service Also, the courts suspended collective events, face-to-face meetings, and travel, adopted telework, limited expenditures and distance learning courses Among the procedural measures, Plenary Sessions or Chambers, procedural deadlines, and remittance of accounts were suspended Finally, the activities of guidance and monitoring were conducted under a series of guidelines and recommendations created collaboratively with other agencies and branches of government, guiding public spending, the acquisition and contracting of services with no bidding requirements, among other procedures It is concluded that the set of measures implemented by the CAs shows a change in the traditional status of subsequent control of public accounts - which gives rise to punitive action - for prior and concurrent control, with recommendations, inspections, and monitoring, when the manager still has instruments to amend errors and avoid waste and misapplication of public resources","output":"Actions by the Courts of Accounts to minimize effects of coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the COVID\\\\19 pandemic caused by SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 now in its second year, there remains an urgent need for diagnostic testing that can identify infected individuals, particularly those who harbor infectious virus.

Reducing corticosteroid use and dependence is an important treatment goal since their use is associated with adverse events. The extent to which the improvements in IBD therapy have led to less corticosteroid use in the modern era remains unclear. METHODS We used the University of Manitoba Inflammatory Bowel Disease Epidemiologic Database to assess the cumulative annual dosing of corticosteroids on a per-patient basis for all persons with IBD in the province of Manitoba between 1997 and 2017. Joinpoint analysis was used to assess for trends in corticosteroid use and to look at variation in the trends over time. RESULTS The mean annual exposure to corticosteroids decreased from 419 mg/yr (1997) to 169 mg/yr (2017) for Crohn's disease (CD) (annual decline: 3.8% per year, 95% confidence interval 3.1-4.6) and from 380 to 240 mg/yr in ulcerative colitis (UC) (annual decline: 2.5% per year, 95% confidence interval 2.1-2.8). In CD, there was an acceleration in the rate of decline after 2007 (pre-2007, 1.9% decline per year; after 2007, 5.7% per year); there was no corresponding acceleration in the rate of decline in UC. DISCUSSION Corticosteroid use has decreased in both CD and UC over the past 2 decades, becoming more pronounced after 2007 in CD.

Pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (CVD) including hypertension have a higher risk for severe illness, cardiac damage, and death. Therefore, strategies for cardiovascular protection in COVID-19 are urgently needed, in addition to the development of vaccines against COVID-19. Previously, it has been reported that several SARS-CoV-1 genes including encoded Envelope (E) protein, open reading frame (ORF) 3a, are capable of forming viral channels in mammalian cells and damaging the cells via activation of apoptotic or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling. In addition, SARS-CoV-1 patients are found to possess antibodies against ORF3a, indicating that this protein was expressed at the surface of the host cells. Moreover, a recent clinical report confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect cardiomyocytes. However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the linkage between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiac risk are unclear. Hypothesis SARS-CoV-2 genes including ORF3a can be expressed in cardiomyocytes after virus infection, and subsequently dysregulate cardiac functions. Methods HEK293T cells and H9c2 cardiac myoblasts were transfected with ORF3a and utilized for biochemical, cell biological, and electrophysiological assays. Numerical model of rabbit ventricular action potential was used to evaluate the role of ORF3a on cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia. Results Although ORF3a sequences from SARS-CoV-1 and -CoV-2 have 72% similarity, ORF3a from SARS-CoV-2 maintains high homology with SARS-CoV-1 in the protein sequences of the transmembrane domains and the pore, which are critical for forming ion channels. We found that SARS-CoV-2-ORF3a is expressed at plasma membrane and outer mitochondrial membrane as assessed by protein fractionation, mitochondrial digestion, and live-cell imaging. Whole cell patch clamp revealed that ORF3a can form K+-permeable channels at the plasma membrane with similar channel properties as the endogenous transient outward K+ current (Ito). Moreover, numerical simulations suggest that increased Ito amplitude (mimicking increase of ORF3a expression) may dysregulate Ca2+ transient and increase the risk for early afterdepolarization in response to increased heart rate. Lastly, we found that ORF3a promotes apoptotic signaling activation, but not ER stress signaling, assessed by caspase activity and the expression of major ER chaperones, respectively. Conclusion ORF3a from SARS-CoV-2 forms K+-permeable channels at the plasma membrane and dysregulates cardiac Ca2+ handling and electrophysiology. ORF3a can also be expressed at the mitochondria and activate oxidative stress signaling, which exacerbates the risk of arrhythmia.

We compared the clinical characteristics of the subjects who tested positive and negative, including the sensibility, positive and negative predictive value of different combination of signs and symptoms. RESULTS: Of all the suspected infected, 2596 tested negative (96.2%) and 103 tested positive (3.8%). The median age was 7.0 and 5.3 years for the positive and negative ones, respectively.

Patients who suffer from it frequently have hyperglycemia and coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death. The comorbidities associated with diabetes are overweight and obesity, systemic arterial hypertension, atherogenic dyslipidemia and in some patients peripheral vascular disease, kidney damage, neuropathy and retinopathy. Chronic lack of control of the disease is associated with increased susceptibility to infections, which generally have few symptoms, but hyperglycemia is generally magnified, which worsens the course of infections. Since December 2019, when the disease caused by one of the coronaviruses (coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS-CoV-2) was identified and has been called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there have been some reports that associate the presence of diabetes with an increased risk of mortality. In this review article we have focused on four specific points: 1) epidemiology of the prevalence and mortality of COVID 19 in the general population and in the population with type 2 diabetes mellitus; 2) pathophysiology related to the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to receptors in subjects with diabetes; 3) the immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2, and 4) the outpatient and hospital treatment recommended in patients with diabetes who become infected with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Infeccin por coronavirus en pacientes con diabetes./ Coronavirus infection in patients with diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Nurse-sensitive quality indicators have historically been used as a metric of nursing care quality in health care organizations.

METHODS The PRISMA guidelines were followed. We searched bibliographic databases (Embase, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL)) from inception to 1st August 2018. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently scrutinized studies for relevance, extracted data and assessed quality of studies. Risk of bias of studies and quality of evidence were assessed using ROBINS-I tool and GRADEpro respectively. Primary outcomes were survival to 30 days with favourable neurological outcomes and survival to hospital discharge with favourable neurological outcomes. Secondary outcomes were survival to 30 days, survival to hospital discharge and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) post-hospital arrival for patients with ongoing resuscitation. This systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD 42018093369) RESULTS: We included data from 17 observational studies on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients in meta-analyses. Overall, the certainty of evidence was very low. Pooling data from only adjusted analyses, care at CAC was not associated with increased likelihood of survival to 30 days with favourable neurological outcome (OR 2.92, 95% CI 0.68-12.48) and survival to 30 days (OR 2.14, 95% CI 0.73-6.29) compared to care at other hospitals. Whereas patients cared for at CACs had improved survival to hospital discharge with favourable neurological outcomes (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.74-2.84) and survival to hospital discharge (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.46-2.34).

Evidence from the 2013C2016 Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak indicated that different genotypes of the virus can have different phenotypes in patients. Additionally, due to the error-prone nature of viral RNA synthesis in an individual patient, the EBOV genome exists around a dominant viral genome sequence. The minor variants within a patient may contribute to the overall phenotype in terms of viral protein function. To investigate the effects of these minor variants, blood samples from patients with acute EVD were deeply sequenced. RESULTS: We examine the minor variant frequency between patients with acute EVD who survived infection with those who died. Non-synonymous differences in viral proteins were identified that have implications for viral protein function. The greatest frequency of substitution was identified at three codon sites in the L genewhich encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Recapitulating this in an assay for virus replication, these substitutions result in aberrant viral RNA synthesis and correlate with patient outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings support the notion that in patients who survived EVD, in some cases, the genetic variability of the virus resulted in deleterious mutations that affected viral protein function, leading to reduced viral load. Such mutations may also lead to persistent strains of the virus and be associated with recrudescent infections.","output":"Variation around the dominant viral genome sequence contributes to viral load and outcome in patients with Ebola virus disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Compensating land managers for the provision of public goods is currently one of the European Union's flagship policies, and one that that resonates across the globe more generally in the effort to meet Sustainable Development Goals. Despite having been central to the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for several decades now, Agri-Environment Schemes (AES) seem to only have had limited success in preserving biodiversity and providing environmental benefits due, among other, to farmer-related factors. This paper systematically reviews and quantifies, for the first time, the body of evidence that explores these factors with respect to their influence on land managers willingness to accept (WTA) compensation for the delivery of biodiversity and environmental features protection. Our analysis shows a complex and nuanced picture. Farmers appear generally willing to enrol in AES, with average payment per hectare being around 327 Euros. However, the current evidence base provides few clues on how best that willingness is matched by contract design formats and features more generally. Providing support to farmers and exploring new ways of monitoring compliance emerge as issues worth considering as means of determining compensation in AES. Further, the broader evidence base seems to suggest that wealthier land managers stand to gain more than less wealthy in enroling in AES. However, this alone seems, in the overall, like a quite modest contribution from the body of evidence to inform policy design more broadly. It indeed does seem that we (academia and/or policy) are not yet hitting the right key on how to best match farmers preferences for enroling in AES for the delivery of biodiversity/environmental features A significant leap forward would not simply require an increased quantity of primary studies, but a deeper reflexion on how the complexity of farmers preferences is best captured in the design of policy instruments that have to both share common features while being adaptable to context dependent characteristics at the landscape level. This is more pressing than ever face to the unprecedented challenges of Brexit and the COVID19-induced economic recession, which is going to put every cent of public funding under the hardest of scrutinies in the years to come. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd","output":"Agri-environmental schemes for biodiversity and environmental protection: How were are not yet hitting the right keys"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The genome of living cells is continuously exposed to endogenous and exogenous attacks, and this is particularly amplified at high temperatures.

Upstream KPIs mainly include the incidence of detected Sars-CoV-2-positive cases in the population, and downstream KPIs include daily hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions and fatalities. Whereas downstream KPIs are essential to evaluate and adapt hospital organization, upstream KPIs are the most appropriate to decide on the strength of restrictions such as lockdown set up and evaluate their effectiveness. Here, we suggested tools derived from pharmacokinetic calculations to improve understanding the epidemic progression. From the time course of the number of new cases of SARS-coV-2 infection in the population, it is possible to calculate the infection rate constant using a simple linear regression and determine its corresponding half-life. This epidemic regression half-life is helpful to measure the potential benefits of restriction measures and to estimate the adequate duration of lockdown if implemented by policymakers in relation to the decided public health objectives. In France, during the first lockdown, we reported an epidemic half-life of 10 days.

MCI/ADRD screening could offer benefits such as early treatment, research participation, lifestyle modification, and advanced care planning. To date, there are no clear guidelines regarding the benefits vs. harms of dementia screening or whether a dementia screening program could be successful. METHODS A community-based study was conducted to evaluate an MCI/ADRD screening program and determine what older adults would do with the information. Measures of cognition, physical health, functionality, and mood were collected. Participants met with a health professional, were given screening results with recommendations, and then contacted 60 days later to determine what was done with the results. Logistic regression models were used to build predictive models. RESULTS Participants (n = 288) had a mean age of 71.58.3y, mean education of 13.34.8y, and were 70% female, 67% White, 26% African American, and 48% Hispanic. After 60 days, 75% of participants were re-contacted; 54% shared results with family, 33% shared results with health care providers (HCPs), and 52% initiated behavioral change. Among participants sharing results with HCPs, 51% reported HCPs did not follow-up on the results, and 18% that HCPs did not show any interest in the screening visit or its results. Predictors of sharing results with HCPs were elevated hemoglobin A1C (OR = 1.85;95%CI:1.19-2.88), uncontrolled hypertension (OR = 2.73;95%CI:1.09-6.83), and mobility issues (OR = 2.43;95%CI: 1.93-5.54). Participant behavioral changes included lifestyle modification (58%), social engagement (10%), cognitive stimulation (5%), and advanced care planning (4%). The most significant predictors of sharing with family were better overall mental health (OR = 0.19; 95%CI: 0.06-0.59) and better physical function (OR = 0.38; 95%CI: 0.17-0.81). DISCUSSION MCI/ADRD screening was well-received by a diverse community sample. Participants showed interest in sharing the results with their family and HCPs and many attempted behavioral change. While HCPs did not always act on screening results, 25% ordered further testing and evaluation. Efforts need to be directed toward (1) increasing self-efficacy of older adults to discuss screening results with their HCPs, and (2) educating HCPs on the value of early detection of MCI/ADRD.

The 180-kDa oligomeric S protein of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 is posttranslationally cleaved into an S1 receptor binding unit and an S2 membrane fusion unit. The latter is thought to contain an internal fusion peptide and has two 4,3 hydrophobic (heptad) repeat regions designated HR1 and HR2. HR2 is located close to the membrane anchor, and HR1 is some 170 amino acids (aa) upstream of it. Heptad repeat (HR) regions are found in fusion proteins of many different viruses and form an important characteristic of class I viral fusion proteins. We investigated the role of these regions in coronavirus membrane fusion. Peptides HR1 (96 aa) and HR2 (39 aa), corresponding to the HR1 and HR2 regions, were produced in Escherichia coli. When mixed together, the two peptides were found to assemble into an extremely stable oligomeric complex. Both on their own and within the complex, the peptides were highly alpha helical. Electron microscopic analysis of the complex revealed a rod-like structure approximately 14.5 nm in length. Limited proteolysis in combination with mass spectrometry indicated that HR1 and HR2 occur in the complex in an antiparallel fashion. In the native protein, such a conformation would bring the proposed fusion peptide, located in the N-terminal domain of HR1, and the transmembrane anchor into close proximity. Using biological assays, the HR2 peptide was shown to be a potent inhibitor of virus entry into the cell, as well as of cell-cell fusion.

SIV was moderately effective against medically-attended ILI caused by influenza A/B in both 2018/19 and 2019/20 winter seasons (53.2% (95%CI 36.7-65.5%) and 41.8% (95%CI 6.3-64.1%), respectively). The VE against the main circulating subtype, influenza A(H1), was higher for the 2018/19 season (57.2% (95%CI 39.8-69.9%), compared to 34.6% (95%CI -9.6-61.4%) in the 2019/20 season). When compared to pan negative controls, those with single NIRV infections were similarly likely to have received SIV (OR 1.05 (95%CI 0.72-1.54) within the influenza season; OR 0.97 (95%CI 0.73-1.29) when including non-influenza seasons). Analyses by type of virus showed no increased risk of SIV identified among those with single infections of EV/RV, HMPV and parainfluenza but a 2-fold increased risk was shown for those with single infections of adenovirus and parainfluenza virus (adenovirus: OR 2.54 (95%CI 1.24-5.14) within influenza season and OR 1.78 (95%CI 1.01-3.09) for the whole period; parainfluenza virus: OR 2.01 (95%CI 1.22-3.29) within influenza season and OR 1.89 (95%CI 1.29-2.76) for the whole period). SIV programme and surveillance of influenza and NIRV, including SARS-CoV-2, should continue during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The effect of seasonal influenza vaccine on medically-attended influenza and non-influenza respiratory viruses infections at primary care level, Hong Kong SAR, 2017/18 to 2019/20."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: To evaluate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in low-risk Prostate Cancer patients as preferred treatment option in emergency health conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 2013 to September 2015, 28 patients with low-risk prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled. The SBRT prescribed dose was 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions, twice a week. Primary endpoints were acute and late toxicity. Secondary endpoints were biochemical recurrence free survival (bRFS) and overall survival. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 65.5 months (range 52-81). No acute G3 or G4 toxicity was recorded. Acute G1 or G2 genitourinary (GU) toxicity occurred in 43% and acute G1-G2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity in 14%. Late G1 and G3 GU toxicity in 18% and 3.5%, respectively. The G3 toxicity was not directly attributable to radiotherapy. Late G1 GI toxicity occurred in 18%. 5yy bRFS was 96.5% (95% CI 82.3-99.4%).

The strategy includes free access to Covid-19 testing and since 2021, compulsory documentation for negative test or vaccination for access to workplace, educational institutions, restaurants, and many other places. In the present study we analysed the effect of the Danish mass testing strategy throughout relevant stages of the pandemic. Mass testing was found not to have impact on the number of hospitalizations during the pandemic. Furthermore, during the highest level of testing in the spring 2021 the fraction of positive tests increased slightly on comparable days indicating that mass testing at best, did not reduce the prevalence of Covid-19. The relationship between positives in antigen testing and in PCR testing indicated that many patients are not tested early in their infection where the risk of transmission is highest. A likely explanation for the lack of impact of mass testing on hospitalizations and infections is that the testing increases risk-behaviour of the tested persons and that a high fraction of false negatives at low Covid-19 prevalence combined with increased risk-behaviour outweighs beneficial effects of mass testing.","output":"Impact of the national test strategy on the development of the Covid-19 pandemic in Denmark"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The risk of cervical cancer is caused by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A review was carried out to recognize relevant research available until 10 April 2020. RESULTS The main transmission routes of COVID-19 have been the following: animal to human and human-to-human pathways, namely: respiratory transmission; oro-fecal transmission; air, surface-human transmission. Transmission from asymptomatic persons, healthcare transmission, and interfamily transmission have been well documented. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 possesses powerful pathogenicity and transmissibility. It is presumed to spread primarily via respiratory droplets and close contact. The most probable transmission pathway is definitely the inter-human one. Asymptomatic patients seem to play a crucial role in spreading the infection. Because of COVID-19 infection pandemic potential, careful surveillance is essential to monitor its future host adaptation, viral evolution, infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity in order to gain an effective vaccine and flock immunity and reduce mortality as soon and as much as it is possible.","output":"Transmission mode associated with coronavirus disease 2019: a review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Data on breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant infections are limited.Methods: We studied breakthrough infections among healthcare workers of a major infectious diseases hospital in Vietnam.

We sequenced the viruses using ARTIC protocol.Findings: Between 11thC25th June 2021 (week 7C8 after dose 2), 69 healthcare workers were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 62 participated in the clinical study. 49 were (pre)symptomatic with one requiring oxygen supplementation. All recovered uneventfully. 23 complete-genome sequences were obtained. They all belonged to the Delta variant, and were phylogenetically distinct from the contemporary Delta variant sequences obtained from community transmission cases, suggestive of ongoing transmission between the workers. Viral loads of breakthrough Delta variant infection cases were 251 times higher than those of cases infected with old strains detected between March-April 2020. Time from diagnosis to PCR negative was 8C33 days (median: 21). Neutralizing antibody levels after vaccination and at diagnosis of the cases were lower than those in the matched uninfected controls. There was no correlation between vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody levels and viral loads or the development of symptoms.Interpretation: Breakthrough Delta variant infections are associated with high viral loads, prolonged PCR positivity, and low levels of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies, explaining the transmission between the vaccinated people.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among dental students in different Saudi universities using an online self-administered questionnaire. It gathered data on students' demographic information, knowledge of COVID-19 and infection control measures, risk perception and attitudes toward the disease, and their preparedness for treating infected patients. Results: A total of 327 dental students responded to the questionnaire.

Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains the standard to determine the adequacy of clipping. Intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) angiography is increasingly utilized to confirm optimal clip positioning across the neck and to evaluate the adjacent vasculature. OBJECTIVE We evaluated the correlation between ICG and DSA in clipped intracranial aneurysms. METHODS A retrospective study of patients who underwent craniotomy and microsurgical clipping of intracranial aneurysms with ICG for 2 years. Patient characteristics, presentation details, operative reports, and pre- and postclipping angiographic images were reviewed to determine the adequacy of the clipping. RESULTS Forty-seven patients underwent clipping with ICG and postoperative DSA: 57 aneurysms were clipped; 23 patients (48.9%) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Nine aneurysms demonstrated a residual on DSA not identified on ICG (residual sizes ranged from 0.5 to 4.3 mm; average size: 1.8 mm). Postoperative DSA demonstrated no branch occlusions. CONCLUSION Intraoperative ICG is useful in the clipping of intracranial aneurysms to ensure a gross patency of branch vessels; however, the presence of residual aneurysms and subtle changes in flow in branch vessels is best seen by DSA.

A cross-sectional study was performed to comprehensively investigate the impact of factors like demography, COVID-19 pandemic-induced behavior, and vaccine attitude on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (VA) among communities of five different universities in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). To investigate the effect of demography and COVID-19 pandemic-induced behavioral factors, Analysis of Variance was perfomed. The effect of COVID-19 vaccine attitudes on COVID-19 VA was examined through partial least squares-structural equations modeling. The results of the study showed no difference among the population in accepting COVID-19 vaccines due to their demographic factors. The effect of pandemic-induced behavioral factors on COVID-19 VA suggested that the people of UAE accepted COVID-19 vaccines irrespective of the movement and travel restrictions imposed due to the pandemic. The results on the effect of vaccine attitudes on COVID-19 VA showed that vaccine benefit attitudes, safety concerns, and trust in health-care professionals (TrHP) were found to be significant factors in VA. Furthermore, TrHP was found to reduce the negative effect of safety concerns related to COVID-19 VA. The findings broadly highlight that COVID-19 VA in the UAE was not hampered by demographic factors and the pandemic-induced behavioral constraints. The study also showed that people with co-morbidities had lower level of COVID-19 VA than people with no co-morbidities.

FAFs comprise update frameworks which empower (human or artificial) agents to argue over time about the probability of outcomes, e.g. the winner of a political election or a fluctuation in inflation rates, whilst flagging perceived irrationality in the agents' behaviour with a view to improving their forecasting accuracy. FAFs include five argument types, amounting to standard pro/con arguments, as in bipolar argumentation, as well as novel proposal arguments and increase/decrease amendment arguments.

The death toll associated with the pandemic is increasing day by day. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus and its N terminal domain (NTD) of Nucleocapsid protein (N protein) binds to the viral (+) sense RNA and results in virus ribonucleoprotien complex, essential for the virus replication. The N protein is composed of a serine-rich linker region sandwiched between NTD and C terminal (CTD). These terminals play a role in viral entry and its processing post entry. The NTD of SARS-CoV-2 N protein forms orthorhombic crystals and binds to the viral genome. Therefore, there is always a quest to target RNA binding domain of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (NTD-N-protein which in turn may help in controlling diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 in humans. The role of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine as potential treatments for is still under debate globally because of some side effects associated with it. This study involves the In silico interactions of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine with the NTD-N-protein of SARS-CoV-2. With the help of various computational methods, we have explored the potential role of both of these antiviral drugs for the treatment of patients by comparing the efficacy of both of the drugs to bind to NTD-N-protein. In our research Hydroxychloroquine exhibited potential inhibitory effects of NTD-N-protein with binding energy -7.28 kcal/mol than Chloroquine (-6.30 kcal/mol) at SARS-CoV-2 receptor recognition of susceptible cells. The outcomes of this research strongly appeal for in vivo trials of Hydroxychloroquine for the patients infected with . Furthermore, the recommended doses of Hydroxychloroquine may reduce the chances of catching to the healthcare workers and staff who are in contact with or delivering direct care to coronavirus patients as long as they have not been diagnosed with .

However, the study of asymptomatic patients is still rare, and the understanding of its potential transmission risk is still insufficient. In this study, epidemiological investigations were conducted in the Zhejiang province to understand the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective study was carried out on 22 asymptomatic patients and 234 symptomatic patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Zhejiang Duodi Hospital from January 21 to March 16, 2020. The characteristics of epidemiology, demography, clinical manifestations, and laboratory data of mild patients were compared and analyzed. Results: The median age was 28 years in asymptomatic patients and 48 years in symptomatic patients. The proportion who were female was 77.3% in asymptomatic patients and 36.3% in symptomatic patients (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients with coexisting diseases was 4.5% in asymptomatic patients and 38.0% in symptomatic patients (p=0.002). The proportion of patients with increased CRP was 13.6% in the asymptomatic group and 61.1% in the symptomatic group (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients received antiviral therapy was 45.5% in the asymptomatic group and 97.9% in the symptomatic group (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients received oxygen therapy was 22.7% in the asymptomatic group and 99.1% in symptomatic patients (p < 0.001). By March 16, 2020, all patients were discharged from the hospital, and no symptoms had appeared in the asymptomatic patients during hospitalization. The median course of infection to discharge was 21.5 days in asymptomatic patients and 22 days in symptomatic patients. Conclusions: Asymptomatic patients are also infectious; relying only on clinical symptoms, blood cell tests, and radiology examination will lead to misdiagnosis of most patients, leading to the spread of the virus. Investigation of medical history is the best strategy for screening asymptomatic patients, especially young people, women, and people without coexisting disease, who are more likely to be asymptomatic when infected. Although the prognosis is good, isolation is critical for asymptomatic patients, and it is important not to end isolation early before a nucleic acid test turns negative.","output":"Clinical Characteristics of Asymptomatic Patients with SARS-CoV-2 in Zhejiang: An Imperceptible Source of Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY OBJECTIVE The present study aimed to investigate the role of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), an inflammation marker, complete blood count, and biochemical parameters in the diagnosis of COVID-19 METHODS A total of 80 patients who had been hospitalized in the internal medicine clinic were enrolled in the study The cases were allocated into two groups, i e , COVID (+) and (-), based on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction The demographic, clinical, and laboratory [NLR, platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), complete blood count, biochemistry, and serology] data of the patients were retrospectively obtained from the hospital data management system RESULTS NLR and fever levels were found to be higher in COVID-19 (+) cases (P=0 021, P=0 001, respectively) There was no difference between males and females with regard to COVID-19 positivity (P=0 527) Total bilirubin levels were found to be lower in COVID-19 (+) cases (P=0 040) When the ROC analysis was carried out for NLR in COVID-19 (+) cases, the AUC value was found to be 0 660 (P=0 021), sensitivity as 69 01 %, specificity as 65 40 %, LR+: 1 98 and LR- : 0 48, PPV: 80 43, and NPV: 50 00, when the NLR was &amp;#8805;2 4 The risk of COVID-19 was found to be 20 3-fold greater when NLR was &amp;#8805;2 4 in the logistic regression (P=0 007) CONCLUSION NLR is an independent predictor for the diagnosis of COVID-19 We also found that fever and total bilirubin measurements could be useful for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in this population RESUMO OBJETIVO O objetivo do presente estudo foi investigar o papel da raz?o neutrfilos/linfcitos (RNL), um marcador de inflamao, hemograma completo e parametros bioqumicos no diagnstico de COVID-19 MTODOS Um total de 80 pacientes internados na clnica mdica foram includos no estudo Os casos foram alocados em dois grupos, COVID (+) e (-), de acordo com a reao em cadeia da polimerase com transcrio reversa em tempo real Os dados demogrficos, clnicos e laboratoriais [NLR, relao plaquetas / linfcitos (PLR), hemograma completo, bioqumica e sorologia]) dos pacientes foram obtidos retrospectivamente no sistema de gerenciamento de dados hospitalares RESULTADOS Os nveis de NLR e febre foram maiores nos casos de COVID-19 (+) (P = 0,021, P = 0,001,respectivamente) N?o houve diferen?a entre homens e mulheres em relao  positividade para COVID-19 (P = 0,527) Os nveis totais de bilirrubina foram menores nos casos de COVID-19 (+) (P = 0,040) Quando a anlise ROC foi realizada para NLR nos casos COVID-19 (+), o valor da AUC foi de 0,660 (P = 0,021), sensibilidade 69,01%, especificidade 65,40%, LR +: 1,98 e LR-: 0,48 , PPV: 80,43 e NPV: 50,00 quando o NLR era&amp;gt;2,4 The risk of COVID-19 was found to be 20 3-fold greater when NLR was &amp;#8805;2 4 in the logistic regression (P=0 007) CONCLUS?O NLR  um preditor independente para o diagnstico de COVID-19 Tambm conclumos que aferies de febre e bilirrubina total podem ser teis para o diagnstico de COVID-19 nesta populao","output":"Can the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) have a role in the diagnosis of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19)?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neurological complications directly impact the lives of hundreds of millions of people worldwide.

Limited progress has been made since the formulation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Strategy in 2010. WHO is seeking to accelerate progress in implementing international efforts to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. The threat to global health posed by tobacco is well understood by policy communities and populations globally; by contrast alcohol is much less so, despite available evidence. THE COMPETITION FOR EPISTEMIC AUTHORITY: Global alcohol corporations have sought to become trusted sources of advice for policy makers and consumers, while continuing to grow their markets. Evidence-informed public health messaging faces formidable competition from transnational corporations as the worlds of corporate and political communications, social and mainstream media become increasingly linked, presenting new opportunities for corporate actors to shape global health governance. Alcohol messaging that uses means of persuasion tied to industry agendas does not tell a clear story about commercial determinants of health, and does not contribute to health improvement. On the contrary, the basic tenets of an evidence-informed population-based approach are denied and the policy measures supported by high quality evidence are being opposed, because they are inimical to commercial interests. A David and Goliath metaphor for this state of affairs, which seems to fit at first glance, may unwittingly reinforce the status quo. CONCLUSION: Public opinion on alcohol and policy issues varies across time and place and can be influenced by dedicated public health interventions. Alcohol marketing dominates peoples thinking about alcohol because we currently allow this to happen. Greater ambition is needed in developing countermarketing and other interventions to promote evidence-informed ideas with the public. Alcohol policies need to be further developed, and implemented more widely, in order to arrest the growing burden of alcohol harms across the world.","output":"Alcohol marketing versus public health: David and Goliath?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dealing with the COVID-19 coronavirus requires a coordinated transnational effort.

The resulting analyses identified patterns of trade consistent with growing populations, increasing incomes and changing diets in developing countries. The analyses also pointed to slow expansion of livestock production, and the impacts of countries' disease status on livestock trade.

Cholesterol plays an important role in the infection and prognosis of SARS-CoV-2, and the study of its mechanism is of great significance not only for the treatment of COVID-19 but also for research on generic antiviral drugs. Observations: Cholesterol promotes the development of atherosclerosis by activating NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), and the resulting inflammatory environment indirectly contributes to COVID-19 infection and subsequent deterioration. In in vitro studies, membrane cholesterol increased the number of viral entry sites on the host cell membrane and the number of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the membrane fusion site. Previous studies have shown that the fusion protein of the virus interacts with cholesterol, and the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 also requires cholesterol to enter the host cells. Cholesterol in blood interacts with the spike protein to promote the entry of spike cells, wherein the scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) plays an important role. Because of the cardiovascular protective effects of lipid-lowering therapy and the additional anti-inflammatory effects of lipid-lowering drugs, it is currently recommended to continue lipid-lowering therapy for patients with COVID-19, but the safety of extremely low LDL-C is questionable. Conclusions and Relevance: Cholesterol can indirectly increase the susceptibility of patients to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the risk of death from COVID-19, which are mediated by NLRP3 and atherosclerotic plaques, respectively.

METHODS: We used 2019 and 2020 Center for Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS) fee-for-service (FFS) claims data to compare arthroplasty volumes prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared overall arthroplasty utilization rates between 2019 and 2020 and then sought to determine the effect of race and COVID-19, both independently and combined. RESULTS: There was a decrease in primary TKA (-28%), primary THA (-14%), primary THA for fracture (-2%) and revision arthroplasty (-14%) utilization between 2019 and 2020. The highest decrease in overall arthroplasty utilization was in the Hispanic population (34% decrease versus 19% decrease in White population). We found that a non-White patient was 39.9% (p < 0.001) less likely to receive a TJA prior to COVID-19.

General and Internal Medicine OBJECTIVE: Unusual clinical course BACKGROUND: The novel COVID-19 disease has infected more than 2 million people worldwide, causing more than 120 000 deaths. While the disease is known to primarily affect the respiratory system, gastrointestinal manifestations can also occur. However, little is known about the development of acute pancreatitis in COVID-19. The present report highlights a patient with no precipitating risk factors for pancreatitis who presented with recurring acute pancreatitis following the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CASE REPORT: An otherwise healthy 38-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with fever and epigastric pain. Laboratory testing revealed a lipase level of 10 255 ukat/L. An abdominal ultrasound showed no gallstones. After ruling out the possible causes of acute pancreatitis, a diagnosis of idiopathic acute pancreatitis was made. He received conservative management and was discharged home after being medically stabilized. Of note, the patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection at a local testing center 1 week prior to presenting to the ED. One week following the discharge, the patient returned with recurrent severe epigastric pain. Laboratory testing showed a lipase level of 20 320 ukat/L. An abdominal CT revealed acute pancreatitis. Further workups, including abdominal ultrasound, hepatitis serology, and immunoglobulin G for autoimmune pancreatitis, were unrevealing. Repeated SARS-CoV-2 testing produced positive results. CONCLUSIONS: The temporal relationship between clinical presentation of acute pancreatitis and SARS-CoV-2 infection in this patient with no precipitating risk factors for pancreatitis suggests COVID-19-associated acute pancreatitis.

Pathogenic LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases and blocks ciliogenesis. Thus, defining novel phospho-Rab interacting partners is critical to our understanding of the molecular basis of LRRK2 pathogenesis. RILPL2 binds with strong preference to LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab8A and Rab10. RILPL2 is a binding partner of the motor protein and Rab effector, Myosin Va. We show here that the globular tail domain of Myosin Va also contains a high affinity binding site for LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab10, and certain tissue-specific Myosin Va isoforms strongly prefer to bind phosphorylated Rab10. In the presence of pathogenic LRRK2, RILPL2 relocalizes to the peri-centriolar region in a phosphoRab10- and Myosin Va-dependent manner. In the absence of phosphoRab10, expression of RILPL2 or depletion of Myosin Va increase centriolar RILPL2 levels, and either condition is sufficient to block ciliogenesis in RPE cells. These experiments show that LRRK2 generated phosphoRab10 dramatically redistributes Myosin Va-RILPL2 complexes to the mother centriole, which may sequester Myosin Va and RILPL2 in a manner that blocks their normal roles in ciliogenesis.","output":"LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab10 sequesters Myosin Va with RILPL2 during ciliogenesis blockade"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was reported in several studies characterized by milder clinical course, benign disease, and peculiar epidemiologic patterns among pediatric patients compared to adults disease. However, other studies indicated that critical cases also exist and are associated with preexisting cardiopulmonary comorbidities and concurrent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. METHODS: The study period was six months, MayCOctober 2020. Data on demographics, clinical manifestations, laboratory abnormalities were extracted from the patients hospital records. During the study period, 644 pediatric patients attended the hospital. They were all screened for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR. Only the confirmed positive patients were included in the subsequent study analysis. They were hospitalized either in the general pediatric wards (GPW) or pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). RESULTS: Out of the total patients screened, 79 (12.3%) children were confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. All the confirmed COVID-19 patients were either admitted to the general pediatric wards (58; 73.4%) or PICU (21; 26.6%). The admission diagnoses for these children were acute gastroenteritis (22.85%), acute pneumonia (19%), clinical sepsis (17.7%), and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (10.1%). A significantly higher percentage of the PICU admitted patients showed shortness of breath (SOB) (P= 0.016). Respiratory insufficiencies, prematurity, and congenital heart diseases are the most reported comorbid conditions among the admitted children. The oxygen saturation was significantly lower among PICU patients than those in GPW (P=0.001). The total hospital stays differ significantly between the two groups, which were ten days for the PICU group compared to 4.5 days for the GPW group with a statistical significance noted (P= 0.001). CONCLUSION: Despite the observable variations in the clinical and laboratory findings among the hospitalized pediatric COVID-19 patients, no serious consequences among all patients were observed. The history of SOB and the initial oxygen saturation level were significantly associated with PICU admissions.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Laboratory Abnormalities of Hospitalized and Critically Ill Children with Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Retrospective Study from Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we are going to explore the effect of mobile Internet technology in health management for the heart failure patients with cardiac rehabilitation.

Although the epidemiology and pathogenicity of coronaviruses have gained substantial attention, little is known about bovine coronavirus in cattle, which possesses a close relationship with human coronavirus. Bovine torovirus (BToV) is a newly identified relevant pathogen associated with cattle diarrhoea and respiratory diseases, and its epidemiology in the Chinese cattle industry remains unknown. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 461 diarrhoeic faecal samples were collected from 38 different farms in three intensive cattle farming regions and analysed. Our results demonstrated that BToV is present in China, with a low prevalence rate of 1.74% (8/461). The full-length spike genes were further cloned from eight clinical samples (five farms in Henan Province). Phylogenetic analysis showed that two different subclades of BToV strains are circulating in China.

Currently there is no literature available regarding the development of pneumothorax during SARS-CoV-2 infection neither the characteristics nor clinical outcomes of these patients. We present a single center review of 11 subjects who developed PTX during the course of hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2. METHOD(S): Retrospective medical records review of patients diagnosed with PTX and SARS-CoV-2 between January 1, 2020 and May 8, 2020 at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA. Patients were identified from our institutional database (Clinical Query 2). Demographics, baseline comorbidities, hospital stay, ICU stay, interventions and crude mortality are presented. RESULT(S): A total of 11 inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 and PTX were included (mean age 66.45 years [SD 13.28];81.82% [n=9] males;72.73% PTX on the right side). The mean hospital stay until discharge or death was 25.91 days (SD 11.61), with a mean time from admission to PTX of 13.81 days (SD 12.27). Nine (81.82%) of PTX were secondary spontaneous and 2 (18.18%) iatrogenic. The most common comorbid conditions found were hypertension (54.55%) followed by hyperlipidemia (45.45%), malignancy (27.27%) and congestive heart failure (27.27%). Nine (81.81%) subjects were on the ICU when the event occurred with a mean ICU stay of 15.11 days (SD 8.89). Seven (63.64%) patients were under mechanical ventilation with a mean intubation time of 19.86 days (SD 10.17). Ten (90.91%) subjects required chest tube insertion with 54.54% (n=6) requiring chest tube size > 14 Fr. Two (18.18%) patients ended up having tracheostomy and 5 (45.45%) died before discharge.

Even with its importance, very limited biophysical studies are available on the N protein because of its high level of disorder, high propensity for aggregation, and high susceptibility for autoproteolysis. Here, we successfully prepare the N protein and a 1000-nucleotide fragment of viral RNA in large quantities and purity suitable for biophysical studies. A combination of biophysical and biochemical techniques demonstrates that the N protein is partially disordered and consists of an independently folded RNA-binding domain and a dimerization domain, flanked by disordered linkers. The protein assembles as a tight dimer with a dimerization constant of sub-micromolar but can also form transient interactions with other N proteins, facilitating larger oligomers. NMR studies on the a100-kDa dimeric protein identify a specific domain that binds 1-1000-nt RNA and show that the N-RNA complex remains highly disordered. Analytical ultracentrifugation, isothermal titration calorimetry, multiangle light scattering, and cross-linking experiments identify a heterogeneous mixture of complexes with a core corresponding to at least 70 dimers of N bound to 1-1000 RNA.

Meta-analysis offers the opportunity to confirm and expand our knowledge by combining and studying at one time a vast set of independent studies creating large datasets with increased statistical power. In this study, we performed two meta-analyses of porcine transcriptomic data: i) scrutinized the global immune response to different challenges, and ii) determined the specific response to Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) infection. To gain an in-depth knowledge of the pig response to PRRSV infection, we used an original approach comparing and eliminating the common genes from both meta-analyses in order to identify genes and pathways specifically involved in the PRRSV immune response. The software Pointillist was used to cope with the highly disparate data, circumventing the biases generated by the specific responses linked to single studies. Next, we used the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) software to survey the canonical pathways, biological functions and transcription factors found to be significantly involved in the pig immune response. We used 779 chips corresponding to 29 datasets for the pig global immune response and 279 chips obtained from 6 datasets for the pig response to PRRSV infection, respectively. RESULTS: The pig global immune response analysis showed interconnected canonical pathways involved in the regulation of translation and mitochondrial energy metabolism. Biological functions revealed in this meta-analysis were centred around translation regulation, which included protein synthesis, RNA-post transcriptional gene expression and cellular growth and proliferation. Furthermore, the oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondria dysfunctions, associated with stress signalling, were highly regulated. Transcription factors such as MYCN, MYC and NFE2L2 were found in this analysis to be potentially involved in the regulation of the immune response. The host specific response to PRRSV infection engendered the activation of well-defined canonical pathways in response to pathogen challenge such as TREM1, toll-like receptor and hyper-cytokinemia/ hyper-chemokinemia signalling. Furthermore, this analysis brought forth the central role of the crosstalk between innate and adaptive immune response and the regulation of anti-inflammatory response. The most significant transcription factor potentially involved in this analysis was HMGB1, which is required for the innate recognition of viral nucleic acids. Other transcription factors like interferon regulatory factors IRF1, IRF3, IRF5 and IRF8 were also involved in the pig specific response to PRRSV infection. CONCLUSIONS: This work reveals key genes, canonical pathways and biological functions involved in the pig global immune response to diverse challenges, including PRRSV infection.

This study was carried out in a watershed located in a low rainfall (400-600 mm) region of western India. The SWAT model was calibrated using surface runoff, soil loss and reservoir storage levels, between the year 2000 and 2006. The investigation indicated that the various AWM interventions increased groundwater recharge from 30 mm/year to 80 mm/year and reduced surface runoff from 250 mm/year to 100 mm/year. The intervention structures were refilled 2 to 3 times during the monsoon season depending on rainfall intensity and duration. The interventions have the advantage of building a resilient system by enhancing groundwater availability even in dry years, stimulating crop intensification and protecting the landscape from severe erosion. The results indicate that soil erosion has been reduced by more than 75% compared to the non-intervention situation. Moreover, the AWM interventions led to the cultivation of 100-150 ha of fallow land with high value crops (horticulture, vegetables and fodder). Household income increased by several-folds compared to the non-intervention situation. The study showed about 50% reduction in downstream water availability, which could be a major concern. However, there are a number of ecosystem trade-offs such as improved base flow to the stream and reduction in soil loss that should be considered.

We estimated the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection for staff and pupils over the period August-December 2020, dependent on measures of recent exposure to known cases linked to their educational settings. Results: The total number of cases in a school was not associated with a subsequent increase in the risk of testing positive (Staff OR per case 0.92, 95%CI 0.85, 1.00; Pupils OR per case 0.98, 95%CI 0.93, 1.02). Amongst pupils, the number of recent cases within the same year group was significantly associated with subsequent increased risk of testing positive (OR per case 1.12, 95%CI 1.08 - 1.15).

The objective of this study was to assess the surge capacity of the Kenyan of the Kenyan health system in terms of general hospital and ICU beds in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We assumed that 2% of the Kenyan population get symptomatic infection by SARS-Cov-2 based on modelled estimates for Kenya and determined the health system surge capacity for COVID-19 under three transmission curve scenarios, 6, 12, and 18 months. We estimated four measures of hospital surge capacity namely: 1) hospital bed surge capacity 2) ICU bed surge capacity 3) Hospital bed tipping point, and 5) ICU bed tipping point. We computed this nationally and for all the 47 county governments. RESULTS: The capacity of Kenyan hospitals to absorb increases in caseload due to COVID-19 is constrained by the availability of oxygen, with only 58% of hospital beds in hospitals with oxygen supply. There is substantial variation in hospital bed surge capacity across counties. For example, under the 6 months transmission scenario, the percentage of available general hospital beds that would be taken up by COVID-19 cases varied from 12% Tharaka Nithi county, to 145% in Trans Nzoia county. Kenya faces substantial gaps in ICU beds and ventilator capacity. Only 22 out of the 47 counties have at least 1 ICU unit. Kenya will need an additional 1,511 ICU beds and 1,609 ventilators (6 months transmission curve) to 374 ICU beds and 472 ventilators (18 months transmission curve) to absorb caseloads due to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Significant gaps exist in Kenyas capacity for hospitals to accommodate a potential surge in caseload due to COVID-19. Alongside efforts to slow and supress the transmission of the infection, the Kenyan government will need to implement adaptive measures and additional investments to expand the hospital surge capacity for COVID-19. Additional investments will however need to be strategically prioritized to focus on strengthening essential services first, such as oxygen availability before higher cost investments such as ICU beds and ventilators.","output":"Assessing the hospital surge capacity of the Kenyan health system in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The epidemiology of psychiatric symptoms among COVID-19 patients is poorly characterized.

METHODS Nine patients with colorectal liver metastases treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and operated with ALPPS were studied with hepatobiliary scintigraphy, computed tomography, indocyanine green clearance test, and serum liver function tests. A comparison between liver volume and function was conducted. RESULTS The preoperative FLR volume of 19.5% underestimated the preoperative FLR function of 25.3% (p = 0.011). The increase in FLR volume exceeded the increase in function at day 6 after stage 1 (FLR volume increase 56.7% versus FLR function increase 28.2%, p = 0.021), meaning that the increase in function was 50% of the increase in volume. After stage 2, functional increase exceeded the volume increase, resulting in similar values 28 days after stage 2. CONCLUSIONS In the inter-stage period of ALPPS, the high volume increase is not paralleled by a corresponding functional increase. This may in part explain the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with ALPPS.

It introduces a deep-based learning method called DSC (deep sentiment classifier) to determine whether or not to recommend the reviewed product thoroughly. Our suggested method also investigates the effect sizes of the feedback, such as positives, negatives, and neutrals. We used the women's clothing review dataset containing 22,642 records after preprocessing of the results. Experimental studies show that the recommendations are an excellent positive sentiment indicator. In comparison, ratings become fuzzy performance metrics in product reviews. The 10-fold cross-validation analysis shows that the recommended form has the top F1 score (93.56%) in the sentimental classification on average and the recommended classification (88.32%) on average. A comparative description of other classifiers focused on machine learning, for example, KNN, random forest, logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine multilayer perceptron, and na?ve Bayes, also demonstrates that DSC gives the best possible result. We have tested DSC on the dataset IMDB (Internet Video Database), which includes the sentiment of the 50,000 movie reviews (25000 for training and 25000 for testing).

METHODS We identified 508 cases of limited resection (12.8%) and examined their clinicopathological features. Using Cox regression analysis, we examined the significant prognostic factors for recurrence of limited resection. Finally, we conducted a histopathological evaluation of tumor STAS. RESULTS Multivariate Cox analysis showed that the risk for local recurrence was significantly associated with STAS (hazard ratio = 12.24, p = 0.001) and a tumor margin less than 1.0 cm (hazard ratio = 6.36, p = 0.02). However, the presence of tumor STAS was not significantly associated with distant recurrence (p = 0.98). This lack of association of STAS with distant recurrence may be due to the small number of distant recurrences. In all, 76 cases (15.0%) (60 adenocarcinomas, nine squamous cell carcinomas, and seven others) were positive for STAS. The morphological STAS patterns were 12 single cells, 45 small cell clusters, and 19 large nests. There was no significant relationship between the recurrence rate and morphological STAS pattern. The STAS-positive group was associated with the presence of micropapillary (p = 0.002) and/or solid components (p = 0.008) in patients with adenocarcinoma and with lymphovascular and pleural invasion (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The presence of STAS and tumor margins less than 1.0 cm are significant risk factors for local recurrence in early-stage lung cancer after limited resection. Thus, the presence of tumor STAS might be a pathological prognostic factor for patients with lung cancer who have undergone limited resection. However, the pathological and molecular significance of STAS remain to be clarified.","output":"Prognostic Impact of Margin Distance and Tumor Spread Through Air Spaces in Limited Resection for Primary Lung Cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patient: Male, 29-year-old Final Diagnosis: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ? COVID-19 ?multi organ failure/septic shock ? pneumothorax Symptoms: Cough ? dyspnea ? fatigue ? myalgia Medication: Clinical Procedure: Mechanical ventilation ? thoracentesis Specialty: Critical Care Medicine OBJECTIVE: Unknown ethiology BACKGROUND: COVID-19 patients that develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) CARDS behave differently compared to patients with classic forms of ARDS. Recently 2 CARDS phenotypes have been described, Type L and Type H. Most patients stabilize at the milder form, Type L, while an unknown subset progress to Type H, resembling full-blown ARDS. If uncorrected, phenotypic conversion can induce a rapid downward spiral towards progressive lung injury, vasoplegia, and pulmonary shrinkage, risking ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) known as the VILI vortex. No cases of in-hospital phenotypic conversion have been reported, while ventilation strategies in these patients differ from the lung-protective approaches seen in classic ARDS. CASE REPORT: A 29-year old male was admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by severe ARDS, multi-organ failure, cytokine release syndrome, and coagulopathy during his admission. He initially resembled CARDS Type L case, although refractory hypoxemia, fevers, and a high viral burden prompted conversion to Type H within 8 days. Despite ventilation strategies, neuromuscular blockade, inhalation therapy, and vitamin C, he remained asynchronous to the ventilator with volumes and pressures beyond accepted thresholds, eventually developing a fatal tension pneumothorax. CONCLUSIONS: Patients that convert to Type H can quickly enter a spiral of hypoxemia, shunting, and dead-space ventilation towards full-blown ARDS. Understanding its nuances is vital to interrupting phenotypic conversion and entry into VILI vortex. Tension pneumothorax represents a poor outcome in patients with CARDS. Further research into monitoring lung dynamics, modifying ventilation strategies, and understanding response to various modes of ventilation in CARDS are required to mitigate these adverse outcomes.","output":"A 29-Year-Old Male with a Fatal Case of COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (CARDS) and Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic is happening complicatedly all over the world, affecting the health and daily life of the people and negatively affecting the socio-economy of many countries.

However, whether optimistic bias could vary across age and culture is unknown. The present study aims to investigate: 1) whether individuals exhibit optimistic bias in the context of COVID-19 pandemic; 2) and whether age and culture would moderate such bias. METHOD: 1051 participants recruited from China, Israel and the US took the online survey. Risk perceptions consists of three questions: estimating the infected probability of different social distance groups (i.e., self, close others, and non-close others), the days that it would take for the number of new infections to decrease to zero and the trend of infections in regions of different geographical distances (i.e., local place, other places inside participants' country and other countries). Participants in China and the US also reported their personal communal values measured by Schwartz's Value Survey. RESULTS: Results from HLM generally confirmed that 1) all participants exhibited optimistic bias to some extent, and 2) with age, Chinese participants had a higher level of optimistic bias than Israeli and US participants. Compared to their younger counterparts, older Chinese are more likely to believe that local communities are at lower risk of COVID-19 than other countries. DISCUSSION: These findings support the hypothesis that age differences in risk perceptions might be influenced by cultural context. Further analysis indicated that such cultural and age variations in optimistic bias were likely to be driven by age-related increase in internalized cultural values.","output":"Are older adults more optimistic?

To associate those two screenings, in order to respond to these clinical needs seems of actual interest. METHODS A prospective cohort study was set-up in an urban area of the Naples province, in which a contemporary screening for HCVAb and SARS-Cov-2-Ab rapid blood tests was performed. RESULTS Of the 3556 eligible subjects,2740(77.05%) participated.Of them,1.4% resulted SARS-Cov2-positive, none resulting positive for SARS-Cov2-RNA, whereas 1.5% were HCVAb-positive and 0.18% HCVRNA-positive.

While specific disease-based outcomes may vary between migrant group and location, general epidemiological principles may be applied to any situation where numbers of individuals move between differences in disease prevalence. Traditionally, migration health activities have been designed for national application and lack an integrated international perspective. Present and future health challenges related to migration may be more effectively addressed through collaborative global undertakings. This paper reviews the epidemiological relationships resulting from health disparities bridged by migration and describes the growing role of migration and population mobility in global disease epidemiology. The implications for national and international health policy and program planning are presented.","output":"The basic principles of migration health: Population mobility and gaps in disease prevalence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Idiopathic congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV) is a relatively common complex deformity of the foot that can be successfully managed by the Ponseti method. The purpose of this study was to see if the latter can be effectively administered by non-medical specialists outside a specialist or teaching hospital setting. METHOD Retrospective review of 24 children (39 feet) with idiopathic congenital talipes equinovarus managed by a physiotherapist-led service in a district general hospital. RESULTS The median Pirani score at presentation was 4.5 (mean 4.2, range 1.5-6). The median Pirani score for feet requiring tenotomy was 6 (4.5-6), whereas feet not requiring tenotomy had a median Pirani score of 2.5 (1.5-5). A total of 18 feet (46%) underwent an Achilles tenotomy. Foot correction was achieved with an average of 3.4 (2-6) cast changes in the non-tenotomy group, and an average of 7.5 (5-13) in the tenotomy group. Successful initial correction of the deformity was achieved in 37 (95%) of the feet studied. One patient (2 feet, 5%) failed local conservative management, requiring tertiary referral. Two children (2 feet) have relapsed, requiring further serial casting. No children required open surgical release. Follow-up was for a mean of 31 months (17-50).

All around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic affects different dimensions of SCs, including but not limited to finance, lead time, demand changes, and production performance. There is an urgent need to respond to this grand challenge. The catastrophic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted scholars to develop innovative SC disruption management strategies and disseminate them via numerous scientific articles. However, there is still a lack of systematic literature survey studies that aim to identify promising SC disruption management strategies through the bibliometric, network, and thematic analyses. In order to address this drawback, this study presents a set of up-to-date bibliometric, network, and thematic analyses to identify the influential contributors, main research streams, and disruption management strategies related to the SC performance under the COVID-19 settings. The conducted analyses reveal that resilience and sustainability are the primary SC topics. Furthermore, the major research themes are found to be food, health-related SCs, and technology-aided tools (e.g., artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT), and blockchains). Various disruption management strategies focusing on resilience and sustainability themes are extracted from the most influential studies that were identified as a part of this work.

Thus, in this setting, extensive experiences with this type of health care delivery have already been gathered, while in other settings this is just beginning. However, the quality of telemedical care on offshore installations is rarely reported yet. The objective of this review was to explore published literature with regards to the following questions: Have any Quality Indicators (QIs) been published for measuring the quality of telemedical care on offshore installations or are there identifiable items that could be used as such QIs? METHODS We conducted a comprehensive Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) of the published literature using the databases MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science (Core Collection), and Google Scholar.

We aim to determine any beneficial or detrimental short-term effects of these changes. METHODS All patients referred to fracture clinic from the emergency department during the period March 24, 2020 to May 10, 2020 (national lockdown) were assessed for number of face to face and telephone appointments, number of radiographs performed, time to discharge, use of a removable cast, any cast complications, other complications, reattendance or re-referral after discharge. They were compared with patients referred in the same period in 2019. Follow-up was to 6 months for every patient. RESULTS In 2019, 240 patients were reviewed and 110 in 2020. Changes in practice resulted in significant differences in the number of face to face appointments per patient [2 (1 to 6) 2019 vs. 1 (0 to 5) 2020 (P<0.00001)] and increase in telephone appointments [0 (0 to 1) 2019 vs. 1 (0 to 2) 2020]. Number of radiographs per patient [1 (1 to 7) 2019 vs. 1 (1 to ) 2020 (P=0.0178)] and time to discharge [29 d (0 to 483) 2019 vs. 16 d (0 to 216) 2020 (P<0.00001)] also reduced significantly. Use of a self-removable casting technique increased significantly (2.4% of casts in 2019 vs. 91.8% in 2020 (P<0.00001). There were no significant differences in complications related to cast or otherwise, unplanned attendance or reattendance after discharge. Use of self-removable casts for supracondylar fractures and for simple injuries (including distal radius, forearm, Toddler's, and ankle fractures) also demonstrated no change in complication rate. Significant potential cost savings of >185 000 per annum could be demonstrated through clinic appointment and cast removal reductions. DISCUSSION Changes to the normal management of pediatric orthopaedic trauma brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic have been demonstrated to be safe in the short term with no increase in complications demonstrated. Potential cost savings are possible both to the health care provider and also to the patient because of reduced hospital attendance.

METHODS Development and validation of the pCMT-QOL patient-reported outcome measure was iterative, involving identifying relevant domains, item pool generation, prospective pilot testing and clinical assessments, structured focus-group interviews, and psychometric testing. Testing was conducted in children with CMT seen at participating sites from the USA, United Kingdom, and Australia. RESULTS We conducted systematic literature reviews and analysis of generic QOL measures to identify six domains relevant to QOL in children with CMT. 60 items corresponding to those domains were developed de novo, or identified from literature review and CMT-specific modification of items from the pediatric Neuro-QOL measures. The draft version underwent prospective feasibility and face content validity assessments to develop a working version of the pCMT-QOL measure. From 2010-2016, the pCMT-QOL working version was administered to 398 children ages 8-18 seen at the participating study sites of the Inherited Neuropathies Consortium. The resulting data underwent rigorous psychometric analysis, including factor analysis, test-retest reliability, internal consistency, convergent validity, IRT analysis, and longitudinal analysis, to develop the final pCMT-QOL patient-reported outcome measure. INTERPRETATION The pCMT-QOL patient-reported outcome measure is a reliable, valid, and sensitive measure of health-related QOL for children with CMT. This article is protected by copyright.

Typical abnormal findings in chest computed tomography (CT) images of COVID-19 patients are ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation, which signify the extent of damage caused to the lungs. The manual annotation of these abnormalities for severity analysis is complex, tedious, and time-consuming. This motivated us to develop a vision-based analysis framework for automated segmentation of lung abnormalities. We proposed a deep learning framework, namely LwMLA-NET Lightweight Multi-Level Attention-based NETwork, to segment GGO and consolidation. The LwMLA-NET is based on an encoderCdecoder architecture where depth-wise separable convolutions are employed at each stage, making it a light-weighted framework that significantly reduces the computational cost. Another distinguishable module in LwMLA-NET is the multilevel attention (MLA) mechanism that focuses on dominant and relevant features and avoids propagation of insignificant features from the encoder to the decoder, thereby aiding faster optimization. Integrating the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module in the bottleneck helps to handle scale variations. The LwMLA-NET was evaluated on two databasesMedSeg and Radiopediaand obtained F1-scores of 76.7% and 73.1%, respectively. The experimental evaluation justifies that LwMLA-NET outperforms other state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks like Attention U-Net, PSP-Net, Cople-Net, Inf-Net, and Mobile-Net V2 in terms of segmentation performance and has an acceptable generalization capability. Moreover, our team, LwMLA-NET-Team-KDD-JU, participated in Kaggles COVID-19 CT Images Segmentation open challenge. The performance was evaluated on a separate test set, and we obtained fourth rank on the leaderboard among 40 teams with an F1-score of 71.196%.","output":"LwMLA-NET: A Lightweight Multi-Level Attention-Based NETwork for Segmentation of COVID-19 Lungs Abnormalities From CT Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated an unprecedented education crisis, causing severe disruption to global education systems.

METHODS: The WHO\\\\ICTRP database was searched for registers of RCTs evaluating HQ or chloroquine, alone or in combinations, compared with other treatments for patients diagnosed with COVID\\\\19. The final search was performed on April 8th, 2020. RESULTS: Among 51 registered RCTs (median sample size 262; IQR: 100, 520), 34 (67%) reported a clinical outcome, 12 (24%) a surrogate outcome, and five (10%) a combination of clinical and surrogate outcomes as primary endpoints.

We aimed to assess its impact on mental health during the early phase by comparing pandemic with prepandemic data and to identify potential risk and protective factors. METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analyses, we systematically searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science from January 1, 2019 to May 29, 2020, and screened reference lists of included studies. In addition, we searched PubMed and PsycINFO for prepandemic comparative data. Survey studies assessing mental burden by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the general population, healthcare workers, or any patients (eg, COVID-19 patients), with a broad range of eligible mental health outcomes, and matching studies evaluating prepandemic comparative data in the same population (if available) were included. We used multilevel meta-analyses for main, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses, focusing on (perceived) stress, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and sleep-related symptoms as primary outcomes. RESULTS: Of 2429 records retrieved, 104 were included in the review (n = 208,261 participants), 43 in the meta-analysis (n = 71,613 participants). While symptoms of anxiety (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.40; 95% CI 0.15C0.65) and depression (SMD 0.67; 95% CI 0.07C1.27) were increased in the general population during the early phase of the pandemic compared with prepandemic conditions, mental burden was not increased in patients as well as healthcare workers, irrespective of COVID-19 patient contact. Specific outcome measures (eg, Patient Health Questionnaire) and older comparative data (published 5 years ago) were associated with increased mental burden. Across the three population groups, existing mental disorders, female sex, and concerns about getting infected were repeatedly reported as risk factors, while older age, a good economic situation, and education were protective. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis paints a more differentiated picture of the mental health consequences in pandemic situations than previous reviews. High-quality, representative surveys, high granular longitudinal studies, and more research on protective factors are required to better understand the psychological impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and to help design effective preventive measures and interventions that are tailored to the needs of specific population groups.

In this paper we report on the evolution of a specific polyclonal aptamer library by the fluorescence based FluCell-SELEX directed against whole cells of P. distasonis that specifically and efficiently binds and labels P. distasonis. The aptamer library showed high binding affinity and was suited to quantitatively discriminate P. distasonis from other prominent gut bacteria also in mixtures.

Few studies have evaluated the levels of chemokines in HMFD children with EV71-related encephalitis. In the present study, we evaluated the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the chemokines IL-8, RANTES, MIG, MCP-1 and IP-10 in 99 children with EV71-related encephalitis and 22 children with febrile convulsion (FC). We found that the concentrations of IL-8, RANTES, MIG and IP-10 were significantly higher in HFMD children with encephalitis compared to patients with FC. Additionally, these four chemokines were dramatically reduced during convalescence. Inversely, the level of MCP-1 was lower in encephalitis patients than FC patients and was not significantly reduced during convalescence. Additionally, MIG was strongly correlated with IP-10 in encephalitis patients. Furthermore, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of CSF MIG and IP-10 in distinguishing encephalitis from FC were 0.869 and 0.876, and the corresponding sensitivities/specificities were 67.7%/100.0% and 67.7%/95.5%, respectively.

More than 300 million cases and over 5 million deaths later, we continue battling the first real pandemic of the 21st century. SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly, reaching most countries within the first half of 2020, and New Zealand was not an exception. Here, we describe the first isolation and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 variants during the initial virus outbreak in New Zealand. Patient-derived nasopharyngeal samples were used to inoculate Vero cells and, three to four days later, a cytopathic effect was observed in seven viral cultures. Viral growth kinetics was characterized using Vero and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. The identity of the viruses was verified by RT-qPCR, Western blot, indirect immunofluorescence assays, and electron microscopy. Whole-genome sequences were analyzed using two different yet complementary deep sequencing platforms (MiSeq/Illumina and Ion PGM?/Ion Torrent?), classifying the viruses as SARS-CoV-2 B.55, B.31, B.1, or B.1.369 based on the Pango Lineage nomenclature. All seven SARS-CoV-2 isolates were susceptible to remdesivir (EC(50) values from 0.83 to 2.42 M) and -D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (molnupiravir, EC(50) values from 0.96 to 1.15 M) but not to favipiravir (>10 M). Interestingly, four SARS-CoV-2 isolates, carrying the D614G substitution originally associated with increased transmissibility, were more susceptible (2.4-fold) to a commercial monoclonal antibody targeting the spike glycoprotein than the wild-type viruses. Altogether, this seminal work allowed for early access to SARS-CoV-2 isolates in New Zealand, paving the way for numerous clinical and scientific research projects in the country, including the development and validation of diagnostic assays, antiviral strategies, and a national COVID-19 vaccine development program.","output":"Characterization of the First SARS-CoV-2 Isolates from Aotearoa New Zealand as Part of a Rapid Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) is well-adapted to the desert environment with the ability to tolerate increased internal body temperatures rising daily to 41C42C during extreme hot. This study was undertaken to assess whether in vitro incubation of camel blood at 41C, simulating conditions of heat stress, differently alters cell vitality, phenotype, and function of leukocytes, compared to incubation at 37C (normothermia). Using flow cytometry, the cell vitality (necrosis and apoptosis), the expression of several cell markers and adhesion molecules, and the antimicrobial functions of camel leukocytes were analyzed in vitro. The fraction of apoptotic cells within the granulocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes increased significantly after incubation of camel whole blood at 41C for 4 h. The higher increase in apoptotic granulocytes and monocytes compared to lymphocytes suggests higher resistance of camel lymphocytes to heat stress. Functionally, incubation of camel blood at 41C for 4 h enhanced the phagocytosis and ROS production activities of camel neutrophils and monocytes toward S. aureus. Monocytes from camel blood incubated at 41C for 4 h significantly decreased their expression level of MHC class II molecules with no change in the abundance of CD163, resulting in a CD163(high) MHC-II(low) M2-like macrophage phenotype. In addition, heat stress treatment showed an inhibitory effect on the LPS-induced changes in camel monocytes phenotype. Furthermore, in vitro incubation of camel blood at 41C reduced the expression of the cell adhesion molecules CD18 and CD11a on neutrophils and monocytes. Collectively, the present study identified some heat-stress-induced phenotypic and functional alterations in camel blood leukocytes, providing a paradigm for comparative immunology in the large animals. The clinical relevance of the observed changes in camel leukocytes for the adaptation of the camel immune response to heat stress conditions needs further in vitro and in vivo studies.","output":"Changes in Cell Vitality, Phenotype, and Function of Dromedary Camel Leukocytes After Whole Blood Exposure to Heat Stress in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cranioplasty is a relatively simple neurosurgical procedure, and common complications of cranioplasty include dural tears, CSF leakage, infection, epilepsy, epidural hematoma and bone flap resorption. Intracerebral hemorrhage as a complication of cranioplasty is rare, and it is often fatal. The report describes one case of delayed severe intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage after an uneventful cranioplasty. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 29-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a traumatic left frontotemporoparietal acute subdural hematoma, an emergency decompressive craniectomy with clot removal was performed. Four months after the surgery, cranioplasty was performed with a titanium mesh, the surgery was uneventful. Six hours after the operation, a CT scan demonstrated no bleeding or edema. In the following 2 days after cranioplasty, the patient did not have any neurological deficits, normal blood pressure was recorded every day, no trauma occurred, and routine laboratory test results were within normal limits. However, on the third day after cranioplasty, the patient suffered a sudden severe headache while playing games on his mobile phone, and then rapidly fell into deep coma; both pupils were fixed and dilated at 5 mm with no response to light. An immediate CT scan revealed a massive intracerebral hematoma and intraventricular hematoma on the left side, and the midline shifted to the right side. Therefore, an ipsilateral decompressive craniectomy was performed with evacuation of the hematoma; the obvious bleeding point was not identified, and no obvious vascular abnormalities were found during the operation. A CT scan on day 3 after reoperation revealed successful decompression, and CT angiography showed no vascular abnormalities. Despite all treatment measures, the patient did not regain consciousness, his neurological situation did not improve after the operation, and the patient lived in a vegetative state. CONCLUSION: Although intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage after cranioplasty is extremely rare, it is often fatal. Aside from hyperperfusion and cerebral autoregulation dysfunction, traction injuries to the fragile vessels due to posttraumatic angiogenesis may also be one of the key factors of complications after cranioplasty.","output":"One case report of delayed severe intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage after cranioplasty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Image medical semantic segmentation has been employed in various areas, including medical imaging, computer vision, and intelligent transportation.

Such dietary inadequacies may be detrimental for their current and future health. Schools are favorable settings to establish healthy eating practices. Still, no school meal arrangement is provided in Norway, and most children typically bring packed lunches from home. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serving a free healthy school meal for one year resulted in a higher intake of fruit and vegetables and a lower intake of unhealthy snacks in total among 10-12-year-olds in Norway. METHODS The School Meal Project in Southern Norway was a non-randomized trial in two elementary schools in rural areas in the school year 2014/2015. The study sample consisted of 10- to 12-year-old children; an intervention group (N = 55) and a control group (N = 109) resulting in a total of 164 school children at baseline. A food frequency questionnaire was completed by the children at baseline, at five months follow-up and after one year to assess fruit, vegetable, and snacks intake. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to assess intervention effects on overall intake of fruit and vegetables and unhealthy snacks. RESULTS Serving of a free healthy school meal for one year was associated with a higher weekly intake of vegetables on sandwiches in the intervention group compared to the control group, adjusted for baseline intake (B: 1.11 (95% CI: .38, 1.85)) at the end of the intervention. No other significant intervention effects were found for the remaining fruit and vegetables measures. Serving of a free healthy school meal was not associated with a lower weekly intake of unhealthy snacks (i.e. potato chips, candy, sugar sweetened beverages) in the intervention group compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS A free healthy school meal was associated with a higher weekly intake of vegetables on sandwiches but did not significantly change any other investigated dietary behaviors. However, given the inadequate intake of vegetables among children and that even moderate improvements have public health relevance, a free healthy school meal for all school children could be beneficial.

Design/methodology/approach: Experiential information is approached by identifying two constitutive aspects: (1) sensory information that an individual obtains from noticeable events lived through by means of human senses such as sight and touch and (2) cognitiveCaffective information that is indicative of how the individual interprets such events by means of cognitive operations like comparison and evaluation, as well as appraises the affective valence of such events. To examine the nature of experiential information, an empirical study was made by analysing how people articulate sensory and cognitiveCaffective information in online discussion about the COVID-19 epidemic. To this end, a sample of 1773 messages posted to the online forum hosted by the Canadian Broadcasting Company was scrutinized by means of descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis. Findings: Experiential information was mainly articulated in the depiction of visual observations of lived-through events, as well as in their comparison and evaluation. Experiential information was often articulated in conjunction with information of other types, most notably topic-related opinions, neutral descriptions of COVID-19 related issues and suggestions offered to fellow participants. Research limitations/implications: As the study concentrated on the sharing of experiential information about the COVID-19 epidemic in an online discussion forum, the findings cannot be extended to concern the exchange of experiential information in other contexts. Originality/value: The study is among the first to characterize empirically the nature of experiential information by examining the articulations of online discussants. ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Sharing experiential information in online discussion: the case of coping with the COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyze bank supply of credit under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).

PML typically manifests with subacute neurologic deficits including altered mental status, motor deficits, limb ataxia, gait ataxia, and visual symptoms. We report an atypical presentation of PML in a lung transplant recipient (LTR). Case Report: A 71-year-old LTR received rituximab induction followed by a combination of mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and prednisone. He had a single episode of minimal acute cellular rejection early after LT, but never required significantly augmented immunosuppression. Notably, he had mild leukopenia throughout his post-LT course (WBC count 3-4 thousand/L), and he had no response to 4 doses of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, suggesting advanced immunosuppression. At 14 months after LT, the patient reported progressive anomia and aphasia, but no other neurologic deficits. MRI showed an abnormal increased T2/FLAIR signal in the left posterior parieto-occipital subcortical white matter, involving subcortical U fibers, characteristic of PML (Figure A, C). Serum JC virus PCR showed low-level viremia, but CSF from 2 lumbar punctures was PCR negative. Thus, he was diagnosed with possible PML, and immunosuppression was narrowed to a combination of tacrolimus (goal trough 4-6) and prednisone, 5 mg daily. Despite reduced immunosuppression, a repeat MRI 2 months after the initial diagnosis showed worsening PML (Figure B, D) and his symptoms progressed to severe anomia, aphasia, and cortical blindness, but still no motor deficits. PML is a rare, albeit well described, complication of LT, but presentation with only anomia and aphasia is unusual. Without CSF viral isolation, a definitive diagnosis requires brain tissue;however, MRI changes involving subcortical U fibers in the parieto-occipital area are highly characteristic. Early recognition allows for expeditious management.","output":"Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy Presenting as Expressive Aphasia in a Lung Transplant Recipient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives The aim of the study was to evaluate whether an ante-mortem diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is possible via immunocytochemical staining (ICC) of feline coronavirus antigen (FCoV) within macrophages of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Methods Prospectively, CSF samples of 41 cats were investigated, including cats with histopathologically confirmed FIP and neurological signs (n = 10), cats with confirmed FIP without CNS involvement (n = 11), cats with neurological signs but another confirmed CNS disease (n = 17), and cats without neurological signs and a disease other than FIP (n = 3). ICC staining of CSF macrophages was performed in all cats. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of CSF ICC were calculated. Results Of 10 samples from cats with CNS FIP, eight had detectable CSF macrophages, seven of which were positive for FCoV. Ten of 11 samples from cats with confirmed FIP without neurological signs had macrophages in the CSF, with all 10 being ICC-positive. In cats with other CNS disorders, 11/17 had macrophages, two of which stained positively. In cats with diseases other than FIP and without neurological disorders, 2/3 revealed macrophages, with one cat showing positive ICC staining. Diagnosis of FIP via CSF ICC had a sensitivity of 85.0% and a specificity of 83.3%. PPV and NPV were 85.0% and 83.3%. Conclusions and relevance CSF ICC is a highly sensitive test for ante-mortem diagnosis of FIP manifesting in the CNS. However, CNS ICC specificity is too low to confirm FIP and the method should only be applied in conjunction with other features such as CSF cytology. CNS ICC could be helpful to discover pre-neurological stages of CNS FIP.","output":"Diagnostic utility of cerebrospinal fluid immunocytochemistry for diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis manifesting in the central nervous system."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 (caused by SARS-Cov-2) is very serious, and no effective antiviral treatment has yet been confirmed. The adage \\"old drug, new trick\\" in this context may suggest the important therapeutic potential of existing drugs. We found that the lopinavir/ritonavir treatment recommended in the fifth edition of the Treatment Plan of China can only help to improve a minority of throat-swab nucleic-acid results (3/15) in hospitals. Our previous use of chloroquine to treat patients with COVID-19 infection showed an improvement in more throat-swab nucleic-acid results (5/10) than the use of lopinavir/ritonavir. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a prospective, open-label, randomized controlled, multicenter clinical study. The study consists of three phases: a screening period, a treatment period of no more than 10 days, and a follow-up period for each participant. Participants with COVID-19 infection who are eligible for selection for the study will be randomly allocated to the trial group or the control group. The control group will be given lopinavir/ritonavir treatment for no more than 10 days. The trial group will be given chloroquine phosphate treatment for no more than 10 days. The primary outcome is the clinical recovery time at no more than 28 days after the completion of therapy and follow-up. The secondary outcomes include the rate of treatment success after the completion of therapy and follow-up, the time of treatment success after no more than 28 days, the rate of serious adverse events during the completion of therapy and follow-up, and the time to return to normal temperature (calculated from the onset of illness) during the completion of therapy and follow-up. Comparisons will be performed using two-sided tests with a statistical significance level of 5%. DISCUSSION: This experiment should reveal the efficacy and safety of using chloroquine versus lopinavir/ritonavir for patients with mild/general COVID-19 infection. If the new treatment including chloroquine shows a higher rate of throat-swab SARS-CoV-2 real-time fluorescent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity and is safe, it could be tested as a future COVID-19 treatment.

In this study, we describe a protein nanoparticle vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine is based on the display of coronavirus spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) on a synthetic virus-like particle (VLP) platform, SpyCatcher003-mi3, using SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology. Low doses of RBD-SpyVLP in a prime-boost regimen induce a strong neutralising antibody response in mice and pigs that is superior to convalescent human sera. We evaluate antibody quality using ACE2 blocking and neutralisation of cell infection by pseudovirus or wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Using competition assays with a monoclonal antibody panel, we show that RBD-SpyVLP induces a polyclonal antibody response that recognises key epitopes on the RBD, reducing the likelihood of selecting neutralisation-escape mutants. Moreover, RBD-SpyVLP is thermostable and can be lyophilised without losing immunogenicity, to facilitate global distribution and reduce cold-chain dependence. The data suggests that RBD-SpyVLP provides strong potential to address clinical and logistic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"A COVID-19 vaccine candidate using SpyCatcher multimerization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain induces potent neutralising antibody responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":": We performed an observational prospective monocentric study in patients living with HIV (PLWH) diagnosed with COVID-19.

Despite high acute case numbers, patients without Covid-19 still need to be cared for. Due to the severity of the disease and a possible stressful overall situation, patients with palliative care needs also require comprehensive care during pandemic times. In addition to specialized palliative care facilities, this also takes place in non palliative care wards. In order to ensure this general palliative care also in pandemic times, the experience of the staff should be used. The aim of this paper is to examine challenges and possible solutions for general palliative care inpatients in relation to the care of seriously ill and dying patients and their relatives. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured focus groups were conducted online for the study. Participants were staff from intensive care or isolation wards or from units where vulnerable patients (e.g. with cognitive impairment) are cared for. The focus groups were recorded and subsequently transcribed. The data material was analysed with the content structuring content analysis according to Kuckartz. RESULTS: Five focus groups with four to eight health care professionals with various backgrounds were conducted. Fifteen main categories with two to eight subcategories were identified. Based on frequency and the importance expressed by the focus groups, six categories were extracted as central aspects: visiting regulations, communication with relatives, hygiene measures, cooperation, determination of the patients will and the possibility to say good bye. CONCLUSION: The pandemic situation produced several challenges needing specific solutions in order to manage the care of seriously ill and dying patients. Especially visiting needs regulation to prevent social isolation and dying alone. Finding alternative communication ways as well as interprofessional and interdisciplinary cooperation is a precondition for individualised care of seriously ill and dying patients and their relatives.

Blood samples were tested using one PCR (Bartonella spp.) and eight antibody-ELISAs, and questionnaires were conducted to assess risk factors. Seventy-seven percent of febrilers and 98% of dip-tanksters had at least one positive test. Bartonella spp. (PCR 9.5%), spotted fever group (SFG) Rickettsia spp. (IgM 24.1%), Coxiella burnetii.

Prior reports have shown that DGK inhibition has multiple direct activities against GBM cells, including suppressing the oncogenic pathways mTOR and HIF-1. It also inhibits pathways associated with the normally treatment-resistant mesenchymal phenotype, yielding preferential activity against mesenchymal GBM; this suggests possible utility in combining DGK inhibition with radiation and other therapies for which the mesenchymal phenotype promotes resistance. The potential for DGK inhibition to block or reverse T cell anergy also suggests the potential of DGK inhibition to boost immunotherapy against GBM, which is generally considered an immunologically \\"cold\\" tumor. A recent report indicates that DGK deficiency increases responsiveness of macrophages, indicating that DGK inhibition could also have the potential to boost macrophage and microglia activity against GBM-which could be a particularly promising approach given the heavy infiltration of these cells in GBM. DGK inhibition may therefore offer a promising multi-pronged attack on GBM, with multiple direct anti-GBM activities and also the ability to boost both adaptive and innate immune responses against GBM. However, both the direct and indirect benefits of DGK inhibition for GBM will likely require combinations with other therapies to achieve meaningful efficacy. Furthermore, GBM offers other challenges for the application of DGK inhibitors, including decreased accessibility from the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The ideal DGK inhibitor for GBM will combine potency, specificity, and BBB penetrability. No existing inhibitor is known to meet all these criteria, but the strong potential of DGK inhibition against this lethal brain cancer should help drive development and testing of agents to bring this promising strategy to the clinic for patients with GBM.","output":"Delivering Glioblastoma a Kick-DGK Inhibition as a Promising Therapeutic Strategy for GBM"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: At the time of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden, little was known about how effective our regular end-of-life care strategies would be for patients dying from COVID-19 in hospitals. The aim of the study was to describe and evaluate end-of-life care for patients dying from COVID-19 in hospitals in Sweden up until up until 12 November 2020. METHODS: Data were collected from the Swedish Register of Palliative Care. Hospital deaths during 2020 for patients with COVID-19 were included and compared to a reference cohort of hospital patients who died during 2019. Logistic regression was used to compare the groups and to control for impact of sex, age and a diagnosis of dementia. RESULTS: The COVID-19 group (1476 individuals) had a lower proportion of women and was older compared to the reference cohort (13,158 individuals), 81.8 versus 80.6 years (p < .001). Breathlessness was more commonly reported in the COVID-19 group compared to the reference cohort (72% vs 43%, p < .001). Furthermore, anxiety and delirium were more commonly and respiratory secretions, nausea and pain were less commonly reported during the last week in life in the COVID-19 group (p < .001 for all five symptoms). When present, complete relief of anxiety (p = .021), pain (p = .025) and respiratory secretions (p = .037) was more often achieved in the COVID-19 group.

Our findings are as follows. First, under the first-in-first-out discipline (FIFO), the common practice of making testing free attracts the most testees, but may not catch the most cases. Charging a testing fee may surprisingly increase case detection. Second, even though people who show symptoms are more likely to carry the virus, prioritizing these individuals over asymptomatic ones (another common practice) may let more cases go undetected than FIFO testing does. Third, we characterize the optimal scheduling and pricing policy. To maximize case detection, testing can be made free, but one should also (partially) prioritize individuals with symptoms when testing demand is high and switch to (partially) prioritizing the asymptomatic when testing demand is moderately low.

The effects of B4 on inflammation-associated mediators were investigated by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) staining. Proteins expression was quantified by western blotting. RESULTS: The network results indicated that many pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) participated in anemoside B4s anti-inflammatory activity. The counts of neutrophil (NEU) and white blood cell (WBC), the level of myeloperoxidase (MPO), and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6 increased by KP or FM1 infection, which were reversed by anemoside B4. In addition, anemoside B4 significantly suppressed the FM1-induced expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differential protein-88 (MyD88), and myeloid differentiation protein-2 (MD-2), which were further validated by molecular docking data that anemoside B4 bound to bioactive sites of TLR4. Therefore, anemoside B4 exhibited a significant therapeutic effect on pneumonia via the TLR4/MyD88 pathway. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that anemoside B4 attenuates pneumonia via the TLR4/Myd88 signaling pathway, suggesting that anemoside B4 is a promising therapeutic candidate for bacterial-infected or viral-infected pneumonia.","output":"Anemoside B4 protects against Klebsiella pneumoniae- and influenza virus FM1-induced pneumonia via the TLR4/Myd88 signaling pathway in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives.

We present our initial experience using a simple retraction device to reduce these problems. MATERIAL AND METHODS In January 2012 a novel lifter was introduced at our department and subsequently used in SPLC for suspension of the gallbladder. Perioperative data were collected prospectively. In addition, all videos were reviewed to assess any adverse events caused by the lifter. RESULTS Thirty (20 female and 10 male) patients at a median age of 48.4 years (range: 23-83) were operated using this novel retraction device. Median BMI accounted for 26.0 kg/m(2) (median; range: 14.0-36.9). Retraction of the gallbladder using the lifter was possible in all patients. In four cases (13.3 %) spillage of bile caused by the lifter was recorded. In addition, perforation of the gallbladder was seen once (3.3 %), caused by electrocautery. No inflammation, induration or visible scars were seen in the right upper quadrant at six weeks postoperatively in any patient. CONCLUSIONS Gallbladder retraction in SPLC using this novel device is feasible and safe without leaving any apparent scar.

The present study aimed to assess the gender-dependent hand hygiene and personal protective behaviors in a national sample of Polish adolescents. The Polish Adolescents' COVID-19 Experience (PLACE-19) Study was conducted in a group of 2323 secondary school students (814 males, 1509 females). Schools were chosen based on the random quota sampling procedure. The participants were surveyed to assess their knowledge and beliefs associated with hand hygiene and personal protection, as well as their actual behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of respondents gave proper answers when asked about their knowledge. However, females displayed a higher level of knowledge (p < 0.05). Most of the respondents declared not leaving home, handwashing, using alcohol-based hand rub, avoiding contact with those who may be sick, and avoiding public places as their personal protective behaviors. They declared using face masks and gloves after the legal regulation requiring people to cover their nose and mouth in public places was enacted in Poland. Regarding the use of face masks and not touching the face, no gender-dependent differences were observed, while for all the other behaviors, females declared more adherence than males (p < 0.05). Females also declared a higher daily frequency of handwashing (p < 0.0001) and washing their hands always when necessary more often than males (68.2% vs. 54.1%; p < 0.0001). Males more often indicated various reasons for not handwashing, including that there is no need to do it, they do not feel like doing it, they have no time to do it, or they forget about it (p < 0.0001), while females pointed out side effects (e.g., skin problems) as the reason (p = 0.0278). Females more often declared handwashing in circumstances associated with socializing, being exposed to contact with other people and health (p < 0.05), and declared always including the recommended steps in their handwashing procedure (p < 0.05). The results showed that female secondary school students exhibited a higher level of knowledge on hand hygiene and personal protection, as well as better behaviors, compared to males. However, irrespective of gender, some false beliefs and improper behaviors were observed, which suggests that education is necessary, especially in the period of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Analysis of Gender-Dependent Personal Protective Behaviors in a National Sample: Polish Adolescents' COVID-19 Experience (PLACE-19) Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To know the perception of health professionals and their families about fake news related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The experiment was conducted at Omsk State Agrarian University, using a random complete block design with four replicates in 2017 and 2018. Concentrations of 15 elements were included in the analysis: macroelements, Ca, K, Mg, P, and S; microelements, Fe, Cu, Mn, and Zn; toxic trace elements, Cd, Co, Ni; and trace elements, Mo, Rb, and Sr. Protein content was found to be positively correlated with the concentrations of 11 of the elements in one or both years. Multiple regression was used to adjust the concentration of each element, based on significant correlations with agronomic traits and macroelements. All 15 elements were evaluated for their suitability for genetic enhancement, considering phenotypic variation, their share of the genetic component in this variation, as well as the dependence of the element concentration on other traits. Three trace elements (Sr, Mo, and Co) were identified as traits that were relatively easy to enhance through breeding. These were followed by Ca, Cd, Rb, and K. The important biofortification elements Mn and Zn were among the traits that were difficult to enhance genetically. The CIMMYT and Japanese synthetics had significantly higher concentrations of K and Sr, compared to the local check. The Japanese synthetics also had the highest concentrations of Ca, S, Cd, and Mo. The US cultivars had concentrations of Ca as high as the Japanese synthetics, and the highest concentrations of Mg and Fe. KASIBs germplasm had near-average values for most elements.

At the cellular level, these changes in shape may be accompanied by fluid flow in and out of individual lens cells. We tested the hypothesis that some of this flow might be directly modulated by pressure-activated channels. In particular, we used the whole cell patch clamp technique to test whether calcium-activated-chloride channels (CaCCs) expressed in differentiating lens cells are activated by mechanical stimulation. Our results show that mechanical stress, produced by focally perfusing the lens cell at a constant rate, caused a significant increase in a chloride current that could be fully reversed by stopping perfusion. The time course of activation and recovery from activation of the flow-induced current occurred rapidly over a time frame similar to that of accommodation. The flow-induced current could be inhibited by the TMEM16A specific CaCC blocker, Ani9, suggesting that the affected current was predominantly due to TMEM16A chloride channels. The mechanism of action of mechanical stress did not appear to involve calcium influx through other mechanosensitive ion channels since removal of calcium from the bath solution failed to block the flow-induced chloride current. In conclusion, our results suggest that CaCCs in the lens can be rapidly and reversibly modulated by mechanical stress, consistent with their participation in regulation of volume in this organ.","output":"Mechanical Stress Modulates Calcium-Activated-Chloride Currents in Differentiating Lens Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has forced frequent testing of populations.

Saliva has been suggested as an appropriate fluid for the diagnosis of COVID-19. We have investigated the possibility of using pools of saliva samples to detect SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Two hundred and seventy-nine saliva samples were analyzed through RT-PCR of Envelope, Nucleocapsid and Open Reading Frame 1ab genes. Reproducibility assays showed an almost perfect agreement as well as high sensitivity (96.6%), specificity (96.8%), positive predicted value (96.6%), and negative predicted value (96.8%).

These measures have been taken in response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020. Epidemic models are being used by governments across the world to inform social distancing and other public health strategies to reduce the spread of the virus. These models, which vary widely in their complexity, simulate interventions by manipulating model parameters that control social mixing, healthcare provision and other behavioral and environmental processes of disease transmission and recovery. The validity of these parameters is challenged by the uncertainty of the impact on disease transmission from socio-economic factors and public health interventions. Although sensitivity of the models to small variations in parameters are often carried out, the forecasting accuracy of these models is rarely investigated during an outbreak. Methods: We fitted a stochastic transmission model on reported cases, recoveries and deaths associated with the infection of SARS-CoV-2 across 101 countries that had adopted at least one social-distancing policy by 15 May 2020. The dynamics of disease transmission was represented in terms of the daily effective reproduction number ( R t ). Countries were grouped according to their initial temporal R t patterns using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. We then computed the time lagged cross correlation among the daily number of policies implemented (policy volume), the daily effective reproduction number, and the daily incidence counts for each country. Finally, we provided forecasts of incidence counts up to 30-days from the time of prediction for each country repeated over 230 daily rolling windows from 15 May to 31 Dec 2020. The forecasting accuracy of the model when R t is updated every time a new prediction is made was compared with the accuracy using a static R t . Findings: We identified 5 groups of countries with distinct transmission patterns during the first 6 months of the pandemic. Early adoption of social distancing measures and a shorter gap between any two interventions were associated with a reduction on the duration of outbreaks (with correlation coefficients of -0.26 and 0.24 respectively). Sustained social distancing appeared to play a role in the prevention of the second transmission peak. By 15 May 2020, the average of the median R t across examined countries had reduced from its peak of 20.5 (17.79, 23.20) to 1.3 (0.94, 1.74).The time lagged cross correlation analysis revealed that increased policy volume was associated with lower future R t (the negative correlation was minimized when R t lagged the policy volume by 75 days), while a lower R t was associated with lower future policy volume (the positive correlation was maximized when R t led by 102 days). R t led the daily incidence counts by 78 days, with lower incidence counts being associated with lower future policy volume (the positive correlation was maximized when counts led the volume by 135 days). On the other hand, higher policy volume was not associated with lower incidence counts within a lag of up to 180 days.The outbreak prediction accuracy of the stochastic transmission model using dynamically updated R t produced an average AUROC of 0.72 (0.708, 0.723) compared to 0.56 (0.555, 0.568) when R t was kept constant. Prediction accuracy declined with forecasting time. Interpretation Understanding the evolution of the daily effective reproduction number during an epidemic is an important complementary piece of information to reported daily counts, recoveries and deaths. This is because R t provides an early signal of the efficacy of containment measures. Using updated R t values produces significantly better predictions of future outbreaks. Our results found a substantial variation in the effect of early public health interventions on the evolution of R t over time and across countries, which could not be explained solely by the timing and number of the adopted interventions. This suggests that further knowledge about the idiosyncrasy of the implementation and effectiveness thereof is required. Although sustained containment measures have successfully lowered growth rate of disease transmission, more than half of the studied countries failed to maintain an effective reproduction number close to or below 1. This resulted in continued growth in reported cases.","output":"Evolution of disease transmission rate during the course of SARS-COV-2: Patterns and determinants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Believed to have originated from a local Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China, the COVID-19 has had an unprecedented and catastrophic impact on humanity, with the WHO declaring it a global pandemic. Although the first case of COVID-19 was reported in December 2019, the primary source and intermediate host have not been confirmed, but human-to-human transmission has been universally accepted. The main mode of transmission of the virus is through respiratory droplets along with prominent respiratory system involvement. However, fecal-oral transmission due to the shedding of the virus in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract may continue for up to 10 weeks after respiratory clearance and is fast becoming important. SARS-CoV-2 shows a high affinity to ACE2 receptors, making sites of high ACE2 receptor expression, such as lungs, GI tract, brain, kidneys, heart, liver and immune system, a prime target for infection. Through this literature review, we aim to summarize the current knowledge of immunological pathways that contribute to the disease with a focus specifically on the GI tract involvement.

Like KIC, inflammatory factors are implicated in the development of insulin resistance. Here, we analyzed the effect of KIC and inflammatory factors (homocysteine [50 M], TNF- [10 ng/ml], and interleukin 6 (IL-6) [10 ng/ml]) on myotubes. Although KIC suppressed insulin-stimulated glucose transport, addition of the inflammatory factors did not worsen this effect.

Anamorelin (appetite stimulation), megestrol acetate, eicosapentaenoic acid, phytocannabinoids, targeting MSTN/activin, and molecules targeting proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF- and IL-6, are being tested as treatment options for cancer cachexia. ABSTRACT: Cancer cachexia is a condition marked by functional, metabolic, and immunological dysfunctions associated with skeletal muscle (SM) atrophy, adipose tissue loss, fat reduction, systemic inflammation, and anorexia. Generally, the condition is caused by a variety of mediators produced by cancer cells and cells in tumor microenvironments. Myostatin and activin signaling, IGF-1/PI3K/AKT signaling, and JAK-STAT signaling are known to play roles in cachexia, and thus, these pathways are considered potential therapeutic targets.

High-performance liquid chromatography and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis of digested products showed a specific trans cleavage of peptides bearing Gln-Gly, Gln-Ala, Glu-Gly, Glu-Pro, or Glu-Lys at the scissile bond. In contrast, peptides bearing Glu-Ala or Gln-Asp at the scissile bond (NS4-NS5 and NS5-NS6, or NS6-NS7 junctions, respectively) were resistant to trans cleavage by NS6 or NS6-7 proteins, whereas cis cleavage of the Glu-Ala scissile bond of the NS5-NS6 junction was evidenced. Interestingly, the presence of a Phe at position P4 overruled the resistance to trans cleavage of the Glu-Ala junction (NS5-NS6), whereas substitutions at the P1 and P2' positions altered the cleavage efficiency. The differential cleavage observed is supported by a model of the substrate-binding site of the sapovirus protease, indicating that the P4, P1, and P2' positions in the substrate modulate the cleavage specificity and efficiency of the sapovirus chymotrypsin-like protease.","output":"Functional characterization of the cleavage specificity of the sapovirus chymotrypsin-like protease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)has been a difficult enemy to beat for healthcare professionals around the world. However, even before the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an emergence of a new combatant in the form of opportunistic fungal infections with a high rate of morbidity and mortality, creating havoc throughout the globe. Methods A case-control single-center study was conducted in Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences, Wardha, Maharashtra. All the subjects who were included in the study were tested positive for COVID-19 through the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method and the cases were defined as patients with biopsy-proven mucormycosis, whereas control were subjects who did not develop mucormycosis. The duration of the study was three months, from June 2021 to August 2021. Result A total of 55 cases and 50 controls were enrolled in the study. The use of zinc was found to be significantly associated with COVID-19-associated mucormycosis, with 89.1% of the cases having a history of zinc intake and only 52% of controls having a history of zinc intake( p-value <0.001). Diabetes mellitus was found to be significantly associated with COVID-19-associated mucormycosis with 83.6% of the cases and 16% of the controls having diabetes mellitus (p-value <0.001). Although the use of steroids in cases was more with 98.2% of the cases and 54% of the control receiving steroids; this difference was not significant statistically (p-value of 1.00). Conclusion We conclude that apart from diabetes mellitus and other immunosuppressive states, zinc might be the hidden culprit behind the sudden surge of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis worldwide owing to the self-administration of zinc by the patients to acquire innate immunity and over-prescription of multivitamins by the treating clinicians. However, this association required further studies in order to be proved.","output":"Role of Zinc and Clinicopathological Factors for COVID-19-Associated Mucormycosis (CAM) in a Rural Hospital of Central India: A Case-Control Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Viruses are known as the major causative agents for infectious diseases globally. The coronaviruses are one of the serious pathogens to cause serious diseases in humans. Recently identified SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan City, China has emerged as a serious threat to human health and caused a global pandemic. Bats have been confirmed as a primary source of infection. The vaccination of the human population and animals serving as a potential reservoir is a straight forward strategy to control the transmission of any pathogen to humans. Natural products from many herbal plants are well known to have novel antiviral properties and evaluated against various viral diseases. There are many alkaloids have shown to be effective against coronaviruses. METHODS: Recently, the antiviral efficacy of natural alkaloids known as Homoharringtonine (HTT) and Emetine has been evaluated and provided promising results against coronaviruses including SARS-CoVs. These alkaloids may be very useful and can be used as antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 because they have already been reported to inhibit the replication of SASRS-CoV and other viruses in cell lines. CONCLUSION: This review specifically focuses on the recent findings of these alkaloids against coronaviruses and possible treatment options for SARS-CoV-2.

The prevalence of psychiatric disorders might be underestimated. Emerging evidence highlights the role of immune response as a key factor in MDs. Immunological biomarkers seem to be related to illness progression and to treatment effectiveness; several studies suggest strong associations among IL-6, TNFa, S100b, IL 1b, and PCR with affective or schizophrenic disorders. The purpose of this review is to examine and to understand the possible link between mental disorders and interleukin 33 to clarify the role of this axis in the immune system. We found 13 research papers that evaluated interleukin 33 or interleukin 31 levels in subjects affected by mental disorders. Eight studies investigated cytokines in affective disorders. Three studies measured levels of IL-33 in schizophrenia and two studies focused on patients affected by autism spectrum disorders. Alterations in brain structure and neurodevelopmental outcome are affected by multiple levels of organization. Disorders of the autoimmune response, and of the IL-33/31 axis, may therefore be one of the factors involved in this process.

Social networks provide a constantly updated pool of news to the end-users but the absence of systematic control and moderation of the posts easily leads to spread unverified news with an instrumental value and likely to be dangerous, which are referred to as rumours. To tackle this issue various systems for automatic rumour detection among conversations, i.e. an aggregated set of posts, have been recently presented in the literature. However, few efforts have been directed towards rumour detection at the level of single posts (micro-level), which is the challenging scenario that we tackle in this work. Moving at a finer scale is an urgent need since both rumour and non-rumour posts are included in the same conversation. Here the rumour detection issue is addressed presenting a novel feature selection approach, which characterizes the feature space aiming at minimizing samples in unreliable configurations. This approach is compared with other state-of-the-art methods using a pool of different learning algorithms on two health-related Twitter datasets, labelled at the micro-level. Our proposal yields promising results: it outperforms other feature selection approaches with a best accuracy of 96.8% and enhances the performance of our previous work up to 5%. These findings prove the potential of the feature selection method introduced, which gives access to samples distribution in the feature space, providing privileged information for the construction of the classifier decision boundaries.

This paper represents a first effort in identifying the psychological characteristics of attitudes towards dangers among healthcare professionals working and not working with COVID-19 patients. Methods. A sample of 246 respondents varying in gender and age took part in this study, including 106 healthcare professionals from the city of Cherepovets (Vologda Region) and the city of Ivanovo (Ivanovo Region). The types of attitudes towards dangers, the need for experiencing a sense of danger, and the need for safety were identified using original questionnaires developed by the authors. The * criterion C Fishers angular transformation (Fishers criterion) was used for data processing. Results. Gender-related differences in the level of threat sensitivity and in the types of responding to dangers were found in groups of healthcare and non-healthcare professionals. Among healthcare professionals, the number of those exaggerating the importance of threats decreased significantly (from 30 % to 14.15 %) and the number of those with an ambiguous type of responding increased (from 17.14 % to 30.19 %). Compared to healthcare professionals not working with COVID-19 patients, those treating and caring for COVID-19 patients showed a decrease in threat sensitivity (from 57.69 % to 27.78 %) and an increase in the need for safety (from 28.85 % to 64.81 %) and in the need for ensuring safety (from 57.69 % to 79.63 %). The differences were significant. Discussion.

Clinical data collected included physical appearance, anthropometric data, neurological and psychological examinations, cardiovascular evaluation, pulmonary function tests, eye and ear-nose-throat examinations, endurance in the 6-min walk test and/or 3-min stair climb test, joint range of motion, and skeletal investigations (X-rays, bone mineral density). RESULTS: At the time of ERT initiation, two patients were infants (1.8 and 2.1 years), five were children (3.4C7.1 years), and three were adults (16.5C39.5 years). Patients had up to 4 years follow-up. Most patients had classical Morquio A, based on genotypic and phenotypic data. Endurance was considerably reduced in all patients, but remained relatively stable or increased over time in most cases after treatment initiation. Length/height fell below normal growth curves, except in the two infants who started ERT at  2.1 years of age. All patients had skeletal and/or joint abnormalities when ERT was started. Follow-up data did not suggest improvements in skeletal abnormalities, except in one of the younger infants. Nine patients had corneal clouding, which resolved after treatment initiation in the two infants, but not in the other patients. Hepatomegaly was reported in seven patients and resolved with treatment in five of them. Other frequent findings at treatment initiation were coarse facial features (N = 9), hearing loss (N = 6), and cardiac abnormalities (N = 6).

The current study's overall aim was to examine the impact of the current COVID-19 outbreak on the number of non-COVID-related patient presentations to a major national emergency traumatology/orthopedics referral center in Latin America. METHODS: An observational study was performed at one of Peru's main tertiary trauma referral centers, during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Numbers of non-follow-up patients presenting to the traumatology/ orthopedics service were counted and compared between January through April 2019 and January through April 2020; and between the month immediately prior to the Peruvian government's implementation of national lock-down measures (Feb 16-Mar 15; Period 1) and the month immediately following (Mar 16-Apr 15; Period 2). The number of surgery service hospitalizations also was compared pre- versus post lockdown initiation (Period 1 vs. 2), as were patient characteristics and outcomes, like age, sex, discharge disposition, mortality, indications for hospital admission, and COVID-19 status. RESULT: Comparing 2019 and 2020, no appreciable differences were detected in the number of patients seen in either January or February. However, relative to March and April 2019, the numbers of patients seen in March and April 2020 (the two months after the first Peruvian case of COVID-19 was detected) were reduced by 55.8 and 88.6%, respectively. Comparing the months immediately pre and post lockdown, the number of service patients declined by 79.9% in April, while the number of hospitalizations declined by 30.9%. The number of admissions for various surgical indications either remained stable or declined in parallel with the overall decline in admissions for all indications except for osteoporotic hip fractures and diabetic foot ulcers (both of which increased proportional to the overall number of admissions) and for hand and foot fractures, both of which decreased. CONCLUSION: At our hospital, not all indications for traumatology/orthopedics service utilization declined despite the national government's directive to reduce non-COVID-related consultations and admissions. Some disorders presented with even greater frequency, which must be considered when developing contingencies for the reallocation of healthcare resources during a pandemic.","output":"How COVID-19 has affected emergent visits to a Latin-American trauma department: Experience at a Peruvian national trauma referral center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a particular challenge for diabetes patients. Diabetes mellitus predisposes to a particularly severe course of the disease and doubles the COVID-19 mortality risk due to pulmonary and cardiac involvement. In addition, diabetes patients often suffer from comorbidities which further worsen clinical outcomes. Glycemic control during infectious diseases is often suboptimal, and antidiabetic drugs and insulin therapy have to be adapted accordingly. On the other hand, access of diabetes patients to outpatient clinics are limited during the ongoing season urging alternative treatment options, particularly the implementation of novel telemedicine strategies.

The role of the C&I load share in reducing the electricity demand of the different states in India has been examined using multi-sectoral regression analysis. The impact of the pan India lights-off event on the short-term operational flexibility response of the power system has also been analysed using high-temporal resolution data. The results indicate that there has been a reduction of nearly 70 TWh of electricity demand during the lockdown period, an 11% reduction compared to 2019. The top three states recording the highest reduction were Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu at 11TWh, 10.6TWh and 8.4 TWh, respectively. Regression analysis revealed that out of the total drop in load demand  73% is owed to the industrial sector, while the remaining 27% is to the commercial sector. This demand drop also impacted the upstream electricity supply mix where 96% of the reduction in supply was borne by the coal generating units, recording its lowest national plant load factor at 35% with a 16% reduction in overall CO2 emission compared to the same period in 2019. In conclusion, a case study of Maharashtra has been used to analyse the impact of this reduction in electricity demand on the supply mix, hourly load profile and cost of supply under the different lockdown phases.","output":"Analysing the impact of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the Indian electricity sector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To assess the impact of the lockdown due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on key quality indicators for the treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. METHODS: Data were obtained from 41 hospitals participating in the prospective Feedback Intervention and Treatment Times in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (FITT-STEMI) study, including 15,800 patients treated for acute STEMI from January 2017 to the end of March 2020. RESULTS: There was a 12.6% decrease in the total number of STEMI patients treated at the peak of the pandemic in March 2020 as compared to the mean number treated in the March months of the preceding years. This was accompanied by a significant difference among the modes of admission to hospitals (p = 0.017) with a particular decline in intra-hospital infarctions and transfer patients from other hospitals, while the proportion of patients transported by emergency medical service (EMS) remained stable. In EMS-transported patients, predefined quality indicators, such as percentages of pre-hospital ECGs (both 97%, 95% CI = ? 2.2C2.7, p = 0.846), direct transports from the scene to the catheterization laboratory bypassing the emergency department (68% vs. 66%, 95% CI = ? 4.9C7.9, p = 0.641), and contact-to-balloon-times of less than or equal to 90 min (58.3% vs. 57.8%, 95%CI = ? 6.2C7.2, p = 0.879) were not significantly altered during the COVID-19 crisis, as was in-hospital mortality (9.2% vs. 8.5%, 95% CI = ? 3.2C4.5, p = 0.739).

The current study examined how living alone was related to social contact and emotional well-being among older adults during the pandemic. Adults (N = 226) aged 69+ completed a brief survey assessing their living situation, social contact with different social partners (in person, by phone, electronically), and emotions during the morning, afternoon and evening the prior day. Older adults who live alone were less likely to see others in person or to receive or provide help, and reported less positive emotion the prior day than those who lived with others. Living alone was associated with more positive emotions concurrent with in-person contact. In contrast, phone contact was related to higher levels of negate affect among those living alone, but not among those who live with others. Findings suggest older adults who live alone may be more reactive to social contact during the COVID 19 outbreak than older adults who reside with others. In-person contact appears to confer distinct benefits not available via telephone contact, suggesting that possible interventions during the pandemic may work best with safe forms of in-person contact.","output":"Living Alone During COVID-19: Social Contact and Emotional Well-Being among Older Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lactoferrins are an iron-binding glycoprotein that have important protective roles in the mammalian body through their numerous functions, which include antimicrobial, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant activities.

We herein describe a 35-year-old Asian man with pulmonary tuberculosis and perforated duodenal ulcer who presented with hyponatremia with hourly fluctuating urine osmolality ranging from 100 to 600 mosmol/kg, which resembled urine osmolality observed in typical polydipsia and SIADH simultaneously. Further review revealed correlation of body temperature and urine osmolality. Since fever is a known non-osmotic stimulus of ADH secretion, we theorized that hyponatremia in this patient was due to transient ADH secretion due to fever. In our case, empiric exogenous glucocorticoid suppressed transient non-osmotic ADH secretion and urine osmolality showed highly variable concentrations. Transient ADH secretion-related hyponatremia may be underrecognized due to occasional empiric glucocorticoid administration in patients with critical illnesses. Repeatedly monitoring of urine chemistries and interpretation of urine chemistries with careful review of non-osmotic stimuli of ADH including fever is crucial in recognition of this etiology. Learning points: Hourly fluctuations in urine osmolality can be observed in patients with fever, which is a non-osmotic stimulant of ADH secretion. Repeated monitoring of urine chemistries aids in the diagnosis of the etiology underlying hyponatremia, including fever, in patients with transient ADH secretion. Glucocorticoid administration suppresses ADH secretion and improves hyponatremia even in the absence of adrenal insufficiency; the etiology of hyponatremia should be determined carefully in these patients.","output":"Hyponatremia presenting with hourly fluctuating urine osmolality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to examine associations between screen time (ST) parenting practices and 2C5-year-old childrens TV viewing and weight status.

Health information technologies (HITs) hold great potential to improve these aspects that underpin the enhanced quality of mental health care. OBJECTIVE: Project Synergy aimed to co-design, implement, and evaluate novel HITs, as exemplified by the InnoWell Platform, to work with standard health care organizations. The goals were to deliver improved outcomes for specific populations under focus and support organizations to enact significant system-level reforms. METHODS: Participating health care organizations included the following: Open ArmsCVeterans & Families Counselling (in Sydney and Lismore, New South Wales [NSW]); NSW North Coast headspace centers for youth (Port Macquarie, Coffs Harbour, Grafton, Lismore, and Tweed Heads); the Butterfly Foundations National Helpline for eating disorders; Kildare Road Medical Centre for enhanced primary care; and Connect to Wellbeing North Coast NSW (administered by Neami National), for population-based intake and assessment. Service users, families and carers, health professionals, and administrators of services across Australia were actively engaged in the configuration of the InnoWell Platform to meet service needs, identify barriers to and facilitators of quality mental health care, and highlight potentially the best points in the service pathway to integrate the InnoWell Platform. The locally configured InnoWell Platform was then implemented within the respective services. A mixed methods approach, including surveys, semistructured interviews, and workshops, was used to evaluate the impact of the InnoWell Platform. A participatory systems modeling approach involving co-design with local stakeholders was also undertaken to simulate the likely impact of the platform in combination with other services being considered for implementation within the North Coast Primary Health Network to explore resulting impacts on mental health outcomes, including suicide prevention. RESULTS: Despite overwhelming support for integrating digital health solutions into mental health service settings and promising impacts of the platform simulated under idealized implementation conditions, our results emphasized that successful implementation is dependent on health professional and service readiness for change, leadership at the local service level, the appropriateness and responsiveness of the technology for the target end users, and, critically, funding models being available to support implementation. The key places of interoperability of digital solutions and a willingness to use technology to coordinate health care system use were also highlighted. CONCLUSIONS: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the widespread acceptance of very basic digital health solutions, Project Synergy highlights the critical need to support equity of access to HITs, provide funding for digital infrastructure and digital mental health care, and actively promote the use of technology-enabled, coordinated systems of care.","output":"Informing the Future of Integrated Digital and Clinical Mental Health Care: Synthesis of the Outcomes From Project Synergy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A sudden rise of Candida krusei candidemia cases was noticed in our hospital within 1 year with maximum cases from paediatric unit.

Methods: At this facility, 82 (60%) residents were infected. Our team rapidly deployed technology to support staff at the facility. Virtual daily rounds created a systematic approach for patient care. The goals of virtual daily rounds include (1) efficiently facilitating HIPAA-compliant communication between nursing and all licensed independent providers, (2) rapid identification of clinical decline, (3) facilitation of care escalation, (4) facilitating bidirectional transfers, and (5) rapid and efficient identification of patients appropriate for telemedicine pulmonary consultation. Results: The outbreak remained active 6 weeks; 82 of 136 (60%) residents were infected, and 36 (44%) COVID-19 positive residents were seen by telemedicine consultation. Fifty-seven (70%) residents remained in-facility for treatment. Twenty-one residents died (15%); 10 in facility, 11 in hospital.

However, serological analyses of these infections remain inconclusive when comparing patients with healthy controls. In particular, it is unclear if certain EBV-derived antigens eliciting antibody responses have a biomarker potential for disease diagnosis. With this purpose, we re-analysed a previously published microarray data on the IgG antibody responses against 3,054 EBV-related antigens in 92 patients with ME/CFS and 50 HCs. This re-analysis consisted of constructing different regression models for binary outcomes with the ability to classify patients and HCs. In these models, we tested for a possible interaction of different antibodies with age and gender. When analyzing the whole data set, there were no antibody responses that could be used to distinguish patients from healthy controls. A similar finding was obtained when comparing patients with noninfectious or unknown disease trigger to healthy controls. However, when data analysis was restricted to the comparison between HCs and patients with a putative infection at disease onset, we could identify stronger antibody responses against two candidate antigens (EBNA4_0529 and EBNA6_0070). Using antibody responses to these two antigens together with age and gender, the final classification model had an estimated sensitivity and specificity of 0.833 and 0.720, respectively. This reliable case-control discrimination suggested the use of the antibody levels related to these candidate viral epitopes as biomarkers for disease diagnosis in this subgroup of patients. When a bioinformatic analysis was performed on these epitopes, it revealed a potential molecular mimicry with several human proteins.

So, we tried to develop a novel approach for triaging COVID-19 patients and deciding the priority for hospital admission using Lung Ultrasound. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of lung ultrasound in triaging suspected COVID-19 patients and assessment of the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia and its comparison with CT chest as the gold standard. METHOD: This was a multicenter cross-sectional study enrolled on 243 COVID-19 confirmed patients presented to the emergency department in three major University hospitals in Egypt. Lung ultrasound was done by an experienced emergency physician or chest physician according to the local protocol of each hospital. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected from each patient. Each patient was subjected to CT chest and lung ultrasound. RESULTS: A total of 243 confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled in this study, with a mean age of 46.7+10.4 years. Ground glass opacity (GGO), subpleural consolidation, trans-lobar consolidation, and crazy paving were reported in chest CT scans of 54.3%, 15.2%, 11.1%, and 8.6% of patients, respectively. B-line artifacts were found in 81.1% of COVID-19 patients, which was of confluent pattern in 18.9% of patients. The lung ultrasound findings of 197 patients (81.1%) were completely coincident with those of CT with a Kappa agreement value of 0.77, and this offered a diagnostic sensitivity of 74 %, a diagnostic specificity of 97.9 %, positive predictive value (PPV) of 90.2% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 93.6 % for lung ultrasound in triaging COVID-19 patients. Adding O2 saturation to the findings of lung imaging, the accuracy of evaluation of lung ultrasound to differentiate between severe and non-severe lung diseases showed that ultrasound had 100% sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: Lung Ultrasound with Oxygen saturation is a very efficient tool for decision-making to prioritize hospital admission for patients affected by COVID-19 in healthcare settings with limited resources.","output":"Utility of Lung Ultrasound in Decision making to prioritize hospital admission for COVID-19 patients: A Developing Country Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Messages about COVID-19 vaccines need to be more inclusive and appropriate to help reduce vaccination hesitancy among healthcare workers, says the nursing regulator.","output":"NMC says COVID-19 vaccination messages need to be more inclusive and appropriate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic forced healthcare management to make structural adaptations in the interest of infection control. One such adaptation is the introduction of ward-based medical teams. The multidisciplinary team (MDT) is one of the cornerstones of geriatric medicine. Therefore, we aimed to explore the perception of the care of the older person MDT on the introduction of ward-based medical teams. METHODS: Qualitative data was collected on a geriatric ward in October 2020 via written questionnaire. The questionnaire analysed how the transition to ward based medical teams was perceived in terms of inter-professional collaboration and clinical service delivered to patients. RESULTS: There were 14 respondents, 10 of whom were nursing staff (71%). 86% strongly agreed that the medical team was more accessible, with most interactions occurring face-to-face. Patient care and safety was thought to have improved, 79% and 71% of respondents respectively. 93% felt they had a better rapport with the medical team. 71% felt the MDT meeting is more effective, 57% believed the meeting had greater impact on patient care. However, 93% felt there was less workspace. 21% believed there were more daily admissions and 57% felt the majority of patient transfers from other wards were inappropriate. Overall 86% favoured ward-based medical teams, with 57% of staff reporting that the change led to increased personal job satisfaction. CONCLUSION: By increasing the geographic proximity of doctors to other professionals, doctors were more accessible, issues were tackled quicker, and there was less time wasted bleeping medical teams. Overall staff favoured a ward-based system. However, there are challenges implementing this system. Particular attention should be paid to the availability of adequate workspace, including telephones and computers. Ward transfers should be minimized as continuity of care can be compromised. Strategies should be implemented so medical charts are available to the MDT during consultant-led ward rounds.","output":"125 WARD-BASED MEDICAL TEAMS: IMPACT ON THE CARE OF THE OLDER PERSON WARD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) within six months after sinus rhythm restoration with direct current cardioversion (DCC) is a significant treatment challenge. Currently, the factors influencing outcome are mostly unknown. Studies have found a link between genetics and the risk of AF and efficacy of rhythm control. The aim of this study was to examine the association between eight single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and the risk of AF development and recurrence after DCC. Materials and Methods: Regarding the occurrence of AF, 259 AF cases and 108 controls were studied. Genotypes for the eight SNVs located in the genes CAV1, MYH7, SOX5, KCNN3, ZFHX3, KCNJ5 and PITX2 were determined using high-resolution melting analysis and confirmed with Sanger sequencing. Six months after DCC, a telephone interview was conducted to determine whether AF had recurred. A polygenic risk score (PRS) was calculated as the unweighted sum of risk alleles. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to assess SNV and PRS association with AF occurrence and recurrence after DCC. Results: The risk allele of rs2200733 (PITX2) was significantly associated with the development of AF (p = 0.012, OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 1.206-4.423). AF recurred in 60% of patients and the allele generally associated with a decreased risk of AF of rs11047543 (SOX5) was associated with a greater risk of AF recurrence (p = 0.014, OR = 0.223, 95% CI = 0.067-0.738). A PRS of greater than 7 was significantly associated (p = 0.008) with a higher likelihood of developing AF after DCC (OR = 4.174, 95% CI = 1.454-11.980). Conclusions: A higher PRS is associated with increased odds of AF recurrence after treatment with DCC. PITX2 (rs2200733) is significantly associated with an increased risk of AF. The protective allele of rs11047543 (SOX5) is associated with a greater risk of AF recurrence.

METHODS: This is a multicenter, international survey among practicing ophthalmologists across different countries. The survey was conducted from September 9th to October 24th, 2020. It included a total of 23 questions that navigated through the currently adopted recommendations in different clinical situations. The survey also assessed the convenience of using various PPE in ophthalmic practice and addressed the clarity of the examination field while using various PPE during clinical or surgical procedures. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-two ophthalmologists completed the survey (101 from Egypt, 50 from the USA, and 21 from four other countries). The analysis of the responses showed that most ophthalmologists use face masks without significant problems during their examinations, while face shields followed by protective goggles were the most inconvenient PPE in the current ophthalmic practice. Moreover, most of the participants (133, 77.3%) noticed an increase in their examination time when using PPE. Furthermore, a considerable percentage of the respondents (70, 40.7%) stopped using one or more of the PPE due to inconvenience or discomfort.

Objectives To molecularly characterise a novel HRV and determine its prevalence and clinical impact on a predominantly paediatric population. Study design Nucleotide sequencing was employed to determine the complete HRV-QPM coding sequence. Two novel real-time RT-PCR diagnostic assays were designed and employed to retrospectively screen a well-defined population of 1244 specimen extracts to identify the prevalence of HRV-QPM during 2003. Results Phylogenetic studies of complete coding sequences defined HRV-QPM as a novel member the genus Rhinovirus residing within the previously described HRV-A2 sub-lineage. Investigation of the relatively short VP1 sequence suggest that the virus is resistant to Pleconaril, setting it apart from the HRV A species. Sixteen additional HRV-QPM strains were detected (1.4% of specimens) often as the sole micro-organism present among infants with suspected bronchiolitis. HRV-QPM was also detected in Europe during 2006, and a closely related virus circulated in the United States during 2004.

The objective of this study was to classify the invasiveness of alien species that have invaded the Upper Burdekin Catchment in Queensland, Australia, at three spatial scales. A combination of three published weed classification frameworks and multivariate techniques were employed to classify species based on their frequency and cover at a range of spatial scales. We surveyed the Upper Burdekin Catchment for alien species, and for each species determined the following distribution indices  site frequency, total cover, transect frequency per site frequency and quadrat frequency per site frequency, cover per quadrat when present, cover per transect when present, and cover per site when present. These indices capture the effect of species abundance and frequency between sites (site frequency and total cover), within sites (transect frequency per site and cover per transect when present), and within transects (quadrat frequency per site frequency and cover per site). They were used to classify the species into seven groups using a hierarchical cluster analysis. The relationship between the indices was explored to determine how effective the small scale, site\\\\specific indices were at predicting the broader, landscape\\\\scale patterns. Strong correlations were observed between transect frequency per site and frequency (r (2) = 0.89) and cover per transect when present and total cover (r (2) = 0.62). This suggests that if a weed is abundant at the site level, it has the potential to occupy large areas of the catchment. The species groupings derived from the application of the three published weed classification frameworks were compared graphically to the groupings derived from the cluster analysis. One of the frameworks classified species into three groups. The other two frameworks classified species into four groups. There was a high degree of subjectivity in applying the frameworks to the survey data. Some of the data were of no relevance to the classification frameworks and were therefore ignored. We suggest that the weed classification frameworks should be used in conjunction with existing multivariate techniques to ensure that classifications capture important natural variations in observed data that may reflect invasion processes. The combined use of the frameworks and multivariate techniques enabled us to aggregate species into categories appropriate for management.","output":"Comparing agglomerative clustering and three weed classification frameworks to assess the invasiveness of alien species across spatial scales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020.

At a pediatric hospital that provides over 25 000 anesthetics a year, a quality improvement project was initiated with the aim of decreasing the amount of sevoflurane used per anesthetic by 20% over the course of a year. METHODS: Three Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles involving gathering comparative data, departmental education, improvement updates on our huddle board, and intraoperative confirmation rounds were completed. The bottles of sevoflurane used and the total number of anesthetics performed were collected each month. To account for the fluctuation of anesthetic cases per month, a metric of \\"Anesthetics Performed per Bottle of Sevoflurane Used\\" was created. RESULTS: Compared to a prior twelve-month period, the Anesthetics Performed per Bottle of Sevoflurane Used were higher with a mean increase of 25%. The bottles of sevoflurane used per month was lower with a mean decrease of 20%. The carbon footprint of our sevoflurane use was also decreased and extrapolated over a year, and the decrease was equivalent to 70 000 miles driven, over 3,200 gallons of gasoline consumed, or over 31000 pounds of coal burned.

We used an explicit motor sequence learning task to investigate the repetition of chunked action sequences across the OC spectrum. As sequential motor behavior is practiced, action movements appear to get bundled together, and the initial movement of the sequence activates the entire sequence, leaving it relatively insensitive to change. Therefore, compulsive behavior in OCD may be a result of failing to inhibit the full activation of an extensively learned action sequence. METHODS: Fifty-seven participants across the range of OCD symptoms practiced one sequence and then tested on a novel sequence in which one of the middle movements was omitted. Optimal performance for the new sequence required goal-directed inhibition of the original sequence and goal-directed execution of the new sequence instead. To manipulate activation of goal-directed behavior, we added a dual-task condition with a competing auditory tonal N-Back task. Data were analyzed using mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Although we did observe expected learning patterns during learning of the original sequence, slower reaction times for the new sequences, and higher errors in the dual-task condition, performance was not significantly related to either obsessive-compulsive symptoms or distress symptoms. LIMITATIONS: The current study used an analog sample; replication in a treatment seeking sample is warranted.

We therefore conducted a large-scale replication of Kahan, Peters, Dawson, and Slovic (2017), using a pre-specified analysis plan with strict evaluation criteria. We did not find good evidence for motivated numeracy; there are distinct patterns in our data at odds with the core predictions of the theory, most notably (i) there is ideologically congruent responding that is not moderated by numeracy, and (ii) when there is moderation, ideologically congruent responding occurs only at the highest levels of numeracy.

Laboratory and clinical data were collected from our institution as well as other local hospitals patients had been treated at. Outcomes were followed from March 15, 2020 to October 15, 2020. All data was deidentified. Results In a cohort of 225 heart transplant patients, 8 patients were identified after testing positive for Covid-19 infection. The mean and median age of patients was 49.8 and 42 years respectively. 63% of patients were male, and 37% of patients were female. The median and mean time from transplant to diagnosis was 4.1 and 4.5 years. The rate of infection for recently transplanted patients was 11%. Two patients (25%) had atherosclerosis, three patients (37.5%) had diabetes, and five patients (62.5%) had hypertension. Four of the patients (50%) were asymptomatic, 3 patients (37.5%) had acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and 1 patient (12.5%) had dyspnea not requiring oxygen at time of presentation. Four patients (50%) were admitted for treatment. Two patients were treated with remdesvir, one patient with tocilizumab, and one patient with lenrolimab. Immunosuppressive regimens were altered in five patients with decreased mycophenolate mofetil dosing, two patients with decreased tacrolimus dosing, and one patient with decreased cyclosporine dosing.

Clinical and histopathologic characteristics are similar across severely affected patients, suggesting that a common mode of immune reaction may be involved in the immunopathogenesis of ARDS. There may be etiologic substances that have an affinity for respiratory cells and induce lung cell injury in cases of ARDS. These substances originate not only from pathogens, but also from injured host cells. At the molecular level, these substances have various sizes and biochemical characteristics, classifying them as protein substances and non-protein substances. Immune cells and immune proteins may recognize and act on these substances, including pathogenic proteins and peptides, depending upon the size and biochemical properties of the substances (this theory is known as the protein-homeostasis-system hypothesis). The severity or chronicity of ARDS depends on the amount of etiologic substances with corresponding immune reactions, the duration of the appearance of specific immune cells, or the repertoire of specific immune cells that control the substances.

We further report a hierarchical frequency spectrum analysis of five distinct protein structures, which offer insights into how genetic mutations, and the binding of the virus spike protein to the human ACE2 cell receptor directly influence the audio. Applications of the approach may include the development of de novo antibodies by designing protein sequences that match, through melodic counterpoints, the binding sites in the spike protein.

Imatinib 400 mg tablets will be encapsulated using size 000 capsules and cellulose microcrystalline filler. For patients on ventilator or ECMO, imatinib will be given as oral suspension (40 mg/mL). To make the oral suspension, imatinib tablets will be crushed and mixed in Ora-sweet solution to yield a concentration of 40 mg/mL suspension by pharmacy. Additionally, in the absence of supportive microbiological testing results, we confirm that the in-use stability period for the prepared imatinib suspensions will be 24 hours at room temperature or 7 days at refrigerated conditions. The pharmacy staff will follow the American Society Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) guidelines for handling hazardous drugs. Placebo: The matching placebo will be packaged by Investigational Drug Service Pharmacy at University of Maryland Medical Center. The placebos will be prepared using size 000 capsules and cellulose microcrystalline filler. Imatinib 400 mg capsules and placebo capsules will be identical form and color. For patients on ventilator or ECMO, placebo will be given as oral suspension with similar process for making imatinib suspension. Concomitant Medications/supportive care: In both arms, patients can receive concomitant available local standard of care antipyretics, antibacterials, antivirals, antifungals and anti-inflammatory including hydroxychloroquine at the discretion of the treating physician as necessary. For other drug-drug interactions particularly with CYP P450, the treating physician should consider the risk and benefit of drug administration based on available information. Co-administration of off-label immunomodulatory treatments for COVID-19 including but not limited to corticosteroids, sarilumab, clazakizumab, tocilizumab, and anakinra will be allowed but may affect interpretability of study outcomes. The timing, dosing, and duration of these treatments will be meticulously collected, including any of these treatments that may be used for participants who experience progression of COVID-19 disease after study enrollment. Two analyses will be performed, the primary analysis will compare the primary endpoint in the two trial arms irrespective of any other treatment; the second analysis will be stratified for co-administration of immunomodulatory drugs. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with a two-point improvement at Day 14 from baseline using the 8-category ordinal scale. The ordinal scale is an evaluation of the clinical status at the first assessment of a given study day. The scale is as follows: 1) Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities; 2) Not hospitalized, limitation on activities and/or requiring home oxygen; 3) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen C no longer requires ongoing medical care; 4) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise); 5) Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 6) Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 7) Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO; 8) Death. The secondary endpoints include: All-cause mortality at Day 28, All-cause mortality at Day 60, Time to a 2-point clinical improvement difference over baseline, Duration of hospitalization, Duration of ECMO or invasive mechanical ventilation (for subjects who are on ECMO or mechanical ventilation at Day 1), Duration of ICU stay (for subjects who are in ICU at Day 1), Time to SARS-CoV-2 negative by RT-PCR, Proportion of patients with negative oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR on days 5, 10, 14, 21, and 28 after starting treatment, Proportion of subjects with serious adverse events, Proportion of subjects who discontinue study drug due to adverse events. The exploratory endpoints include: Determine the impact of treatment arms on IL-6 levels, Obtain blood/peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for storage to look at transcriptomics in severe disease, Association of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) with severity of illness, Mean change in the ordinal scale from baseline, Time to an improvement of one category from admission using an ordinal scale, Duration of hospitalization, Duration of new oxygen use, Number of oxygenation free days, Duration of new mechanical ventilation, Number of ventilator free days. RANDOMIZATION: Eligible patients will be uniformly randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either imatinib or placebo for 14 days. Both groups will receive the BCC. The randomized treatment allocations use stratified, permuted block randomization with a variable block size; blocks are generated using a validated random number generator. In order to balance the severity of the respiratory illness between the two arms, randomization will be stratified based on radiographic findings and oxygen requirements: 1) Severe disease: evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray or CT scan OR chest auscultation (rales, crackles), and SpO(2) 92% on ambient air or PaO(2)/FiO(2) <300 mmHg, and requires supplemental oxygen administration by nasal cannula, simple face mask, or other similar oxygen delivery device; 2) Critical disease: requires supplemental oxygen delivered by non-rebreather mask or high flow cannula OR use of invasive or non-invasive ventilation OR requiring treatment in an intensive care unit, use of vasopressors, extracorporeal life support, or renal replacement therapy. BLINDING (MASKING): The participants, caregivers, and the statistician are blinded to group assignment. The only people who are not blinded are Site Pharmacists. Blinding will be performed via a specific randomization process. Centralized, concealed randomization will be executed by the Primary Sites Pharmacist. Data on eligible consented cases will be submitted electronically on the appropriate on-study form to the pharmacy, where the patient is randomized to imatinib or placebo. Imatinib 400 mg capsules and placebo capsules will be identical form and color. For patients on ventilator or ECMO, placebo will be given as oral suspension with similar process for making imatinib suspension. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): The trial is designed as a double-blind, two-parallel arm, randomized controlled trial with a uniform (1:1) allocation ratio to: Arm A) Imatinib or Arm B) Placebo. Patients in both arms will receive the BCC per local institutional standards at the discretion of the treating physician. Group sample sizes of 102 in Arm A and 102 in Arm B achieve 80.6% power to detect a difference between the group proportions of 0.20. The proportion in Arm A (imatinib treatment arm) is assumed to be 0.30 under the null hypothesis and 0.50 under the alternative hypothesis. The proportion in Arm B (placebo control arm) is 0.30. The test statistic used is the two-sided Fisher's Exact Test. The significance level of the test is targeted at 0.05. The significance level actually achieved by this design is =0.0385. The power of the test is calculated using binomial enumeration of all possible outcomes. The primary analysis will be conducted using an intention to treat principle (ITT) for participants who at least receive one dose of study drug or placebo. The sample size is not inflated for dropouts. All patients will be evaluable irrespective of the clinical course of their disease. TRIAL STATUS: Current protocol version is 1.2 from May 8, 2020. The recruitment started on June 15, 2020 and is ongoing. We originally anticipated that the trial would finish recruitment by mid 2021. We are aware of the enrollment requirement of approximately 200 patients, which is required to provide scientific integrity of the results. We are also aware of the fact that enrolling this number of patients in a single-site at University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) may take longer than expected, particularly taken into account other competing studies. For this reason, we are actively considering opening the protocol in other sites. After identification of other sites, we will fulfill all regulatory requirements before opening the protocol in other sites. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04394416.

Untact marketing is generating profits by communicating with consumers through non-face-to-face methods and by e-enabled marketing targets. As the changes in the marketing environment, an investigation was conducted on how the empirical value of untact marketing affects consumer satisfaction and consumer's willingness to repurchase, centered on service mobile application. This investigation intends to contribute to the establishment of untact marketing strategy. After using service mobile application that is frequently used in our daily lives, such as delivery apps, shopping apps, and finance apps, we studied consumer satisfaction with their empirical value and their intention to repurchase them and tried to present the direction for the strategic development of untact marketing by revealing the influential relationship. Therefore, empirical values were contemplated, and according to this, concepts of consumer satisfaction, willingness to repurchase were summarized. The research model was constructed based on the theoretical background, and the survey was conducted for empirical analysis. The collected data was obtained using the SPSS 22 program. In this research model, empirical values perceived by consumers using mobile service applications were defined as five factors: hedonic value, practical value, economic value, service value, and reliability value. In this study, consumers seem to be positive about untact marketing, and as the consumer market for the untact marketing expands, it is believed that corporate strategic efforts are needed so that consumers can feel interested, as well as realizing economical, and reasonable value.

Due to its proximity and close links to China, Southeast Asia was one of the first regions to be affected by the outbreak. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia in the general adult population and healthcare workers (HCWs) in Southeast Asia during the course of the first year of the pandemic. METHODS: Several literature databases were systemically searched for articles published up to February 2021 and two reviewers independently evaluated all relevant studies using pre\\\\determined criteria. The prevalence rates of mental health symptoms were calculated using a random\\\\effect meta\\\\analysis model. RESULTS: In total, 32 samples from 25 studies with 20 352 participants were included. Anxiety was assessed in all 25 studies and depression in 15 studies with pooled prevalence rates of 22% and 16%, respectively. Only two studies assessed insomnia, which was estimated at 19%. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was similar among frontline HCWs (18%), general HCWs (17%), and students (20%) while being noticeably higher in the general population (27%). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first systematic review to investigate the mental health impact of the Covid\\\\19 pandemic in Southeast Asia. A considerable proportion of the general population and HCWs reported mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression; the pooled prevalence rater, however, remain significantly lower than those reported in other areas such as China and Europe.","output":"A systematic review and meta\\\\analysis of the mental health symptoms during the Covid\\\\19 pandemic in Southeast Asia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plant viruses are major contributors to crop losses and induce high economic costs worldwide.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A tumor ablation database was retrospectively reviewed for sternal cryoablation procedures performed between January 2005 and June 2013, which yielded 15 procedures to treat 12 sternal metastases in 12 patients (five men). Median patient age was 57 years (range, 38-80 y). Metastases arose from five primary sites (breast, lung, kidney, ampulla, and thyroid), and median tumor size was 3.8 cm (range, 2.2-7.5 cm). Seven patients (58%) underwent cryoablation for pain palliation, and five (42%) underwent cryoablation for local tumor control of oligometastatic disease. Clinical outcomes (including complications, local tumor control, and pain response) were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS Mean pain scores decreased from 7.0  1.9 (median, 7; range, 4-10) at baseline to 1.8  1.2 (median, 1.5; range, 0-4) following cryoablation (P = .00049). Two patients had durable pain palliation, and four had greater than 1 month of pain relief, with a median duration of 5.7 months (range, 1.5-14.7 mo). Two patients in whom recurrent pain developed underwent repeat cryoablation, with durable pain relief. Allowing for a single repeat treatment, local tumor control was achieved in four of five patients (80%) treated for this indication, with median follow-up of 8.4 months (range, 2.6-13.6 mo). In one patient (8%), an infectious complication developed that was successfully treated with antibiotics on an outpatient basis.

Meanwhile, P4HB can be prepared via the ring-opening polymerization of ?3-butyrolactone. In this contribution, high molecular weight P4HB from chemosynthesis is electrospun into fibrous membrane, showing good mechanical properties that match the natural dura mater. Such P4HB membrane induces fast cellular migration, adhesion, and proliferation of fibroblasts in vitro. Subcutaneous implantation in rats demonstrates excellent biocompatibility of the P4HB membrane with proper biodegradation behaviors. After implantation in the rabbit dural defect model as an onlay graft, the P4HB membranes prevent cerebrospinal fluid leakage and regenerate dura tissue without detecting any local or systematic infections or foreign body responses. Thus, the electrospun P4HB membranes may be particularly useful as artificial dural substitutes to induce wound closure and tissue regeneration, which will be of great benefit to neurosurgery in the future.","output":"Robust Electrospun Nanofibers from Chemosynthetic Poly(4-hydroxybutyrate) as Artificial Dural Substitute"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditionally viewed as important in the regulation of blood pressure, the renin-angiotensin system - and specifically the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-angiotensin (Ang) II-AT(1 )receptor axis - may play a prominent role to promote inflammation and fibrosis.

METHODS: Hospitalized patients with oxygen saturation 94%, a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR in the past 4 days and radiographic evidence of pneumonia were randomized 1:1 to receive 5d or 10d of intravenous RDV. We compared d14 clinical outcomes of patients from different geographical areas, as measured by mortality rates, change in clinical status from baseline (BL) on a 7-point ordinal scale and change in O2 requirements from BL. Based on previous analyses in compassionate use data showing region as an important predictor of outcome, Italy was examined separately from other regions. RESULTS: 397 patients were treated with RDV, of which 229 (58%) were in the US, 77 (19%) Italy, 61 (15% in Spain), 12 (3%) Republic of Korea, 9 (2%) Singapore, 4 (1%) Germany, 4 (1%) Hong Kong and 1 (< 1%) Taiwan. BL clinical status was worse in Italy compared to other regions (72% vs 17% requiring high-flow oxygen delivery or higher), and Italian patients were more likely to be male than patients from other regions (69% vs 63%). Overall results showed 5d RDV was as effective as 10d. Mortality at d14 was higher in Italy (18%) compared to all other countries except Italy (7%).

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all COVID patients requiring ECMO support at our facility. Patient demographics, co-morbidities, measures of acuity, and blood product utilization were identified. Patients were stratified by the presence of a major bleed and the need for dialysis. The primary outcome was blood product utilization. Linear regression models were used to assess predictors of the need for blood products. RESULTS: From 2020-2021, 41 patients with COVID-19 were included in our study. Over a total of 1601 days of support, COVID ECMO patients received 755 units of packed red blood cells(PRBC), 51 units of fresh frozen plasma(FFP), 326 platelets, and 1702 cryoprecipitate, amounting to 18.4 units PRBC per patient or 3.30 units per week of ECMO support. Both major bleeding and the need for dialysis were associated with higher rates of transfusion of PRBC, FFP, and platelets. The average non-bleeding COVID ECMO patient who did not need dialysis required 2.17 units of PRBC, 0.12 units of FFP, 0.76 platelets, and 8.36 of cryoprecipitate per week of ECMO support. On multivariable linear regression analysis, each day on ECMO was associated with 0.30[0.19-0.42,p<0.01] units of PRBC.

Research on MI has made significant progress in feature information detection and machine learning decoding algorithms, but there are still problems, such as a low overall recognition rate and large differences in individual execution effects, which make the development of MI run into a bottleneck. Aiming at solving this bottleneck problem, the current study optimized the quality of the MI original signal by enhancing the difficulty of imagination tasks, conducted the qualitative and quantitative analyses of EEG rhythm characteristics, and used quantitative indicators, such as ERD mean value and recognition rate. Research on the comparative analysis of the lower limb MI of different tasks, namely, high-frequency motor imagination (HFMI) and low-frequency motor imagination (LFMI), was conducted. The results validate the following: the average ERD of HFMI (?1.827) is less than that of LFMI (?1.3487) in the alpha band, so did (?3.4756 < ?2.2891) in the beta band. In the alpha and beta characteristic frequency bands, the average ERD of HFMI is smaller than that of LFMI, and the ERD values of the two are significantly different (p=0.0074 < 0.01; r = 0.945). The ERD intensity STD values of HFMI are less than those of LFMI. which suggests that the ERD intensity individual difference among the subjects is smaller in the HFMI mode than in the LFMI mode. The average recognition rate of HFMI is higher than that of LFMI (87.84% > 76.46%), and the recognition rate of the two modes is significantly different (p=0.0034 < 0.01; r = 0.429).

A possible worldwide sovereign debt crisis could emerge, in short term, for supply chains blockage due to its slowing-down in many countries. China, having the second largest economy in the world, is crucial for the stability and sustainability of the economic recovery. China endures a long-term growth since 2000;nevertheless, a large amount of that growth is contributed by the government debt, which was spent on infrastructures. The accumulation of debts is a potential risk to the future growth of China. This research evaluates the central government and local government debts with a series of indicators. The weights of indicators are determined by objective methods of the CRITIC approach. Results confirm that the central government debt of China is on the edge of risk, while the risk of local governments debt is already in a concerning danger. The local government risk is 50% higher than the central government's risk. Moreover, the K-means clustering algorithm performed on data, collected from various provinces, suggests that the local government debts of China follow a pattern of geographical distribution;that is, the closer to the coast, the lesser the risk, which is in accordance with the pattern of labor flowing. Labors are attracted by job opportunities which lie in the well-developed regions of China. This is confirmed by the crosscheck with the wage growth data. This indicates that the less developed areas of China rely more heavily on debt-investment stimulation that could be of a potential stagnation because the yield of investment follows diminishing marginal returns and the relative lacking labor weakens the potential economic growth.","output":"Clustering Analysis of Risk Divergence of China Government's Debts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Logical reasoning over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is a fundamental technique that can provide efficient querying mechanism over large and incomplete databases. Current approaches employ spatial geometries such as boxes to learn query representations that encompass the answer entities and model the logical operations of projection and intersection. However, their geometry is restrictive and leads to non-smooth strict boundaries, which further results in ambiguous answer entities. Furthermore, previous works propose transformation tricks to handle unions which results in non-closure and, thus, cannot be chained in a stream. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Entity Representation Model (PERM) to encode entities as a Multivariate Gaussian density with mean and covariance parameters to capture its semantic position and smooth decision boundary, respectively. Additionally, we also define the closed logical operations of projection, intersection, and union that can be aggregated using an end-to-end objective function.

Consensus suggestions can standardise care, thereby improving outcomes and facilitating future research. METHODS: An International Task Force was composed and agreement regarding courses of action was measured using the Convergence of Opinion on Recommendations and Evidence (CORE) process. 70% agreement was necessary to make a consensus suggestion. RESULTS: The Task Force made consensus suggestions to treat patients with acute COVID-19 pneumonia with remdesivir and dexamethasone but suggested against hydroxychloroquine except in the context of a clinical trial; these are revisions of prior suggestions resulting from the interim publication of several randomised trials. It also suggested that COVID-19 patients with a venous thromboembolic event be treated with therapeutic anticoagulant therapy for 3a? months. The Task Force was unable to reach sufficient agreement to yield consensus suggestions for the post-hospital care of COVID-19 survivors. The Task Force fell one vote shy of suggesting routine screening for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. CONCLUSIONS: The Task Force addressed questions related to pharmacotherapy in patients with COVID-19 and the post-hospital care of survivors, yielding several consensus suggestions.

We evaluated the association between ACEI or ARB use and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection among patients with hypertension. Methods and Results We identified patients with hypertension as of March 1, 2020 (index date) from Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Patients who received ACEIs, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, thiazide diuretics (TD), or no therapy were identified using outpatient pharmacy data covering the index date. Outcome of interest was a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test for COVID-19 between March 1 and May 6, 2020. Patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were identified within 1 year preindex date. Among 824 650 patients with hypertension, 16 898 (2.0%) were tested for COVID-19. Of those tested, 1794 (10.6%) had a positive result. Overall, exposure to ACEIs or ARBs was not statistically significantly associated with COVID-19 infection after propensity score adjustment (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% CI, 0.90-1.25) for ACEIs versus calcium channel blockers/beta blockers/TD; OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.91-1.31 for ARBs versus calcium channel blockers/beta blockers/TD). The associations between ACEI use and COVID-19 infection varied in different age groups (P-interaction=0.03). ACEI use was associated with lower odds of COVID-19 among those aged &#8805;85 years (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.12-0.77). Use of no antihypertensive medication was significantly associated with increased odds of COVID-19 infection compared with calcium channel blockers/beta blockers/TD (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.11-1.56). Conclusions Neither ACEI nor ARB use was associated with increased likelihood of COVID-19 infection. Decreased odds of COVID-19 infection among adults &#8805;85 years using ACEIs warrants further investigation.","output":"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers Use and COVID-19 Infection Among 824 650 Patients With Hypertension From a US Integrated Healthcare System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CT imaging is crucial for diagnosis, assessment and staging COVID-19 infection. Follow-up scans every 3-5 days are often recommended for disease progression. It has been reported that bilateral and peripheral ground glass opacification (GGO) with or without consolidation are predominant CT findings in COVID-19 patients. However, due to lack of computerized quantification tools, only qualitative impression and rough description of infected areas are currently used in radiological reports. In this paper, a deep learning (DL)-based segmentation system is developed to automatically quantify infection regions of interest (ROIs) and their volumetric ratios w.r.t. the lung. The performance of the system was evaluated by comparing the automatically segmented infection regions with the manually-delineated ones on 300 chest CT scans of 300 COVID-19 patients. For fast manual delineation of training samples and possible manual intervention of automatic results, a human-in-the-loop (HITL) strategy has been adopted to assist radiologists for infection region segmentation, which dramatically reduced the total segmentation time to 4 minutes after 3 iterations of model updating. The average Dice simiarility coefficient showed 91.6% agreement between automatic and manual infaction segmentations, and the mean estimation error of percentage of infection (POI) was 0.3% for the whole lung.

The solution provides a tool for analyzing density of targets in a specific area, useful when checking contact proximities of a target along a route. The principle consists of the detection of mobile devices that use active Bluetooth connections, such as personal notebooks, smartphones, smartwatches, Bluetooth headphones, etc. to locate and track their movement in the dedicated area. For this purpose, a specific configuration of three BT sensors is used and RSSI levels compared, based on a combination of differential location estimates. The solution may also be suited for indoor localization where GPS signals are usually weak or missing; for example, in public places such as subway stations or trains, hospitals, airport terminals and so on. The applicability of this solution is estimated to be vast, ranging from travel and transport information services, route guidance, passenger flows tracking, and path recovery for persons suspected to have SARS-COV2 or other contagious viruses, serving epidemiologic enquiries. The specific configuration of Bluetooth detectors may be installed either in a fixed location, or in a public transport vehicle. A set of filters and algorithms for triangulation-based location of detected targets and movement tracking, based on artificial intelligence is employed. When applied in the public transport field, this setup can be also developed to extract additional information on traffic, such as private traffic flowing, or passenger movement patterns along the vehicle route, improved location in absence of GPS signals, etc. Field tests have been carried out for determining different aspects concerning indoor location accuracy, reliability, selection of targets and filtering.

The vertebrate models used for this purpose are often the object of ethical consideration. Though invertebrate models including Galleria mellonella (GM) have demonstrated the ability to be used to assess the toxicity of various products. To the authors knowledge, GM has never been exploited to determine the toxicity of medicinal plants. AIM: The aim of this study was to demonstrate the potential of GM larvae as a simple, inexpensive, and rapid model for the evaluation of the toxicity of herbal medicines. METHOD: In this study, the toxicity of aqueous and ethanolic (80%, v/v) extracts of seven well known plants from Cameroon namely leaves of Cymbopogon citratus (DC.) Stapf, Moringa oleifera Lam and Vernonia amygdalina Delile; barks of Cinchona officinalis and Enantia chlorantha Oliv; barks and seeds of Garcinia lucida Vesque and leaves and seeds of Azadirachta indica (Neem) was evaluated using the larval form of GM. The median lethal doses (LD(50)), 90% (LD(90)), and 100% (LD(100)) were determined using the spline cubic survival curves and equations from the data obtained on the survival rate of GM 24 hours after the injection with the extracts. RESULTS: We found that distilled water extracted a more important mass of phytochemical compounds (7.4%C21.2%) compared to ethanolic solution (5.8%C12.4%). LD varied depending on the plant materials and ethanolic extracts (hydroalcoholic extract, (HAE)) were more toxic to GM than aqueous ones. The LD(50) (mg/ml) of the tested extracts varied from 4.87 [3.90 g/kg body weight (bw)] to >200 (> 166.67 g/kg bw), the LD(90) (mg/ml) from 25.00 (18.52 g/kg bw) to >200 (> 181.82 g/kg bw) and LD(100) (mg/ml) from 45.00 (40.91 g/kg bw) to > 200 (>181.82 g/kg bw). The HAE of A. indica seed and C. officinalis bark exhibited the highest toxicity with LD(50) (g/kg bw) of 3.90 and 4.81, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results obtained in this study suggest that GM can be used as a sensitive, reliable, and robust eco-friendly model to gauge the toxicity of medicinal plants.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA DCD livers are associated with increased risk of primary nonfunction, poor function, and nonanastomotic strictures (NAS), leading to underutilization. METHODS A single center, retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on 233 DCD liver transplants performed using SCS, NRP, or NMP between January 2013 and October 2020. RESULTS Ninety-seven SCS, 69 NRP, and 67 NMP DCD liver transplants were performed, with 6-month and 3-year transplant survival (graft survival noncensored for death) rates of 87%, 94%, 90%, and 76%, 90%, and 76%, respectively. NRP livers had a lower 6-month risk-adjusted Cox proportional hazard for transplant failure compared to SCS (hazard ratio 0.30, 95%CI 0.08-1.05, P = 0.06). NRP and NMP livers had a risk-adjusted estimated reduction in the mean model for early allograft function score of 1.52 (P < 0.0001) and 1.19 (P < 0.001) respectively compared to SCS. Acute kidney injury was more common with SCS (55% vs 39% NRP vs 40% NMP; P = 0.08), with a lower risk-adjusted peak-to-baseline creatinine ratio in the NRP (P = 0.02). No NRP liver had clinically significant NAS in contrast to SCS (14%) and NMP (11%, P = 0.009), with lower risk-adjusted odds of overall NAS development compared to SCS (odds ratio = 0.2, 95%CI 0.06-0.72, P = 0.01).

Breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) are a poor prognostic indicator and associated with very poor survival and only a minority of patients survive >1 year despite oncological treatment. The rising prevalence of patients with BCBM represent an increasing unmet healthcare need. However, in the UK there is a paucity of data about prevalence, survival and management. Guidance on managing brain metastases is improving, however it is unclear how this has been applied in the context of BCBM and whether recommended standards are uniformly applied across the UK METHODS: PRIMROSE is a trainee collaborative-led initiative to estimate BCBM prevalence, assess current practice (comparing national/international standards) and determine long term outcomes/sequalae.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate perceptions, preparedness, and knowledge among U.S. internists with regard to Ebola risk. DESIGN: Cross-sectional Web-based national survey distributed by e-mail between December 2014 and January 2015. PARTICIPANTS: Practicing U.S. internists participating in a research panel representative of American College of Physicians (ACP) membership. MAIN MEASURES: Respondents perceptions of Ebola, reported sources of information, and reported management of possible Ebola cases. The primary predictor was the possibility of encountering Ebola (based on respondents geographic proximity to designated airports or confirmed Ebola cases, or on their patients travel histories). Pre-specified outcomes included reported management intensity in clinical vignettes involving patients at low risk of symptomatic Ebola as well as reported Ebola preparedness. KEY RESULTS: The survey response rate was 46.1 %. Among the 202 respondents, 9.9 % (95 % CI 6.2C14.9 %) reported that they had recently evaluated a patient who had traveled to West Africa. Seventy percent (95 % CI 63.0C76.0 %) reported a practice-level protocol. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was the most popular source for Ebola information (75.2 %, 95 % CI 68.7C81.0 %). Most respondents felt very (45.0 %) or somewhat prepared (52.0 %) to communicate information about or diagnose Ebola, especially those with the possibility of encountering Ebola and those who reported medical journals, professional groups, or government as information sources. One-fifth of respondents (19.8 %, 95 % CI 14.5C26.0 %) reported overly intensive management for low-risk patients. Those with the possibility of encountering Ebola were less likely to report overly intensive management (3.1 vs. 22.9 %, p = 0.011).

Typically, quarantine deactivates normal economic interactions, thus causing huge economic loss [3]. Moreover, the lack of versatility and resiliency also brings safety challenges on some occasions. In this investigation, a performance scoring quarantine index, referred to as QDex, is developed to provide guidance for a new concept of dynamic geofencing quarantine directive. QDex evaluation features adaptive dynamic geofencing (QEDG) for quarantine. In QEDG, QDex is newly defined to evaluate the dynamic geofencing in relation to epidemic control and economic loss. They are represented by two formulated indicators, namely the transmission risk (TR) and the active profit (AP), which are related to the isolator bio status (e.g., body temperature). Based on the evaluation results of TR and AP, QEDG provides a proper geofencing indication for quarantine, which decreases epidemic transmission and restores economic recovery.

Therefore, there is increasing interest in whether home measurements of lung function could be used in place of clinic testing. However, little is known as to whether home spirometry accurately reflects clinic measurements, and whether it provides sufficient precision to inform treatment decisions. Therefore, we evaluated the agreement between home and clinic measurements of trough FEV1 using data from the CAPTAIN study. Methods: This Phase IIIA, double-blind, 24-52- week, parallel-group study randomized adults with uncontrolled asthma despite inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting 2-agonist therapy. Treatment: once-daily FF/VI (100/25, 200/25mcg) or FF/UMEC/VI (100/31.25/25, 100/62.5/25, 200/31.25/25, 200/62.5/25mcg) (ELLIPTA inhaler). Trough FEV1 and other spirometry measurements were taken in clinic at approximately the same time in the morning using a MasterScope device. Patients also measured trough FEV1 each morning at home using a peak flow meter (AM3 device);three measurements were performed at each time point, with the highest measurement recorded. We used the Bland-Altman method to assess agreement between clinic trough FEV1 and the average of the home trough FEV1 measurements collected on the same day and 2 days prior to the clinic measurement, at baseline and at Week 24 (post hoc analyses). Only patients with a value for both clinic and home trough FEV1 were included (baseline: n=2434, Week 24: n=2261). Results: Agreement between clinic and home trough FEV1 measurements was poor (Figure). At baseline, the lower and upper limits of agreement were -812 mL and 943 mL, respectively, while at Week 24 these were -771 mL and 980 mL, respectively. In total, 6% of patients were outside the limits of agreement at baseline (n=151) and Week 24 (n=143) (Figure). Conclusions: This comparison of home and clinic spirometry in the CAPTAIN study suggests that home spirometry performed with the AM3 device cannot be used as an alternative to clinic spirometry, and that caution should be exercised when using home spirometry data in research or clinical care. The reason for the lack of agreement between home and clinic trough FEV1 measurements is not clear. Possible explanations include the different devices and methodologies, and lack of supervision and coaching for home measurements. However, it is possible that home spirometry may provide different and potentially complementary information to clinic measurements.

Prolonged ventilation was associated with pneumonia during hospitalization and unfavorable functional outcome (mRS 3) and death at follow-up (Mann-Whitney U test; P  .001). According to receiver operating characteristic analysis, a cutoff after 24 hours predicted unfavorable functional outcome with a sensitivity and specificity of 60% and 78%, respectively. Our results imply that delayed extubation was not associated with a less favorable clinical outcome compared with immediate extubation after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS Short ventilation times are associated with a lower pneumonia rate and more favorable clinical outcome. Cautious interpretation of our data implies that whether patients are extubated immediately after the procedure is irrelevant for clinical outcome as long as ventilation does not exceed 24 hours.","output":"Clinical Impact of Ventilation Duration in Patients with Stroke Undergoing Interventional Treatment under General Anesthesia: The Shorter the Better?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the religious lifestyles of practicing female Roman Catholics in Belgium.

To better understand the genetic determinants behind the ability of ACE2 orthologs to support viral entry, we compared koala and mouse ACE2 sequences with that of human and identified the key residues in koala and mouse ACE2 that restrict viral receptor activity.

measurement of the patients condition, reported directly by the patient, without the interpretation by a clinician or anyone else [1] Recently, there has been a growing interest in the integration of PROs as part of data collection about toxicity and symptoms experienced by patients with cancer This integration could have relevant implications not only for a more accurate reporting of adverse events and definition of quality of life (QoL) within clinical trials [2], but also for a better patients management in routine clinical practice [3] Many tools and questionnaires have been validated to properly measure QoL and symptoms in patients with lung cancer The inclusion of these measures in clinical trials has several important advantages It allows providing a patient-focused assessment of the burden and the impact of disease Moreover, it allows completely assessing the clinical benefit of a therapy, by complementing the information provided by commonly used efficacy endpoints, including overall survival, and the traditional description of safety based on physicians assessment Furthermore, the availability of QoL data from trials could allow a more accurate patient-physician communication about the treatment strategies offered in clinical practice However, a systematic review that we performed in order to evaluate the adoption of QoL among endpoints in randomized phase III trials conducted in lung cancer, published between 2012 and 2018 in 11 major journals, showed quite disappointing findings [4] Beyond the importance in clinical trials, PROs can play an important role in clinical practice Several studies have demonstrated a clear benefit in terms of patients QoL [5,6] Our experience, focused on the adoption of PROs in patients receiving active anticancer treatment at Mauriziano Hospital in Turin, showed that the introduction of PROs, thanks to an active role of nurses, was feasible, produced high patients satisfaction and a significant QoL improvement compared to the traditional modality of visit [6] In details, we compared 2 groups: patients in the control group underwent usual visits, while patients in the PRO group received a paper questionnaire by a dedicated nurse before each visit, in order to provide information about symptoms and toxicities After 1 month, mean change from baseline of global QoL was significantly better in the PRO group, and significantly higher proportion of patients obtained a clinically significant improvement in global QoL score In addition to QoL benefit, several studies have shown a significant improvement in overall survival with the adoption of electronic PROs in patients with lung cancer [7-9] In a pivotal randomized trial involving US patients with different solid tumors (including lung cancer) undergoing chemotherapy, patients assigned to the control arm received usual care, while subjects assigned to experimental arm could report their symptoms remotely from home, using tablet computers or computer kiosks [5,7] Doctors received a report of symptoms referred by patients during visits, and nurses received email alerts when patients reported severe or worsening symptoms Beyond the QoL improvement (the primary endpoint of the trial), a significantly longer life expectancy in the experimental arm (median 31 2 months) compared to the usual care arm (26 0 months) was reported [7] A French randomized trial, conducted in lung cancer patients without evidence of disease progression after or during initial treatment, compared a web-mediated follow-up algorithm (experimental arm), based on weekly self-scored patient symptoms, with routine follow-up with CT scans scheduled every 3-6 months according to the disease stage (control arm) [8] In the experimental arm, the oncologist received automatically an alert email when self-scored symptoms matched predefined criteria Notably, a significant improvement in overall survival was found in patients assigned to experimental arm [9] The adoption of electronic PROs in clinical practice could have many advantages [10] Regular discussion of PROs questionnaires, filled out electronically by patients and received by nurses or doctors, could allow a systematic check of the clinical trend of symptoms and side-effects The early, proactive identification of worsening symptoms and toxicities could help prevent the occurrence of severe adverse events needing ER access and hospitalization Adoption and discussion of PROs would reasonably have a positive psychological impact on patients, increasing their satisfaction with healthcare services While the adoption of electronic PROs could initially appear as a challenging organizational effort, we believe that their benefits will definitely be evident in the long-term The use of PROs may allow a significant benefit in terms of patients QoL, and this should be more than enough to consider its adoption in clinical practice, which - overall survival benefit or not C is

Clinical and laboratory parameters at the time of admission and follow-up data were recorded. Systemic renal tubular dysfunction was evaluated via 24-h urine collections in a subgroup of 55 patients. RESULTS: In total, 823 patients were enrolled (50.5% male) with a mean age of 60.9  14.9 years. AKI occurred in 38 (40.9%) ICU cases but only 6 (0.8%) non-ICU cases. Using forward stepwise Cox regression analysis, we found eight independent risk factors for AKI including decreased platelet level, lower albumin level, lower phosphorus level, higher level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), urea, and prothrombin time (PT) on admission. For every 0.1 mmol/L decreases in serum phosphorus level, patients had a 1.34-fold (95% CI 1.14C1.58) increased risk of AKI. Patients with hypophosphatemia were likely to be older and with lower lymphocyte count, lower serum albumin level, lower uric acid, higher LDH, and higher CRP. Furthermore, serum phosphorus level was positively correlated with phosphate tubular maximum per volume of filtrate (TmP/GFR) (Pearson r = 0.66, p < .001) in subgroup analysis, indicating renal phosphate loss via proximal renal tubular dysfunction.

Pulsatile flow impacts greatly on organ function and microcirculation, however, the effects of pulsatile flow on hemodynamics and inflammatory responses during ECMO are unknown. An in vivo study was launched aiming at comparing the two perfusion modes in ECMO. METHODS: Fourteen beagles were randomly allocated into two groups: the pulsatile group (n=7) and the non-pulsatile group (n=7). ECMO was conducted using the i-Cor system for 24 hours. Hemodynamic parameters including surplus hemodynamic energy (SHE), energy equivalent pressure (EEP), oxygenator pressure drop (OPD), and circuit pressure drop (CPD) were monitored. To assess inflammatory responses during ECMO, levels of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-8, and transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) were measured. RESULTS: EEP and SHE were markedly higher in pulsatile circuits when compared with the conventional circuits. Between-group differences in both OPD and CPD reached statistical significance. Significant decreases in TNF- were seen in animals treated with pulsatile flows at 2 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours as well as a decrease in IL-1 at 24 hours during ECMO. The TGF-1 levels were significantly higher in pulsatile circuits from 2 hours to 24 hours. The changes in IL-6 and IL-8 levels were insignificant.

The burden is heavier for the more vulnerable economies in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), who must juggle meeting strict greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reduction goals, significant fossil-fuel reliance, and pressure to respond to current pandemic concerns that require an increasing share of limited public resources, while facing severe repercussions for non-compliance. Thus, the main goals of this research are: (i) to generate reliable aggregate GHG projections for CEE countries;(ii) to assess whether these economies are on track to meet their binding pollution reduction targets;(iii) to pin-point countries where more in-depth analysis using spatial inventories of GHGs at a finer resolution is further needed to uncover specific areas that should be targeted by additional measures;and (iv) to perform geo-spatial analysis for the most at-risk country, Poland. Seven statistical and machine-learning models are fitted through automated forecasting algorithms to predict the aggregate GHGs in nine CEE countries for the 2019C2050 horizon. Estimations show that CEE countries (except Romania and Bulgaria) will not meet the set pollution reduction targets for 2030 and will unanimously miss the 2050 carbon neutrality target without resorting to carbon credits or offsets. Austria and Slovenia are the least likely to meet the 2030 emissions reduction targets, whereas Poland (in absolute terms) and Slovenia (in relative terms) are the farthest from meeting the EUs 2050 net-zero policy targets. The findings thus stress the need for additional measures that go beyond the status quo, particularly in Poland, Austria, and Slovenia. Geospatial analysis for Poland uncovers that Krakow is the city where pollution is the most concentrated with several air pollutants surpassing EU standards. Short-term projections of PM2.5 levels indicate that the air quality in Krakow will remain below EU and WHO standards, highlighting the urgency of policy interventions.

The role of neutralizing antibody (NAb) response in disease progression remains elusive. This study determined the seroprevalence of 733 non-COVID-19 individuals from April 2018 to February 2020 in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and compared the neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses of eight COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with those of 42 patients not admitted to the ICU. We found that NAb against SARS-CoV-2 was not detectable in any of the anonymous serum specimens from the 733 non-COVID-19 individuals. The peak serum geometric mean NAb titer was significantly higher among the eight ICU patients than the 42 non-ICU patients (7280 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1468-36099]) vs (671 [95% CI, 368-1223]). Furthermore, NAb titer increased significantly at earlier infection stages among ICU patients than among non-ICU patients. The median number of days to reach the peak Nab titers after symptoms onset was shorter among the ICU patients (17.6) than that of the non-ICU patients (20.1). Multivariate analysis showed that oxygen requirement and fever during admission were the only clinical factors independently associated with higher NAb titers. Our data suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was unlikely to have silently spread before the COVID-19 emergence in Hong Kong. ICU patients had an accelerated and augmented NAb response compared to non-ICU patients, which was associated with disease severity.

To help HDM recipients increase their nutritional intake, HDM agencies may provide expanded meal options that allow older adults to have greater autonomy over their meal selection; however, the extent to which recipients are able to select nutritious meals that are responsive to their health complexities is unknown. This study examined the nutritional content of meals selected by HDM recipients enrolled in an expanded menu plan through a large HDM agency. Data were drawn from a retrospective chart review of 130 HDM recipients who had the option of selecting their own HDM meals and frequency of meal delivery. Findings indicate that older adults who selected their own meals chose meals that were significantly lower in protein, potassium, fat, and calories. The lack of these nutrients suggests that older adults enrolled in expanded menu plans should be referred to registered dietitian nutritionists who can provide skilled guidance in meal selection. To address this need, we also describe and provide preliminary data representing a referral program designed to connect HDM recipients to dietetic services with the goal of optimizing older adult nutrition and health-related outcomes.","output":"Implementing a Community-Based Initiative to Improve Nutritional Intake among Home-Delivered Meal Recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are ubiquitous persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that are known neuroendocrine disrupting chemicals with adverse neurodevelopmental effects. PBDEs may act as risk factors for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), characterized by abnormal psychosocial functioning, although direct evidence is currently lacking. Using a translational exposure model, we tested the hypothesis that maternal transfer of a commercial mixture of PBDEs, DE-71, produces ASD-relevant behavioral and neurochemical deficits in female offspring. C57Bl6/N mouse dams (F0) were exposed to DE-71 via oral administration of 0 (VEH/CON), 0.1 (L-DE-71) or 0.4 (H-DE-71) mg/kg bw/d from 3 wk prior to gestation through end of lactation. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated in utero and lactational transfer of PBDEs (in ppb) to F1 female offspring brain tissue at postnatal day (PND) 15 which was reduced by PND 110. Neurobehavioral testing of social novelty preference (SNP) and social recognition memory (SRM) revealed that adult L-DE-71 F1 offspring display deficient short- and long-term SRM, in the absence of reduced sociability, and increased repetitive behavior. These effects were concomitant with reduced olfactory discrimination of social odors. Additionally, L-DE-71 exposure also altered short-term novel object recognition memory but not anxiety or depressive-like behavior. Moreover, F1 L-DE-71 displayed downregulated mRNA transcripts for oxytocin (Oxt) in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and supraoptic nucleus, and vasopressin (Avp) in the BNST and upregulated Avp1ar in BNST, and Oxtr in the paraventricular nucleus.

It was therefore hypothesized that polymorphisms of the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene affects the risk and outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). DESIGN Prospective, observational study. PATIENTS AND SETTINGS The ARDS group consisted of 101 patients treated at the medical intensive care unit; the control groups consisted of 138 \\"at-risk\\" patients treated at the medical intensive care unit due to acute respiratory failure but did not meet the ARDS criteria throughout the hospital course, and 210 non-at-risk subjects. INTERVENTION None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The ARDS patients and control subjects were genotyped for the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene. Association of the polymorphism and the risk and the outcome of ARDS was analyzed. There was no significant difference in the frequencies of the genotypes between the ARDS, at-risk, and non-at-risk groups. The 28-day mortality rates were significantly different between the three angiotensin-converting enzyme genotypes (42%, 65%, and 75% for II, ID, and , respectively; p = .036). Survival analysis showed that the II genotype favorably affected 28-day survival (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.81; p = .007), whereas ARDS caused by hospital-acquired pneumonia had a negative effect (hazard ratio, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-4.40; p = .008). The II genotype (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.87; p = .012) and ARDS caused by hospital-acquired pneumonia (hazard ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-3.68; p = .006) were also significant prognostic factors for the in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS The angiotensin-converting enzyme I/D polymorphism is a significant prognostic factor for the outcome of ARDS.

METHODS: The study, which followed a descriptive, cross\\\\sectional design, surveyed 236 Omani nursing students via an online questionnaire containing two standardized scales: the Self\\\\Directed Learning Readiness Scale for Nursing Education and the Learning Style Scales. RESULTS: Nursing students were identified as having a low level of SDL (mean = 149.58). Probation status ( = ?0.165; p = 0.021) was negatively associated with SDL. In terms of LS, solitary ( = 0.217; p = 0.001), competitive ( = 0.201; p = 0.005), imaginative ( = 0.19; p = 0.012), and perceptive LS ( = 0.437; p = 0.0) were positively associated with SDL.

METHODS: IBD patients (&#8805;18 years) at the outpatient clinic at Oslo University Hospital were included and answered a self-report questionnaire including concerns regarding their disease, medical therapy and follow-up during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 522 IBD patients were included, 317 Crohn's disease, 205 ulcerative colitis, 386 patients <50 years. Eighteen percent were in obligatory quarantine, and more often patients <50 years compared to patients &#8805;50 years. Five patients tested positive to SARS- CoV-2. A higher proportion <50 years reported worries for their medical treatment and risk of COVID -19 disease compared to those &#8805;50 years. Forty percent avoided family, two-thirds avoided friends, and 4% cancelled their scheduled consultation at the hospital. The hospital changed physical consultation to telephone consultation for 15% of the patients. The preferred follow-up was physical consultation.

Design Longitudinal ecological study Setting 307 Lower-tier local authorities in England Primary outcome measure Age-standardised COVID-19 mortality rates by local authority and decile of index of multiple deprivation. Results Local authorities that started recording COVID-19 deaths earlier tended to be more deprived, and more deprived authorities saw faster increases in their death rates. By 2020-04-06 (week 15, the time the March 23rd lockdown could have begun affecting deaths) the cumulative death rate in local authorities in the two most deprived deciles of IMD was 54% higher than the rate in the two least deprived deciles. By 2020-07-04 (week 27), this gap had narrowed to 29%. Thus, inequalities in mortality rates by decile of deprivation persisted throughout the first wave, but reduced somewhat during the lockdown. Conclusions This study found significant differences in the dynamics of COVID-19 mortality at the local authority level, resulting in inequalities in cumulative mortality rates during the first wave of the pandemic. The first lockdown in England was fairly strict - and the study found that it particularly benefited those living in the more deprived local authorities.

Previous studies of coronavirus replication complex organization and protein interactions have utilized protein overexpression studies and immunofluorescence of fixed cells. Additionally, live-imaging studies of coronavirus replicase proteins have used fluorescent reporter molecules fused to replicase proteins, but expressed from nonnative locations, mostly late-transcribed subgenomic mRNAs, in the presence or absence of the native protein. Thus, the timing and targeting of native replicase proteins expressed in real time from native locations in the genome remain unknown. In this study, we tested whether reporter molecules could be expressed from the replicase polyprotein of murine hepatitis virus as fusions with nonstructural protein 2 or 3 and whether such reporters could define the targeting and activity of replicase proteins during infection. We demonstrate that the fusion of green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase with either nonstructural protein 2 or 3 is tolerated and that these reporter-replicase fusions can be used to quantitate replication complex formation and virus replication. The results show that the replicase gene has flexibility to accommodate a foreign gene addition and can be used directly to study replicase complex formation and evolution during infection as well as to provide highly sensitive and specific markers for protein translation and genome replication. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses that are important agents of disease, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Replication is associated with multiple virus-induced membrane structures that evolve during infection; however, the dynamics of this process remain poorly understood. In this study, we tested whether reporter molecules expressed from native locations within the replicase polyprotein of murine hepatitis virus as fusions with nonstructural proteins could define the expression and targeting of replicase proteins during infection in live cells. We demonstrate that the replicase gene tolerates the introduction of green fluorescent protein or firefly luciferase as fusions with replicase proteins.

MethodsTo identify asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2, we implemented a longitudinal screening program for critical on-site employees within our research institute in early April 2020. We conducted a survey of both on-site employees and those working from home in order to measure their reactions to the testing program.

In spite of the high sequence identity of SARS-CoV-2 with its closely related SARS-CoV emerged in 2002, the atomic-level determinants underlining the molecular recognition of SARS-CoV-2 to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and, thus, the rapid virus spread into human body, remain unresolved.

However, the unique impacts of pre-existing SA on well-being and interpersonal outcomes within the stressful context of the pandemic are currently unknown. DESIGN In a study that took place in May 2020, we surveyed 488 North American community participants online. METHODS We used multiple linear regression to analyze whether retrospective reports of pre-pandemic SA symptoms predicted current coronavirus anxiety, loneliness, fears of negative evaluation, use of preventive measures, and affiliative outcomes, and whether pre-pandemic functional impairment and recent COVID-related stressors moderated these relations. RESULTS Results highlighted the negative effects of pre-pandemic SA on current mental health functioning, especially for participants with higher pre-pandemic functional impairment and greater exposure to COVID-related stressors. Although participants with higher pre-pandemic SA reported currently feeling lonelier and more fearful of negative evaluation, they also endorsed greater efforts to affiliate with others. CONCLUSIONS High SA individuals may have heightened desire for social support within the isolating context of the pandemic, in which COVID-related social restrictions enable greater avoidance of social evaluation but may also mask the enduring impairment associated with pre-pandemic SA.","output":"The moderating effects of reported pre-pandemic social anxiety, symptom impairment, and current stressors on mental health and affiliative adjustment during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: A meta-analysis of laboratory cardiac markers for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) was performed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

RESULTS: Of the 2583 participants enrolled in 24 studies, 1613 patients were diagnosed with MIS-C. MIS-C patients exhibited higher BNP levels than patients with non-severe COVID-19 [SMD (95% CI): 1.13 (0.48, 1.77), p < 0.05]. No significant differences in BNP levels were observed between patients with MIS-C and severe COVID-19 [SMD (95% CI): 0.29 (-0.07, 0.65), p = 0.117]. Comparisons of MIS-C patients to all COVID-19 patients revealed no significant differences in levels of troponin [SMD (95% CI): 0.13 (-0.07, 0.32), p = 0.212] or AST [SMD (95% CI): 0.10 (-0.11, 0.31), p = 0.336]. Compared to patients with non-severe MIS-C, those with severe MIS-C exhibited higher levels of BNP [SMD (95% CI): 0.26 (0.04, 0.48), p < 0.05], but no differences in troponin [SMD (95% CI): 0.05 (-0.06, 0.16) p = 0.387] or AST [SMD (95% CI): 0.19 (-0.34, 0.71), p = 0.483] were observed.

Although this equation is nonlinear and it contains time-dependent coefficients, it can be solved in closed form, yielding an expression for N(t) that depends on a function (t). For the particular case that (t) is constant, this expression reduces to the well-known logistic formula, giving rise to a sigmoidal curve suitable for modelling usual epidemics. However, for the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, the long series of available data shows that the use of this simple formula for predictions underestimates N(t); thus, the logistic formula only provides a lower bound of N(t). After experimenting with more than 50 different forms of (t), we introduce two novel models that will be referred to as 'rational' and 'birational'. The parameters specifying these models (as well as those of the logistic model), are determined from the available data using an error-minimizing algorithm. The analysis of the applicability of the above models to the cases of China and South Korea suggest that they yield more accurate predictions, and importantly that they may provide an upper bound of the actual N(t).

Policy action in the pandemic recovery period must be informed by pre-pandemic conditions. PURPOSE: To describe registered nurses (RNs) working conditions, job outcomes, and measures of patient safety and care quality in hospitals and nursing homes just before the pandemic. METHODS: Cross-sectional study using descriptive statistics to analyze survey data from RNs in New York and Illinois collected December 2019 through February 2020. RESULTS: A total of 33,462 RNs were included in the final analysis. Before the pandemic, more than 40% of RNs reported high burnout, one in four were dissatisfied with their job, and one in five planned to leave their employer within 1 year. Among nursing home RNs, one in three planned to leave their employer. RNs reported poor working conditions characterized by not having enough staff (56%), administrators who did not listen/respond to RNs concerns (42%), frequently missed nursing care (ranging from 8% to 34% depending on the nursing task in question), work that was interrupted or delayed by insufficient staff (88%), and performing non-nursing tasks (82%). Most RNs (68%) rated care quality at their workplace as less than excellent, and 41% gave their hospital an unfavorable patient safety rating. CONCLUSION: Hospitals and nursing homes were understaffed before the COVID-19 pandemic, and many RNs were dissatisfied with their employers contribution to the widespread observed shortage of nursing care during the pandemic. Policy interventions to address understaffing include the implementation of safe nurse staffing standards and passage of the Nurse Licensure Compact to permit RNs to move expeditiously to locales with the greatest needs.","output":"Conditions of Nursing Practice in Hospitals and Nursing Homes Before COVID-19: Implications for Policy Action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The combination of sofosbuvir (SOF) and daclatasvir (DCV) has shown preliminary efficacy for patients with COVID-19 in five open-label studies with small sample sizes. This larger trial aimed to assess if the addition of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir to standard care improved clinical endpoints in hospitalized patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. Methods: This was a placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial in adults with moderate or severe COVID-19 admitted to 19 hospitals in Iran. Patients were randomized to SOF/DCV 400/60mg once-daily or placebo in addition to standard of care. Patients were included if they had positive PCR or diagnostic chest CT, O 2 saturation <95%, and compatible symptoms. The primary endpoint was discharge from hospital within 10 days of first treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created SemRepDS (an extension of SemRep), capable of extracting semantic relations from abstracts by leveraging a DS-specific terminology (iDISK) containing 28,884 DS terms not found in the UMLS. PubMed abstracts were processed using SemRepDS to generate semantic relations, which were then filtered using a PubMedBERT-based model to remove incorrect relations before generating our knowledge graph (SuppKG). Two pathways are used to identify potential DS-Drug interactions which are then evaluated by medical professionals for mechanistic plausibility. RESULTS: Comparison analysis found that SemRepDS returned 206.9% more DS relations and 158.5% more DS entities than SemRep. The fine-tuned BERT model obtained an F1 score of 0.8605 and removed 43.86% of the relations, improving the precision of the relations by 26.4% compared to pre-filtering. SuppKG consists of 2,928 DS-specific nodes. Manual review of findings identified 44 (88%) proposed DS-Gene-Drug and 32 (64%) proposed DS-Gene1-Function-Gene2-Drug pathways to be mechanistically plausible. DISCUSSION: The additional relations extracted using SemRepDS generated SuppKG that was used to find plausible DSI not found in the current literature. By the nature of the SuppKG, these interactions are unlikely to have been found using SemRep without the expanded DS terminology.

However, when policy recommendations exceed what is feasible to implement, CHWs are overstretched by the volume of activities, implementation strength is diluted, and programs fail to produce promised outcomes. To counteract this, we developed a time-use modeling toolthe CHW Coverage and Capacity (C3) Tooland used it with government partners in Rwanda and Zanzibar to address common policy questions related to CHW needs, coverage, and time optimization. In Rwanda, the C3 Tool was used to analyze 2 well-established cadres of CHWs and 1 new one. The well-established CHW cadres were within a manageable workload range whereas the new cadre was projected to achieve less than half of assigned activities. This is informing ongoing changes to the CHWs' scopes of work. In Zanzibar, the C3 Tool was used to update the national community health strategy to include community health volunteers (CHVs) for the first time and determine how many CHVs were needed. The tool projected that 2,200 CHVs could achieve approximately 90% coverage of all defined services. Based on these figures, Zanzibar updated its national community health strategy, which officially launched in February 2020. We discuss lessons from these 2 experiences. Translating analysis into decision making depends not only on the programmatic will and motivation of governments but also on finding opportune timing for when policy and program processes allow for optimization of CHW investments.

To overcome some of these limitations, 29Si{27Al} TRAPDOR NMR as well as 27Al{29Si} and 27Al{1H} REDOR NMR spectroscopy were applied to materials synthesized by the one-part alkali-activation route from three different amorphous silica starting materials, including rice husk ash. The latter led to formation of a fully amorphous sodium aluminosilicate gel (geopolymer), while the materials produced from the other silicas contained amorphous phase and crystalline zeolites. Application of the double-resonance NMR methods allowed to identify hydrous alumina gel domains in the rice husk ash-based material as well as significantly differing amounts of residual silica in the three cured materials. Four-coordinated Al existed not only in the aluminosilicate gel framework but also in a water-rich chemical environment with only a small amount of Si in proximity, likely in the alumina gel or possibly present as extra-framework Al in the aluminosilicate gel.

Additionally, the authors successfully piloted the case on more than 350 undergraduate students enrolled in a business and corporate strategy course. Case overview/synopsis: Peloton used vertical integration to control the creation of its own software, bikes, exercise classes and retail outlets. In doing so, Peloton was one of the first companies in the industry to have near full control of the production process (Gross and Caisman, 2019). Due to this integration, Peloton was one of the fitness equipment industry leaders. However, Pelotons high level of vertical integration coupled with rapid growth led to lackluster profitability. Given the rise in popularity of in-home exercise equipment, Peloton had room to continue its growth, but the question remained whether it was strategically positioned to do so. Complexity academic level: This case is best taught in undergraduate and graduate strategy courses. For undergraduate courses, it could be incorporated into lessons on competitive dynamics, internal analysis and first-mover advantage and strategic positioning.

Despite its ubiquity in the hospital, consensus on much of its management is lacking. METHODS: Representatives from ID, Podiatry, and Pathology interested in quality improvement (QI) developed multidisciplinary institutional recommendations culminating in an educational intervention describing optimal diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to DFO. Knowledge acquisition was assessed by pre- and post-intervention surveys. Inpatients with forefoot DFO were retrospectively reviewed pre- and post- intervention to assess frequency of recommended diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers, including appropriate definition of surgical bone margins, definitive histopathology reports, and unnecessary intravenous antibiotics or prolonged antibiotic courses. RESULTS: A post-intervention survey revealed significant improvements in knowledge of antibiotic treatment duration and the role of oral antibiotics in managing DFO. There were 104 consecutive patients in the pre-intervention cohort (4/1/2018-4/1/2019) and 32 patients in the post-intervention cohort (11/5/2019-03/01/2020), the latter truncated by changes in hospital practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-categorizable or equivocal pathology reports decreased from pre-intervention to post-intervention (27.0% vs 3.3%, respectively, P=0.006). We observed non-significant improvement in correct bone margin definition (74.0% vs 87.5%, p=0.11), unnecessary PICC line placement (18.3% vs 9.4%, p=0.23), and unnecessary prolonged antibiotics (21.9% vs 5.0%, p=0.10). Additionally, by working as an interdisciplinary group, many solvable misunderstandings were identified, and processes were adjusted to improve the quality of care provided to these patients. CONCLUSIONS: This QI initiative regarding management of DFO led to improved provider knowledge and collaborative competency between these three departments, improvements in definitive pathology reports, and non-significant improvement in several other clinical endpoints.

We identified a cohort of women who were eligible for the HPV vaccination and those who were not eligible from the most recent Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey. We used a quasi-experimental regression discontinuity design, exploiting the quasi-random change in HPV vaccination eligibility in 2011, to compare sexual behaviours among vaccinated and unvaccinated adolescent women.

This study investigates changes in grass pollen aerobiology in a subtropical city of Brisbane, Australia, between the two available monitoring periods, 1994-1999 and 2016-2020. Potential drivers of pollen change were examined including weather and satellite-derived vegetation indicators. The magnitude of the seasonal pollen index for grass showed almost a three-fold increase for 2016-2020 over 1994-1999. The number and proportion of high and extreme grass pollen days in the recent period increased compared to earlier monitoring. Statistically significant changes were also identified for distributions of CO2, satellite-derived seasonal vegetation health indices, and daily maximum temperatures, but not for minimum temperatures, daily rainfall, or seasonal fraction of green groundcover. Quarterly grass pollen levels were correlated with corresponding vegetation health indices, and with green groundcover fraction, suggesting that seasonal-scale plant health was higher in the latter period. The magnitude of grass pollen exposure in the subtropical region of Brisbane has increased markedly in the recent past, posing an increased environmental health threat.

There have been concerns throughout the pandemic about patients with underlying chronic lung diseases like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and asthma. However, there is paucity of data in these patients, especially from a rural setting. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 301 patient 18 years and older, admitted with symptomatic COVID-19 infection to 8 Vidant health system hospitals in Eastern North Carolina (ENC) from March 1,2020 to July 15,2020. Primary objective was to assess prevalence of asthma and COPD in patients hospitalized with symptomatic COVID-19. Secondary objectives were to compare need for ICU admission, mechanical ventilation (MV), MV duration, ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, and mortality between patients with and without COPD and asthma, and between obese and non-obese asthmatics. Nonparametric tests and binary regression analyses were performed as appropriate to analyze differences between clinical covariates of interest.

Based on a limited sample size, obesity in asthma was not significantly associated with increased risk of ICU admission, intubation, prolonged MV, prolonged hospital or ICU LOS, or mortality (n=33 obese asthmatics, n=14 non-obese asthmatics). Increased risk of mortality was significantly associated with older age (OR=1.04, p=0.003). Kaplan-Meier analyses of survival did not reveal a decrease in in-hospital survival in patients with COPD and asthma. Conclusion: Our study shows that asthma and COPD are among the less common comorbidities of COVID-19. Compared to some other studies, our study does not show worse outcomes for COPD or asthma. Larger cohorts are required to establish predictors of outcomes in these patient populations.","output":"Outcomes of COVID-19 patients with underlying asthma and COPD: Analysis from a rural setting in the unites states"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Social distance, quarantine, pathogen testing and other preventive strategies implemented during COVID-19 pandemic may negatively influence the management of acute stroke. Objective: The current study aimed to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on treatment delay of acute stroke in China. Methods: This study included patients with acute stroke admitted in two hospitals in Jiangsu, China. Patients admitted before and after the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak (January 31, 2020, as officially announced by Chinese government) were compared for pre- (measured as onset-to-door time) and post-hospital delay (measured as door-to-needle time). The influence factors for delayed treatment (indicated as onset-to-needle time >4.5 hours) were analyzed with multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: Onset-to-door time increased from 202 min (IQR 65-492) before to 317 min (IQR 75-790) after the COVID-19 pandemic (P=0.001). Door-to-needle time increased from 50min (IQR 40-75) before to 65 min (IQR 48-84) after the COVID-19 pandemic (P=0.048). The proportion of patients with intravenous thrombolysis in those with acute ischemic stroke was decreased significantly after the pandemic (15.4% vs 20.1%; P=0.030). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that patients after COVID-19 pandemic, lower educational level, rural residency, mild symptoms and transported by other means than ambulance were associated with delayed treatment. Conclusions: COVID-19 pandemic has remarkable impacts on the management of acute ischemic stroke. Both pre- and post-hospital delays were prolonged significantly, and proportion of patient arrived within the 4.5-hour time window for intravenous thrombolysis treatment was decreased. Given that anti-COVID-19 measures are becoming medical routines, efforts are warranted to shorten the delay so that the outcomes of stroke could be improved.","output":"Delayed Stroke Treatment during COVID-19 Pandemic in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Technology has the potential to facilitate the development of higher-order thinking skills in learning.

SARS-CoV-2 testing occurs frequently in nursing homes, with current public health guidance suggesting that repeat testing is generally not warranted in the 90 days following initial positive test results. Interpretation of repeat positive tests beyond 90 days is challenging and the consequences of decisions following these tests are significant.Methods: We utilized a surveillance system for COVID-19 to identify Connecticut nursing home residents who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RNA-based testing  90 days after initial positive results. We analyzed statewide nursing home testing data over a 9-month period, from the first Connecticut nursing home case identified on March 15 through December 15, 2020, when nursing home COVID-19 vaccinations began in Connecticut.Findings: We identified 156 residents (median age 75 years) with positive RNA-based PCR tests occurring 90 days after an initial positive test. Residents with repeat positives tests represented approximately 26% (156/6,079) of nursing home residents surviving beyond 90 days of their initial SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis statewide since the start of the pandemic, with a median time to repeat positivity of 135 days (range 90-245 days). Deaths were reported in 128% (20/156) of residents following the repeat positive test, with 80% (16/20) having one or more intervening negative RT-PCR tests prior to the repeat positive test.Interpretation: Our analysis suggests that repeat positive testing in nursing home populations may exceed those reported in younger age groups.

No studies of medical devices and software assess the impact on patient safety of the FDA's current regulatory safeguards and new legislative changes to those standards. Our analysis quantifies the impact of software problems in regulated medical devices and indicates that current regulations are necessary but not sufficient for ensuring patient safety by identifying and eliminating dangerous defects in software currently on the market. New legislative changes will further deregulate health IT, reducing safeguards that facilitate the reporting and timely recall of flawed medical software that could harm patients. CONTEXT Medical software has become an increasingly critical component of health care, yet the regulatory landscape for digital health is inconsistent and controversial. To understand which policies might best protect patients, we examined the impact of the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) regulatory safeguards on software-related technologies in recent years and the implications for newly passed legislative changes in regulatory policy. METHODS Using FDA databases, we identified all medical devices that were recalled from 2011 through 2015 primarily because of software defects. We counted all software-related recalls for each FDA risk category and evaluated each high-risk and moderate-risk recall of electronic medical records to determine the manufacturer, device classification, submission type, number of units, and product details. FINDINGS A total of 627 software devices (1.4 million units) were subject to recalls, with 12 of these devices (190,596 units) subject to the highest-risk recalls. Eleven of the devices recalled as high risk had entered the market through the FDA review process that does not require evidence of safety or effectiveness, and one device was completely exempt from regulatory review. The largest high-risk recall categories were anesthesiology and general hospital, with one each in cardiovascular and neurology. Five electronic medical record systems (9,347 units) were recalled for software defects classified as posing a moderate risk to patient safety. CONCLUSIONS Software problems in medical devices are not rare and have the potential to negatively influence medical care. Premarket regulation has not captured all the software issues that could harm patients, evidenced by the potentially large number of patients exposed to software products later subject to high-risk and moderate-risk recalls. Provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act that became law in late 2016 will reduce safeguards further. Absent stronger regulations and implementation to create robust risk assessment and adverse event reporting, physicians and their patients are likely to be at risk from medical errors caused by software-related problems in medical devices.","output":"Software-Related Recalls of Health Information Technology and Other Medical Devices: Implications for FDA Regulation of Digital Health."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the evolution of seropositivity in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, through 10 consecutive surveys conducted between April 2020 and April 2021.

This review addresses gaps in the literature regarding posttracheostomy care, emphasizing safety of multidisciplinary teams, coordinating complex care needs, and identifying and managing late complications of prolonged intubation and tracheostomy. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Google Scholar, institutional guidance documents. REVIEW METHODS: Literature through June 2020 on the care of patients with a tracheostomy was reviewed, including consensus statements, clinical practice guidelines, institutional guidance, and scientific literature on COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 virology and immunology. Where data were lacking, expert opinions were aggregated and adjudicated to arrive at consensus recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Best practices in caring for patients after a tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic are multifaceted, encompassing precautions during aerosol-generating procedures; minimizing exposure risks to health care workers, caregivers, and patients; ensuring safe, timely tracheostomy care; and identifying and managing laryngotracheal injury, such as vocal fold injury, posterior glottic stenosis, and subglottic stenosis that may affect speech, swallowing, and airway protection. We present recommended approaches to tracheostomy care, outlining modifications to conventional algorithms, raising vigilance for heightened risks of bleeding or other complications, and offering recommendations for personal protective equipment, equipment, care protocols, and personnel.

Policy analysis of reallocation of medical resources, lockdowns and cash transfers produce heterogeneous effects across groups. Policy simulations indicate that: reallocating medical resources cuts deaths and raises output and the welfare of both groups; mild lockdowns favor slum individuals by mitigating the demand for hospital beds, whereas strict confinements mostly delay the evolution of the pandemic; and cash transfers benefit slum residents to the detriment of others, highlighting important distributional effects.","output":"Slums and pandemics()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemic outbreaks such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and Covid-19 have attracted worldwide attention since these viruses have affected many countries and become a global public health issue.

However, little is known about the association between pregnant women with COVID-19 and its transmission to neonates. This investigation aimed to see if COVID-19 infection could be transmitted vertically into the uterus. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study. 48 COVID-19 infected mothers were enrolled during their third trimester. A qRT-PCR assay of the nasal and oropharyngeal swab samples was performed to confirm positive for COVID-19 infection as per WHO protocol. In addition, characteristics of pregnant women with confirmed SARS -CoV-2 infection and newborns were documented. Results: Forty-eight expectant mothers, 10 (20.8%) were found symptomatic, and 38 (79.2%) were asymptomatic, with COVID-19 infection were delivered (33 cesarean section & 15 vaginal deliveries). One female child (4.1%) out of 48 newborns was initially diagnosed with COVID-19 infection based on a nucleic acid qRT-PCR. The female child showed no or negligible signs and recovered completely, whereas 47 neonates (95.9%) confirmed negative. None of the mothers or neonates died from COVID-19 related pulmonary problems. Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence on vertical virologic transmission of COVID-19 infection during the third trimester of pregnancy.

The objectives of this retrospective study were to report our experience of intraoperative adverse events (IOAEs) during fenestrated and branched stent grafting and to analyze the impact on clinical outcomes. METHODS: Consecutive patients treated with fenestrated and branched stent grafting in a tertiary vascular center between February 2006 and October 2013 were evaluated. A prospectively maintained computerized database was scrutinized and updated retrospectively. Intraoperative angiograms were reviewed to identify IOAEs, and adverse events were categorized into three types: target vessel cannulation, positioning of graft components, and intraoperative access. Clinical consequences of IOAEs were analyzed to ascertain whether they were responsible for death or moderate to severe postoperative complications. RESULTS: During the study period, 113 consecutive elective patients underwent fenestrated or branched stent grafting. Indications for treatment were asymptomatic complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (CAAAs, n = 89) and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs, n = 24). Stent grafts included fenestrated (n = 79) and branched (n = 17) Cook stent grafts (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind), Ventana (Endologix, Irvine, Calif) stent grafts (n = 9), and fenestrated Anaconda (Vascutek Terumo, Scotland, UK) stent grafts (n = 8). In-hospital mortality rates for the CAAA and TAAA groups were 6.7% (6 of 89) and 12.5% (3 of 24), respectively. Twenty-eight moderate to severe complications occurred in 21 patients (18.6%). Spinal cord ischemia was recorded in six patients, three of which resolved completely. A total of 37 IOAEs were recorded in 34 (30.1%) patients (22 CAAAs and 12 TAAAs). Of 37 IOAEs, 15 (40.5%) resulted in no clinical consequence in 15 patients; 17 (45.9%) were responsible for moderate to severe complications in 16 patients, and five (13.5%) led to death in four patients. The composite end point death/nonfatal moderate to severe complication occurred more frequently in patients with IOAEs compared with patients without IOAEs (20 of 34 vs 12 of 79; P < .0001).

This paper examines the relationship of parenting and family environment factors with ADHD. A systematic review of the literature was conducted in 2014 and identified 52 longitudinal studies. A follow-up search in 2021 identified 7 additional articles, for a total of 59 studies that examined the association of parenting factors with ADHD outcomes: ADHD overall (diagnosis or symptoms), ADHD diagnosis specifically, or presence of the specific ADHD symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. For parenting factors that were present in three or more studies, pooled effect sizes were calculated separately for dichotomous or continuous ADHD outcomes, accounting for each studys conditional variance. Factors with sufficient information for analysis were parenting interaction quality (sensitivity/warmth, intrusiveness/reactivity, and negativity/harsh discipline), maltreatment (general maltreatment and physical abuse), parental relationship status (divorce, single parenting), parental incarceration, and child media exposure. All factors showed a significant direct association with ADHD outcomes, except sensitivity/warmth which had an inverse association. Parenting factors predicted diagnosis and overall symptoms as well as inattentive and hyperactive symptoms when measured, but multiple factors showed significant heterogeneity across studies. These findings support the possibility that parenting and family environment influences ADHD symptoms and may affect a childs likelihood of being diagnosed with ADHD. Prevention strategies that support parents, such as decreasing parenting challenges and increasing access to parent training in behavior management, may improve childrens long-term developmental health.

However, data on asymptomatic identification rates of respiratory viruses are limited, particularly in Indigenous populations, who suffer a high burden of OM. METHODS We describe the identification of respiratory viruses alone and in combination with pathogenic OM bacteria in 1006 nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from asymptomatic Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children in a longitudinal community-based cohort study in rural Western Australia. RESULTS Viruses were identified in 42% of samples from Aboriginal and 32% from non-Aboriginal children. Rhinoviruses were the most frequently identified virus with higher identification rates in Aboriginal (23.6%) than non-Aboriginal children (16.5%; P = 0.003). Rhinoviruses were associated with H. influenzae (odds ratio [OR], 2.24; 95% CI, 1.24-4.07 for Aboriginal children) and M. catarrhalis (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.05-3.57 for Aboriginal children).

Microaspiration of the contaminated gastric and oropharyngeal secretions is the main mechanism involved in the pathophysiology of VAP. Tracheal cuff plays an important role in stopping the progression of contaminated secretions into the lower respiratory tract. Previous in vitro studies suggested that conical cuff shape might be helpful in improving tracheal sealing. However, clinical studies found conflicting results. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of conical tracheal cuff shape on the microaspiration of gastric contents in critically ill patients. METHODS/DESIGN This prospective cluster randomized controlled crossover open-label trial is currently being conducted in ten French intensive care units (ICUs). Patients are allocated to intubation with a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) standard (barrel)-shaped or a PVC conical-shaped tracheal tube. The primary objective is to determine the impact of the conical shaped tracheal cuff on abundant microaspiration of gastric contents. Secondary outcomes include the incidence of microaspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, tracheobronchial colonization, VAP and ventilator-associated events. Abundant microaspiration is defined as the presence of pepsin at significant level (>200 ng/ml) in at least 30 % of the tracheal aspirates. Pepsin and amylase are quantitatively measured in all tracheal aspirates during the 48 h following inclusion. Quantitative tracheal aspirate culture is performed at inclusion and twice weekly. We plan to recruit 312 patients in the participating ICUs. DISCUSSION BEST Cuff is the first randomized controlled study evaluating the impact of PVC tracheal-cuff shape on gastric microaspirations in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation.

METHODS: In this study, a network pharmacology approach was employed, including drug-likeness evaluation, oral bioavailability prediction, protein?protein interaction (PPI) network construction and analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation, and virtual docking, to predict the bioactive components, potential targets, and molecular mechanism of CDPF for COVID-19 treatment. RESULTS: The active compound of herbs in CDPF and their candidate targets were obtained through database mining, and an herbsingredientstargets network was constructed. Subsequently, the candidate targets of the active compounds were compared to those relevant to COVID-19, to identify the potential targets of CDPF for COVID-19 treatment. Subsequently, the PPI network was constructed, which provided a basis for cluster analysis and hub gene screening. The seed targets in the most significant module were selected for further functional annotation. GO enrichment analysis identified four main areas: (1) cellular responses to external stimuli, (2) regulation of blood production and circulation, (3) free radical regulation, (4) immune regulation and anti-inflammatory effects. KEGG pathway analysis also revealed that CDPF could play pharmacological roles against COVID-19 through multi components?multi targets?multi pathways at the molecular level, mainly involving anti-viral, immune-regulatory, and anti-inflammatory pathways; consequently, a CDPFherbsingredientstargetspathwaysCOVID-19 network was constructed.

MethodBlood samples were taken on the first, third, and fifth days from 30 healthy volunteers, 15 of whom were smokers, 15 were non-smokers, and D-dimer, ferritin, and fibrinogen tests were studied with repeated measurements. After the data processed for normality and homogeneity and removing extreme values, CVA, CVI, CVG, CVT, RCV, II, I%, B%, TE% values were calculated via a full nested ANOVA design, according to Callum G, Fraser, and EFLM. ResultsCVI and CVG values of D-dimer were calculated as 49.07% and 40.69% for all individuals, 49.26% and 27.71% for smokers, 48.80% and 51.67% for non-smokers, respectively. In terms of fibrinogen, the same analyzes for all individuals were calculated as 11.18% and 10.62%, 3.25% and 20.17% for smokers, 9.11% and 6.79% for non-smokers, respectively.

There is little data about the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in this population. METHODS: HIV-infected adults admitted to two intensive care units over a 6-year period for an acute respiratory failure and explored for respiratory viruses with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) were retrospectively selected. Objectives were to describe the prevalence of respiratory viruses, coinfections with non-viral pathogens, and hospital outcome. RESULTS: A total of 123 episodes were included. An HIV infection was newly diagnosed in 9% of cases and 72% of the population were on antiretroviral therapy. Real-time mPCR tests identified at least one respiratory virus in the respiratory tract of 33 (27%) patients, but with a non-viral copathogen in two-thirds of cases. Rhinovirus was predominant, documented in 15 patients, followed by Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Viruses (both n = 6). The prevalence of respiratory virus-associated infection did not vary along with the level of the CD4 T-cell deficiency, except for Rhinovirus which was more prevalent in patients with a CD4 lymphocyte count below 200 cells/L (n = 13 (20%) vs. n = 2 (4%), p < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, respiratory virus-associated infection was not associated with a worse prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Viruses are frequently identified in the respiratory tract of HIV-infected patients with acute respiratory failure that requires ICU admission, but with a non-viral copathogen in two-thirds of cases. Rhinovirus is the predominant viral specie; its prevalence is highest in patients with a CD4 lymphocyte count below 200 cells/L.","output":"Respiratory virus-associated infections in HIV-infected adults admitted to the intensive care unit for acute respiratory failure: a 6-year bicenter retrospective study (HIV-VIR study)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 infection represented a huge burden on the healthcare systems worldwide during the pandemic year 2020. Perioperative infection with SARS-CoV-2 was previously associated with increased mortality and morbidity rates for few surgical procedures, but data about pancreatic resections are scarce. The study aims to assess the impact of perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection on early outcomes after pancreatico-duodenectomies. Methods: The data of 50 patients with pancreatico-duodenectomies performed during the pandemic year 2020 at our institution were retrospectively assessed from a prospective electronic database. The patients were divided into two groups: with and without perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection. Demographic, clinical, bioumoral, pathological, intraoperative and early postoperative outcomes were compared between the groups, with the appropriate statistical tests. All patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection at RT-PCR test 48 hours prior to surgery. Results: A number of 8 patients (16%) were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection at a median POD 11 (range, 6 C 32 POD). Perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection was only associated with statistically significant increased overall length of hospital stays (33 vs. 15 days, p < 0.0001) but not with increased intensive care unit stay, overall or severe morbidity, clinically relevant pancreatic fistulae, delayed gastric emptying, hemorrhage, bile leak, pulmonary complications or in-hospital mortality rates (p values  0.062, ns).

To investigate the occurrence of STEC among grazing dromedaries from Kenya, E. coli isolated from fecal matter collected from 163 dromedaries on a large ranch were screened for the presence of stx1 and stx2. STEC strains were isolated and serotyped. Isolates were subjected to PCR for the subtyping of stx genes and for the detection of eae and ehx. In addition, whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out to detect further virulence genes and to determine the multilocus sequence types (MLST). Antimicrobial resistance profiles were determined by disk diffusion. STEC was isolated from 20 (12.3%) of the fecal samples. Thereof, nine (45%) isolates were STEC O156:H25, three (15%) isolates typed STEC O43:H2. The remaining isolates occurred as single serotypes or were O non-typeable. Eleven (55%) of the isolates harboured stx2a, nine (45%) eae, and 14 (70%) ehx, respectively. WGS revealed the presence of iss in 16 (80%), subAB in four (20%) and astA in two (10%) of the isolates, Furthermore, espA, tccP, nleA, nleB, tccP, and tir were found exclusively among STEC O156:H25.

The aim of the present study was to study the possible beneficial effects of the administration of the GLP-1R agonist, liraglutide, in the pathogenesis of the fibrotic process in an animal model of pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin. We observed that liraglutide decreased mRNA expression of collagen, hydroxyproline and key enzymes for the synthesis of collagen. In addition, GLP-1R activation restored the ACE2 mRNA levels modulating the activities of the RAS components, increased the production of surfactant proteins (SFTPa1, SFTPb, SFTPc) and promoted an improvement in pulmonary and cardiac functionality, including a partial restoration of lung alveolar structure. Liraglutide effects are shown at both the pro-inflammatory and fibrosis phases of the experimental disease.

METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. We searched MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science to locate all articles published up to 10 April 2020 reporting data of COVID-19 survivors and nonsurvivors developing ACI as a complication of the infection. Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. Data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio as the effect measure with the related 95% confidence interval. Statistical heterogeneity between groups was measured using the Higgins I statistic. RESULTS: Eight studies, enrolling 1686 patients (mean age 59.5 years), met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Data regarding the outcome of patients complicated with ACI were available for 1615 patients. Of these, 387 (23.9%) experienced ACIs as COVID-19 complications during the hospitalization. The incidence of ACI was significantly higher among non survivors when compared with survivors (61.6 vs. 6.7%, Pa<a0.0001).

Late reperfusion of tissue that was no longer salvageable could be one explanation, as suggested by previous exploratory studies that showed an association between time to reperfusion and good clinical outcome. We sought to validate this association in a preplanned analysis of data from the IMS III trial. METHODS We used data for patients with complete proximal arterial occlusions in the anterior circulation who received endovascular treatment and achieved angiographic reperfusion (score on Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scale of grade 2-3) during the endovascular procedure (within 7 h of symptom onset). We used logistic regression to model good clinical outcome (defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 3 months) as a function of the time to reperfusion. We prespecified variables to be considered for adjustment, including age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, sex, and baseline blood glucose concentration. FINDINGS Of 240 patients who were otherwise eligible for inclusion in our analysis, 182 (76%) achieved angiographic reperfusion. Mean time from symptom onset to reperfusion (ie, procedure end) was 325 min (SD 52). Increased time to reperfusion was associated with a decreased likelihood of good clinical outcome (unadjusted relative risk for every 30-min delay 085 [95% CI 077-094]; adjusted relative risk 088 [080-098]).

Methods: Between 17 January 2020 and 11 February 2020, 13 patients were admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital for emergency cardiovascular surgery. During this time, Wuhan was a COVID-19 epicenter, and Wuhan Union Hospital is a sentinel hospital located in this area. These patients' epidemiological histories, clinical records, laboratory assessments, imaging findings, and surgical outcomes were retrospectively reviewed. Throat swabs were collected from some patients preoperatively and all patients postoperatively for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing to determine whether these patients had COVID-19. Results: This cohort included 5 cases of acute aortic dissection, 3 cases of congenital heart disease, 2 cases of dilated cardiomyopathy with end-stage heart failure, 1 case of aortocoronary fistula that had undergone previous surgery, 1 case of subacute infective endocarditis with cerebral infarction, and 1 case of multivessel coronary disease. Six patients were suspected COVID-19 cases (46.2%). There were no confirmed COVID-19 cases in this cohort. None of the patients in this cohort died and none developed severe acute respiratory syndrome, renal failure, or septic shock after surgery. No cross-infection occurred with other patients or medical staff who came into close contact with this cohort.

The basic idea is that after each stage a decision about continuation of the trial and accrual of patients for an additional stage is made on the basis of the expected reduction in loss. For this purpose, we define a loss function that incorporates the patient accrual costs as well as costs associated with an incorrect decision at the end of the trial. An attractive feature of our loss function is that its estimation is computationally undemanding, also when K > 2. We evaluate the frequentist operating characteristics for settings with a binary outcome and multiple experimental arms. We consider both the situation with and without a control arm.

Therefore, the study has been carried out to understand socio-economic vulnerability in child nutrition with migration status and other contributing factors in India. This study used data from the National Family Health Survey, the fourth in the NFHS series which was conducted in 2015C2016 (NFHS-4). We were interested in looking at the children age 12C59 months for their nutritional indicators such as stunting and underweight across migrants and non-migrants children. This resulted in a sample of 199,448 children in selected age group and among them 33.1% children belongs to the migrant family as compared to 67% of non-migrant children. Overall, 44.2% of children were stunted and 39.5% were underweight among non-migrant children as compared to 37.4% & 32.8% of migrant children were stunted and underweight respectively. Further, the results showed that among the social groups, scheduled caste children were found a high variation in underweight (34% vs. 41.6%) and stunting (36% vs. 46%) between migrants and non-migrants children. Similar trend of malnourishment is found in the poor wealth quintile, for rural residents and low educated women with non-migrant status. Those children who were poor but non-migrant were more likely to be malnourished as underweight [aOR; 1.15, CI: 1.11C1.18] and stunted [aOR; 1.17, CI:1.13C1.20] as compared to migrant status children in the same category of the household.

The present study aimed to carry out an epidemiological analysis of confirmed cases and asymptomatic infections in Shenzhen City to provide scientific reference for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Methods The epidemiological information of the 462 confirmed cases and 45 asymptomatic infections from January 19th to June 30th was collected in Shenzhen City, Southern China, and a descriptive analysis was performed. Results A total of 462 confirmed COVID-19 cases from January 19 to April 30, 2020 were reported in Shenzhen City, including 423 domestic cases (91.56%) and 39 imported cases (8.44%) who came back from other countries. Among domestic cases, the majority were cases imported from Hubei Province (n = 312, 67.53%), followed by local ones (n = 69, 14.94%). During the same period, a total of 45 asymptomatic infections were reported in Shenzhen City, including 31 local ones (68.89%) and 14 imported from abroad (31.11%). The proportion of asymptomatic infections in Shenzhen City was increasing over time (Z = 13.1888, P < 0.0001). The total number of local asymptomatic infections in Shenzhen City exceeded as the same pattern as that in other provinces (  2 = 118.830, P < 0.0001). The proportion of asymptomatic infections among cases imported from abroad was higher than that of the same in domestic cases (  2 = 22.5121, P < 0.0001, OR = 4.8983, 95%: 2.4052, 9.9756). No statistical significance was noted in the proportions of asymptomatic infections among imported cases from different countries (  2 = 7.7202, P = 0.6561). Conclusions The majority of COVID-19 cases in Shenzhen City were imported cases who came back from Hubei Province in the early stage (before 1st March, 2020) and from abroad in the later stage (after 1st April, 2020). Scientific and effective prevention and control measures have resulted in only a few local infections in Shenzhen City. Asymptomatic infections accounted for an increasing proportion among cases imported from abroad, indicating that the prevention measures carried out in Shenzhen City did avoid the import of infected cases.

METHODOLOGY We compared POC-Ab with rRT-PCR results among patients in a tertiary hospital from January to March 2020 in Bandung, Indonesia. We selected presumptive COVID-19 patients with positive rRT-PCR consecutively and 20 patients with negative rRT-PCR results were selected randomly from the same group of patients as controls. We described the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) with corresponding 95% confidence interval using serum and capillary blood samples. We also tested POC-Ab using non-COVID-19 (confirmed dengue and typhoid) patients' sera. RESULTS Twenty-seven patients with positive rRT-PCR result and 20 negative controls were included (68.1% males, mean age 46 (SD: 15.4)). Using the serum, the sensitivity of the POC-Ab was 63.0% (42.4-80.6), specificity was 95.0% (75.1-99.9), PPV was 94.4% (72.7-99.8), NPV was 65.5% (45.7-82.1). A subset of 20 patients was tested using a capillary blood sample. The accuracy of the capillary blood sample is lower compared to serum (50.0% vs. 78.7%). None of the non-COVID-19 sera tested were reactive. CONCLUSIONS POC-Ab for COVID-19 has a high specificity with no false-positive result in non-COVID-19 sera. Therefore, it can be used to guide diagnostic among symptomatic patients in resource limited settings. Given its low sensitivity, patients with high suspicion of COVID-19 but non-reactive result should be prioritized for rRT-PCR testing.","output":"The performance of point-of-care antibody test for COVID-19 diagnosis in a tertiary hospital in Bandung, Indonesia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The benefits of publishing your data sooner versus later in Ecology and Evolution.[Image: see text]","output":"The early bird gets the return: The benefits of publishing your data sooner"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital health literacy is crucial in accessing and applying health information in the COVID-19 pandemic period.

We report here a carbohydrate microarray analysis of a number of tumor-associated carbohydrates for their serum antibody reactivities and potential immunogenicity in humans. These are the precursors, cores and internal sequences of N-glycans. They are usually masked by other sugar moieties and belong to a class of glyco-antigens that are normally cryptic. However, viral expression of these carbohydrates may trigger host immune responses. For examples, HIV-1 and SARS-CoV display Man9 clusters and tri- or multi-antennary type II (Gal14GlcNAc) chains (Tri/m-II), respectively; viral neutralizing antibodies often target these sugar moieties. We asked, therefore, whether prostate tumor expression of corresponding carbohydrates triggers antibody responses in vivo. Using carbohydrate microarrays, we analyzed a panel of human sera, including 17 samples from prostate cancer patients and 12 from men with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). We observed that IgG antibodies targeting the Man9- or Tri-/m-II-autoantigens are readily detectable in the sera of men with BPH, as well as those with cancer. Importantly, these antibody activities were selectively increased in prostate cancer patients. Thus, human immune systems actively recognize these N-glycan cryptic carbohydrates and produce targeting antibodies.

To better address this threat, representatives from the human, animal, and environmental health sectors in China held a One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization (OHZDP) workshop in May 2019 to develop a list of priority zoonotic diseases for multisectoral, One Health collaboration. METHODS: Representatives used the OHZDP Process, developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), to prioritize zoonotic diseases for China. Representatives defined the criteria used for prioritization and determined questions and weights for each individual criterion. A review of English and Chinese literature was conducted prior to the workshop to collect disease specific information on prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) from China and the Western Pacific Region for zoonotic diseases considered for prioritization. RESULTS: Thirty zoonotic diseases were evaluated for prioritization. Criteria selected included: 1) disease hazard/severity (case fatality rate) in humans, 2) epidemic scale and intensity (in humans and animals) in China, 3) economic impact, 4) prevention and control, and 5) social impact. Disease specific information was obtained from 792 articles (637 in English and 155 in Chinese) and subject matter experts for the prioritization process. Following discussion of the OHZDP Tool output among disease experts, five priority zoonotic diseases were identified for China: avian influenza, echinococcosis, rabies, plague, and brucellosis. CONCLUSION: Representatives agreed on a list of five priority zoonotic diseases that can serve as a foundation to strengthen One Health collaboration for disease prevention and control in China; this list was developed prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic. Next steps focused on establishing a multisectoral, One Health coordination mechanism, improving multisectoral linkages in laboratory testing and surveillance platforms, creating multisectoral preparedness and response plans, and increasing workforce capacity.","output":"Using a One Health approach to prioritize zoonotic diseases in China, 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At present, the global COVID-19 is still severe. More and more countries have experienced second or even third outbreaks. The epidemic is far from over until the vaccine is successfully developed and put on the market on a large scale. Inappropriate epidemic control strategies may bring catastrophic consequences. It is essential to maximize the epidemic restraining and to mitigate economic damage. However, the study on the optimal control strategy concerning both sides is rare, and no optimal model has been built. In this paper, the Susceptible-Infectious-Hospitalized-Recovered (SIHR) compartment model is expanded to simulate the epidemic's spread concerning isolation rate. An economic model affected by epidemic isolation measures is established. The effective reproduction number and the eigenvalues at the equilibrium point are introduced as the indicators of controllability and stability of the model and verified the effectiveness of the SIHR model. Based on the Deep Q Network (DQN), one of the deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods, the blocking policy is studied to maximize the economic output under the premise of controlling the number of infections in different stages. The epidemic control strategies given by deep RL under different learning strategies are compared for different reward coefficients. The study demonstrates that optimal policies may differ in various countries depending on disease spread and anti-economic risk ability. The results show that the more economical strategy, the less economic loss in the short term, which can save economically fragile countries from economic crises. In the second or third outbreak stage, the earlier the government adopts the control strategy, the smaller the economic loss. We recommend the method of deep RL to specify a policy which can control the epidemic while making quarantine economically viable.","output":"Optimal control strategy for COVID-19 concerning both life and economy based on deep reinforcement learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Worldwide diarrhea outbreaks in cattle herds are more frequently detected in calves being that diarrhea outbreaks in adult cattle are not common.

Usually, such aggregation occurs only once, resulting in single-aggregation disease maps whose representation of the underlying data depends on the chosen set of aggregation units. This dependence is described by the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). Despite an extensive literature, in practice, the MAUP is rarely acknowledged, including in disease mapping. Further, despite single-aggregation disease maps being widely relied upon to guide distribution of healthcare resources, potential inefficiencies arising due to the impact of the MAUP on such maps have not previously been investigated. RESULTS: We introduce the overlay aggregation method (OAM) for disease mapping. This method avoids dependence on any single set of aggregate-level mapping units through incorporating information from many different sets. We characterise OAM as a novel smoothing technique and show how its use results in potentially dramatic improvements in resource allocation efficiency over single-aggregation maps. We demonstrate these findings in a simulation context and through applying OAM to a real-world dataset: ischaemic stroke hospital admissions in Perth, Western Australia, in 2016. CONCLUSIONS: The ongoing, widespread lack of acknowledgement of the MAUP in disease mapping suggests that unawareness of its impact is extensive or that impact is underestimated. Routine implementation of OAM can help avoid resource allocation inefficiencies associated with this phenomenon.

This contamination may not be evenly distributed, and there is no validated sampling method for detection of viruses in animal feed or ingredients. The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the sensitivity of ingredient sampling methods for detection of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV). No animals were used in this experiment, so approval from an animal ethics committee was not necessary. Thirteen kg soybean meal was used in a 2  2 factorial plus a control, with 2 doses of PEDV (Low: 10(3) TCID(50)/g versus High: 10(5) TCID(50)/g) and two sample types (individual probes versus composite sample). Soybean meal was confirmed PEDV negative, then loaded into individual, 1\\\\kg polyethylene tote bags with PEDV introduced after loading the first 100 g. There were six replicates per PEDV dose plus a control. Ten individual probes or one composite sample per bag were created and analysed for PEDV via qRT\\\\PCR. The interaction, dose and sample type were significant for both PEDV presence and quantity. No control samples had detectable PEDV. At the low dose, no PEDV RNA was detected in individual probes or composite samples, but was confirmed in 100% (32.4 C(t)) of the inoculant samples. This is likely due to loss of sensitivity during the analysis process, which has been previously reported to cause a loss up to 10 C(t) when detecting PEDV in feed or ingredients. At the high dose, only 37% (37.7 C(t)) of the probes had detectable PEDV RNA. Composite samples were more sensitive (p < .05), with PEDV RNA detected in 100% of samples (35.7 C(t)). In summary, sampling bulk ingredients for PEDV should include compositing at least 10 individual samples.

There were no current guidelines or clear direction on the use of antivirals or other agents on treating Covid\\\\19 for this new virus, and escalating death rates in the underserved community became disturbing. The early studies consisted of studying Chloroquine (CQ) or Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with or without Azithromycin (AZ), Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LV/RV) and other HIV Protease Inhibitors; Remdesivir (RDV) looked promising; however, it was still in clinical trial phases. COVID\\\\19 causes individuals to suffer from respiratory distress, organ failure, hypotension, lactic acidosis, oliguria, and other acute blood disorders due to various pathogens and conditions. This massive infection triggers an immune response which vasoactivates chemicals, such as cytokines, dilate the blood vessels and increase capillary permeability, causing vascular fluid to shift to the interstitium. The immune system extends signaling molecules (cytokines) that recruit immune cells to the infection site as part of an inflammatory response. In a desperate attempt to save lives, Valtrex (VX) was used to treat COVID\\\\19 as an off\\\\label use to stop viral replication, stop inflammation, and promote recovery time for patients sent home with viral pneumonia due to COVID 19 that were Short of breath and who were symptomatic. VX is not without bothersome side\\\\effects: it must be used with caution in persons with kidney disease and in people 60 years and older. To treat the pneumonia with a combination approach, amoxicillin (AMX) with clavulanate(CLV) was used twice a day for five days. In addition, Diflucan 150 mg was used to halt the overproduction of yeast caused by using antibiotics. METHODS: MEDLINE, PubMed, and print repositories on trials: for CQ HCQ with or without AZ, LV/RV, Protease Inhibitors, and RDV in COVID\\\\19 or SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection, until May 2020. The patients were given consent for off\\\\label use of the treatment. The patients involved in the study were between the ages of 25 to 49. They had documented positive test results for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection. Radiologic studies were done as well as a complete blood count and a chemistry level. RESULTS: There were ten people treated with VX, AMX, and Diflucan((DFN). All the participants recovered. One participant had to receive supplemental oxygen and saline nebulizer treatments at home for one due to shortness of breath a month. The comparison group used high doses of probiotics 100 billion cells and ginger shots twice a day. The people who used VX, AMX, and DFN reported recovery from the symptoms of fever, coughing, and SOB in 24\\\\48 hours. However, the patients that used the alternative medications reported symptom improvement around day 5 \\\\7. In conclusion, there is an insufficient confirmation regarding the clinical effectiveness and safety of VX in patients with COVID\\\\19. Its use should be considered preliminary, requiring ethical approval and clinical trial oversight. VX can potentially be used in patients with mild to moderate symptoms of Covid\\\\19 that are sent home and asked to self\\\\quarantine who are symptomatic but requires additional study.","output":"A case study on off\\\\label medications vs alternative medicines in Patients with mild to moderate symptoms of COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) performs non-invasive visualization and characterization of microvasculature in research and clinical applications mainly in ophthalmology and dermatology.

At low values of porosity, the surface forces on the solid obstacles compete with the inertial force of the fluid flow to result in the formation of flow instabilities. In this paper, we report the origin and mechanism of a symmetry-breaking phenomenon in periodic porous media that causes a deviation in the direction of the mean flow from that of the applied pressure gradient. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is used to simulate turbulent flow in a homogeneous porous medium consisting of a periodic, square lattice arrangement of cylindrical solid obstacles. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) is used to simulate the transient stages during symmetry breakdown and also to validate the LES method. Quantitative and qualitative observations are made from the following approaches: (1) macroscale momentum budget, (2) 2D&3D flow visualization. The phenomenon draws its roots from the amplification of a flow instability that emerges from the vortex shedding process. The symmetry-breaking phenomenon is a pitchfork bifurcation that can exhibit multiple modes depending on the local vortex shedding process. The phenomenon is observed to be sensitive to the porosity, solid obstacle shape, and the Reynolds number. It is a source of macroscale turbulence anisotropy in porous media for symmetric solid obstacle geometries. The resulting macroscale flow field is oriented such that it does not align with the plane of symmetry of the porous matrix geometry. The principal axis of the Reynolds stress tensor is not aligned with any of the geometric axes of symmetry, nor with the direction of flow. Thus, symmetry-breaking in porous media involves new flow physics that should be taken into consideration while modeling flow inhomogeneity in the macroscale.","output":"Symmetry-Breaking of Turbulent Flow in Porous Media Composed of Periodically Arranged Solid Obstacles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: We examined associations between job strain and cognitive aging in a sample of older Puerto Ricans.

However, there is a lack of investigation on longitudinal changes in physical activity beyond lockdowns and stay at home orders. Moreover, it is unclear if there is heterogeneity in physical activity growth trajectories. This study aimed to explore longitudinal patterns of physical activity and factors associated with them. Methods: Data were from the UCL COVID -19 Social Study. The analytical sample consisted of 35,915 adults in England who were followed up for 22 weeks from 24th March to 23rd August 2020. Data were analysed using growth mixture models. Findings: Our analyses identified six classes of growth trajectories, including three stable classes showing little change over time (62.4% in total), two classes showing decreasing physical activity (28.6%), and one class showing increasing physical activity over time (9%). A range of factors were found to be associated the class membership of physical activity trajectories, such as age, gender, education, income, employment status, and health. Interpretation: There is substantial heterogeneity in longitudinal changes in physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a substantial proportion of our sample showed persistent physical inactivity or decreasing physical activity. Given the well-established linked between physical activity and health, persistent or increased physical inactivity is likely to have both immediate and long-term implications for people's physical and mental health, as well as general wellbeing.

The immune activities of the central nervous system are profoundly affected by peripheral immune activities. Immune tolerance refers to the unresponsiveness of the immune system to continuous or repeated stimulation to avoid excessive inflammation and unnecessary by-stander injury in the face of continuous antigen threat. It has been proved that the immune tolerance could suppress the development of various peripheral inflammation-related diseases. However, the role of immune tolerance in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases was not clear. METHODS: Rats were injected with repeated low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.3 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 4 days to induce peripheral immune tolerance. Neuroinflammation was produced using intracranial LPS (15 g) injection. Inflammation cytokines were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Microglial activation were measured using immunostaining of Iba-1 and ED-1. Dopaminergic neuronal damage was evaluated using immunochemistry staining and stereological counting of TH-positive neurons. Behavioral impairment was evaluated using amphetamine-induced rotational behavioral assessment. RESULTS: Compared with the non-immune tolerated animals, pre-treatment of peripheral immune tolerance significantly decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines, suppressed the microglial activation, and increased the number of dopaminergic neuronal survival in the substantia nigra. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that peripheral immune tolerance attenuated neuroinflammation and inhibited neuroinflammation-induced dopaminergic neuronal death.

Delirium is preventable and treatable. Recognition of the syndrome is challenging. Our aim was to increase this recognition through robust inpatient screening, utilising a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) approach. Method Stakeholder analysis for a quality improvement project revealed that junior doctors were members of the team most likely to perform a 4AT. Plan, do, study, act (PDSA) cycles were carried out: 1. Junior doctor engagement 2. Verbal prompts in huddle 3. Healthcare assistant (HCA) questionnaires. Results Baseline data showed that on average 0.6% patients had new 4AT over one week on elderly care wards. Intervention 1 involved 4AT handouts given to junior doctors. Number of 4ATs was 3% of patients per week. Intervention 2 used prompts in the morning MDT huddle, asking about concerns for patients. This increased the number of patients having 4AT per week to 6.5%. HCAs did not attend huddles and were targeted in the third intervention. A questionnaire with delirium information and the subsequent question are you concerned about this patient was placed in patient bedside folders. This gave opportunity for HCAs to escalate patients to huddle so 4ATs could be carried out. The questionnaire was completed for 62% of patients, but only 1.4% patients were flagged up and subsequently had 4AT. This time was complicated however by the wards becoming Covid-19 wards. Conclusion Delirium is common however there is missed opportunity for earlier identification.

Monitoring lung stress in assisted ventilation is indispensable, but achieving passive conditions in spontaneously breathing patients to measure driving pressure is challenging. The accuracy of the morphology of airway pressure (Paw) during end-inspiratory occlusion to assure passive conditions during pressure support ventilation has not been examined. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of end-inspiratory occlusions obtained from critically ill patients during pressure support ventilation. Flow, airway, esophageal, gastric, and transdiaphragmatic pressures were analyzed. The rise of gastric pressure during occlusion with a constant/decreasing transdiaphragmatic pressure was used to identify and quantify the expiratory muscle activity. The Paw during occlusion was classified in three patterns, based on the differences at three pre-defined points after occlusion (0.3, 1, and 2 s): a passive-like decrease followed by plateau, a pattern with clear plateau, and an irregular rise pattern, which included all cases of late or continuous increase, with or without plateau. RESULTS: Data from 40 patients and 227 occlusions were analyzed. Expiratory muscle activity during occlusion was identified in 79% of occlusions, and at all levels of assist. After classifying occlusions according to Paw pattern, expiratory muscle activity was identified in 52%, 67%, and 100% of cases of Paw of passive-like, clear plateau, or irregular rise pattern, respectively. The driving pressure was evaluated in the 133 occlusions having a passive-like or clear plateau pattern in Paw. An increase in gastric pressure was present in 46%, 62%, and 64% of cases at 0.3, 1, and 2 s, respectively, and it was greater than 2 cmH(2)O, in 10%, 20%, and 15% of cases at 0.3, 1, and 2 s, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of Paw during an end-inspiratory occlusion in pressure support cannot assure the absence of expiratory muscle activity and accurate measurement of driving pressure. Yet, because driving pressure can only be overestimated due to expiratory muscle contraction, in everyday practice, a low driving pressure indicates an absence of global lung over-stretch. A measurement of high driving pressure should prompt further diagnostic workup, such as a measurement of esophageal pressure.","output":"Airway pressure morphology and respiratory muscle activity during end-inspiratory occlusions in pressure support ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the absence of highly effective antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to counter the known pathophysiological causes of severe COVID-19. Evaluating the efficacy existing drugs may expedite the development of such therapeutics. Severe COVID-19 is largely the result of a dysregulated immune response characterized by lymphocytopenia, neutrophilia and critical hypercytokinemia, or cytokine storm, which is largely mediated by the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). The IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab (TCZ) could potentially suppress the effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokine and thereby lower mortality from the disease. This systematic analysis aimed to investigate and synthesize existing evidence for the efficacy of TCZ in reducing COVID-19 mortality. METHODOLOGY: PubMed and SearchWorks searches were performed to locate clinical studies with primary data on TCZ treatment for severe COVID-19. Sixteen case-control studies comparing mortality between TCZ and standard of care (SOC) were identified for quantitative synthesis. The systematic analysis was pre-approved through PROSPERO (CRD42020193479). RESULTS: Combined mortality for the TCZ-treated and SOC groups were 26.0% and 43.4% respectively. In all but one of the studies, the odds ratio of mortality from COVID-19 pointed towards lower fatality with TCZ vs the SOC. A combined random effects odds ratio calculation yielded an odds ratio of 0.453 (95% CI [0.376C0.547], p < 0.001). Additionally, 18 uncontrolled trials were identified for qualitative analysis producing a raw combined mortality rate of 16.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Important caveats to this research include the lack of prospective randomized control trials and the absence of data from the large COVATA study from the published literature. However, results from this systematic analysis of published research provide positive evidence for the potential efficacy of TCZ to treat severe COVID-19, validating the ethical basis and merit of ongoing randomized controlled clinical trials.","output":"The efficacy of IL-6 inhibitor Tocilizumab in reducing severe COVID-19 mortality: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim to provide valid, relevant, permanent, timely information to all health care institutions, as well as citizens of Ukraine in the framework of public health management processes for quality medical care.

There is currently no consensus on the complement or scope of care delivered by these providers, nor is there a repository of studies that evaluate the various models of care. We conducted a rapid scoping review to identify and map what care provider models and interventions in LTCH have been evaluated to improve quality of life, quality of care, and health outcomes of residents. METHODS: We conducted this review over 10-weeks of English language, peer-reviewed studies published from 2010 onward. Search strategies for databases (e.g., MEDLINE) were run on July 9, 2020. Studies that evaluated models of provider care (e.g., direct patient care), or interventions delivered to facility, staff, and residents of LTCH were included. Study selection was performed independently, in duplicate. Mapping was performed by two reviewers, and data were extracted by one reviewer, with partial verification by a second reviewer. RESULTS: A total of 7,574 citations were screened based on the title/abstract, 836 were reviewed at full text, and 366 studies were included. Studies were classified according to two main categories: healthcare service delivery (n = 92) and implementation strategies (n = 274). The condition/ focus of the intervention was used to further classify the interventions into subcategories. The complex nature of the interventions may have led to a study being classified in more than one category/subcategory.

We analyze COVID-19 press conferences and press briefings issued during Feb-May 2020, for over 123 LMICs and for international organizations (e.g. the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Health Organization (WHO)). Our virtual audit shows that only 65% of countries have a sign language interpreter (SLI) present in COVID-19 press briefings and conferences. This number is smaller in low-income countries (41%) and Sub-Saharan African countries (54%). Surprisingly, none of the international organizations including the WHO has a SLI present during COVID-19 press briefings. We recommend all countries and international organizations to reconsider ways to make press conferences accessible to a wide audience in general, and to the hearing impaired communities in particular by including a SLI during their COVID-19 briefings, a primary step towards upholding the sustainable development pledge of no one gets left behind.","output":"Are Responses to the Pandemic Inclusive?

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study from February 2018 to 2020. SETTING: An urban academic quaternary referral center. PATIENTS: Adult patients greater than or equal to 18 years admitted to the ICU from the ED. Exclusion criteria included age less than 18 years, do not resuscitate/do not intubate documented prior to arrival, advanced directives outlining limitations of care, and inability to calculate baseline modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (mSOFA) score. INTERVENTIONS: ED-based critical care consultation by an early intervention team (EIT) initiated by the primary emergency medicine physician compared with usual practice. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was hospital LOS, and secondary outcomes were hospital mortality, ICU LOS, ventilator-free days, and change in the mSOFA. MAIN RESULTS: A total 1,764 patients met inclusion criteria, of which 492 (27.9%) were evaluated by EIT. Final analysis, excluding those without baseline mSOFA score, limited to 1,699 patients, 476 in EIT consultation group, and 1,223 in usual care group. Baseline mSOFA scores (sd) were higher in the EIT consultation group at 3.6 (2.4) versus 2.6 (2.0) in the usual care group. After propensity score matching, there was no difference in the primary outcome: EIT consultation group had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) LOS of 7.0 days (4.0C13.0 d) compared with the usual care group median (IQR) LOS of 7.0 days (4.0C13.0 d), p = 0.64. The median (IQR) boarding time was twice as long subjects in the EIT consultation group at 8.0 (5.0C15.0) compared with 4.0 (3.0C7.0) usual care, p < 0.001.

Transfer diversion has a dramatic impact on rural hospitals because these facilities are forced to care for critically ill patients who normally would have been transferred to tertiary care centers for higher levels of care. Many of these rural hospitals have the equipment to care for critically ill patients, but lack physicians trained and experienced in the management of critical care. To mitigate this issue, the academic medical center at which this research occurred instituted a telemedicine program to provide critical care services to rural hospitals within the state. This research evaluated the outcomes of this program. Methods: A summative evaluation was conducted. The telemedicine critical care program was initiated at three rural hospitals, and rapidly expanded to four additional hospitals based on the immediate reduction in the number of transfers. Telemedicine services were provided by emergency physicians with a critical care-trained physician providing medical oversight. Telemedicine consults were initiated either in the emergency department or after the patient was admitted to the hospital. Patient care evaluations were conducted daily until the patient was either discharged, transferred, or transitioned to comfort care. If a patients care requirements exceeded the capability of a rural site despite critical care telemedicine involvement, the academic medical center accepted all transfers regardless of diversion status. The following data were collected: number of patient consultations, number of transfers, and mortality rates. Results: From July 20, 2020 through May 20, 2021, 551 patients were evaluated and treated using the telemedicine critical care program (76.6% COVID-19 related, 23.4% not-COVID-19 related) (See Figure 1). Of the 551 patients 67.2% were discharged from the rural facilities, 8.3% were provided end-of-life care without transfer, and 24.5% were transferred to the tertiary hospital. This is a decrease in transfers of approximately 80.0%. On comparison COVID-19 mortality was similar across all sites: rural hospitals (including transferred patients) 29.0%, after transfer 30.1%, and at the tertiary hospital 32.4%. Conclusion: This research demonstrated that a tertiary to rural hospital telemedicine critical care program can reduce transfers while providing optimal levels of care during a pandemic. Without this program all of the patients would have been transferred including some to out-of-state facilities. The reduction in transfers, while necessitated due to transfer diversion, had other benefits including keeping patients close to home and generating revenue for rural hospitals. The COVID-19 pandemic caused urban and suburban hospitals to exceed their inpatient capacity and required low-resource hospitals in rural areas to adopt new methods for caring for higher acuity patients. The telemedicine critical care program met this challenge. Future research will evaluate post pandemic telemedicine critical care utilization including recent changes which have lowered barriers for usage such as removal of the rural designation for billing, the addition of cooperative agreements by non-affiliated health systems and hospitals, and continued service reimbursement.

The model showed that, although no death of children would result from the reopening of the schools in the three cities analysed, the risk of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases and secondary cases among teachers, school staff and relatives of the children is not negligible. Although the epidemic hit different regions with different intensities, our model shows that, for regions where the incidence profile is similar to the cities analysed, the risk of reopening of schools is still too high. This in spite of the fact that incidences in these cities were declining in the period of the time considered. Therefore, although we cannot extend the result to the entire country, the overall conclusion is valid for regions with a declining incidence and it is even more valid for regions where incidence is increasing. We assumed a very conservative level of infection transmissibility of children of just 10% as that of adults. In spite of the very low level of transmissibility is assumed, the number of secondary cases caused by infected children among teachers, school staff and relatives varied from 2 to 85. It is, therefore, too soon to have any degree of confidence that reopening of schools before the advent of a vaccine is the right decision to take.

It was presumed that the aerosols exhaled through the tubes while playing would be ejected over larger distances and spread into the room due to jet stream effects. In particular, the soprano recorder is widely used as instrument in school classes and for beginners of all age groups in their musical education, as well as in contexts of leisure activities and in professional concert performances. Understanding the aerosol impulse dispersion characteristics of playing the soprano recorder could assist with the establishment of concepts for safe music-making. Methods: Five adult professionally trained soprano recorder players (4 female, 1 male) played four bars of the main theme of L. van Beethovens \\"Ode to Joy\\" in low and in high octaves, as well as with 3 different potential protection devices in the high octave. For comparison they spoke the corresponding text by F. Schiller. Before each task, they inhaled .5 L of vapor from an e-cigarette filled with base liquid. The vapor cloud escaping during speaking or playing was recorded by cameras and its spread was measured as a function of time in the three spatial dimensions. The potential safety devices were rated in practicability with a questionnaire, and their influence on the sound was compared, generating a long-term average spectrum from the audio data. Results: When playing in the high octave, at the end of the task the clouds showed a median distance of 1.06 m to the front and .57 m diameter laterally (maxima: x: 1.35 m and y: .97 m). It was found that the clouds expansion values in playing the recorder with and without safety measures are mostly lower when compared to the ordinary, raised speaking voice of the same subjects. The safety devices which covered the instrument did not show clear advantages and were rated as unpracticable by the subjects. The most effective reduction of the cloud was reached when playing into a suction funnel. Conclusion: The aerosol dispersion characteristics of soprano recorders seem comparable to clarinets.

In this study, we conducted a mixed methods content analysis of biodiversity plans by 39 cities around the world to determine whether they measured their actions, how they did so (via quantitative indicators and qualitative outputs), and what topics these actions and measures covered. We based our analytical framework on the Singapore Index on Cities Biodiversity (also known as the City Biodiversity Index), a widely applied 23-indicator index that helps cities track their progress in biodiversity planning. The Singapore Index groups its indicators into the following three core components: native biodiversity, ecosystem services, and governance and management. For actions and measures not classifiable by the Singapore Index, we inductively derived additional categories. Across all plans, we identified 2,231 actions, 346 indicators, and 444 outputs. We found that all of the plans included actions, while 82% included measures (67% included indicators and 72% included outputs). Only 29% of actions were associated with a measure. Overall, the plans covered all of the categories in the Singapore Index, particularly within the core components of native biodiversity and governance and management, though some plans had a narrower focus. The 20 additional urban biodiversity topics that were not covered by the Singapore Index framework included socioeconomic considerations, data collection, genetic diversity, urban agriculture and forestry, green infrastructure, human-wildlife conflicts, indigenous concerns, and citizen science.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of LigaSure Impact in abdominoplasty compared with the conventional techniques, diathermia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients underwent primary abdominoplasty after massive weight loss at a single center from 1 January 2008 to 31 May 2015 and were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 94 patients eligible for the study were divided into two groups on basis of the dissection technique: LigaSure Impact group (29 patients) and the conventional technique group (65 patients). Total intraoperative blood loss was the primary endpoint. Duration of the operation, perioperative complications and re-operation were recorded as secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the groups. Significant differences were found in intraoperative blood loss favoring LigaSure Impact group (259.6  198.8 mL vs 377.9  190.0 mL, p = 0.004) and blood transfusion rates (13.8% vs 35.4%, p = 0.047).

Reviewing their shortcomings can provide elements to consider in light of the second wave currently underway in Europe. Here we estimate the rate of detection of COVID-19 symptomatic cases in France after lockdown through the use of virological3 and participatory syndromic4 surveillance data coupled with mathematical transmission models calibrated to regional hospitalizations2. Our findings indicate that around 90,000 incident symptomatic infections, corresponding to 9 out 10 cases, were not ascertained by the surveillance system in the first 7 weeks following lockdown from May 11 to June 28 2020, although the test positivity rate did not exceed WHO recommendations (5%)5. The median detection rate increased from 7% [6-8]% to 38% [35-44]% over time, with large regional variations, owing to a strengthening of the system as well as a decrease of epidemic activity. According to participatory surveillance data, only 31% of individuals with COVID-19-like symptoms consulted a doctor in the study period. This suggests that large numbers of symptomatic COVID-19 cases did not seek medical advice despite recommendations, as confirmed by serological studies6,7. Encouraging awareness and same-day healthcare-seeking behavior in suspect cases is critical to improve detection. However, the capacity of the system remained insufficient even at the low levels of viral circulation achieved after lockdown, and was predicted to deteriorate rapidly with increasing epidemic activity.

The abrupt closure of economic activities through lockdown measures have shown how the concentration of air pollutants and noise from different sources are long-standing, major environmental and health issues in the European Union, especially in highly populated urban areas. Scientific evidence underscores that simultaneous exposure to air pollutants and noise constitutes a mutually reinforcing threat to human health. However, the current regulatory approaches in the European legislation still fall short in addressing the issues of air and noise pollution in a comprehensive and coordinated manner. The lack of harmonized and effective planning regime for air and noise pollution runs against the objectives pursued by the European Green Deal, whereas an effective and integrated response to environmental issues should underpin EU policies in the post Covid-19 recovery. This contribution thus analyzes two key EU legal regimes addressing air and noise pollution, namely Directive 2008/50/ec and Directive 2002/49/ec, respectively, to appraise their mutual pitfalls against the said need to adopt an integrated response to air and noise pollution. Moreover, the paper sheds further light on innovative approaches, such as integrated urban planning, citizen science and Internet of Things as key means to enhance cities' resilience and support the implementation of effective legal responses to air and noise pollution. 2022 ?

In this case report, we went about proning a corona virus positive patient for 6-8hrs as a potential early intervention to prevent progression to ARDS. Our patient was initially in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and placed on nasal cannula. He was started on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin with no improvement of symptoms. However within the span of few hours of proning he experienced significant symptomatic relief with improvement of oxygenation.

There is a need to identify potentially severe or critical cases early using a novel test for preventing fatality. Coronavirus utilizes angiotens in converting enzyme receptors (ACE) for gaining entry to host cells and leads to multiorgan failure. ACE 2 receptors are present in the liver, cardia, skeletal muscles, kidneys, brain, RBCs. These organs also have high concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase enzyme. It is worth noting the increase in AST which would indirectly be used as evidence for severity. MATERIAL This a cross-sectional retrospective study including 120 non-alcoholic Covid 19 patients (50 survivors and 70 non-survivors), aged > 18 years tested positive for RTPCR and were admitted to our hospital. The results of tests like neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, CRP, D Dimer, LDH, ferritin, albumin, AST, ALT, AST/ALT ratio, bilirubin, urea, and creatinine values were noted from the case records. All the tests were done on the day of admission. Receiver operator curve analysis was plotted for these parameters and their usefulness in predicting mortality was deduced and compared with AST/ALT ratio. OBSERVATION The mean age of the study group was 50.63 years with 60 % males and 40 % females. Using Mann Whitney test statistical significance of studied parameters was proved with a p-value of <0.005. The ROC curve analysis was performed for all the tests and clinical relevance of the same in terms of predicting mortality between survivors and non-survivors is determined. DE RITIS ratio had the best utility as a predictor of poor prognosis with sensitivity and specificity of 83% and 88% respectively (p-value > 0.001). It surpassed the N/L ratio and CRP for predicting mortality in COVID patients. Cut -off value of the DE RITIS ratio for predicting fatality was 1.28 with a significant p-value of < 0.001. CONCLUSION DE RITIS ratio can be used as the best parameter among the other novel tests for predicting severity in covid patients for effective resource allocation and timely intervention.","output":"The Study of De Ritis (Ast/ Alt) Ratio in Comparision with Other Parameters for Predicting Poor Prognosis in Covid 19 Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thailand has committed to reducing population sodium intake by 30% by 2025.

Vaccination rates were analyzed also in the corresponding pediatric population.Almost 27% of participants declared they were in favor of vaccinations, and in fact real life vaccination rates in children exceeded the national mean. Only 26.5% of respondents declared they would receive COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine refusal was attributed to safety concerns in 76% of parents. Specific vaccine attributes further reduced the acceptance rate. Female gender, younger age and lower education level were associated with non-adherence to vaccination. Among extrinsic factors of COVID-19 vaccination, only information from National Health Authorities was significantly associated to vaccine acceptance.The rate of potential COVID-19 vaccine acceptability was very poor in our population of parents.

This descriptive study included individuals aged 20 years or older who were diagnosed with invasive cancer (adenocarcinoma) of the colon or rectum between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2014. Laparoscopic surgery was higher in colon cancer (24.1%) compared to rectal cancer (13.6%). For colon cancer, the percentage of laparoscopic surgery ranged from 12.9% to 29.2%, with significant differences by regional health authority (RHA) of surgery. In 86.1% of colon cancers, 12 lymph nodes were removed. In Manitoba, the negative circumferential resection margin for rectal cancers was 96.9%, and ranged from 96.0% to 100.0% between RHAs. The median time between first colonoscopy and resection was 40 days for individuals with colon cancer. This study showed that high-quality colorectal cancer surgery is being conducted in Manitoba along with some variation and gaps in quality. As a result of this work, a formal structure for ongoing measuring and reporting surgical quality has been established in Manitoba.

For example, tests that measure the ability to identify odors may confound sensory performance with memory recall, verbal ability, and past experience with the odor. Conversely, typical threshold-based tests avoid these issues, but are labor intensive. Additionally, many commercially-available olfactory tests are slow and may require a trained administrator, making them impractical for use in a short wellness visit or other broad clinical assessment. We tested the performance of the Adaptive Olfactory Measure of Threshold (ArOMa-T) C a novel odor detection threshold test that employs an adaptive Bayesian algorithm paired with a disposable odorant C delivery card C in a non-clinical sample of individuals (n=534) at the 2021 Twins Day Festival in Twinsburg, OH. Participants successfully completed the test in under 3 min with a false alarm rate of 9.6% and a test-retest reliability of 0.61. Odor detection thresholds differed by sex (~3.2-fold lower for females) and age (~8.7-fold lower for the youngest versus the oldest age group), consistent with prior studies. In an exploratory analysis, we failed to observe evidence of detection threshold differences between participants who reported a history of COVID-19 and matched controls who did not. We also found evidence for broad-sense heritability of odor detection thresholds. Together, these data indicate the ArOMa-T can determine odor detection thresholds.

This paper aims to examine the long-run and short-run association between natural resource rent, financial development, and urbanization on carbon emission from the context of the USA during 1995C2015 with the help of a contemporary and innovative approach named quantile autoregressive distributed lagged model (QARDL). The stated approach is applied due to the fact that non-linearity is observed for the study variables. The findings indicated that the higher financial development (0.304), natural resource rent (0.102), and urbanization (0.489) have a positive impact on the environmental degradation in the region of USA during long-run estimation in the stated quantiles of the study. This would indicate that higher financial development, urbanization, and natural resources are putting more environmental pressure on the economy of the USA. Similarly, the findings under short-run estimation confirm that past and lagged values of carbon emission, financial development, natural resource rent, and urbanization are significantly determining the current values of the carbon emission. For this reason, it is suggested that the government requires some immediate steps of the USA to control the harmful effect of such financial development, more urbanization, and higher natural resource rent as well.

Additionally, phytochemical compounds, defense enzymes as well as antioxidant activity against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2-azino-bis(ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS(+)) radical assays of crude extracts (methylene chloride:methanol, 1:1) were evaluated. Based on antioxidant activity, four promising extracts were subjected to different biological activities such as anticancer, antimicrobial, and antiviral activities. The obtained results revealed that supplementation of external nitrogen source in the form of sodium nitrate was found to increase the total phycobiliprotein content by fivefold. Also, nitrogen depletion provoked significantly highest quantities of phenolic and flavonoid content and this has effects on biological activities of Nostoc linckia. Moreover, 0.3 g/l S was found to be the most effective extract exhibiting a significant increase in antioxidant activity based on DPPH and ABTS assays, respectively (88.18  0.64% and 84.20  1.01%).

The data were analysed thematically. RESULTS 108 articles were included. Most focussed on the Zika virus outbreak (n = 50) and the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 28). Four key themes were identified: importance of contraception during disasters, impact of disasters on contraceptive behaviour, barriers to contraception during disasters and ways of improving use of contraception during disasters. Despite efforts to increase access to contraception including by transforming ways of delivery, barriers to use meant that unmet need persisted. CONCLUSIONS To prevent adverse health outcomes and reduce health costs as a result of failure to have access to contraception during disasters, there is a need to intensify efforts to remove barriers to use. This should include increasing access and information on methods of contraception and their side effects (e.g., menstrual suppression) and making contraception freely available.","output":"The impact of disasters on contraception in OECD member countries: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase anxiety levels within the community and in particular medical students who are already considered psychologically vulnerable groups Since the COVID-19 outbreak, no study has yet estimated the effect of this pandemic on university students in the UAE or its impact on the psychological well-being of medical students Methods and Materials: We surveyed 1485 medical (comprising medical and dental) and non-medical university students across 4 emirates within the UAE We used an online platform to assess knowledge, sources of information, changes in hygienic behavior, perceptions of fear and worry and anxiety levels using the generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale The GAD-7 score was measured at three time points: during hospital visits for medical/dental students, before the introduction of online learning and after online learning for all students Results: The majority of students demonstrated high levels of knowledge and utilized reliable sources of information Non-medical students exercised higher compliance with social restrictions, while medical students practiced better hand hygiene Almost half of students reported anxiety levels ranging from mild to severe with females reporting higher anxiety scores during hospital visits (OR=2 02, 95% CI, 1 41 to 2 91) and medical students reporting lower anxiety levels in comparison to dental students (OR=0 61, 95% CI, 0 45 to 0 84) Medical students reported higher levels of anxiety during their clinical rotations which decreased with the introduction of online learning, yet, non-medical students anxiety levels increased with online learning Conclusion: This study provides important information on the initial response and anxiety levels in university students across the UAE during the COVID-19 pandemic The findings from our study can be used to support the development of effective screening strategies and interventions to build psychological resilience among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health emergencies in the future ? 2020 Saddik et al","output":"Increased levels of anxiety among medical and non-medical university students during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Arab Emirates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the 1st case officially confirmed on the last March 2020, Indonesia recorded more than 1000 new cases daily.

Results: : Our search identified 26,005 different mutations. The largest number of mutations was located within the gene encoding for the Nsp3 protein (20.7%), followed by the gene encoding for the spike protein (14.6%). Overall, 17948/26005 (69.0%) of these mutations interested single nucleotide positions, thus spanning over ~62% of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome. Of all mutations, 61.5% were non-synonymous, whilst 17.4% of those in the gene encoding for the spike protein involved the sequence of the receptor binding domain, 59.2%, of which were non-synonymous. When the number of mutations was expressed as ratio to the gene size, the highest ratio was found in the sequence encoding for ORF7a (ratio, 2.25), followed by ORF7b (ratio, 1.85), ORF8 (ratio, 1.60) and ORF3a (ratio, 1.48). The gene encoding for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase accounted for only 0.1% of all mutations, with a considerably low ratio with the gene size (i.e., ratio, 0.01).

What does emerge, however, is an understanding that the reported outcomes reflect social inequities rather than biological predispositions. The inequities flow from both historical forces and contemporary ones that leave sizeable fractions of the Black population without access to quality healthcare or safe environments.

Some evidence indicates this has been paralleled by an increasing proportion of non-cardiovascular mortality in people with CVD. However, the contemporary causes of death across a broad spectrum of CVDs, either alone or in combination, remains unclear. We analysed cardiovascular, infection, cancer and other causes of death prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in 493,280 participants in the prospective UK Biobank study. Studied CVDs included baseline: abdominal aortic aneurysm, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, heart failure, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, valvular heart disease and venous thromboembolic disease; we separately considered cardiovascular multimorbidity defined as the total number of these baseline CVDs. Crude mortality rates and Poisson regression analysis were used to quantify the absolute and relative risk of cause-specific death. Associations are reported as incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% CIs. During a median follow-up of 10.9 [IQR 10.1-11.6] years per participant, there were 27,729 deaths (20.4% primarily attributed to CVD, 53.6% to cancer, 5.0% to infection and 21.0% to other causes). As the number of co-morbid CVDs increased, the proportion of cardiovascular and infection-related deaths increased, whereas cancer and other deaths decreased. Accrual of multiple CVDs was associated with marked increases in relative risk of infection and cardiovascular death; versus those without CVD, people with three or more CVDs, the relative risk of cardiovascular death increased most (IRR 3.89; 95%CI 3.59-4.21), followed by infection (4.41; 3.44-5.64), with other (2.01; 1.72-2.35) and cancer (1.52; 1.35-1.72) being substantially less increased. All studied CVDs except atrial fibrillation were independently associated with increased risk of infection death, with heart failure (2.73; 1.60-4.66) and valvular heart disease (3.09; 2.38-4.00) posing the greatest risk. In conclusion, causes of death vary substantially between differing baseline CVDs, and according to the number of baseline CVDs, with non-cardiovascular deaths due to cancer and infection making an important contribution. Holistic and personalized care are likely to be important tools for continuing to improve outcomes in people with CVD.","output":"Causes of death in people with cardiovascular disease: a prospective UK Biobank cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Outbreak and pandemic of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in 2019/2020 will challenge global health for the future.

This Special Section describes numerous innovations. Here we take a practitioner's view in understanding the key issues related to assessment of mental health in humanitarian contexts and how the innovations contribute to the field. MAIN BODY: In this guide for practitioners, we address the following issues: (1) clarifying the intended purpose of conducting mental health assessment in humanitarian crises: why is this information collected and for what intended purposes?; (2) determining what type of tool should be selected and the types of psychometric properties that are important for tools serving this particular purpose; (3) when a validated tool is not available, considering how qualitative and quantitative methods should be used to generate information on validity; and finally, (4) how to report on validity and its implications for interpreting information for humanitarian practitioners, governments, care providers, and other stakeholders supporting people affected by humanitarian emergencies. CONCLUSION: Ultimately, mental health assessment tools are not independent of the group with which they were designed, nor are the psychometric properties of the tools or their utility universal across purposes. Therefore, organizations and stakeholders will optimize their positive impact when choosing tools wisely, appropriately adapting and validating tools, and providing guidance on how to interpret those findings to best serve populations in need.","output":"Measuring mental health in humanitarian crises: a practitioners guide to validity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remote education has become necessary to resume teaching activities during the pandemic.

Folate intake was estimated using a sample of N = 1248 subjects aged 10C74 years, stratified in three age groups (adolescents, adults, elderly population), through two 24 h-dietary recalls and food propensity questionnaire. Data on serum folate and homocysteine was available for 280 participants. Very low folate intake (<300 g/day) was observed in 59% of adolescents, 58% of adults and 68% of elderlies, and only about 12% achieved the WHO recommended level of 400 g/day. Major dietary contributors were vegetables and fruit, and cereal products. Living environment, education, employment status and BMI were linked with low folate intake in adults; BMI, and sex in adolescents; and sex in elderlies. Considering low serum folate (<7 nmol/L) and high serum homocysteine (>15 nmol/L), folate deficiency was found in 7.6 and 10.5% in adults and elderlies, respectively.

The ideal treatment procedure for GI remains controversial. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 63-year-old female was admitted to our hospital following persistent nausea and vomiting for 7 days. Computed tomography revealed a partially calcified 4-cm circular object in the jejunum, and the proximal intestine was dilated, with concomitant pneumobilia. Based on the preoperative diagnosis of GI, enterotomy with stone extraction by single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) was performed. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and the cholecystoduodenal fistula closed spontaneously 4 months after the surgery. DISCUSSION Recent studies have reported that enterotomy with stone extraction alone is associated with better outcomes than with more invasive techniques. This case also suggests that enterotomy with stone extraction alone and careful postoperative follow-up is feasible for the management of GI. Although the use of laparoscopy in the management of GI has been described previously, laparoscopic surgery has not been widely performed, and SILS is not generally performed. When only this less demanding procedure is required, laparoscopic surgery, including SILS, can be a viable option.

Several management strategies have been used with no clear consensus recommendations. We examined subjects with tandem occlusions enrolled in the ESCAPE trial and their outcomes. METHODS Data are from the ESCAPE trial. Additional data were sought on interventions for each subject. RESULTS There were 54 (17%) subjects with tandem extracranial and intracranial occlusions. Patients in the endovascular treatment arm (n=30) were more likely to be younger (median age 66 years, p<0.01), male (66.7%, p=0.03), diabetic, and without atrial fibrillation. Subjects with tandem occlusions were more likely to have intracranial internal carotid artery occlusions than M1 occlusions (p<0.01). Of the 30 intervention-arm subjects, 17 (57%) underwent emergency endovascular treatment of the extracranial disease, 10 subjects before and seven subjects after intracranial thrombectomy. Of the remaining 13 subjects, only four required staged carotid revascularization due to persistent severe carotid stenosis; four had cervical pseudo-occlusions with no residual stenosis after large distal carotid thrombus burden aspiration/retrieval. Outcomes were similar between subjects with and without tandem lesions. The use of antithrombotic agents after acute carotid artery stenting was variable but no symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was seen in subjects who underwent emergency endovascular treatment of extracranial carotid artery.

Given their central role in supporting children's development, child care professionals' overall physical and mental health is important. Objectives: To evaluate the prevalence of chronic diseases, depression, and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic among U.S. child care professionals. Design: In this large-scale national survey, data were collected through an online survey from May 22, 2020 to June 8, 2020. We analyzed the association of sociodemographic characteristics with four physical health conditions (asthma, heart disease, diabetes, and obesity), depression, and stress weighted to national representativeness. Sociodemographic characteristics included race, ethnicity, age, gender, medical insurance status, and child care type. Setting: Center- and home-based child care. Participants: Child care professionals (n = 81,682) from all U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Results: Mean age was 42.1 years (standard deviation = 14.1); 96.0% (n = 78,725) were female, 2.5% (n = 2,033) were male, and 0.3% (n = 225) were non-binary. For physical health conditions, 14.3% (n = 11,717) reported moderate to severe asthma, 6.5% (n = 5,317) diabetes, 4.9% (n = 3,971) heart disease, and 19.8% (n = 16,207) being obese.

It has been shown that circulating cytokines and endothelial dysfunction play an important role in the process of clot formation. The aim of our study was to assess the concentration of various circulating cytokines, endothelial function and blood clotting in AMI patients depending on the blood flow through the infarction-related artery (IRA). METHODS: We included 75 patients with AMI. 58 presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and 17 had non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI). A flow-mediated dilation test (FMD test), thrombodynamics and rotational thromboelastometry as well as assessment of 14 serum cytokines using xMAP technology were performed. FINDINGS: Non-STEMI-patients were characterized by higher levels of MDC, MIP-1, TNF-. Moreover, we observed that patients with impaired blood flow through the IRA (TIMI flow 0-1) had higher average and initial clot growth rates, earlier onset of spontaneous clots, C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-10 compared to patients with preserved blood flow through the IRA (TIMI flow 2-3). Patients with TIMI 2-3 blood flow had higher level of IP-10. IL-10 correlated with CRP and pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, initial clot growth rate and clot lysis time in TIMI 0-1 patients. All these differences were statistically significant. INTERPRETATION: We demonstrated that concentrations of the inflammatory cytokines correlate not only with the form of myocardial infarction (STEMI or non-STEMI), but also with the blood flow through the infarct-related artery. Inflammatory response, functional state of endothelium, and clot formation are closely linked with each other.

METHODS: Data on the illnesses recorded were extracted from the passenger and crew arrival registers and passenger and crew illness logs for all ships and maritime vessels arriving at Barbados Ports and passing through its territorial waters between January 2009 and December 2013. Data were entered into an Epi Info database and most of the analysis undertaken using Epi Info Version 7. Rates per 100,000 visits were calculated, and confidence intervals on these were derived using the software Openepi. RESULTS: There were 1031 cases of illness from over 3 million passenger visits and 1 million crew visits during this period. The overall event rate for communicable illnesses was 15.7 (95 % CI 14.4C17.1) per 100,000 passengers, and for crew was 24.0 (21.6C26.6) per 100, 000 crew. Gastroenteritis was the predominant illness experienced by passengers and crew followed by influenza. The event rate for gastroenteritis among passengers was 13.7 (12.5C15.0) per 100,000 and 14.4 (12.6, 16.5) for crew. The event rate for non-communicable illnesses was 3.4 per 100,000 passengers with myocardial infarction being the main diagnosis. The event rate for non-communicable illnesses among crew was 2.1 per 100,000, the leading cause being injuries. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant illnesses reported were gastroenteritis and influenza similar to previous published reports from around the world. This study is the first of its type in the Caribbean and the data provide a baseline for future surveillance and for comparison with other countries and regions.","output":"An epidemiological study of rates of illness in passengers and crew at a busy Caribbean cruise port"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a novel ultrasound imaging point-of-care (PoC) COVID-19 diagnostic system. The adaptive visual diagnostics utilize few-shot learning (FSL) to generate encoded disease state models that are stored and classified using a dictionary of knowns. The novel vocabulary based feature processing of the pipeline adapts the knowledge of a pretrained deep neural network to compress the ultrasound images into discrimative descriptions. The computational efficiency of the FSL approach enables high diagnostic deep learning performance in PoC settings, where training data is limited and the annotation process is not strictly controlled. The algorithm performance is evaluated on the open source COVID-19 POCUS Dataset to validate the system's ability to distinguish COVID-19, pneumonia, and healthy disease states. The results of the empirical analyses demonstrate the appropriate efficiency and accuracy for scalable PoC use.

Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is warranted because both medications cause corrected QT-interval (QTc) prolongation. Whether QTc duration significantly varies during the day, potentially requiring multiple ECGs, remains to be established. METHODS: We performed 12-lead ECGs and 12-lead 24-h Holter ECG monitoring in all patients aged <80 years admitted to our medical unit for COVID-19, in oral therapy with hydroxychloroquine (200 mg, twice daily) and azithromycin (500 mg, once daily) for at least 3 days. A group of healthy individuals matched for age and sex served as control. RESULTS: Out of 126 patients, 22 (median age 64, 82% men) met the inclusion criteria. ECG after therapy showed longer QTc-interval than before therapy (450 vs 426 ms, p = .02). Four patients had a QTc &#8805; 480 ms: they showed higher values of aspartate aminotransferase (52 vs 30 U/L, p = .03) and alanine aminotransferase (108 vs 33 U/L, p < .01) compared with those with QTc < 480 ms. At 24-h Holter ECG monitoring, 1 COVID-19 patient and no control had &#8805;1 run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (p = .4). No patients showed \\"R on T\\" premature ventricular beats. Analysis of 24-h QTc dynamics revealed that COVID-19 patients had higher QTc values than controls, with no significant hourly variability. CONCLUSION: Therapy with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin prolongs QTc interval in patients with COVID-19, particularly in those with high levels of transaminases. Because QTc duration remains stable during the 24 h, multiple daily ECG are not recommendable.","output":"Arrhythmic profile and 24-hour QT interval variability in COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to validate the Short Multidimensional Inventory Lifestyle Evaluation-Confinement (SMILE-C) in a Malaysian context.

In such scenarios, telecollaboration and virtual exchange have gained increased attention as powerful pedagogical strategies to allow for the continuity of intercultural exchanges and understanding the trends of this growing field can be of high significance to practitioners when planning future related initiatives. Although telecollaboration and virtual exchange are not new phenomena, to the best of our knowledge, a thorough bibliometric study of the area, considering the characteristics of its publications and its scientific community, has not yet been developed. This study carried out a bibliometric analysis of the telecollaboration and virtual exchange research field using a set of 254 articles from the Web of Science and Scopus databases with the objective of characterising the area as well as identifying research tendencies. In particular, this study uses four analytical scientometric tools: co-citation, co-authorship, keywords co-occurrence analysis and identification of research trends. This study identified emerging and declining themes in the field of telecollaboration and virtual exchange, confirming that the practice is increasingly adopting diverse formats and cutting across different knowledge fields. In addition, results showed that international collaboration so far involves few countries and there is much space to widen co-authorship networks to enhance intercultural exchanges. The review also explores the benefits and drawbacks of the technological tools adopted in the studies from our sample database.

Methods: : A total of 194 positive COVID-19 patients were collected from Tianyou Hospital and Puren Hospital, affiliated hospital of Wuhan University of Science and Technology. Their demographic characteristics were analyzed. The dynamic changes of CRP and L in peripheral blood were retrospectively studied. Results: : (1) There were significant statistical differences in CRP, L in clinical typing and clinical outcome in patients over 60 years old compared with those under 60 years old. Survival analysis showed that the risk of death was greater in patients over 60 than in those under 60.2In 125 patients over 60 years old, the hospitalized patients with severe or critical types of disease had significantly higher CRP than those with moderate type (p<0.01). In the outcome of the elderly patients, the CRP of the patients with the outcomes of discharge, improvement, aggravation and death increased successively (p<0.01). According to the analysis of Logistic regression model, the increase of CRP constitutes a risk factor for death in elderly patients. (3) In the ROC curve analysis to distinguish the death outcome and non-death outcome of COVID-19 patients, the area under the curve (AUC) of CRP and L was 0.751 and 0.720 respectively. CRP and L had good diagnostic accuracy for the death outcome of patients. (4) Changes in CRP were correlated with changes in CT imaging and were consistent with changes in the course of the disease. Conclusions: : (1) The data collected in this research showed that the cumulative survival rate of patients over 60 years old was lower than that of patients under 60 years old. With the increase of age, the CRP of patients showed an increasing trend, and the L of patients showed a characteristic lower than the normal reference interval.

Over the course of the last few months, a number of SARS-CoV-2 variants have been identified against which vaccine-induced immune responses may be less effective. These variants-of-concern have garnered significant attention in the media, with discussion around their impact on the future of the pandemic and the ability of leading COVID-19 vaccines to protect against them effectively. To address concerns about emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants affecting vaccine-induced immunity, we investigated the neutralisation of representative G614, 501Y.V1 and 501Y.V2 virus isolates using sera from ferrets that had received prime-boost doses of the DNA vaccine, INO-4800. Neutralisation titres against G614 and 501Y.V1 were comparable, but titres against the 501Y.V2 variant were approximately 4-fold lower, similar to results reported with other nucleic acid vaccines and supported by in silico biomolecular modelling. The results confirm that the vaccine-induced neutralising antibodies generated by INO-4800 remain effective against current variants-of-concern, albeit with lower neutralisation titres against 501Y.V2 similar to other leading nucleic acid-based vaccines.","output":"Live Virus Neutralisation of the 501Y.V1 and 501Y.V2 SARS-CoV-2 Variants following INO-4800 Vaccination of Ferrets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of the COVID-19 epidemic has led to extraordinary measures taken worldwide, and has led to serious psychological disorders. Healthcare professionals face greater severity of stress burden, due both to their direct contact with patients with the virus and to the isolation dimension of this outbreak. OBJECTIVE: To examine psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression and sleep disorders among healthcare professionals working in an emergency department and a COVID-19 clinic. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study including healthcare professionals in the emergency department and other units serving patients with COVID-19, of a training and research hospital in Turkey. METHODS: 210 volunteers, including 105 healthcare professionals in the emergency department and 105 healthcare professionals working in other departments rendering services for COVID-19 patients, were included in this study. A sociodemographic data form and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HAD), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), World Health Organization Quality of Life scale (WHOQOL-BREF-TR) and Religious Orientation Scale were applied to the volunteers. RESULTS: The perceived stress levels and PSQI subscores were found to be significantly higher among the volunteers working in the emergency department than among those in other departments. The risk of development of anxiety among women was 16.6 times higher than among men. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals on the frontline need systematic regular psychosocial support mechanisms. Anxiety due to fear of infecting family members can be prevented through precautions such as isolation.

However, we found some useful information that we would like to share with other pediatric surgeons and urologists through this journal. Based upon the available data, we believe that surgery should only be performed in pediatric patients with emergent/urgent and oncological indications until resolution of the COVID-19 outbreak. Robotics and MIS may be safely performed in such selected children by adopting specific technical precautions such as prevention of aerosol dispersion using filters/suction or adapted systems and appropriate use of electrocautery and other sealing devices for reduction of surgical smoke, as reported in our recent experience. Another key point to manage this pandemic emergency is that all hospitals should provide health care professionals with adequate individual protections and perform universal screening in all patients undergoing surgery. Considering that this pandemic is a rapidly evolving situation with new information available daily, these data resulting from the analysis of literature focused on pediatric robotics and MIS may be further revised and updated.","output":"Letter to the Editor: Robot-Assisted and Minimally Invasive Pediatric Surgery and Urology During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Short Literature Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination are evolving over time, leading to potential changes in vaccination intention among unvaccinated people, which helps in the predictions of vaccination rates. This study investigated the changes in COVID-19 vaccination intention at the population level during a post-rollout period and two potential mechanisms underlying the change via the mediation/suppression effects that involve the perceived benefits/severe side effects of vaccination. Methods: Two serial random population-based telephone surveys interviewed 358 and 145 Chinese adults (aged 18C70) who were unvaccinated and who were unscheduled for COVID-19 vaccination, respectively, in May and August 2021 in Hong Kong, China. Results: The prevalence of vaccination intention increased from 14.5% to 22.8%, while the levels of perceived benefits (protection and travel-related advantages due to vaccination) and the perceived risk of severe side effects resulting from COVID-19 vaccination both significantly declined over time. Structural equation modeling found a simultaneous partial suppression effect via perceived benefits and a partial mediation effect via perceived severe side effects between the time when the surveys were conducted and COVID-19 vaccination intention, with adjustment for background factors. Conclusion: Perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination are likely to change over time and partially account for changes in vaccination intention, sometimes in opposite directions. Ongoing health promotion may take such changes into account.

A set of six LAMP primers was designed to amplify the target RNA by incubation with Bst DNA polymerase plus reverse transcriptase and the reaction was optimised at 65 degrees C for 60 min. Three different methods for detection of the amplified product by naked eye gave identical results to gel electrophoresis, which was run for confirmation. Negative results obtained with RNA from four other fish viruses confirmed the specificity of the test. The IPNV-RT-LAMP assay demonstrated superior analytical sensitivity compared to conventional RT-PCR conducted according to published methods (1:10(12) dilution of RNA extracted from an IPNV-infected cell culture supernatant vs. 1:10(6) for the conventional RT-PCR). The feasibility of the RT-LAMP assay for detection of IPNV RNA in clinical specimen was authenticated using kidney tissue samples from experimentally IPNV-infected Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) post-smolts.

On top of the many non-pharmaceutical measures put in place for containment of the pandemic, pharmacological measures have been incorporated in the battle against the SARS-CoV-2 especially with the commencement of vaccination in the early December 2020. This study develops a deterministic compartmental model that incorporates vaccination as a measure to combat the spread of COVID-19 epidemic. We use the model particularly to assess the potential impact of vaccination in shattering the chain of transmission of the virus in South Africa. Verification of the model is carried out by performing its best fit to cumulative COVID-19 positive cases data as reported by the government of the Republic of South Africa utilizing the maximum likelihood estimation algorithm implemented in fitR package. With some vaccines already being under utility while other are being developed, we consider two major vaccine efficacy scenarios. One scenario accounts for general hypothetical vaccines with 20%,50%,65% and 85% case efficacy. The other scenario considers the Johnson and Johnsons Janssen vaccine with its distinctive efficacy levels as reported to act against the 501Y.V2 variant. The sensitivity analysis and simulations for the model reveal that the cumulative infections decline drastically with increased extent of vaccination at each level of the vaccine efficacy.The study fundamentally discovers that vaccinating approximately 20% of the population with a vaccine of at least 60% efficacy would be sufficient in elimination of the pandemic over relatively shorter time.

Perspectives of primary care providers (PCPs) and psychiatrists treating TRLLD could give insights into the challenges and potential solutions for managing this condition. METHODS To identify perspectives of providers who treat TRLLD, we conducted a qualitative descriptive study using semi-structured interviews with providers treating older adults with TRLLD in five locations across North America (i.e., Los Angeles, New York City, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, and Toronto). We conducted semi-structured interviews with 50 care providers (24 primary care providers [PCPs], 22 psychiatrists, and 4 depression care managers). Interviews elicited providers' perspectives on treatment options for TRLLD, including treatment within the primary care setting and referral to psychiatry, and sought suggestions for improvement. RESULTS We identified four themes. (1) Treating TRLLD takes an emotional toll on providers; (2) existing psychiatric services are inadequate to meet the needs of patients with TRLLD, mainly because of lack of access; (3) PCPs often attempt to treat TRLLD, even when they are not comfortable doing so; and (4) to better meet the needs of patients with TRLLD, providers recommend integrated care models involving PCPs, psychiatrists, and psychotherapists, potentially made more feasible by the growth of telehealth. CONCLUSIONS Findings from these qualitative interviews show the challenges in providing care for TRLLD. These findings can guide knowledge dissemination to psychiatrists, PCPs, policy-makers, and other stakeholders involved in the mental health system. They can also inform structural changes to clinical practice that may increase the implementation of the best treatment strategies across settings to improve long-term outcomes for TRLLD.","output":"\\"What else can we do?\\"-Provider perspectives on treatment-resistant depression in late life."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The exact residues within severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) S1 protein and its receptor, human ACE2, involved in their interaction still remain largely undetermined.

In this paper, a molecular docking model of SARS-CoV S1 protein in complex with human ACE2 was constructed. The interacting residue pairs within this complex model and their contact types were also identified. Our model, supported by significant biochemical evidence, suggested receptor-binding residues were concentrated in two segments of S1 protein. In contrast, the interfacial residues in ACE2, though close to each other in tertiary structure, were found to be widely scattered in the primary sequence.

We describe here a longitudinal study on the mental health of adults in France. METHODS: We did a secondary analysis of a web-based cohort, initially set up to study home and leisure injuries, in order to measure the consequences of the national lockdown implemented in France from 17 March 2020 to 11 May 2020, and to assess potential vulnerability and resilience factors. Eligible participants were invited to answer an online questionnaire designed to assess their living conditions and health during lockdown. Comparisons were done with answers provided 4.8 years earlier on average. RESULTS: On 15th April 2020, we sent email invitations to 9598 participants recruited between November 2014 and December 2019 and 1237 volunteers took part in the study by completing the online questionnaire. The proportion of those with anxiety symptoms markedly increased from 17.3 to 20.1%. The average self-rated level of mental health decreased from 7.77 to 7.58. Women, the elderly and the youngest appeared to be more vulnerable. A small living space (less than 30 m2) was associated with an increase in depression symptoms (PHQ-9 score), and poorer self-rated physical health at recruitment was associated with an increase in anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 score). On the contrary, the average self-rated level of physical health markedly increased from 7.44 to 7.94 between recruitment and lockdown, and the proportion of those who reported a level of 9 or 10 jumped from 25.7% at recruitment to 43.1% during lockdown.

The hypothetical pathogenetic process for covid-19 could occur in three phases: a) Viral phase, asymptomatic or weakly symptomatic, with an a-specific innate immune response; b) Immunological phase, intermediately symptomatic, with an anomalous specific immune response (delayed, slow and/or low synthesis of IgM and IgG) in antigen excess conditions, immune complex formation and complement activation with tissue damages; c) Hemo-vascular phase, severely symptomatic, where complement-mediated tissue damages would induce vascular inflammation and systemic alteration of the coagulation homeostasis. This hypothesis is well supported by the immune-histochemical and microscopic demonstration in severe patient lungs of co-localized spike viral proteins, terminal components of the activated complement system (C5b-9 membrane attack complex) and microvascular deposits of small fibrin thrombi. This picture could be aggravated by the involvement of neutrophils and macrophages, releasing additional lytic and inflammatory factors. Thus, covid-19 would arise as a simple viral infection, develop as a diffuse immune complex hypersensitivity and explode as a systemic hemo-vascular pathology. If this hypothesized process would be real, suitable therapeutic interventions might be carried out, able to interfere with or block the critical factors in the various phases.","output":"COVID-19 as an Immune Complex Hypersensitivity in Antigen Excess Conditions: Theoretical Pathogenetic Process and Suggestions for Potential Therapeutic Interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Concussion is a common yet heterogenous injury. Approximately 15-30% of cases present with persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS), continuing 4 weeks or more post-injury in children, youth, and adolescents, and 3 months or more in adults. There are known bidirectional links between PPCS and mental health outcomes. The focus of this scoping review is to explore the literature on mental health outcomes in individuals experiencing PPCS. Research objectives were to explore: (1) the mental health outcomes of individuals with PPCS and types of assessments used to identify mental health outcomes this group, and (2) how mental health outcomes compare in terms of similarities and differences among pediatric and adult populations with PPCS. Method Ovid MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL, and PsycInfo databases were searched. After title and abstract screening of 11,920 studies, 481 articles were reviewed. Twenty-five papers met inclusion criteria. Results were organized by mental health outcomes of pediatric and adult populations, separately. Results There was a significantly higher number of studies devoted to adult populations. Of the 25 studies, 19 (76%) focused on adults, while six (24%) focused on adolescents. In adult populations, studies focused on symptoms of: anxiety (n = 2), depression (n = 8), and anxiety and depression (n = 9). Two studies assessed other emotional outcomes (10.5%). Within pediatric populations, an equal number of studies explored symptoms of: anxiety (n = 2), depression (n = 2), and anxiety and depression (n = 2). No studies focused on other emotional outcomes. Studies ranged greatly in methods, design, and control group. Most studies reported higher psychiatric symptoms of anxiety and/or depression in those with PPCS compared to individuals with recovered concussion or healthy controls.

Mental health and PPCS requires greater attention in pediatric populations, and consider strategies for those experiencing PPCS and mental health impacts. Future studies should consider including a wider range of emotional outcomes in their design, not limited to anxiety and depression.

Also, SARS-CoV-2-reactive T memory cells occur in unexposed healthy individuals from endemic coronaviruses that cause the 'common cold.' The finding of the expression of adaptive SARS-CoV-2-reactive T memory cells in unexposed healthy individuals may be due to multiple cross-reactive viral protein targets following previous exposure to endemic human coronavirus infections. The opinion of the authors is that determination of protein sequence homologies across seemingly disparate viral protein libraries may provide epitope-matching data that link SARS-CoV-2-reactive T memory cell signatures to prior administration of cross-reacting vaccines to common viral pathogens. Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 initiates diverse cellular immune responses, including the associated 'cytokine storm'. Therefore, it is possible that the intact virus possesses a required degree of conformational matching, or stereoselectivity, to effectively target its receptor on multiple cell types. Therefore, conformational matching may be viewed as an evolving mechanism of viral infection and viral replication by an evolutionary modification of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor required for SARS-CoV-2 binding and host cell entry. The authors propose that convalescent memory T cell immunity in individuals with mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection may result from an evolutionarily adapted immune response to coronavirus and the 'common cold'.","output":"Convalescent Memory T Cell Immunity in Individuals with Mild or Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection May Result from an Evolutionarily Adapted Immune Response to Coronavirus and the 'Common Cold'"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, with pneumonia-like clinical manifestations, a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 emerged and quickly escalated into a pandemic.

Nevertheless, there are ample evidences of the persistence of infectious viruses on inanimate surfaces for several hours to a few days. Through a critical review of the current literature and a preliminary analysis of the link between SARS-CoV-2 transmission and air pollution in the affected regions, we offer a perspective that polluted environment could enhance the transmission rate of such deadly viruses under moderate-to-high humidity conditions. The aqueous atmospheric aerosols offer a conducive surface for adsorption/absorption of organic molecules and viruses onto them, facilitating a pathway for higher rate of transmission under favourable environmental conditions. This mechanism partially explains the role of polluted air besides the exacerbation of chronic respiratory diseases in the rapid transmission of the virus amongst the public. Hence, it is stressed that more ambitious policies towards a cleaner environment are required globally to nip in the bud what could be the seeds of a fatal outbreak such as COVID-19.","output":"Potential link between compromised air quality and transmission of the novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) in affected areas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 highlighting the zoonotic cross-over link in the present century has provoked an emergency worldwide.

Current recommendations include mitigation measures before, during, and after travel. Pre- and post-travel strategies including symptom monitoring, antigen or nucleic acid amplification testing, and quarantine can be combined in multiple ways considering different trade-offs in feasibility, adherence, effectiveness, cost, and adverse consequences. METHODS: We used a mathematical model to analyze the expected effectiveness of symptom monitoring, testing, and quarantine under different estimates of the infectious period, test-positivity relative to time of infection, and test sensitivity to reduce the risk of transmission from infected travelers during and after travel. RESULTS: If infection occurs 0-7 days prior to travel, immediate isolation following symptom onset prior to or during travel reduces risk of transmission while traveling by 30-35%. Pre-departure testing can further reduce risk, with testing closer to the time of travel being optimal even if test sensitivity is lower than an earlier test. For example, testing on the day of departure can reduce risk while traveling by 44-72%. For transmission risk after travel with infection time up to 7 days prior to arrival at the destination, isolation based on symptom monitoring reduced introduction risk at the destination by 42-56%. A 14-day quarantine after arrival, without symptom monitoring or testing, can reduce post-travel risk by 96-100% on its own. However, a shorter quarantine of 7 days combined with symptom monitoring and a test on day 5-6 after arrival is also effective (97--100%) at reducing introduction risk and is less burdensome, which may improve adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Quarantine is an effective measure to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk from travelers and can be enhanced by the addition of symptom monitoring and testing. Optimal test timing depends on the effectiveness of quarantine: with low adherence or no quarantine, optimal test timing is close to the time of arrival; with effective quarantine, testing a few days later optimizes sensitivity to detect those infected immediately before or while traveling. These measures can complement recommendations such as social distancing, using masks, and hand hygiene, to further reduce risk during and after travel.","output":"Reducing travel-related SARS-CoV-2 transmission with layered mitigation measures: symptom monitoring, quarantine, and testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the initial emergency responses deployed to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the first half of 2020, we should now start thinking about long-term strategies and concepts for pandemic and disaster governance such as resilience.

Methods: Eight cadaver knees were used and performed the biomechanical kinematics tests in orders of: Group A: the LMPR was intact; Group B: the LMPR was cut off from its tibial end; Group C: the LMPRT has been repaired. 1) An internal rotation moment (5 Nm) was given to the tibia, then the internal rotation angle of the tibia was measured; 2) An forward shifting force (134 N) was given to the tibia, then the anterior displacement of the tibia was measured; 3) An internal rotation moment (5 Nm) and a valgus moment (10 Nm) were given to the tibia, then the internal rotation angle and the anterior displacement was measured. The stability was inferred from smaller rotation angle and displacement, and all of the angles and displacements were measured at knee flexion of 0, 30, 60 and 90, respectively. Results: Comparing to Group A, the internal rotation angle in Group B was increased significantly at knee flexion of 30 (p = 0.025), 60 (p = 0.041), 90 (p = 0.002); the anterior tibia displacement in Group B was increased significantly at knee flexion of 30 (p = 0.015), 60 (p = 0.024); at knee valgus, the internal rotation angle was also increased significantly at knee flexion of 60 (p = 0.011), 90 (p = 0.037).

METHODS: We applied the summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) method to identify genes that were pleiotropically associated with the risk and various outcomes of COVID-19, including severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19 and hospitalized COVID-19. RESULTS: In blood, we identified 2 probes, ILMN_1765146 and ILMN_1791057 tagging IFNAR2, that showed pleiotropic association with hospitalized COVID-19 (? [SE]=0.42 [0.09], Pa?=a?4.75a?a?10-06 and ?

METHODS A LESS mechanical evaluation platform was set up to investigate the performance of 2 tasks (suture pass-through rings and clip-cut) with 3 different settings: uncrossed manipulation with straight instruments (group A, the control group), uncrossed manipulation with articulating instruments (group B), and cross-handed manipulation with articulating instruments (group C). The operation time and average load required for accomplishment of the standard tasks were measured. RESULTS Group A presented significantly better time scores than group B, and group C consumed the longest time to accomplish the 2 tasks (P < .05). Comparing of average load required to perform the suture pass-through rings task, it differed significantly between dominant and nondominant hand in all groups (P < .01) and was less in group A and group B than group C in dominant hand (P < .01), while it was almost the same in all groups in the nondominant hand. In terms of average load requirement to accomplish clip-cut task, it was almost equal not only between group A and B but also between dominant and nondominant hand while the increase reached statistical significance when comparing group C with other groups (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS Compared with conventional devices and maneuvering techniques, articulating instruments and cross-handed manipulation are associated with longer operation time and higher workload. Instruments with better maneuverability should be developed in the future for LESS.","output":"Mechanical evaluation of articulating instruments and cross-handed manipulation in laparoendoscopic single-site surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyse motivations and perspectives of outdoor tourists and tourism stakeholders in the Islamic Republic of Iran. We use semi-structured qualitative interviews, and interpretivist grounded theory, with basic and axial coding and fine-scaled differential narrative analysis. We distinguish three principal tourist segments, seeking: exhilaration through adventure;enjoyment of nature;and escape from cultural restrictions and associated social surveillance. The nature and adventure segments behave as ecotourists, and gain improved eudaimonic wellbeing. Nature tourists gain psychological restoration through calm and tranquil nature contemplation. Adventure tourists gain psychological recharge through challenge and achievement. The escape segment, in contrast, aims for hedonic wellbeing, is heedless of its social and ecological impacts, and does not behave as ecotourists. It adopts an ecotourism disguise, to avoid being observed as it flouts expected cultural norms. It uses unauthorised and clandestine logistics providers, creating substantial management obstacles for authorised commercial outdoor tour providers. Temporary escape from social surveillance generates mental health gains as a psychological safety valve for the tourists concerned, but their behaviour imposes unsustainable costs on local communities, natural environment, nature and adventure tourists, and outdoor tourism operators. These costs reduce the net social economic gains achieved from the mental health benefits of outdoor tourism.","output":"Outdoor tourism to escape social surveillance: health gains but sustainability costs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Relapse of infection due to SARS-CoV-2 has been rarely described and there is little guidance regarding the management of such cases in immunocompromised hosts.

This descriptive epidemiologic study spanning from January 1, 2015 - March 31, 2021 utilizes the Philadelphia Police Department's registry of shooting victims, a database which includes all individuals shot and/or killed due to interpersonal firearm violence in the city of Philadelphia. We compared victim and event characteristics prior to the pandemic with those following implementation of pandemic containment measures. In this study, containment began on March 16, 2020, when non-essential businesses were ordered to close in Philadelphia. There were 331 (SE = 13.9) individuals shot/quarter pre-containment vs. 545 (SE = 66.4) individuals shot/quarter post-containment (p = 0.031). Post-containment, the proportion of women shot increased by 39% (95% CI: 1.21, 1.59), and the proportion of children shot increased by 17% (95% CI: 1.00, 1.35). Black women and children were more likely to be shot post-containment (RR 1.11, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.20 and RR 1.08, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.14, respectively). The proportion of mass shootings (4 individuals shot within 100 m within 1 h) increased by 53% post-containment (95% CI: 1.25, 1.88). Geographic analysis revealed relative increases in all shootings and mass shootings in specific city locations post-containment. The observed changes in firearm injury epidemiology following COVID-19 containment in Philadelphia demonstrate an intensification in firearm violence, which is increasingly impacting people who are likely made more vulnerable by existing social and structural disadvantage. These findings support existing knowledge about structural causes of interpersonal firearm violence and suggest structural solutions are required to address this public health threat.","output":"The changing epidemiology of interpersonal firearm violence during the COVID-19 pandemic in Philadelphia, PA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The accuracy of commercially available tests for COVID-19 in Brazil remains unclear. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis to describe the accuracy of available tests to detect COVID-19 in Brazil. We searched at the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) online platform to describe the pooled sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and summary receiver operating characteristic curves (SROC) for detection of IgM/IgG antibodies and for tests using naso/oropharyngeal swabs in the random-effects models. We identified 16 tests registered, mostly rapid-tests. Pooled diagnostic accuracy measures [95%CI] were: (i) for IgM antibodies Se=82% [76-87]; Sp=97% [96-98]; DOR=168 [92-305] and SROC=0.98 [0.96-0.99]; (ii) for IgG antibodies Se=97% [90-99]; Sp=98% [97-99]; DOR=1994 [385-10334] and SROC=0.99 [0.98-1.00]; and (iii) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by antigen or molecular assays in naso/oropharyngeal swabs Se=97% [85-99]; Sp=99% [77-100]; DOR=2649 [30-233056] and SROC=0.99 [0.98-1.00]. These tests can be helpful for emergency testing during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. However, it is important to highlight the high rate of false negative results from tests which detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies in the initial course of the disease and the scarce evidence-based validation results published in Brazil.

Here, we performed high-dimensional flow cytometry-analysis focusing on mononuclear phagocyte (MNP) lineages in SARS-CoV-2Cinfected patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. We provide a deep and comprehensive map of the MNP landscape in COVID-19. A redistribution of monocyte subsets toward intermediate monocytes and a general decrease in circulating DCs was observed in response to infection. Severe disease coincided with the appearance of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell-like cells and a higher frequency of pre-DC2. Furthermore, phenotypic alterations in MNPs, and their late precursors, were cell-lineageCspecific and associated either with the general response against SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 severity. This included an interferon-imprint in DC1s observed in all patients and a decreased expression of the coinhibitory molecule CD200R in pre-DCs, DC2s, and DC3 subsets of severely sick patients. Finally, unsupervised analysis revealed that the MNP profile, alone, pointed to a cluster of COVID-19 nonsurvivors.

The present cross-sectional online survey of adult Poles (n = 1020) expressing a willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was conducted between February and March 2021 and aimed to assess (i) the general trust in different types of vaccines, (ii) the level of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines already in use in Poland (BNT162b2 by BioNTech/Pfizer, mRNA-1273 by Moderna and AZD1222 by Oxford/AstraZeneca) as well as eight vaccines approved outside European Union (EU) or in advanced stages of clinical trials, (iii) level of fear of vaccination against COVID-19, and (iv) main sources of information on COVID-19 vaccination. Among all major vaccine technology, the highest level of trust was observed for the mRNA platform, with a considerable number of surveyed (&gt;20%) not aware of the existence of vaccines produced using the traditional approach (inactivated and live attenuated vaccines). The age of participants was the main factor differentiating the level of trust in a particular vaccine type. Both BNT162b and mRNA-1273 received a high level of acceptance, contrary to AZD1222. From eight vaccines unauthorized in the EU at the moment of study, the CVnCoV (mRNA;CureVac) was met with the highest level of trust, followed by Ad26.COV2.S (vector;Janssen/Johnson&Johnson) and NVX-CoV2373 (protein;Novavax). Sputnik V (vector;Gamaleya Research Institute) was decidedly the least trusted vaccine. The median level of fear (measured by the 10-point Likert-type scale) in the studied group was 4.0, mostly related to the risk of serious allergic reactions, other severe adverse events and unknown long-term effects of vaccination. Female, individuals with a lower level of education and those not seeking any information on the COVID-19 vaccines revealed a higher fear of vaccination.

However, the complex combination of demographic, economic, and lifestyle factors and perceived health risks contributing to patterns of anxiety and depression has not been explored. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to harness flexible machine learning methods to identify constellations of factors related to symptoms of mental illness and to understand their changes over time during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Cross-sectional samples of Canadian adults (aged 18 years) completed web-based surveys in 6 waves from May to December 2020 (N=6021), and quota sampling strategies were used to match the English-speaking Canadian population in age, gender, and region. The surveys measured anxiety and depression symptoms, sociodemographic characteristics, substance use, and perceived COVID-19 risks and worries. First, principal component analysis was used to condense highly comorbid anxiety and depression symptoms into a single data-driven measure of emotional distress. Second, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), a machine learning algorithm that can model nonlinear and interactive relationships, was used to regress this measure on all included explanatory variables. Variable importance and effects across time were explored using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). RESULTS: Principal component analysis of responses to 9 anxiety and depression questions on an ordinal scale revealed a primary latent factor, termed emotional distress, that explained 76% of the variation in all 9 measures. Our XGBoost model explained a substantial proportion of variance in emotional distress (r(2)=0.39). The 3 most important items predicting elevated emotional distress were increased worries about finances (SHAP=0.17), worries about getting COVID-19 (SHAP=0.17), and younger age (SHAP=0.13). Hopefulness was associated with emotional distress and moderated the impacts of several other factors. Predicted emotional distress exhibited a nonlinear pattern over time, with the highest predicted symptoms in May and November and the lowest in June. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight factors that may exacerbate emotional distress during the current pandemic and possible future pandemics, including a role of hopefulness in moderating distressing effects of other factors. The pandemic disproportionately affected emotional distress among younger adults and those economically impacted.","output":"Machine LearningCBased Predictive Modeling of Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms During 8 Months of the COVID-19 Global Pandemic: Repeated Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the restrictions to reduce the spread of the virus has had a large impact on daily life. We investigated the individual differences in the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and first lockdown on optimism and meaning in life in a sample from the Netherlands Twin Register. Participants completed surveys before (N = 9964, Mean age: 48.2, SD = 14.4) and during the first months of the pandemic (i.e. AprilCMay 2020, N = 17,464, Mean age: 44.6 SD = 14.8), with a subsample completing both surveys (N = 6461, Mean age T1: 48.8, SD = 14.5). We applied genetic covariance structure models to twin data to investigate changes in the genetic architecture of the outcome traits due to the pandemic and the interaction of genes with the environmental exposure. Although 56% and 35% of the sample was negatively affected by the pandemic in their optimism and meaning in life, many participants were stable (32% and 43%) or even showed increased optimism and meaning in life (11% and 22%). Subgroups, specifically women, higher educated people, and people with poorer health, experienced larger negative effects. During the first months of the pandemic, slightly lower heritability estimates for optimism and meaning in life (respectively 20% and 25%) were obtained compared to pre-pandemic (respectively 26% and 32%), although confidence intervals overlap. The lower than unity genetic correlations across time (.75 and .63) suggest gene-environment interactions, where the expression of genes that influence optimism and meaning in life differs before and during the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is a strong exposure that leads to imbalanced effects on the well-being of individuals. Some people decrease in well-being, while others get more optimistic and consider their lives as more meaningful during the pandemic.

We sought to evaluate the experience of a small to medium size center following implementation. Methods Patients (47 pre and 54 post) undergoing lung transplantation were identified from institutional database from January 2016 to October 2019. Detailed chart review and analysis of institutional cost data was performed. Univariate analysis was performed to compare eras. Results Similar short-term mortality and primary graft dysfunction were observed between groups. Decreased local donation (68% vs 6%, p < 0.001), increased travel distance (145 vs 235 miles, p = 0.004), travel cost ($8,626 vs $14,482, p < 0.001), and total procurement cost ($60,852 vs. $69,052, p = 0.001) were observed post implementation. We also document an increase in waitlist mortality post-implementation (6.9 vs 31.6 per 100 patient years, p < 0.001). Conclusions Following implementation of the new allocation policy in a small to medium size center, several changes were in accordance with policy intention. However, concerning shifts emerged including increased waitlist mortality and resource utilization.

In England's National Health Service, the waiting list has grown from 4.4 million in February 2020 to 5.7m by August 2021. Aims: The objective of this study was to estimate the trajectory of future waiting list size and waiting times to December 2025. Methods: A scenario analysis was performed using computer simulation and publicly available data as of November 2021. Future demand assumed a phased return of various proportions (0, 25, 50 and 75%) of the estimated 7.1 million referrals 'missed' during the pandemic. Future capacity assumed 90, 100 and 110% of that provided in the 12 months immediately before the pandemic. Results: As a worst case, the waiting list would reach 13.6m (95% CI: 12.4m to 15.6m) by Autumn 2022, if 75% of missed referrals returned and only 90% of pre pandemic capacity could be achieved. Under this scenario, the proportion of patients waiting under 18 weeks would reduce from 67.6% in August 2021 to 42.2% (37.4% to 46.2%) with the number waiting over 52 weeks reaching 1.6m (0.8m to 3.1m) by Summer 2023. At this time, 29.0% (21.3% to 36.8%) of patients would be leaving the waiting list before treatment. Waiting lists would remain pressured under even the most optimistic of scenarios considered, with 18-week performance struggling to maintain 60% (against the 92% constitutional target).

Patients were classified into non-sepsis and sepsis as per the Sepsis-3 definitions and were followed up for the development of severe respiratory failure (SRF) and for outcome. Results were confirmed by multivariate analyses. HBP was significantly higher in patients classified as having sepsis and was negatively associated with the oxygenation ratio and positively associated with creatinine and lactate. Logistic regression analysis evidenced admission HBP more than 18 ng/ml and IL-6 more than 30 pg/ml as independent risk factors for the development of SRP. Their integration prognosticated SRF with respective sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive 59.1%, 96.3%, 83.9%, and 87.8%.

Beyond slowing viral transmission, strict lockdowns have severe economic consequences. This work investigated response stringency, quantified by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker's Stringency Index, and examined how restrictive interventions affected infection rates and gross domestic product (GDP) in China and OECD countries. Accounting for response timing, China imposed the most stringent restrictions, while Sweden and Japan were the least stringent. Expected GDP declines range from -8% (Japan) to -15.4% (UK). While greater restrictions generally slowed viral transmission, they failed to reach statistical significance and reduced GDP (p = 0.006). Timing was fundamental: governments who responded to the pandemic faster saw greater reductions in viral transmission (p = 0.013), but worse decreases in GDP (p = 0.044). Thus, response stringency has a greater effect on GDP than infection rates, which are instead affected by the timing of COVID-19 interventions. Attempts to mitigate economic impacts by delaying restrictions or decreasing stringency may buoy GDP in the short term but increase infection rates, the longer-term economic consequences of which are not yet fully understood. As highly restrictive interventions were successful in some but not all countries, decision-makers must consider whether their strategies are appropriate for the country on health and economic grounds.","output":"Trading Health for Wealth: The Effect of COVID-19 Response Stringency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Use of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been hypothesized to be associated with reduced risk of breast cancer; however, results of epidemiological studies have been mixed. Few studies have investigated these associations among African American women. METHODS: To assess the relation of aspirin use to risk of breast cancer in African American women, we conducted a prospective analysis within the Black Women's Health Study, an ongoing nationwide cohort study of 59,000 African American women. On baseline and follow-up questionnaires, women reported regular use of aspirin (defined as use at least 3 days per week) and years of use. During follow-up from 1995 through 2017, 1919 invasive breast cancers occurred, including 1112 ER+, 569 ER-, and 284 triple-negative (TN) tumors. We used age-stratified Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of aspirin use with risk of ER+, ER-, and TN breast cancer, adjusted for established breast cancer risk factors. RESULTS: Overall, the HR for current regular use of aspirin relative to non-use was 0.92 (95% CI 0.81, 1.04). For ER+, ER-, and TN breast cancer, corresponding HRs were 0.98 (0.84, 1.15), 0.81 (0.64, 1.04), and 0.70 (0.49, 0.99), respectively.

METHODS A systematic review of articles in Medline and Embase was performed to identify all studies of patients with MD who underwent CoI. This analysis evaluates outcomes of speech recognition, pure tone audiometry, vertigo, tinnitus, and quality of life. RESULTS Of 321 studies identified, 37 were included, involving 216 patients. Mean age at implantation was 61.4 years (range 27-85 years) with average length of follow-up at 1.7 years (range 0-9 years). Forty-four (20.4%) patients underwent labyrinthectomy. Meta-analysis demonstrated significant improvements in audiometric outcomes following CoI. There was a statistically significant improvement in Hearing in Noise Test performance, with a mean difference improvement of 44.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] [8.8, 80.6]) at 6 months and 60.1 (95% CI [35.3, 85.0]) at 12 months.

To assess these interactions, standard statistical tests of independence suggest that the prevalence ratio--defined as the ratio of co-infection prevalence to the product of single-infection prevalences--should equal unity for non-interacting pathogens. As a result, earlier epidemiological studies aimed to estimate the prevalence ratio from co-detection prevalence data, under the assumption that deviations from unity implied interaction. To examine the validity of this assumption, we designed a simulation study that built on a broadly applicable epidemiological model of co-circulation of two respiratory viruses causing seasonal epidemics. By focusing on the pair influenza-SARS-CoV-2, we first demonstrate that the prevalence ratio systematically under-estimates the strength of interaction, and can even misclassify antagonistic or synergistic interactions that persist after clearance of infection. In a global sensitivity analysis, we further identify properties of viral infection--such as a high reproduction number or a short infectious period--that blur the interaction inferred from the prevalence ratio. Altogether, our results suggest that epidemiological studies based on co-detection prevalence data provide a poor guide to assess interactions among respiratory viruses.","output":"The pitfalls of inferring virus-virus interactions from co-detection prevalence data: Application to influenza and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The potential effect of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants on vaccine efficacy is an issue of critical importance.

Methods Bioaerosol sampling was undertaken in the absence of clinical activity (baseline) and also during treatment procedures (cavity preparation using an air rotor, history and oral examination, ultrasonic scaling and tooth extraction under local anaesthesia). For each treatment, bioaerosols were measured for two patient episodes (with and without ACS operation) and between five and nine bioaerosol samples were collected. For baseline measurements, 15 bioaerosol samples were obtained. For bioaerosol sampling, environmental air was drawn on to blood agar plates using a bioaerosol sampling pump placed in a standard position 20 cm from the dental chair. Plates were incubated aerobically at 37C for 48 hours and resulting growth quantified as colony forming units (cfu/m(3)). Distinct colony types were identified using standard methods. Results were analysed statistically using SPSS 12 and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Results The ACS resulted in a significant reduction (p = 0.001) in the mean bioaerosols (cfu/m(3)) of all three clinics compared with baseline measurements. The mean level of bioaerosols recorded during the procedures, with or without the ACS activated respectively, was 23.9 cfu/m(3) and 105.1 cfu/m(3) (p = 0.02) for cavity preparation, 23.9 cfu/m(3) and 62.2 cfu/m(3) (p = 0.04) for history and oral examination; 41.9 cfu/m(3) and 70.9 cfu/m(3) (p = 0.01) for ultrasonic scaling and 9.1 cfu/m(3) and 66.1 cfu/m(3) (p = 0.01) for extraction.

The aim of the BIOSOLVE-II and -III studies was to assess the safety and performance of a magnesium based sirolimus-eluting scaffold; we report the clinical outcomes at 3 years, 2 years after scaffold resorption. METHODS/MATERIALS BIOSOLVE-II and BIOSOLVE-III are international, prospective multi-center studies, including 184 patients with 189 de novo lesions and stable or unstable angina, or documented silent ischemia. Acute myocardial infarction, 3-vessel coronary artery disease and heavily calcified lesions were excluded. Antiplatelet therapy was recommended for 6-months. RESULTS Patients were 65.5  10.8 years old, and lesions were 12.1  4.5 mm long and located in vessels with a diameter of 2.7  0.4 mm. More than half of the lesions (56.5%) were type B2/C lesions. At 2 years, 92.5% (160/173) of patients were symptom-free and 91.5% (151/165) at 3 years; all the other patients had stable angina. At 3 years, target lesion failure occurred in 11 patients (6.3%), consisting of 4 cardiac deaths (2.3%), one target-vessel myocardial infarction (0.6%), and 6 clinically-driven target lesion revascularizations (3.4%). There was no definite or probable scaffold thrombosis. CONCLUSION In a low-risk patient population, treatment with a sirolimus-eluting magnesium bioresorbable scaffold can be considered safe, in particular with no definite or probable scaffold thrombosis.

In the wake of COVID-19, in response to shortages and lack of availability of surgical masks and respirators, the use of cloth masks has become a research focus. Various fabrics have been promoted with little evidence-based foundation and without guidelines on design principles for optimal performance. In these circumstances, it is essential to understand the properties, key performance factors, filter mechanisms and evidence on cloth masks materials. The general community might also need to decontaminate and reuse disposable, single-use devices as a last resort. We present an overview of the filter materials, filter mechanisms and effectiveness, key performance factors, and hydrophobicity of the common disposable masks, as well as cloth masks. We also reviewed decontamination methods for disposable respiratory devices. As an alternative to surgical masks and respirators, we recommend a cloth mask made of at least three layers (300C350 threads per inch) and adding a nylon stocking layer over the mask for a better fit. Water-resistant fabrics (polyesters/nylon), blends of fabrics and water-absorbing fabrics (cotton) should be in the outside layer, middle layer/layers and inside layer, respectively.

One of the consequences of these actions has been a general reduction in the habitual daily physical activity among children and young people for whom schools represent the major setting for the promotion of sports, physically active play, movement skills learning, and other activity supportive of healthy, active lifestyles. Whilst acknowledging the seriousness of these changes, and their concomitant health risks, we suggest that COVID-19 offers an opportunity to think again about important features of school-based activity promotion in light of new lessons learnt during lockdown, emerging technologies, and adapted pedagogies. In these specific cases, COVID-19 could be judged a fortuitous disruptor to the extent that it has opened a window of opportunity to schools and teachers to reflect on their assumptions about the scope, content, and delivery of their curricula, and on the new professional knowledge that has emerged. Active Homework, or physical activity-related tasks assigned to students by teachers that are meant to be carried out before, after and away from school, that students can do on their own or with family members, is not a new idea, but the enforced changes to school provision have made it considerably more common since the pandemic. Perhaps Active Homework is a concept worth retaining as schools start to return to normal? We offer a typology of Active Homework, and examine opportunities to expand, extend, and enhance physical education and physical activity opportunities by breaking down the presumed boundary between school and home. In conclusion, we suggest that Active Homework is worth exploring as a potentially valuable approach to enhancing the quantity and quality of students' school-based health-related physical activity. If so, considerably more research and curriculum development is needed.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic as a fortuitous disruptor in physical education: the case of active homework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"English has now become a digital language with the rise of the digital age, especially with Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and now due to COVID-19 Individuals' interaction with the digital beings such as front camera, social media, and keyboards has allowed new words to emerge or caused some changes in the existing words Regarding these dynamic changes, Chaos/Complexity Theory brought to English language teaching (ELT) field by Diane Larsen-Freeman (1997) might provide explanations while shedding light on the construction or emergence of new words In this article, Chaos/Complexity Theory is revisited first as a transdisciplinary theory and then along with its main features in the language learning field Then, English as a Lingua Digital is proposed as a new concept to be studied by future empirical studies In this sense, this article is the first to propose English as a Lingua Digital within Chaos/Complexity Theory The ideas in this paper may be the leading topics ELT research in a very near future considering the fact that there are not enough empirical studies utilizing Chaos/Complexity Theory ? 2020 Karadeniz Technical University All rights reserved","output":"The emergence of english as a lingua digital within chaos/Complexity theory framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV, characterized by an over-exuberant immune response with lung lymphomononuclear cells infiltration and proliferation that may account for tissue damage more than the direct effect of viral replication. This study is aimed at investigating the capability of SARS-CoV to activate IFN- and - expression in lymphomonocytes (PBMC) from healthy donors, evaluating whether viral replication is necessary for this activation. RESULTS: SARS-CoV virus is able to induce both IFN- and - mRNA accumulation and protein release in a dose-dependent manner, MOI 10 being the most effective. The time course curve indicated that IFN- mRNA induction peaked at 24 h.p.i,. whereas IFN- mRNA was still increasing at 48 h.p.i. Released IFN (both types) reached a plateau after 24C48 h.p.i. and remained rather stable over a 5-day period. A transient peak of negative strand viral RNA was detected after 1C2 days of infection, but neither infectious virus progeny yield nor newly produced viral genomic RNA could be evidenced in infected cultures, even after prolonged observation time (up to 13 days). Cocultivation of PBMC with fixed SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells was even more efficient than exposure to live virus in eliciting IFN- and - induction. A combination of IFN- and - strongly inhibited SARS-CoV replication in Vero cells, while the single cytokines were much less effective. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that SARS-CoV is able to induce in normal PBMC a coordinate induction of IFN- and - gene expression. Virus replication is not necessary for IFN induction since efficient IFN expression could be obtained also by the cocultivation of normal PBMC with fixed SARS-CoV-infected cells. Concomitant activation of IFN- and - gene expression by SARS-CoV in vivo may be relevant for the pathogenesis of the disease, both for the possible involvement in immunomediated damage of the tissues and for the strong inhibition of SARS-CoV replication as a result of combined cytokine action.","output":"Coordinate induction of IFN- and - by SARS-CoV also in the absence of virus replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of a new Coronavirus has developed into a global pandemic with about 10,5 million reported cases and over 500,000 deaths worldwide. Our prospective paper reports an updated analysis of the impact that this pandemic had on the Italian agri-food sector during the national lockdown and discusses why and how this unprecedented economic crisis could be a turning point to deal with the overall sustainability of food and agricultural systems in the frame of the forthcoming European Green Deal. Its introductory part includes a wide-ranging examination of the first quarter of pandemic emergency, with a specific focus on the primary production, to be understood as agriculture (i.e. crops and livestock, and their food products), fisheries and forestry. The effect on the typical food and wine exports, and the local environment tourism segments is also taken into account in this analysis, because of their old and deep roots into the cultural and historical heritage of the country. The subsequent part of the paper is centered on strategic lines and research networks for an efficient socio-economic and territorial restart, and a faster transition to sustainability in the frame of a circular bio-economy. Particular emphasis is given to the urgent need of investments in research and development concerning agriculture, in terms of not only a fruitful penetration of the agro-tech for a next-generation agri-food era, but also a deeper attention to the natural and environmental resources, including forestry. As for the rest of Europe, Italy demands actions to expand knowledge and strengthen research applied to technology transfer for innovation activities aimed at providing solutions for a climate neutral and resilient society, in reference to primary production to ensure food security and nutrition quality.

RNIHL is preventable; therefore, the present study aimed to determine (i) the accuracy and reliability of dbTrack (Westone) sound-level monitoring earphones and (ii) the effect of sound-level monitoring earphones with smartphone feedback and hearing-health information as an intervention to promote healthy listening behaviors in young adults. DESIGN The study consisted of two phases: the first phase investigated the accuracy and reliability of dbTrack sound-level monitoring earphones. Accuracy was determined by comparing earphone measurements to sound level meter measurements. Intradevice reliability was determined by comparing earphone measurements during test-retest conditions. Nineteen participants were recruited through convenience sampling to determine within-subject reliability by comparing in-ear sound levels measured by the earphones during test-retest conditions. For the second phase of the study, a single-group pretest-posttest design was utilized. Forty participants, recruited through snowball sampling, utilized the sound-level monitoring earphones with the accompanying dbTrack smartphone application for 4 weeks. The application's smartphone feedback was disabled during the first 2 weeks (pretest condition) and enabled during the last 2 weeks (posttest condition). Average daily intensities, durations, and sound dosages measured during pre- and posttest conditions were compared. RESULTS Phase 1 dbTrack earphone measurements were within 1 dB when compared with sound level meter measurements. Earphones were also within 1 dB in repeated measures across earphones and across participants. Phase 2 posttest average daily intensity decreased by 8.7 dB (18.3 SD), duration decreased by 7.6 minutes (46.6 SD), and sound dose decreased by 4128.4% (24965.5% SD). Differences in intensity and sound dose were significantly lower with a small and medium effect size, respectively.

Knockout of unc-7b alone almost eliminated the I j, whereas AVA-specific expression of UNC-7b substantially rescued the coupling defect of unc-7 mutant. Neutralizing charged residues in UNC-7b amino terminus abolished the rectification property of UNC-7b/UNC-9 GJs.

Current treatments either are less effective or result in further acquired resistance. At the same time, several new antimicrobial discovery approaches are expensive, slow, and relatively poorly equipped for translation into the clinical world. Therefore, the use of nanomaterials is presented as a suitable solution. In particular, this review discusses selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) as one of the most promising therapeutic agents based in the nanoscale to treat infections effectively. This work summarizes the latest advances in the synthesis of SeNPs and their progress as antimicrobial agents using traditional and biogenic approaches. While physiochemical methods produce consistent nanostructures, along with shortened processing procedures and potential for functionalization of designs, green or biogenic synthesis represents a quick, inexpensive, efficient, and eco-friendly approach with more promise for tunability and versatility. In the end, the clinical translation of SeNPs faces various obstacles, including uncertain in vivo safety profiles and mechanisms of action and unclear regulatory frameworks.

Indeed, the vast literature on computational epidemiology offers solid grounds for analytical studies and the definition of novel models aimed at both predictive and prescriptive scenario descriptions.

In this work, we introduce UTLDR, a framework that can simulate the effects of several public interventions (and their combinations) on the unfolding of epidemic processes.

Although YouTube facilitates easy access to hundreds of well-produced and trustworthy videos, abhorrent, misinformative, and mistargeted content is also common. The platform is plagued by various types of problematic content: 1) disturbing videos targeting young children; 2) hateful and misogynistic content; and 3) pseudoscientific misinformation. While YouTube's recommendation algorithm plays a vital role in increasing user engagement and YouTube's monetization, its role in unwittingly promoting problematic content is not entirely understood. In this thesis, we shed some light on the degree of problematic content on YouTube and the role of the recommendation algorithm in the dissemination of such content. Following a data-driven quantitative approach, we analyze thousands of videos on YouTube, to shed light on: 1) the risks of YouTube media consumption by young children; 2) the role of the recommendation algorithm in the dissemination of misogynistic content, by focusing on the Involuntary Celibates (Incels) community; and 3) user exposure to pseudoscientific content on various parts of the platform and how this exposure changes based on the user's watch history. Our analysis reveals that young children are likely to encounter disturbing content when they randomly browse the platform. By analyzing the Incel community on YouTube, we find that Incel activity is increasing over time and that platforms may play an active role in steering users towards extreme content. Finally, when studying pseudoscientific misinformation, we find that YouTube suggests more pseudoscientific content regarding traditional pseudoscientific topics (e.g., flat earth) than for emerging ones (like COVID-19) and that these recommendations are more common on the search results page than on a user's homepage or the video recommendations section.","output":"Characterizing Abhorrent, Misinformative, and Mistargeted Content on YouTube"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The practice of otolaryngology has changed drastically since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, identification of single guide RNA (sgRNA) through screening is critical to the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and is traditionally time and labor intensive, and not suitable for rapid and high throughput screening of effective PRV sgRNAs. In this study, we developed a recombinant PRV strain expressing firefly luciferase and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a reporter virus for PRV-specific sgRNA screens and rapid evaluation of antiviral compounds. Luciferase activity was apparent as soon as 4 h after infection and was stably expressed through 10 passages. In a proof of the principle screen, we were able to identify several PRV specific sgRNAs and confirmed that they inhibited PRV replication using traditional methods. Using the reporter virus, we also identified PRV variants lacking US3, US2, and US9 gene function, and showed anti-PRV activity for chloroquine.

Although it is still not fully established if RNA viruses could generate miRNAs, there are examples of miRNA like sequences from RNA viruses with regulatory functions. In the case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are several mechanisms that would make miRNAs impact the virus, like interfering with viral replication, translation and even modulating the host expression. In this study, we performed a machine learning based miRNA prediction analysis for the SARS-CoV-2 genome to identify miRNA-like hairpins and searched for potential miRNA-based interactions between the viral miRNAs and human genes and human miRNAs and viral genes. Overall, 950 hairpin structured sequences were extracted from the virus genome and based on the prediction results, 29 of them could be precursor miRNAs. Targeting analysis showed that 30 viral mature miRNA-like sequences could target 1,367 different human genes. PANTHER gene function analysis results indicated that viral derived miRNA candidates could target various human genes involved in crucial cellular processes including transcription, metabolism, defense system and several signaling pathways such as Wnt and EGFR signalings. Protein class-based grouping of targeted human genes showed that host transcription might be one of the main targets of the virus since 96 genes involved in transcriptional processes were potential targets of predicted viral miRNAs. For instance, basal transcription machinery elements including several components of human mediator complex (MED1, MED9, MED12L, MED19), basal transcription factors such as TAF4, TAF5, TAF7L and site-specific transcription factors such as STAT1 were found to be targeted. In addition, many known human miRNAs appeared to be able to target viral genes involved in viral life cycle such as S, M, N, E proteins and ORF1ab, ORF3a, ORF8, ORF7a and ORF10. Considering the fact that miRNA-based therapies have been paid attention, based on the findings of this study, comprehending mode of actions of miRNAs and their possible roles during SARS-CoV-2 infections could create new opportunities for the development and improvement of new therapeutics.","output":"Computational analysis of microRNA-mediated interactions in SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The recent identification of a novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2, has caused a global outbreak of respiratory illnesses. The rapidly developing pandemic has posed great challenges to diagnosis of this novel infection. However, little is known about the metatranscriptomic characteristics of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We analyzed metatranscriptomics in 187 patients (62 cases with COVID-19 and 125 with non-COVID-19 pneumonia). Transcriptional aspects of three core elements C pathogens, the microbiome, and host responses C were interrogated. Based on the host transcriptional signature, we built a host gene classifier and examined its potential for diagnosing COVID-19 and indicating disease severity. RESULTS: The airway microbiome in COVID-19 patients had reduced alpha diversity, with 18 taxa of differential abundance. Potentially pathogenic microbes were also detected in 47% of the COVID-19 cases, 58% of which were respiratory viruses. Host gene analysis revealed a transcriptional signature of 36 differentially expressed genes significantly associated with immune pathways such as cytokine signaling. The host gene classifier built on such a signature exhibited potential for diagnosing COVID-19 (AUC of 0.75-0.89) and indicating disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to those with non-COVID-19 pneumonias, COVID-19 patients appeared to have a more disrupted airway microbiome with frequent potential concurrent infections, and a special trigger host immune response in certain pathways such as interferon gamma signaling.

METHODS In this study, we utilized in vivo luminescent imaging of NF-B activity and serum cytokine measures to investigate relationships between the NF-B regulatory network and the presentation of painful symptoms in a model of neuropathy. RESULTS The chronic constriction injury model led to temporal increases in NF-B activity that were strongly and non-linearly correlated with the presentation of pain sensitivities (i.e. mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia). The delivery of NEMO-binding domain peptide reduced pain sensitivities through the inhibition of NF-B activity in a manner consistent with the demonstrated non-linear relationship. Importantly, the combination of non-invasive measures of NF-B activity and NF-B-regulated serum cytokines produced a highly predictive model of both mechanical (R(2) = 0.86) and thermal (R(2) = 0.76) pain centred on the NF-B regulatory network (NF-B, IL-6, CXCL1).

METHOD: Retrospective analysis of 5069 consecutive patients who underwent procedures in theatre from 11/03/20 C 08/09/20. COVID-19 infection was defined by PCR and/or radiological confirmation. Analysis of nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 and mortality was conducted using patient notes and death certificates. The number of procedures was compared with the same study dates in 2019. RESULTS: Nosocomial transmission rate was 0.27% in elective admissions (10/3773) and 0.97% in acute admissions (20/2052). The overall mortality in 2020 was 2.7% (135/5069).

Methods: In 2020, we searched publicly available information on the Internet and the scientific literature to identify programs and collect information, including: setting, program funding, targeted population, test offered, and patient cost. Program representatives were contacted throughout 2020 and 2021 to clarify, update, and supplement the publicly available information. Results: Twelve programs were identified. Information was available on key program features, such as setting, genes tested, and target populations. Data on costs, outcomes, or long-term sustainability plans were not always available. Most programs offered testing at no or significantly reduced cost due to generous pilot funding, although the sustainability of these programs remains unknown. Gene testing lists were diverse, ranging from 11 genes (CDC tier 1 genes) to 59 genes (ACMG secondary findings list v.2) to broad exome and genome sequencing.

This policy has been questioned regarding both its efficacy and the social cost it entails, including the possible asymmetric impact it has on genders in many societies due to traditional childcare roles. To the best of our knowledge no existing contribution has attempted to gauge the effectiveness of such a policy over time, in a longitudinal cross-country perspective. OBJECTIVES: This paper aimed to fill the gap in the literature by assessing, at a European level, the effect of school closures (or the lack of such measures) on the numbers of new COVID-19 infections, in the absence of vaccines. Given this policys expected change in effectiveness over time, we also measured the effectiveness of having schools closed after a given number of days (from 7 to 100). METHODS: We pursued our objectives by means of a quantitative panel analysis, building a longitudinal dataset with observations from countries in Europe, from 1 January to 30 September, and estimating the impact of school closure via feasible-generalised least-squares fixed effect and random effect estimators, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) mixed models. RESULTS: Our results show that having schools closed is effective in reducing the number of new cases. Countries that implement closure have fewer new COVID-19 cases than those that do not. This becomes a reality around 20 days after the implementation of the policy. Its efficacy continues to be detectable up to 100 days after implementation. The result is robust to controls for other forms of social distancing. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that school closure is effective in reducing the number of people who are infected with COVID-19.

The policy of restrictive measures to stop the pandemic was the internationally accepted response1 and the generalized adherence proved effective, despite the shock and the various reactions from the unprecedented, generalized state of restriction, different scale from epidemics of other times.2-4 In other countries, the loose restrictive measures have cost thousands of deaths. The general restrictive measures, however, have serious consequences for people's mental equilibrium, economy and employment, and for this reason they can only be of limited duration.5 The gradual return to normal life rhythms began gradually from May. But the test of the holiday time and the gradual opening of the tourist season, that is, the open communication of moving populations with limited, random checks for the virus and only local restrictions of the gathering of citizens. We are experiencing now the gradual and severe increase in cases, with an uncertain spreading, with asymptomatic and younger in age likely playing a central role in the spread of the virus, while the fear of a potential large increase in serious cases remains. At the time of this writing, the only means of coping is to maintain and locally strengthen the protective measures, while we gradually realize that these measures came to stay for many more months.6,7 A major problem is that the initial small number of cases favored the underestimation of risk by part of the population, and the serious consequences on people's jobs and lives, along with the deregulation of employment and social security relations legislated in recent months, have provided substantial material to conspiracy theories. We carefully monitor the research on the epidemiological behavior of covid-19 and the clinical data, the discussion on the drugs that make the symptoms milder, the effect of the virus on the CNS and the expected vaccine or vaccines. Our role from the beginning concerned the enormous psychological burden of a global health crisis, with serious consequences on people's working and social lives and equally avoiding the deregulation of the management of our patients and of the units that provide it. At the time of confinement, the telephone contact, familiar to all generations, offered valuable information and support, the lines 10306 and 1110, as well as many local or voluntary help-lines. Telepsychiatry was used more widely - being also an initiative of the Hellenic Psychiatric Association - and seems to have entered impetuously in our work, as well as in education. Its central or complementary role and its safe use are issues that are widely discussed at the moment.8 Protection measures against the virus seriously affect the normal functioning of health and mental health services. The solution should be sought in the urgent operational upgrade, the very necessary reinforcement of the staff and its effective protection from the virus and stress from exposure to danger, which has emerged as important factors for the normal operation of the mental health units.9 The use of telepsychiatry has solved a number of operational problems, but in many cases, it remains complementary, as it cannot replace physical presence in more specific care operations. The need not only to normalize, but to improve the follow up of our patients, the need to strengthen the units that provide basic, community mental health services, is shown by the increase in cases of involuntary hospitalization in the psychiatric hospitals of Athens and Thessaloniki during the last two months. A health crisis that affects almost the entire planet and the working and social life of most is a major social and political problem that concerns all of us,10 while mental health professionals are called to offer their scientific tools for people to face a multifaceted threat and in particular to claim and ensure the continuation of the treatment of our patients and the normal operation of our units.","output":"Living with covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 12\\\\year\\\\old, 4 kg, castrated male Persian cat was referred with a 2\\\\month history of sneezing and bilateral mucopurulent nasal discharge.

HF is the leading cause of hospitalization among older adults, with the highest readmission rates when compared to other chronic conditions representing significant economic and health impact. Psychological distress including depression is prevalent in HF patients and has been shown to contribute to negative outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has had important implications for HF patients by heightening the risk of infection and HF acute exacerbations, as well as distancing patients from their support network impacting their wellbeing and quality of life. This study aimed to explore psychosocial experiences of those living with HF during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Qualitative research study that collected information with semi-structured interviews delivered by phone and a demographics and mental health history survey mailed to patients. 30 Patients were recruited from February to May 2021. All interviews were transcribed and coded using NVivo. Results Mean age was 72.6, 73% male, and 27% female. 27% reported previous or current depression diagnosis and 23% considered symptoms to be somewhat related to HF; 17% reported anxiety diagnosis that occurred either in the past or presently with 10% considering symptoms somewhat related to HF. There were 4 major categories identified. 1. Access to Medical Services, included themes about ability to connect with providers throughout the pandemic and adjustment to novel care models; challenges with hospitalizations that lacked family support and presence; and delay in emergency care. 2. Social Life and Routines, included the most common themes described by patients and the difficulties experienced within this category. Themes about the pivotal role of socialization and social support that were lost during the pandemic commonly emerged. Additionally, the resulting changes to family structures and routines, as well as themes related to the challenges of accessing public services like restrooms. 3. Fears and Health Consequences, included themes about the fear of COVID-19 infection, the potential health consequences, and the importance of prioritizing health and follow medical advice. Most participants described a sense of relief and hope once the vaccine became available. 4. Emotional Response, included themes related to mood decline and experiences of fear and frustration. Positive themes emerged related to masking which was normalized and helpful to those immunocompromised. Moreover, some described the benefits of connecting with others either using technology or spending more physical time at home because of the quarantine. Conclusions HF patients have high healthcare needs, often experience psychological distress, and the COVID-19 pandemic presented important challenges to this population. Based on patients experiences, the pandemic impacted acces to care, contributed to illness exacerbations, hospitalizations, and psychological distress, as well as interrupted social connections which are an important source of wellbeing in a population that carries several physical limitations as a result of their underlying condition.

METHODS Persons who presented to the emergency department (ED) or were hospitalized with fever and/or acute respiratory symptoms at the academic medical center in Forsyth County, North Carolina were prospectively enrolled and underwent nasal/throat swab testing for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus identified through active surveillance were compared by capture-recapture analysis to those identified through independent, passive surveillance (physician-ordered influenza testing). This approach estimated the number of total cases, including those not captured by either surveillance method. A second analysis estimated the total number of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases by multiplying weekly influenza percentages determined via active surveillance by weekly counts of influenza-associated discharge diagnoses from administrative data. Market share adjustments were used to estimate influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus ED visits or hospitalizations per 1,000 residents. RESULTS Capture-recapture analysis estimated that 753 residents (95% confidence interval [CI], 424-2,735) with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were seen in the academic medical center from September 2009 through mid-April 2010; this result yielded an estimated 4.7 (95% CI, 2.6-16.9) influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus ED visits or hospitalizations per 1,000 residents. Similarly, 708 visits were estimated using weekly influenza percentages and influenza-associated discharge diagnoses, yielding an estimated 4.4 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus ED visits or hospitalizations per 1,000 residents. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that the burden of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in ED and inpatient settings by capture-recapture analysis was 4-5 per 1,000 residents; this rate was approximately 8-fold higher than that detected by physician-ordered influenza testing.","output":"Estimating the Burden of Pandemic Infectious Disease: The Case of the Second Wave of Pandemic Influenza H1N1 in Forsyth County, North Carolina."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interactions between proteins and small molecules play important roles in the inhibition of protein function. However, a lack of proper knowledge about non-covalent interactions can act as a barrier towards gaining a complete understanding of the factors that control these associations. To find effective molecules for COVID-19 inhibition, we have quantitatively investigated 143 X-ray crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein of coronavirus with covalently or non-covalently bound small molecules (SMs). Our present study is able to explain ordinary and perceptive aspects relating to protein inhibition. The active site of the protein consists of 21 amino acid residues, but only nine are actively involved in the ligand binding process. The H41, M49, and C145 residues have highest priority with respect to interactions with small molecules through hydrogen bond, CH-&#960;, and van der Waals interactions. At the active site, this ranking of amino acids is clear, based on different spatial orientations of ligands, and consistent with the electronic properties. SMs with aromatic moieties that bind to the active site of the protein play a distinct role in the determination of the following order of interaction frequency with the amino acids: CH-&#960; > H-bonding > polar interactions. This present study revealed that the G143 and C145 residues play crucial roles in the recognition of the carbonyl functionality of SMs through hydrogen bonding. With this knowledge in mind, an effective inhibitor small-molecule for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was designed: docking studies showed that the designed molecule has strong binding affinity towards the protein. The non-covalent interactions in the protein-ligand complex are in good agreement with the results obtained from X-ray crystallography. Moreover, the present study focused on weak forces and their influence on protein inhibition, henceforth shedding much light on the essential requirements for moieties that should be present in a good inhibitor and their orientations at the ligand binding site.","output":"A crystallography-based investigation of weak interactions for drug design against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was the third zoonotic coronavirus to have an outbreak in the first two decades of the 21st century Human-to-human transmission of this virus has threatened thousands of lives around the world SARS-CoV-2 shares 79% and 50% sequence homology with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), respectively Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection, evidence has shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection also causes acute tissue damage due to a pathological immune response, particularly in severe cases T cells play an important role in virus clearance and prevention, and in this paper, we summarize dynamic changes in the T cell count, subsets, phenotype, and function in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients based on current clinical reports This review may help to better understand the pathological immune response of T cells and facilitate making better therapeutic strategies for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection","output":"T cell response in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research focused on robotic ultraviolet light (RUV light) for sanitizing the environment due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic devastating the whole world.

Whether timing of surgery has an impact on morbidity and mortality has been discussed controversially, numerous studies suggest that the delay of surgery can significantly increase the risk of morbidity and mortality; others report that achieving a stable medical condition is more important than early surgery. The goal of our systematic review is to assess the impact of timing of surgery on health outcomes in patients aged 60 years or older with acute hip fracture. In addition, we will investigate differences in beneficial or harmful effects of timing of surgery in subgroups of patients based on demographic characteristics, physical status, and the use of anticoagulant medications. METHODS We will systematically search MEDLINE via Ovid, the Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, and clinical trial registries (from 1997 to 2017). In addition, we will search reference lists of pertinent reviews, archives of annual meetings of orthopaedic societies, and contact experts. We will include randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies assessing the impact of timing of surgery after hip fracture in patients 60 years or older, published in English or German. Our outcomes of interest include health outcomes such as mortality, perioperative complications, functional capacity, and quality of life. We plan to perform meta-analyses if we have at least three sufficiently similar studies. If data are sufficient, we will conduct subgroup-analyses testing for differences between age groups, sex, patients' physical status as assessed with ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) scores, and the use of anticoagulation. DISCUSSION Since this is the first systematic review on this topic since 2010, our findings will help to inform clinical practice guidelines concerning timing of surgery in hip fractures. Furthermore, our findings could contribute to define an optimal time period for surgery for different groups of patients with acute hip fracture.

While advanced evidence is needed regarding its clinical features and mechanisms. We aimed to describe two phenotypes of AKI as well as their risk factors and the association with mortality. METHODS: Consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in tertiary hospitals in Wuhan, China from 1 January 2020 to 23 March 2020 were included. Patients with AKI were classified as AKI-early and AKI-late according to the sequence of organ dysfunction (kidney as the first dysfunctional organ or not). Demographic and clinical features were compared between two AKI groups. Their risk factors and the associations with in-hospital mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 4020 cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included and 285 (7.09%) of them were identified as AKI. Compared with patients with AKI-early, patients with AKI-late had significantly higher levels of systemic inflammatory markers. Both AKIs were associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality, with similar fully adjusted hazard ratios of 2.46 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35C4.49] for AKI-early and 3.09 (95% CI 2.17C4.40) for AKI-late. Only hypertension was independently associated with the risk of AKI-early. While age, history of chronic kidney disease and the levels of inflammatory biomarkers were associated with the risk of AKI-late.

METHODS: Neutralizing activities of Ad26.COV2.S (given at a dose level of 5 x 10(10) viral particles [vp]) against VOC were assessed by wild-type virus neutralizing (wtVNA) and pseudovirion neutralization (psVNA) assays in sera from participants in Phase 1/2a and Phase 3 clinical trials, respectively. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) were determined at Days 29 and 71 after vaccination. RESULTS: In serum samples from Phase 1/2a participants (n = 6), at Day 29 after 1 dose of Ad26.COV2.S, wtVNA titers against VOC were lower than for the original strain (GMT = 573), with GMT = 65, 14, and 15 for Alpha, Beta, and Delta, respectively, representing 8.8-, 40.9-, and 37.7-fold decreases. By Day 71 after vaccination (n = 14), fold differences between the original strain (GMT = 375) and VOC (GMT = 113, 27, and 28) were smaller (3.3-, 13.9-, and 13.4-fold) than at Day 29, suggestive of B-cell maturation (Figure 1). Day 71 titers against the Delta variant were maintained for at least 8 months following a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S (5 x 10(10) vp). In serum samples from Phase 3 participants (n = 8), psVNA titers against VOC were lower than the original strain at Day 71 after vaccination, with the lowest titers observed for the Beta variant (3.6-fold decrease vs original strain). Smaller reductions in Nab titers for VOC were observed in the psVNA assay compared to wtVNA. Figure 1.

This wider excision creates a large defect requiring pelvic floor reconstruction, and there is still controversy regarding the best method of closure. The aim of this study is to present outcomes of biological mesh pelvic floor reconstruction following ELAPER. METHODS Prospective data on consecutive patients having ELAPER for low rectal cancer at a single UK institution between October 2008 and March 2013 were collected. The perineum was reconstructed using a biological mesh and the short-term outcomes were evaluated, focusing particularly on perineal wound complications and perineal hernias. RESULTS Thirty-four patients were included [median age 62 years, range 40-72 years, 27 males (79 %)]. The median operative time was 248 min (range 120-340 min). The median length of hospital stay was 9 days (range 4-20 days). There were three perineal complications (9 %) requiring surgical intervention, but no meshes were removed. There were no perineal hernias. The median length of follow-up was 21 months (range 1-54 months). The overall mortality was 9 % from distant metastases. CONCLUSIONS Our series adds to the increasing evidence that good outcomes can be achieved for pelvic floor reconstruction with biological mesh following ELAPER without the additional use of myocutaneous flaps. The low serious complication rate, good outcomes in perineal wound healing and the absence of perineal hernias demonstrates that this is a safe and feasible procedure.","output":"Outcomes after biological mesh reconstruction of the pelvic floor following extra-levator abdominoperineal excision of rectum (APER)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is commonly used to detect viral pathogens because of its high sensitivity and specificity. However, conventional PCR methods cannot determine virus infectivity. Virus infectivity is conventionally examined with methods such as the plaque assay, even though such assays require several days. Long-range reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) has previously been suggested for the rapid assessment of RNA virus infectivity where the loss of infectivity is attributable to genomic fragmentation. METHODS: IAV was irradiated with 253.7 nm ultraviolet (UV) rays to induce genomic strand breaks that were confirmed by a full-length RT-PCR assay. The IAV was then subjected to plaque assay, conventional RT-qPCR and long-range RT-qPCR to examine the relationship between infectious titer and copy number. A simple linear regression analysis was performed to examine the correlation between the results of these assays. RESULTS: A long-range RT-qPCR assay was developed and validated for influenza A virus (IAV). Although only a few minutes of UV irradiation was required to completely inactivate IAV, genomic RNA remained detectable by the conventional RT-qPCR and the full-length RT-PCR for NS of viral genome following inactivation. A long-range RT-qPCR assay was then designed using RT-priming at the 3 termini of each genomic segment and subsequent qPCR of the 5 regions. UV-mediated IAV inactivation was successfully analyzed by the long-range RT-qPCR assay especially when targeting PA of the viral genome. This was also supported by the regression analysis that the long-range RT-qPCR is highly correlated with plaque assay (Adjusted R(2) = 0.931, P = 0.000066). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that IAV infectivity can be predicted without the infectivity assays. The rapid detection of pathogenic IAV has, therefore, been achieved with this sensing technology.","output":"Quick assessment of influenza a virus infectivity with a long-range reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Packaging is necessary for preserving and delivering products and has significant impacts on human health and the environment. Particle matter (PM) may be released from packages and transferred to the air during a typical peeling process, but little is known about this package-to-air migration route of particles. Here, we investigated the emission profiles of total and biological particles, and the horizontal and vertical dispersion abilities and community structure of viable microbes released from packaging to the air by peeling. The results revealed that a lot of inhalable particles and viable microbes were released from package to the air in different migration directions, and this migration can be regulated by several factors including package material, effective peeling area, peeling speed and angles, as well as the characteristics of the migrant itself. Dispersal of package-borne viable microbes provides direct evidence that viable microbes, including pathogens, can survive the aerosolization caused by peeling and be transferred to air over different distances while remaining alive. Based on the experimental data and visual proof in movies, we speculate that nonbiological particles are package fibers fractured and released to air by the external peeling force exerted on the package and that microbe dispersal is attributed to surface-borne microbe suspension by vibration caused by the peeling force. This investigation provides new information that aerosolized particles can deliver package-borne substances and viable microbes from packaging to the ambient environment, motivating further studies to characterize the health effects of such aerosolized particles and the geographic migration of microbes via packaging.","output":"Release of inhalable particles and viable microbes to the air during packaging peeling: Emission profiles and mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The presented paper deals with the influence of the heating rate on combustion characteristics (reactivity and reactivity evaluation, ignition index (D(i)), burnout index (D(f)), the combustion performance index (S), and the combustion stability index (R(W))) of the protective coronavirus face masks.

Mobility restriction was implemented in Jakarta and its surrounding cities and impacted more than 20 million people. Is this mobility restriction impacting people's wellbeing? The objective of this study is to see whether there is an impact on wellbeing- in terms of happiness and life satisfaction in Indonesia due to mobility restriction. A survey was conducted in April 2020. Happiness and satisfaction with life were measured by using the Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS) and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWL). The reliability and validity of measures were analyzed with SPSS, and the differences between groups were analyzed with Two-Sample T-Test. The study finds that the respondents' happiness level was only slightly happy, and the level of satisfaction was only slightly satisfied. The respondents claimed that their happiness was deteriorated during mobility restriction (41%). Thirty-four percent felt their satisfaction was deteriorated.

However, critically ill COVID-19 patients will often develop venous thromboembolism with associated increases in morbidity and mortality. The cause for this prothrombotic state is unclear but is likely related to platelet hyperactivation. In this review, we summarize the current evidence surrounding COVID-19 thrombosis and platelet hyperactivation. We highlight the fact that several studies have identified a soluble factor in COVID-19 patient plasma that is capable of altering platelet phenotype in vitro. Furthermore, this soluble factor appears to be an immune complex, which may be composed of COVID-19 Spike protein and related antibodies. We suggest that these Spike-specific immune complexes contribute to COVID-19 platelet activation and thrombosis in a manner similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence of bacterial and viral infections continue to increase, because of the acquisition of rhinovirus, coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, OC43), influenza A H1N1, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus during Hajj. Whilst MERS-CoV continues to circulate in the Middle East, no cases of MERS-CoV have yet been identified in pilgrims during Hajj. SUMMARY: Respiratory tract infections are a major cause of morbidity in pilgrims attending mass gathering events. The management of severe respiratory infections should consider investigation and empirical coverage for the most likely agents based on syndromic surveillance data from hosting country and /or other relevant exposure history during events.

METHODS: A self-reported survey was undertaken in 7 settlements. The American Dental Association questionnaire on oral health (OH) was adapted and distributed to adults attending a mobile dental clinic between July and August 2017. Data were collected on sociodemographics, length of stay in settlement, utilisation of dental service, and OHQoL. Statistical analysis included descriptive analysis and Chi-square tests of associations. RESULTS: Of 156 participants, the majority were male (73%), were aged 18 to 34 (59%), and had education up to high school (48%). Most of the participants rated OH as fair or poor (76%) and had spent more than 6 months in the settlements (45%). A majority of the participants (85%) had no access to dental care without the mobile clinic. Negative impact on OHQoL was significantly (P < .05) related to settlement location and time spent, smoking status, frequency of cleaning teeth and use of fluoridated toothpaste, perceived OH, and time since last dental visit. Those who spent less than 1 month in the settlement reported a higher negative OHQoL impact related to chewing, anxiety, smiling, daily activity, and sleeping (range, 48%-73%) compared to those who had spent more than 6 months (range, 17%-41%) (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cross-sectional study assessing the OHQoL of refugees seeking emergency dental care in settlements in Greece.

This study aimed to describe the healthcare resource utilization of patients with COVID-19 from hospital visit to 30 days after discharge for inpatients and hospital-based outpatients in the United States. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using Premier Healthcare Database COVID-19 Special Release, a large geographically diverse all-payer hospital administrative database. Adult patients (age  18 years) were identified by their first, or index, visit between April 1, 2020, and February 28, 2021, with a principal or secondary discharge diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 1 454 780 adult patients with COVID-19, 33% (n = 481 216) were inpatients and 67% (n = 973 564) were outpatients. Among inpatients, mean age was 64.4 years and comorbidities were common. Most patients (80%) originated from home, 10% from another acute care facility, and 95% were admitted through the emergency department. Of these patients, 23% (n = 108 120) were admitted to intensive care unit and 14% (n = 66 706) died during index hospitalization; 44% were discharged home, 15% to nursing or rehabilitation facility, and 12% to home health. Among outpatients, mean age was 48.8 years, 44% were male, and 60% were emergency department outpatients (n = 586 537). During index outpatient visit, 79% were sent home but 10% had another outpatient visit and 4% were hospitalized within 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with high level of healthcare resource utilization and in-hospital mortality. More than one-third of inpatients required post hospital healthcare services.

In elderly people, the number of colonic enteric neurons and smooth muscle functions is preserved; decreased cholinergic function with unopposed nitrergic relaxation may explain colonic motor dysfunction. Less physical activity or dietary fiber intake and postmenopausal hormonal therapy are risk factors for fecal incontinence in elderly people. Two thirds of patients with fecal incontinence respond to biofeedback therapy. Used in combination, loperamide and biofeedback therapy are more effective than placebo, education, and biofeedback therapy. Vaginal or anal insert devices are another option.

False beliefs, once adopted, are rarely corrected. Amidst the COVID-19 crisis, pandemic-deniers and people who oppose wearing face masks or quarantine have already been a substantial aspect of the development of the pandemic. With the vaccine for COVID-19, different anti-vaccine narratives are being created and are probably being adopted by large population groups with critical consequences. Assuming full adherence to vaccine administration, we use a diffusion model to analyse epidemic spreading and the impact of different vaccination strategies, measured with the average years of life lost, in three network topologies (a proximity, a scale-free and a small-world network). Then, using a similar diffusion model, we consider the spread of anti-vaccine views in the network, which are adopted based on a persuasiveness parameter of anti-vaccine views. Results show that even if anti-vaccine narratives have a small persuasiveness, a large part of the population will be rapidly exposed to them. Assuming that all individuals are equally likely to adopt anti-vaccine views after being exposed, more central nodes in the network, which are more exposed to these views, are more likely to adopt them. Comparing years of life lost, anti-vaccine views could have a significant cost not only on those who share them, since the core social benefits of a limited vaccination strategy (reduction of susceptible hosts, network disruptions and slowing the spread of the disease) are substantially shortened.","output":"Vaccination strategies against COVID-19 and the diffusion of anti-vaccination views"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examines Turkey's response to the Covid-19 pandemic, from the aspects of health infrastructure of the country, access to information and privacy The following is provided in this article: the timeline of the pandemic including the administrative information;a relevant analysis of the health infrastructure of the country and some advantages of the infrastructure;and the right to access to information and the nature of privacy in a pandemic","output":"Covid-19 and Turkey: the Health Infrastructure of Turkey and Nature of Privacy in a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Evidence-based alcohol policies have the potential to reduce a wide range of related harms. Yet, barriers to adoption and implementation within governments often exist. Engaging relevant stakeholders may be an effective way to identify and address potential challenges thereby increasing reach and uptake of policy evaluation research and strengthening jurisdictional responses to alcohol harms. METHODS: As part of the 2019 Canadian Alcohol Policy Evaluation project, we conducted interviews with government stakeholders across alcohol-related sectors prior to a second round of researcher-led policy assessments in Canada's 13 provinces and territories. Stakeholders were asked for feedback on the design and impact of an earlier policy assessment in 2013 and for recommendations to improve the design and dissemination strategy for the next iteration. Content analysis was used to identify ways of improving stakeholder engagement. RESULTS: We interviewed 25 stakeholders across 12 of Canada's 13 jurisdictions, including representatives from government health ministries and from alcohol regulation, distribution and finance departments. In providing feedback on our stakeholder engagement strategy, participants highlighted the importance of maintaining ongoing contact; presenting results in accessible online formats; providing advance notice of results; and offering jurisdiction-specific webinars. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study offers important insight into the engagement preferences of government stakeholders involved in the health, regulation, distribution and financial aspects of alcohol control policy.

Prevalence is rising as the age and weight of the general population increase. Despite its high prevalence, nearly half of patients do not receive recommended treatments. Multiple barriers to receipt of evidence-based care have been identified and OA Management Programs (OAMPs) have been posited as an alternative care model to facilitate treatment. This mixed-methods study was designed to examine and evaluate patients perceptions of the acceptability and effectiveness of an OAMP at a U.S. academic medical center. Methods: Eligible patients included adults with knee or hip OA who completed at least one visit in the OAMP from July 1, 2017, to January 15, 2021 (n=938). These patients were divided into three groups based on the number of completed visits: 1 visit, 2-3 visits, or 4+ visits. Seventy patients from each group were randomly selected to receive a mailing that included: 1) the Osteoarthritis Quality Indicator (OA-QI) which queried receipt of guideline-recommended care;2) an invitation to participate in an interview regarding their OAMP care experience;3) the studys informed consent document;and 4) an addressed, stamped envelope to return the completed OA-QI and consent form to investigators. Interviews of consenting patients were conducted in person or over the phone by a trained medical student who followed a semi-structured interview script. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using NVivo QSR 12, supplemented by a manual analysis to confirm themes. Results: Fifty-six patients (26.67%) completed the OA-QI and reported receiving an average of 13.24 (2.85) of the 17 quality indicators. Thirty-four participants (60.7%) reported receiving at least 80% of the included quality indicators, 11 reported receiving 60-80%, and 11 (17.2%) reported receiving less than 60%. There was no statistical difference in OA-QI scores based on the number of OAMP appointments attended. Less than 60% of respondents reported being seen by a specialist for weight management. Every patient who returned the OA-QI had met with a registered dietitian for weight management as part of OAMP care. Seventeen patients (30%) reported not being referred to a joint specialist to evaluate for surgery for their severe symptoms. A total of 17 patient interviews were conducted, at which time data saturation was reached. Seventy-seven percent affirmed having had enough time to discuss their joint disease and treatment recommendations, 64.7% reported positive changes in their knowledge or beliefs about OA, and 64.7% had made at least some progress toward achieving their goals. Thirty percent cited a lack of proactiveness, motivation, or proper time management as barriers to starting or maintaining their treatment goals. Fifteen of the 17 participants responded to a query regarding confidence in self-managing their OA: 40% reported increased confidence, 40% reported no change, and one person reported a decrease. Two interviewees reported no change in confidence, but felt affirmed that they were doing the right thing. Rapport with providers was highly endorsed (88.2%), and telemedicine visits were mentioned as a mechanism for support and encouragement. Forty-one percent of interviewees had attended a group medical visit;non-attendance was attributed to distance to the clinic and group visit unavailability when COVID-19 arose. Fifty-nine percent of the interviewees endorsed a belief that OA could be managed without surgery;however, only 47% knew anyone who had successfully done so. Conclusions: Patients reported receiving a very high number of OA quality indicators, higher than reported in the literature for general populations. Interviewees were very satisfied with OAMP providers and nearly two-thirds affirmed positive changes in knowledge or beliefs regarding OA and progress toward meeting goals. Many patients did not recognize that the OAMP offers specialized care. They reported not receiving care from a specialist f r weight management despite having met with a registered dietitian. Others reported not being referred to a joint specialist to discuss surgery for their severe symptoms, although this discussion is a routine part of the OAMPs services. These gaps in perception could potentially influence satisfaction and adherence. They suggest that improved communication regarding the OAMPs specialized, evidence-based care may need to be provided. Additionally, many patients still believed that surgical intervention is an inevitable part of having OA, which may impede buy-in to minimally invasive OA management.","output":"Patient-reported Barriers, Facilitators, and Acceptability of Care from a United States Osteoarthritis Management Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was an impetus for a multitude of transformations C from the ever-changing clinical practice frameworks, to changes in our execution of education and research.

METHODS: A committee was convened to create a VOR to replace visiting orthopaedic rotations for medical students who are interested in pursuing a career in orthopaedic surgery. The VOR was reviewed and sanctioned by our medical school, but no academic credit was granted. We conducted three 3-week VOR sessions. During each session, virtual rotators participated in regularly scheduled educational conferences and attended an invitation-only daily conference in the evenings that was designed for a medical student audience. In addition, students were paired with faculty and resident mentors in a structured mentorship program. Students' orthopaedic knowledge was assessed using prerotation and postrotation tests. RESULTS: From July to September 2020, 61 students from 37 distinct medical schools participated in the VOR. Notable improvements were observed in prerotation and postrotation orthopaedic knowledge test scores. In postrotation surveys, both students and faculty expressed high satisfaction with the curriculum but less certainty about how well they got to know each other.

O-desmethyltramadol (ODMT or M1) was used as a positive control as it undergoes a phase II glucuronidation reaction in these species. The rates of phase II mefloquine depletion by microsomes by all three species were too slow to estimate.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a Qualtrics survey that was developed by Cancer and Aging Research Group among 275 health care providers to cancer patients during. There were twenty questions in the survey. Of these 20, three open-ended questions were included that inquired about the barriers to the clinical care of cancer patients during COVID-19; the questions asked to the health care team by cancer patients or the attendants; health care teams general experience in the situations of the COVID-19. Two different reviewers performed the quality analysis for the open-ended questions after they were assigned a code. SPSS ver-23 was used for the descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Medical services organizational difficulties and addressing necessities and support were generally reported. Hindrances to the medical health teams included the included administrative difficulties, access of the patient to the support and basic resources, uncertainties for patients' psychological and physical well-being, and teleconsultation challenges.

While most existing studies have focused on extending the traditional structure-centric drug design strategies and emphasized exploring pre-existing structure features of IDPs for specific binding, several examples have also emerged to suggest that small molecules could achieve specificity in binding IDPs and affect their function through dynamic and transient interactions. These dynamic interactions can modulate the disordered conformational ensemble and often lead to modest compaction to shield functionally important interaction sites. Much work remains to be done on further elucidation of the molecular basis of the dynamic small moleculeCIDP interaction and determining how it can be exploited for targeting IDPs in practice. These efforts will rely critically on an integrated experimental and computational framework for disordered protein ensemble characterization.

Pearson's correlation was used to search for the association between time spent on quarantine and the 4DSQ subscales (distress, anxiety, depression, and somatization). Independent sample T-test and Glass's &#916; were used for differences between healthy individuals and chronic disease patients in these subscales, an analysis also carried out between healthy individuals and all patient subgroups. RESULTS: No statistically significant correlations were noted between the 4DSQ subscales and the quarantine duration, both for the patient and the healthy individuals' group. Chronic disease patients had significantly higher levels of distress (p = 0.001, &#916; = 0.28) and somatization (p = 0.000, &#916; = 0.47), but not there were no significant differences in anxiety (p = 0.098, &#916; = 0.14) and depression (p = 0.052, &#916; = 0.19). Concerning head-to-head comparisons between the healthy individuals' group and each patient group, significantly higher scores in distress were found only for patients with respiratory diseases (p = 0.028, &#916; = 0.42).

Examples include the establishment of a virus in a novel host or an adaptation to increasing immunity within the host population due to prior infection or vaccination against a circulating strain. Knowledge of the viral protein regions under positive selection is therefore crucial for surveillance. We have developed a method for detecting positively selected patches of sites on the surface of viral proteins, which we assume to be relevant for adaptive evolution. We measure positive selection based on dN/dS ratios of genetic changes inferred by considering the phylogenetic structure of the data and suggest a graph-cut algorithm to identify such regions. Our algorithm searches for dense and spatially distinct clusters of sites under positive selection on the protein surface. For the hemagglutinin protein of human influenza A viruses of the subtypes H3N2 and H1N1, our predicted sites significantly overlap with known antigenic and receptor-binding sites. From the structure and sequence data of the 2009 swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 hemagglutinin and PB2 protein, we identified regions that provide evidence of evolution under positive selection since introduction of the virus into the human population. The changes in PB2 overlap with sites reported to be associated with mammalian adaptation of the influenza A virus.

Expired alcohol concentration (breathalyser) and BIS measurements were performed hourly for 4 h. A venous blood alcohol sample was taken at the conclusion of the study period. RESULTS The main outcome measures were the correlation between blood alcohol and brain function as measured by BIS and the change in BIS from baseline (?BIS) at 4 h. The median number of standard drinks consumed was 9.1 (IQR 7.7-12.3), range 5.4-17. At 4 h, there was a moderate inverse correlation between BIS and blood alcohol (r = -0.49, P = 0.029) and between ?BIS and blood alcohol (r = -0.46, P =0.043).

Both viruses, as well as the more distantly related Epstein-Barr virus, engage cellular receptors from the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases (Ephs). However, the importance of the Eph interaction for RRV entry varies between cell types suggesting the existence of Eph-independent entry pathways. We therefore aimed to identify additional cellular receptors for RRV by affinity enrichment and mass spectrometry. We identified an additional receptor family, the Plexin domain containing proteins 1 and 2 (Plxdc1/2) that bind the RRV gH/gL glycoprotein complex. Preincubation of RRV with soluble Plxdc2 decoy receptor reduced infection by ~60%, while overexpression of Plxdc1 and 2 dramatically enhanced RRV susceptibility and cell-cell fusion of otherwise marginally permissive Raji cells. While the Plxdc2 interaction is conserved between two RRV strains, 26C95 and 17577, Plxdc1 specifically interacts with RRV 26C95 gH. The Plxdc interaction is mediated by a short motif at the N-terminus of RRV gH that is partially conserved between isolate 26C95 and isolate 17577, but absent in KSHV gH. Mutation of this motif abrogated the interaction with Plxdc1/2 and reduced RRV infection in a cell type-specific manner. Taken together, our findings characterize Plxdc1/2 as novel interaction partners and entry receptors for RRV and support the concept of the N-terminal domain of the gammaherpesviral gH/gL complex as a multifunctional receptor-binding domain.

The current study examined the acute mental health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in 5070 adult participants in Australia, using an online survey administered during the peak of the outbreak in Australia (27th March to 7th April 2020). Self-report questionnaires examined COVID-19 fears and behavioural responses to COVID-19, as well as the severity of psychological distress (depression, anxiety and stress), health anxiety, contamination fears, alcohol use, and physical activity. 78% of respondents reported that their mental health had worsened since the outbreak, one quarter (25.9%) were very or extremely worried about contracting COVID-19, and half (52.7%) were worried about family and friends contracting COVID-19. Uncertainty, loneliness and financial worries (50%) were common. Rates of elevated psychological distress were higher than expected, with 62%, 50%, and 64% of respondents reporting elevated depression, anxiety and stress levels respectively, and one in four reporting elevated health anxiety in the past week. Participants with self-reported history of a mental health diagnosis had significantly higher distress, health anxiety, and COVID-19 fears than those without a prior mental health diagnosis. Demographic (e.g., non-binary or different gender identity; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status), occupational (e.g., being a carer or stay at home parent), and psychological (e.g., perceived risk of contracting COVID-19) factors were associated with distress. Results revealed that precautionary behaviours (e.g., washing hands, using hand sanitiser, avoiding social events) were common, although in contrast to previous research, higher engagement in hygiene behaviours was associated with higher stress and anxiety levels. These results highlight the serious acute impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of respondents, and the need for proactive, accessible digital mental health services to address these mental health needs, particularly for those most vulnerable, including people with prior history of mental health problems.

This study aims to determine the impact a preexisting endocrine diagnosis has on severity of COVID-19 presentation in youth. METHODS: Cross-sectional chart review study included all patients less than 25 years old with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR at St. Louis Children's Hospital between March 2020 and February 2021. Electronic medical record data for analysis included: patient demographics, BMI percentile, inpatient hospitalization or admission to the pediatric intensive care unit, presence of a preexisting endocrine diagnosis such as: diabetes mellitus (Type 1 and Type 2), adrenal insufficiency, and hypothyroidism. Two outcome measures were analyzed in multivariate analysis: inpatient admission and PICU admission. Adjusted Odds ratios with 95% CI were calculated using binary logistic regression, along with p values after Wald Chi-Square analysis. RESULTS: 390 patients were included in the study. Mean age 123.1 (+ 82.2) months old. 50.3% of patients were hospitalized, and 12.1% of patients were admitted to intensive care. Preexisting diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypothyroidism were associated with an increased risk of hospital and ICU admission, independent of socioeconomic status.

When rationing of services, drugs, and equipment must occur, health care providers have a responsibility to make rationing decisions fairly, both procedurally and substantively. In addition, health care providers, like all professionals, are accountable for their decisions. The legal standard of care requires providers to exercise the skill and knowledge normally possessed by providers in good standing in the same field or class of practice acting in the same or similar circumstances. But making rationing decisions in crisis conditions, like those created by COVID-19, is not the same as or similar to decision making in non-crisis conditions. Thus, the standard of care, properly applied, expects less of providers practicing under the stress of COVID-19s triage conditions. Because many health care providers do not perceive this is true, and for pragmatic and normative reasons, policymakers should articulate rules limiting providers liability for rationing decisionsas well as other acts and omissionsoccurring in and attendant to crisis conditions. These rules should not, however, create absolute immunities.

PURPOSE: To describe the experiences of post-graduate students in nursing sciences (experienced in clinical nursing) during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHOD: This qualitative descriptive study took place at a Swiss University delivering masters and doctoral programmes in nursing sciences. Participants were post-graduate students enrolled in masters and doctoral programmes. All current students were invited by email to participate in three focus groups, which were recorded, and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Thirteen students participated, with a majority who had been called back into clinical practice. Four themes were identified: Challenges of caring for patients during the coronavirus pandemic, Challenges of being a student during the pandemic, Resilience amid the difficulties, and Recognition of the Clinical Nurse Specialist competencies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that amid the challenges, post-graduate nursing students demonstrated high leadership skills, resilience, and a tremendous sense of professional duty, where patients' and families' best interest remained their main concerns.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyze the relationship between social media and stock market trends during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of social theory and Baudrillard's simulacra and hyperreality theory. The authors conducted the data analysis in two phases: the emotional and Granger correlation analysis by using the KPI6 software to analyze 3,275,588 tweets for the predominant emotion on each day and observe its relationship with the stock market. Findings: The research results show a significant Granger causality relation between tweets on a particular day and the closing price of the FTSE MIB during the first phase of the COVID-19 epidemic. The results highlight a strong relationship between social media hyperreality and the real world. The study confirms the role of social media in predicting stock market volatility. Research limitations/implications: The findings have theoretical and practical implications as they reveal the relevance of social media in our society and its relationship with businesses and economies. In an emergency, social media, as an expression of users' feelings and emotions, can generate a state of hyperreality that is strong correlated with reality. Since social media allows users to publish and share messages without any filter and mediation, the hyperreality generated is affected by highly subjective elements. Originality/value: This research is different from the previous ones on the same topic because unlike previous studies, conducted under normal or simulated scenarios, this study is focused on the first phase of an unpredictable and unforeseen emergency event: the COVID-19 pandemic. This research adopts a multidisciplinary approach and integrates previous studies on the economic and financial effects generated by social media by applying well-known theories to a new and unexplored context.

In this study, we leached chemicals from plastic into artificial sea water during simulated UV-induced weathering. We tested largely additive-free pre-production polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene and polystyrene and two types of plastic obtained from electronic equipment as positive controls. Leachates were concentrated by solid-phase extraction and dosed into cell-based bioassays that cover i) cytotoxicity; ii) activation of metabolic enzymes via binding to the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR); iii) specific, receptor-mediated effects (estrogenicity, ER?); and iv) adaptive response to oxidative stress (AREc32). LC-HRMS analysis was used to identify possible chain-scission products of polymer degradation, which were then tested in AREc32 and PPAR. Explicit activation of all assays by the positive controls provided proof-of-concept of the experimental setup to demonstrate effects of chemicals liberated during weathering. All plastic leachates activated the oxidative stress response, in most cases with increased induction by UV-treated samples compared to dark controls. For PPAR, polyethylene-specific effects were partially explained by the detected dicarboxylic acids.

We conducted an online survey of pathology trainees, program directors, and faculty to assess pre- and post-COVID-19 use of, and response to, various digital pathology modalities. Responses were solicited through both social media and directed appeals. A total of 261 respondents (112 faculty, 52 program directors, and 97 trainees) reported a dramatic and significant increase in the use of digital pathology-related education tools. A significant majority of faculty and program directors agreed that this shift had adversely affected the quality (59% and 62%, respectively) and effectiveness (66%) of their teaching.

Electronic databases (Medline, Google Scholar, WHO, CDC, UK National Health Service, LitCovid, and other databases with unpublished pre-prints) were extensively searched, and all articles on MIS-C published from January 1, 2020, to October 10, 2020, were retrieved. English language studies were included. This systematic review analysed 17 studies with 992 MIS-C patients from low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and developed countries (France, the UK, Italy, Spain, Chile and the US CDC data). Fever (95%) was the most common clinical manifestation followed by gastrointestinal (78%), cardiovascular (75.5%), and respiratory system (55.3%) involvement. Laboratory or epidemiologic evidence of inflammation and SARS-CoV-2 infection was present. Though the exact pathogenesis remains elusive, virus-induced post-infective immune dysregulation appears to play a predominant role. Features resembling Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome or macrophage activation syndrome were present; 49% had shock; 32% had myocarditis; 18% had coronary vessel abnormalities and 9% had congestive cardiac failure. Sixty-three percent of the patients were admitted in paediatric intensive care unit (PICU); 63% received intravenous immunoglobulin, 58% received corticosteroids and 19% received alternate agents like tocilizumab; there were 22 (2.2%) deaths. Only 9/144 children in LMICs received tocilizumab that was significantly less than children in developed countries (p < 0.0001).

Highly potent neutralizing antibodies can intercept a virus before it attaches to its target cell and, thus, inactivate it. This ability is based on the antibodies specific recognition of epitopes, the sites of the antigen to which antibodies bind. Thus, understanding the antibody/epitope interaction provides a basis for the rational design of preventive vaccines. It is assumed that immunization with the precise epitope, corresponding to an effective neutralizing antibody, would elicit the generation of similarly potent antibodies in the vaccinee. Such a vaccine would be a B-cell epitope-based vaccine, the implementation of which requires the ability to backtrack from a desired antibody to its corresponding epitope. In this article we discuss a range of methods that enable epitope discovery based on a specific antibody. Such a reversed immunological approach is the first step in the rational design of an epitope-based vaccine. Undoubtedly, the gold standard for epitope definition is x-ray analyses of crystals of antigen: antibody complexes. This method provides atomic resolution of the epitope; however, it is not readily applicable to many antigens and antibodies, and requires a very high degree of sophistication and expertise. Most other methods rely on the ability to monitor the binding of the antibody to antigen fragments or mutated variations. In mutagenesis of the antigen, loss of binding due to point modification of an amino acid residue is often considered an indication of an epitope component. In addition, computational combinatorial methods for epitope mapping are also useful. These methods rely on the ability of the antibody of interest to affinity isolate specific short peptides from combinatorial phage display peptide libraries. The peptides are then regarded as leads for the definition of the epitope corresponding to the antibody used to screen the peptide library. For epitope mapping, computational algorithms have been developed, such as Mapitope, which has recently been found to be effective in mapping conformational discontinuous epitopes. The pros and cons of various approaches towards epitope mapping are also discussed.","output":"Epitope Mapping: The First Step in Developing Epitope-Based Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objectives To describe and evaluate a risk-stratified triage pathway for inpatient urology consultations during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. This pathway seeks to outline a urology patient care strategy that reduces the transmission risk to both healthcare providers and patients, reduces the healthcare burden, and maintains appropriate patient care. Methods Consultations to the urology service during a three-week period (March 16 to April 2, 2020) were triaged and managed via one of three pathways: Standard, Telemedicine, or High-Risk. Standard consults were in-person consults with non- COVID-19 patients, High-Risk consults were in-person consults with COVID-19 positive/suspected patients, and Telemedicine consults were telephonic consults for low-acuity urologic issues in either group of patients. Patient demographics, consultation parameters and consultation outcomes were compared to consultations from the month of March 2019. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square test and continuous variables using Mann-Whitney U test. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. Results Between March 16 and April 2, 2020, 53 inpatient consultations were performed. By following our triage pathway, a total of 19/53 consultations (35.8%) were performed via Telemedicine with no in-person exposure, 10/53 consultations (18.9%) were High-Risk, in which we strictly controlled the urology team member in-person contact, and the remainder, 24/53 consultations (45.2%), were performed as Standard in-person encounters. COVID-19 associated consultations represented 18/53 (34.0%) of all consultations during this period, and of these, 8/18 (44.4%) were managed successfully via Telemedicine alone.

All patients presented with ocular symptoms. Standard endovascular approaches, including transvenous and transarterial routes, were primarily attempted without success in all cases. Direct puncture was performed through two different approaches, namely inferolateral and superomedial. The entry point was the inferior and superior eyelid, respectively.

This study investigated the associations between ABSI and the incidence of cancer at 23 sites and all cancer combined. METHODS: Data from 442614 participants from the UK Biobank prospective study were included in this study. ABSI was used as the exposure. Incidence of cancer at 23 sites were the outcomes. Cox-proportional hazard models were performed to explore the association of ABSI, and combined ABSI and BMI with cancer risk, after adjusting for multiple testing. RESULTS: 36961 individuals developed cancer during the 8.8 years median follow-up. In multivariable analyses, participants in the highest tertile of ABSI had higher risk of lung (HR 1.58 [1.44;1.74]), liver (HR:1.45 [1.18;1.77]), oesophagus (HR: 1.32 [95% CI: 1.12;1.57]) and colorectal (HR:1.19 [1.10;1.28]), breast (HR: 1.05 [1.04;1.17]) cancers, and all cancers combined (HR:1.11 [1.08;1.14]) compared with the lowest tertile. These associations remained significant after adjustment for BMI. When ABSI was combined with BMI, participants in the highest ABSI who also had a BMI{greater than or equal to}25kg/m2 were at higher risk of uterus, oesophagus, liver, stomach, colorectal and breast cancers, as well as all cancers combined, compared with those in the lowest ABSI tertile with a normal BMI. CONCLUSION: ABSI is associated with an increased risk of five cancers as well as all cancers combined, independently of BMI. IMPACT: ABSI is a useful marker for adiposity. However, cancer risk prediction improves with the combination of BMI.","output":"Associations of A Body Shape Index (ABSI) with cancer incidence, all-cause and at 23 sites- Findings from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide an update on the consequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 infection on the health and perinatal outcomes of pregnant women and their infants. RECENT FINDINGS: The severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is greater in pregnant compared to nonpregnant women as measured by rates of admission to intensive care units, mechanical ventilation, mortality, and morbidities including myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolic and other thrombotic events, preeclampsia, preterm labor, and preterm birth. The risk of transmission from mother-to-infant is relatively low (1.5-5%) as quantitated by neonatal SARS-CoV-2 testing. Infants appear to be at higher risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 if the mother has tested positive within 1 week of delivery or is herself symptomatic at the time of maternity admission. The rate of positivity is not higher in infants who room in with the mother compared to infants who are initially separated and cared for in a SARS-CoV-2-free environment. Infants who test positive in the hospital have no or mild signs of disease, most of which may be attributable to prematurity, and rarely require readmission for clinical signs consistent with COVID-19. SUMMARY: Pregnant women should take precautions to avoid infection with SARS-CoV-2. Infants born to mothers who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 can receive normal neonatal care in-hospital with their mothers if mother and staff adhere to recommended infection control practices.","output":"Consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the perinatal period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here we report the first case study of the significant algae blooming in large reservoirs in relation to the COVID-19 lockdown in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and phycocyanin (PC) concentrations were estimated for the Guarapiranga and Billings reservoirs, which supply daily water use for over 20 million people and receives treated wastewater. We employed field-calibrated Sentinel 2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI images to map the spatial patterns of Chl-a and PC over the two periods: before the lockdown (April, August and October 2019) and after the lockdown in S?o Paulo (April 2020). We found a significant increase in algae pigments (Chl-a and PC) in both reservoirs in April 2020, compared to the same month of 2019. We show that the episodic algae blooming is strongly related to the increased inflows of the residential wastewater from the surrounding watersheds, because the household water use has increased 3.2% in April 2020, while the runoff into the reservoirs driven by the rainfall was much lower in 2020 compared to the previous year for the same month. In the case of Guarapiranga Reservoir, PC increased nearly 500% in April 2020 compared to April 2019. Given the importance of Billings and Guarapiranga reservoirs for the water supply of the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo (MRSP), the abrupt occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms related to the states lockdown should be considered a major concern for public and environmental health of the region.

A PCR test amplifying the lktC-artJ intergenic region was evaluated and shown to be specific for the two species M. haemolytica and Mannheimia glucosida. All 90 aspirations were also analyzed for bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenza-3 virus, and bovine corona virus by antigen ELISA. Surprisingly, 63% of the apparently healthy calves harbored potentially pathogenic bacteria in the lower respiratory tract, 60% of these samples contained either pure cultures or many pathogenic bacteria in mixed culture. Among diseased calves, all samples showed growth of pathogenic bacteria in the lower respiratory tract. All of these were classified as pure culture or many pathogenic bacteria in mixed culture. A higher percentage of the samples were positive for all bacterial species in the group of diseased animals compared to the clinically healthy animals, however this difference was only significant for M. dispar and M. bovirhinis. M. bovis was not detected in any of the samples. BRSV was detected in diseased calves in two herds but not in the clinically healthy animals. Among the diseased calves in these two herds a significant increase in haptoglobin and serum amyloid A levels was observed compared to the healthy calves.

We report our experience based on routine patch use in MH repair to curb recurrence. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to study the recurrence and complications associated with minimally invasive surgery and the use of patch. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all cases of MH who underwent first-time repair in 2012-2017 in our institution to determine recurrence and complication rate. A MEDLINE search related to minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and patch repair of MH was conducted for systematic review. Eligible articles published from 1997-2017 with follow-up data available were included. Primary outcomes measured were recurrence and complication. Meta-analysis to compare open versus MIS and primary versus patch repair in the MIS group were performed in comparative cohorts. Continuous data were presented as median (range), and statistical significance was P<0.05. RESULTS In our institution, 12 consecutive patients aged 17-month-old (22 days-7 years), underwent laparoscopic patch repair of MH, with one conversion to laparotomy. No recurrence or significant complication occurred over a follow-up period of 8 months (1-48 months). Thirty-six articles were included from literature review and were combined with the current series. All were retrospective case reports or series, of which 6 were comparative cohorts with both MIS and open repairs. A total of 296 patients from 37 series were ultimately used for analysis: 80 had open repair (4 patch) and 216 had MIS repair (32 patch), with a patch rate of 12%. There were 13 recurrences (4%): no difference between open and MIS repairs (4/80 vs 9/216, p=0.75); recurrence rate following primary repair was 13/260 (5%), but no recurrence occurred with 36 patch repairs. Meta-analysis showed no difference in recurrence between open and MIS repair (p=0.83), whereas patch repair was associated with 14% less recurrence compared with primary repair, although it did not reach statistical significance (p=0.12). There were 13 complications (5%): no difference between open and MIS repairs (5/80 vs 8/216, p=0.35). One small bowel obstruction occurred in a patient who had laparoscopic patch repair. CONCLUSION In MH, recurrence and complication rates are comparable between MIS and open repairs. Use of patch appeared to confer additional benefit in reducing recurrence.

Nevertheless, in high morbidity and mortality settings rotavirus remains an important cause of disease, partly attributable to the sub-optimal clinical efficacy of LORVs in those settings. Regardless of the precise immunological mechanism(s) underlying the diminished efficacy, the introduction of injectable next-generation rotavirus vaccines (iNGRV), currently in clinical development, could offer a potent remedy. In addition to the potential for greater clinical efficacy, precisely how iNGRVs are delivered (multiple doses to young infants; alongside LORVs or as a booster; co-formulated with Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis (DTP)-containing vaccines), their pricing, and their storage and cold chain characteristics could each have major implications on the resultant health outcomes, on cost-effectiveness as well as on product preferences by national stakeholders and healthcare providers. To better understand these implications, we critically assessed whether there is a compelling public health value proposition for iNGRVs based on potential (but still hypothetical) vaccine profiles. Our results suggest that the answer is highly dependent on the specific use cases and potential attributes of such novel vaccines. Notably, co-formulation of iNGRVs with similar or greater efficacy than LORVs with a DTP-containing vaccine, such as DTP-Hib-HepB, scored especially high on potential impact, cost-effectiveness, and strength of preference by national stakeholders and health care providers in lower and middle income countries.","output":"Does Anybody Want an Injectable Rotavirus Vaccine, and Why?

As a new medical pedagogical approach, team-based learning (TBL) is gradually being integrated into Chinese medical education programmes to promote clinical reasoning, knowledge application, teamwork and collaboration. The aim of this controlled study is to investigate the effects of TBL on pediatric bedside teaching in medical students. METHODS: Thirty medical students in pediatric clinical practice were randomly assigned to an intervention and a control group. Students in the intervention group exposed bedside teaching activity with TBL while students in the control group received traditional bedside teaching. Teaching for the two groups was conducted biweekly, and the same clinical cases were selected for both groups with the same instructors. After six months of clinical practice, the differences of learning outcomes between the two groups were compared through assessments by computer-based case simulations (CCS) and mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercise (mini-CEX). Student feedback following completion of bedside teaching was collected by questionnaire. RESULTS: The CCS scores in the intervention group were significantly higher than that in the control group (p < 0.05). The mini-CEX results showed that clinical judgment and counseling skills of the intervention group were higher than those in the control group (p < 0.01). Medical interviewing skills and overall clinical competence in the intervention group were better than those in the control group (p < 0.05).

With the aid of Traditional Chinese Medicine Network Pharmacology Intelligent Information Platform (TCMN) searching JOL chemical components and targets, the \\"herb-compound-target network\\" was constructed using Cytoscape-3.2.1 software to predict the main active ingredients and action targets of JOL in the treatment of COVID-19. The crystal structure of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) 3CL hydrolase (3CLpro) and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) was retrieved from the RCSB PDB database, and the active compounds were docked with the two proteins by using AutoDock Vina software. Results: The herb-compound-target network contained 75 compounds including isoglabrolide, peimisine, and sennoside B, etc., which are from the three medicinal materials of Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Rheum officinale, and Fritillaria ussuriensis, and 28 targets including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MEK1). Furthermore, nine key compounds (isoglabrolide, glabrolide, ebeiedinone, desoxo- glabrolid-acetate, peimisine, verticinone, imperialine, ussuriedinone and euchrenone A5) and 10 potential targets (mTOR, JAK3, ACE2, TNFA, AKT2, PIK3CA, MEK1, BRD2, ACE and ANPEP) of JOL were predicted for treating COVID-19 by network characteristic analysis. The molecular docking results showed that some core compounds of JOL had a certain degree of affinity for 3CLpro and ACE2. Conclusion: JOL may inhibit the occurrence and development of cytokine storm in COVID-19 by regulating the expression of Brd2, CD13, and ACE2 and interfering with the PI3K/Akt, Jak-STAT, TNF and MAPK signaling pathways, and inhibit virus replication by binding with 3CLpro, thus exerting a preventive or therapeutic effect on COVID-19.","output":"Investigate mechanism of Jinzhen Oral Liquid for prevention COVID-19 based on network pharmacology and molecular docking technology/ ҩѧͷӶԽӼĽڷҺԤ͹״(COVID-19)ûо"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new operant test for preclinical pain research, termed the Mechanical Conflict System (MCS), is presented.

Results indicate that escape latency increased as a function of probe height in both naive and CCI rats. Pregabalin (10 and 30 mg/kg) and morphine (5 mg/kg), but not RP 67580, decreased latency to escape in CCI rats suggesting an antinociceptive effect. In contrast, morphine (10 mg/kg) but not pregabalin (30 mg/kg) increased escape latency in naive rats suggesting a possible anxiolytic action of morphine in response to light-induced fear.

The active involvement of national animal health services enabled the identification, collection and hierarchization of risk factors. Quantitative data were collected in the field, and expert knowledge was integrated to adjust the available data at regional level. Experts categorized and combined the risk factors into ordinal levels of risk per epidemiological unit to ease implementation of risk-based surveillance in the field. The framework was used to perform a qualitative assessment of the risk of introduction and spread of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Tunisia as part of a series of workshops held between 2015 and 2018. The experts in attendance combined risk factors such as epidemiological status, transboundary movements, proximity to the borders and accessibility to assess the risk of FMD outbreaks in Tunisia. Out of the 2,075 Tunisian imadas, 23 were at a very high risk of FMD introduction, mainly at the borders; and 59 were at a very high risk of FMD spread. To validate the model, the results were compared to the FMD outbreaks notified by Tunisia during the 2014 FMD epizootic. Using a spatial Poisson model, a significant alignment between the very high and high-risk categories of spread and the occurrence of FMD outbreaks was shown. The relative risk of FMD occurrence was thus 3.2 higher for imadas in the very high and high spread risk categories than for imadas in the low and negligible spread risk categories.

This study aims to investigate whether MSC transplantation improves the outcome of 7 enrolled patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Beijing YouAn Hospital, China, from Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 16, 2020. The clinical outcomes, as well as changes of inflammatory and immune function levels and adverse effects of 7 enrolled patients were assessed for 14 days after MSC injection. MSCs could cure or significantly improve the functional outcomes of seven patients without observed adverse effects. The pulmonary function and symptoms of these seven patients were significantly improved in 2 days after MSC transplantation. Among them, two common and one severe patient were recovered and discharged in 10 days after treatment. After treatment, the peripheral lymphocytes were increased, the C-reactive protein decreased, and the overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells disappeared in 3-6 days. In addition, a group of CD14+CD11c+CD11bmid regulatory DC cell population dramatically increased. Meanwhile, the level of TNF-&#945; was significantly decreased, while IL-10 increased in MSC treatment group compared to the placebo control group. Furthermore, the gene expression profile showed MSCs were ACE2- and TMPRSS2- which indicated MSCs are free from COVID-19 infection. Thus, the intravenous transplantation of MSCs was safe and effective for treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in critically severe condition.","output":"Transplantation of ACE2- Mesenchymal Stem Cells Improves the Outcome of Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a real-time fully autonomous prescriptive solution for explainable cyber-fraud detection within the iGaming industry.

This systematic review evaluates how cancer survivors and healthcare providers (HCPs) perceive PROM implementation in survivorship care, and how PROM implementation impacts cancer survivors' health outcomes. METHODS We systematically searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from database inception to February 2022 to identify randomized and nonrandomized studies of PROM implementation in cancer survivors. RESULTS Based on prespecified eligibility criteria, we included 29 studies that reported on 26 unique PROMs. The studies were heterogeneous in study design, PROM instrument, patient demographics, and outcomes. Several studies found that cancer survivors and HCPs had favorable impressions of the utility of PROMs, and a few studies demonstrated that PROM implementation led to improvements in patient quality of life (QoL), with small to moderate effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS We found implementation of PROMs in cancer survivorship care improved health outcomes for select patient populations. Future research is needed to assess the real-world utility of PROM integration into clinical workflows and the impact of PROMs on measurable health outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS Cancer survivors accepted PROMs. When successfully implemented, PROMs can improve health outcomes after completion of active treatment.

We evaluated the surgical outcomes of elderly patients in a nationwide prospective cohort study. METHODS One hundred and sixty-nine participating institutions were identified by stratified random sampling, and were adjusted for hospital volume, type and location. During 1 year from 2014 to 2015, consecutive patients who underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer were prospectively enrolled. 'Elderly' was defined as  75 years of age, based on the prevalence of comorbidities and the activities of daily living of patients of this age. We compared the surgical outcomes of LG to those of open gastrectomy (OG) in non-elderly and elderly patients. The primary outcome was the incidence of severe morbidities (Grade  3). RESULTS Eight thousand nine hundred and twenty-seven patients were enrolled [non-elderly, n = 6090 (OG, n = 2602; LG, n = 3488); elderly, n = 2837 (OG, n = 1471; LG, n = 1366)]. Grade  3 complications occurred in 161 (10.9%) patients who underwent OG and 98 (7.2%) who underwent LG (p < 0.001). After adjusting for confounding factors, we confirmed that laparoscopic surgery was not an independent risk factor (odds ratio = 0.81, 0.60-1.09). OG was associated with a significantly longer median length of postoperative stay in comparison to LG (16 versus 12 days, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the incidence of other postoperative comorbidities. CONCLUSION The safety of LG in elderly patients was demonstrated. LG shortened the length of postoperative hospital stay.","output":"Surgical risk and benefits of laparoscopic surgery for elderly patients with gastric cancer: a multicenter prospective cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SR/RS domains are found in almost all eukaryotic genomes from C elegans to human These domains are thought to mediate interactions between proteins but also between proteins and RNA in complex networks associated with mRNA splicing, chromatin structure, transcription, cell cycle and cell structure A precise and tight regulation of their function is achieved through phosphorylation of a number of serine residues within the SR/RS motifs by the Serine-Arginine protein kinases (SRPKs) that lead to delicate structural alterations Given that coronavirus N proteins also contain SR/RS domains, we formulate the hypothesis that the viruses exploit the properties of these motifs to promote unpacking of viral RNA and virion assembly","output":"SR/RS Motifs as Critical Determinants of Coronavirus Life Cycle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a novel coronavirus that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Yet, few studies have examined risk factors unique to adult development. The present study examined how changes in life roles (educational, marital, and parental status) predicted disordered eating as participants transitioned from their 20s to their 50s. Participants (N = 624 women and N = 276 men) completed baseline assessments in college and at 10-, 20-, and 30-year follow-up, with 72% of women and 67% of men completing 30-year follow-up. Multilevel models examined how changes in life roles predicted changes in disordered eating. For women, obtaining a graduate degree predicted decreased eating pathology initially but over time predicted subsequent increases in Drive for Thinness. Men's eating pathology was not affected by obtaining a graduate degree. Changes in marital status demonstrated no significant association with disordered eating for either gender. Becoming a parent predicted a significant decrease in Drive for Thinness at the subsequent assessment but no further declines with age, whereas those who never had children showed significant decreases in both Drive for Thinness and Bulimia with age. For both women and men, becoming a parent may decrease the importance of shape and weight as sources of self-evaluation.

PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE A cross-sectional study was conducted on 168 healthcare workers (Mage = 29.19  6.13 years and 63.1% women) working at a state hospital in the eastern part of Turkey. They completed measures of coronavirus anxiety, fear of COVID-19, resilience, and hope during COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS The results indicated that resilience mediated the relationship between coronavirus anxiety and fear of COVID-19. Hope moderated the mediating path from coronavirus anxiety to resilience. Coronavirus anxiety had a stronger effect on resilience under the moderate and high levels of hope condition, compared to the low level of hope condition. CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that resilience is an important mechanism explaining how coronavirus anxiety is associated with fear of COVID-19 and that this relation may depend on the levels of hope.

Methods: : The study comprised 126 patients with COVID-19, 171 with influenza and 180 with dengue, who presented within 5 days of symptom onset. All cases were confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests. We used logistic regression models to identify clinical characteristics and laboratory markers in classifying COVID-19 versus influenza, and COVID-19 versus dengue. The performance of the models were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC). Results: : Shortness of breath was the strongest predictor in the models for differentiating between COVID-19 and influenza, followed by diarrhoea. Higher lymphocyte count was predictive of COVID-19 versus influenza and versus dengue. In the model for differentiating between COVID-19 and dengue, patients with cough and higher platelet count were at increased odds of COVID-19, while headache, joint pain, skin rash and vomiting/nausea were indicative of dengue. The area under the ROC was 0.92 for flu model and 0.99 for dengue model.

However, their accuracy comes at the cost of intelligibility: it is usually unclear how they make their decisions. This hinders their applicability to high stakes decision-making domains such as healthcare. We propose Neural Additive Models (NAMs) which combine some of the expressivity of DNNs with the inherent intelligibility of generalized additive models. NAMs learn a linear combination of neural networks that each attend to a single input feature. These networks are trained jointly and can learn arbitrarily complex relationships between their input feature and the output. Our experiments on regression and classification datasets show that NAMs are more accurate than widely used intelligible models such as logistic regression and shallow decision trees. They perform similarly to existing state-of-the-art generalized additive models in accuracy, but are more flexible because they are based on neural nets instead of boosted trees. To demonstrate this, we show how NAMs can be used for multitask learning on synthetic data and on the COMPAS recidivism data due to their composability, and demonstrate that the differentiability of NAMs allows them to train more complex interpretable models for COVID-19.","output":"Neural Additive Models: Interpretable Machine Learning with Neural Nets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Little is known about long-term recovery from severe COVID-19 disease.

Subject and methods: In the period March 20-30, 2020, we collected data on COVID-19-related knowledge, awareness and adoption of preventive practices, depression and anxiety (Patient Health Questionnaire-4), stress (Impact of Event Scale-6), pessimism, and tobacco and alcohol use. Differences between age groups (18-39 years, 40-59 years and &#8805; 60 years) were tested using Pearson's chi-squared tests or ANOVAs; associations between drinking and smoking and depression, anxiety, and stress were tested using adjusted logistic regression models. Results: Approximately half of the sample (N Total = 6391) were 50-69 years old and 58% were female. COVID-19 knowledge (mean = 12.0; SD = 1.2) and protective practice awareness (mean = 9.1; SD = 0.8) were high. Among respondents, 44% had a score consistent with depression and anxiety (PHQ-4 score &#8805; 6), and 52% reported high stress scores (&#8805; median of 1.33). COVID-19-related anxiety and depression were associated with increased drinking (AOR = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.49, 2.15) and smoking (AOR = 2.17; 95% CI = 1.64, 2.88). High stress scores were also associated with increased drinking (AOR = 1.80; 95% CI = 1.49, 2.17, p < 0.001) and smoking (AOR = 1.75; 95% CI = 1.31, 2.33). Conclusions: In spite of high knowledge levels, important gaps were identified. High prevalence of poor mental health outcomes and associated increases in drinking and smoking warrant ongoing risk communications tailoring to effectively disseminate information and expanding psychosocial services, particularly via telehealth, to mitigate the negative mental health impact of COVID-19.

Inflammatory response secondary to viral infection might be the driver of severe diseases. We report the safety and efficacy (in terms of overall survival and hospital discharge) of the anti-IL6 tocilizumab (TCZ) in subjects with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center analysis included all the patients consecutively admitted to our Hospital with severe or critical COVID-19 who started TCZ treatment from March 13th to April 03rd, 2020. A 1:2 matching to patients not treated with TCZ was performed according to age, sex, severity of disease, P/F, Charlson Comorbidity Index and length of time between symptoms onset and hospital admittance. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests to compare the groups were applied. Kaplan Meier probability curves and Cox regression models for survival, hospital discharge and orotracheal intubation were used. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients treated with TCZ were matched with 148 matched controls. They were mainly males (81.5%), Caucasian (82.0%) and with a median age of 59 years. The majority (69.8%) showed critical stage COVID-19 disease. TCZ use was associated with a better overall survival (HR 0.499 [95% CI 0.262C0.952], p=0.035) compared to controls but with a longer hospital stay (HR 1.658 [95% CI 1.088C2.524], p=0.019) mainly due to biochemical, respiratory and infectious adverse events. DISCUSSION: TCZ use resulted potentially effective on COVID-19 in terms of overall survival. Caution is warranted given the potential occurrence of adverse events.

Studies have suggested that excessive activation of the host immune system including macrophages is responsible for the severe pathologies mediated by IFV infection. Here, we focused on the X11 protein family member Mint3/Apba3, known to promote ATP production via glycolysis by activating hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in macrophages, and examined its roles in lung pathogenesis and anti-viral defence upon IFV infection. Mint3-deficient mice exhibited improved influenza pneumonia with reduced inflammatory cytokines/chemokine levels and neutrophil infiltration in the IFV-infected lungs without alteration in viral burden, type-I interferon production, or acquired immunity. In macrophages, Mint3 depletion attenuated NF-B signalling and the resultant cytokine/chemokine production in response to IFV infection by increasing IB and activating the cellular energy sensor AMPK, respectively. Thus, Mint3 might represent one of the likely therapeutic targets for the treatment of severe influenza pneumonia without affecting host anti-viral defence through suppressing macrophage cytokine/chemokine production.","output":"Mint3/Apba3 depletion ameliorates severe murine influenza pneumonia and macrophage cytokine production in response to the influenza virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New immunotherapies based on monoclonal antibodies have recently been developed and are giving promising results in refractory B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Indeed, CD20, CD38, CD22 and HER2/neu could constitute therapeutic targets. However, few studies have reported on the expression level of these markers. Such investigations would be useful to appreciate the potential efficacy/toxicity of immunotherapies targeting these antigens. Indeed, a cohort of 125 B-ALL patients (1-25 years old) was retrospectively enrolled, for whom the same multiparametric flow cytometry assay had been performed over the whole period, allowing for fluorescence intensities comparison. CD20, CD38 and CD22 were expressed in respectively 53,6%, 99,2% 98,4% of the cases, rather homogeneously and at intermediate levels. HER2/neu, a marker of breast cancer also expressed in a subset of ALL, was present in 16 samples (13,4%), but not detectable on hematogones. Interestingly, in this subgroup, patients had a significantly lower 5-year EFS compared to patients without expression of HER2/neu (63,0% versus 80,5%, p=0.02). In conclusion, these 4 antigens could be alternatives of interest especially since CD19 can be downmodulated after current therapies targeting this antigen.

The purposes of this study were to 1) identify the disparities in mental distress, perceived adversities, resilience, and coping during the COVID-19 pandemic among four age groups (18C34, 35C49, 50C64, and 65+); 2) assess the age-moderated time effect on mental distress, and 3) estimate the effects of perceived adversities on mental distress as moderated by age, resilience and coping. METHODS: Data were drawn from a longitudinal survey of a nationally representative sample (n = 7830) administered during the pandemic. Weighted mean of mental distress and adversities (perceived loneliness, perceived stress, and perceived risk), resilience, and coping were compared among different age groups. Hierarchical random-effects models were used to assess the moderated effects of adversities on mental distress. RESULTS: The youngest age group (18C34) reported the highest mental distress at baseline with the mean (standard error) as 2.70 (0.12), which showed an incremental improvement with age (2.27 (0.10), 1.88 (0.08), 1.29 (0.07) for 35C49, 50C64, and 65 groups respectively). The older age groups reported lower levels of loneliness and perceived stress, higher perceived risk, greater resilience, and more relaxation coping (ps < .001). Model results showed that mental distress declined over time, and the downward trend was moderated by age group. Perceived adversities, alcohol, and social coping were positively associated with mental distress, whereas resilience and relaxation were negatively associated with it. Resilience and age group moderated the slope of each adversity on mental distress. CONCLUSIONS: The youngest age group appeared to be most vulnerable during the pandemic. Mental health interventions may provide training to build resilience from everyday adversities for the vulnerable individuals and empower them to achieve personal growth that challenges age boundaries.","output":"Age disparities in mental health during the COVID19 pandemic: The roles of resilience and coping"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current exploratory endeavour sets out to scrutinize the relationships between the corporate social responsibility (CSR) approach of fashion companies, their strategic CSR communication, corporate reputation, and consumers' propensity towards buying sustainable products.

Methods This prospective, cohort study included 40 adults undergoing LD-OLT under general anaesthesia (GA). All patients received BIS-guided desflurane GA. ETDes requirements in three phases of LD-OLT (primary objective); relationship between inhalational anaesthetic requirements and severity of liver disease; and effect of changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and body temperature on ETDes concentration for all three phases were also evaluated. Results ETDes during the 'dissection' phase (2.92  0.65%) was > 'anhepatic' (2.68  0.85%, P = 0.049) and 'neohepatic' phases (2.58  0.71%, P = 0.005).

Also, participants who blamed the Jews for the coronavirus pandemic were inclined to refuse a coronavirus vaccination when it is available. We argue that religiosity might not be directly related to conspiratorial thinking but, instead, activates a sense of outgroup threats among religious individuals making them more likely to endorse Jewish conspiracy theories. Despite the assumption that Jewish conspiracy theories are somehow benign, our findings dispute this premise.","output":"The Enemy of Ummah: Belief in Jewish conspiracy theories indirectly affected vaccination decisions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been discovered as the pathogenic cause of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 are mediated by the spike glycoprotein of virus, and the host specific receptors and proteases. Recently, besides pulmonary complications as the chief symptom, investigations have also revealed that SARS-CoV-2 can trigger neurological manifestations. Herein, to investigate the expression level of receptors and related proteases is important for understanding the neuropathy in COVID-19. We determined the expression levels of receptor ACE2 and CD147, and serine protease TMPRSS2 in human and mouse brain cell lines and mouse different region of brain tissues with qRT-PCR and Western blot. The results showed that the expression pattern of all them was very different to that of lung. ACE2 is lower but CD147 is higher expressed in mostly brain cell lines and mouse brain tissues comparing with lung cell line and tissue, and TMPRSS2 has consistent expression in brain cell lines and mouse lung tissues. It is suggested that SARS-CoV-2 might have a different way of infection to cerebral nervous system.

However, little is known about herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation occurring in patients with severe ARDS under veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We tried to determine the frequency of Herpesviridae reactivation and its impact on patients prognosis during ECMO for severe ARDS. RESULTS: During a 5-year period, 123 non-immunocompromised patients with a severe ARDS requiring a veno-venous ECMO were included. Sixty-seven patients (54%) experienced HSV and/or CMV reactivation during ECMO course (20 viral co-infection, 40 HSV alone, and 7 CMV alone). HSV reactivation occurred earlier than CMV after the beginning of MV [(6C15) vs. 19 (13C29) days; p < 0.01] and after ECMO implementation [(2C8) vs. 14 (10C20) days; p < 0.01]. In univariate analysis, HSV/CMV reactivation was associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation [(22C52.5) vs. 17.5 (9C28) days; p < 0.01], a longer duration of ECMO [15 (10C22.5) vs. 9 (5C14) days; p < 0.01], and a prolonged ICU [29 (19.5C47.5) vs. 16 (9C30) days; p < 0.01] and hospital stay [44 (29C63.5) vs. 24 (11C43) days; p < 0.01] as compared to non-reactivated patients. However, in multivariate analysis, viral reactivation remained associated with prolonged MV only. When considered separately, both HSV and CMV reactivation were associated with a longer duration of MV as compared to non-reactivation patients [29 (19.5C41) and 28 (20.5C37), respectively, vs. 17.5 (9C28) days; p < 0.05]. Co-reactivation patients had a longer duration of MV [58.5 (38C72.3); p < 0.05] and ICU stay [51.5 (32.5C69) vs. 27.5 (17.75C35.5) and 29 (20C30.5), respectively] as compared to patients with HSV or CMV reactivation alone. In multivariate analysis, HSV reactivation remained independently associated with a longer duration of MV and hospital length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Herpesviridae reactivation is frequent among patients with severe ARDS under veno-venous ECMO and is associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation. The direct causative link between HSV and CMV reactivation and respiratory function worsening under ECMO remains to be confirmed.","output":"Herpes simplex virus and Cytomegalovirus reactivation among severe ARDS patients under veno-venous ECMO"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Prediction models that can accurately estimate the risk of poor prognosis could assist providers with proactively managing the at-risk population for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) This study sought to identify predictors of intensive care unit (ICU) utilization among COVID-19 patients using Optum? de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record (EHR) dataset (2007-2020) and machine learning (ML) techniques Methods: The Optum?

This paper presents differences in patterns of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 in the Arab, ultra-Orthodox and overall populations in Israel, and suggests possible reasons for the low rates of infection in the Arab population. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Israeli Ministry of Health's (MOH) open COVID-19 database, which includes information on 1270 localities and is updated daily. The database contains the number of COVID-19 diagnostic tests performed, the number of confirmed cases and deaths in Israel. RESULTS: In the first 4 months of Israel's COVID-19 outbreak, just 2060 cases were confirmed in the Arab population, comprising 8.8% of the 23,345 confirmed cases, or 2.38 times less than would be expected relative to the population size. In contrast, the ultra-Orthodox made up 30.1% of confirmed cases yet just 10.1% of the population. Confirmed case rate per 100,000 was twice as high in the general Jewish population compared to the Arab population. The Arab mortality rate was 0.57 per 100,000, compared to 3.37 in the overall population, and to 7.26 in the ultra-Orthodox community. We discuss possible reasons for this low morbidity and mortality including less use of nursing homes, and effective leadership which led to early closure of mosques and high adherence to social distancing measures, even during the month of Ramadan. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a disproportionate burden of underlying illness, the Arab population did not fulfil initial predictions during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak and maintained low numbers of infections and deaths. This contrasts with reports of increased mortality in ethnic minorities and economically disadvantaged populations in other countries, and with high rates of infection in the ultra-Orthodox sector in Israel. Effective leadership and cooperation between individuals and institutions, particularly engagement of community and religious leaders, can reduce a group's vulnerability and build resilience in an emergency situation such as the current pandemic.","output":"Coping with the COVID-19 pandemic - the role of leadership in the Arab ethnic minority in Israel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Babchi (Psorylea corylifolia) is occasionally used by patients as a herbal treatment in conditions such as psoriasis and vitiligo, due to its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and immune-modulatory properties (Shrestha et al., 2018; Chopra et al., 2013).

No specific studies have been found that evaluate the impact of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) pandemic on AA and its surgical management. An analysis was made on the influence of this new pathology on the clinical course of AA. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study was conducted on patients operated on for AA from January to April 2020. They were classified according to the time of the appendectomy, before the declaration of the state of alarm (pre-COVID-19), and after its declaration (post-COVID-19) in Spain, one the most affected countries in the world. An evaluation was made of demographic variables, duration of symptoms, type of appendicitis, surgical time, hospital stay, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: The study included 66 patients (41 pre-COVID-19; 25 post-COVID-19) with mean age of 10.7  3 and 9.3  3.1; P = .073, respectively. Fever was found in a higher number of post-COVID-19 patients (52 vs. 19.5%; P = 0.013), as well as a higher CRP (72.7  96.2 vs. 31.3  36.2 mg/dL; P = 0.042).

METHODS: We did a prospective, interventional, non-randomised, controlled study of molecular point-of-care testing in patients aged 18 years or older presenting with suspected COVID-19 to the emergency department or other acute areas of Southampton General Hospital during the first wave of the pandemic in the UK. Nose and throat swab samples taken at admission from patients in the point-of-care testing group were tested with the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel. Samples taken from patients in a contemporaneous control group were tested by laboratory PCR. The primary outcome was time to results in the full cohort. This study is registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN14966673) and is completed. FINDINGS: Between March 20 and April 29, 2020, 517 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 499 were recruited to the point-of-care testing group and tested by the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel. 555 contemporaneously identified patients were included in the control group and tested by laboratory PCR. The two groups were similar with regard to the distribution of sex, age, and ethnicity. 197 (39%) patients in the point-of-care testing group and 155 (28%) in the control group tested positive for COVID-19 (difference 115% [95% CI 58C172], p=00001).

Its causative agent, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an enveloped single stranded positive-sense ribonucleic acid virus that enters cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor or several other receptors. While COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory system, other organs including the brain can be involved. In Western clinical studies, relatively mild neurological dysfunction such as anosmia and dysgeusia is frequent (~70-84%) while severe neurologic disorders such as stroke (~1-6%) and meningoencephalitis are less common. It is unclear how much SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to the incidence of stroke given co-morbidities in the affected patient population. Rarely, clinically-defined cases of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barr syndrome and acute necrotizing encephalopathy have been reported in COVID-19 patients. Common neuropathological findings in the 184 patients reviewed include microglial activation (42.9%) with microglial nodules in a subset (33.3%), lymphoid inflammation (37.5%), acute hypoxic-ischemic changes (29.9%), astrogliosis (27.7%), acute/subacute brain infarcts (21.2%), spontaneous hemorrhage (15.8%), and microthrombi (15.2%). In our institutional cases, we also note occasional anterior pituitary infarcts. COVID-19 coagulopathy, sepsis, and acute respiratory distress likely contribute to a number of these findings. When present, central nervous system lymphoid inflammation is often minimal to mild, is detected best by immunohistochemistry and, in one study, indistinguishable from control sepsis cases. Some cases evince microglial nodules or neuronophagy, strongly supporting viral meningoencephalitis, with a proclivity for involvement of the medulla oblongata. The virus is detectable by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, or electron microscopy in human cerebrum, cerebellum, cranial nerves, olfactory bulb, as well as in the olfactory epithelium; neurons and endothelium can also be infected. Review of the extant cases has limitations including selection bias and limited clinical information in some cases.

However, nearly all high-resolution results are based on data acquired on state-of-the-art microscopes where their availability is restricted to a number of centers across the globe with the studies on infectious viruses being further regulated or forbidden. One potential remedy is to employ multipurpose microscopes. Here, we investigated the capability of 200 kV multipurpose microscopes equipped with a direct electron camera in determining the structures of infectious particles. We used 30 nm particles of the grouper nerve necrosis virus as a test sample and obtained the cryo-EM structure with a resolution as high as a2.7 ? from a setting that used electron counting. For comparison, we tested a high-end cryo-EM (Talos Arctica) using a similar virus (Macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus) to obtain virtually the same resolution. Those results revealed that the resolution is ultimately limited by the depth of field.

Corticosteroids can reduce this storm through their anti-inflammatory action, thus preventing lung damage. However the efficacy and side effect profile of the two commonly used corticosteroids- dexamethasone and methylprednisolone against COVID-19 have to be compared, to enable the selection of the appropriate drug with better outcomes. Thus the objective was to compare the efficacy of adjuvant parenteral methylprednisolone and dexamethasone in reducing COVID-19 disease severity and mortality among the moderate to critical patients. MATERIAL: A retrospective comparative study was done among 162 adult patients who were COVID-19 RTPCR positive with moderate or severe illness, among whom 100 patients had received parenteral dexamethasone and 62 patients had received parenteral methylprednisolone. The radiological changes, inflammatory markers and outcomes -duration of hospital stay, rate of discharges, deaths improvement in oxygen requirement, blood glucose post steroids were compared between the two groups. The same parameters were compared for duration of either steroid of less than five days and more than five days respectively. OBSERVATION: Both corticosteroids had a significant improvement in the inflammatory markers of serum LDH, D-Dimer and CRP (p<0.001) with a significant improvement in D-Dimer levels in the methylprednisolone group compared to the dexamethasone group (p =0.04). Methylprednisolone was found to have significant improvement in the oxygen requirement (p=0.01), disease severity (p= 0.015) and radiological changes (p=0.002) compared to dexamethasone. Both corticosteroids were associated with an increase in blood glucose levels post treatment, but no significant difference in the glucose levels between the two groups (p=0.469). No significant difference was seen in the outcomes on comparing the duration of steroids of either group for less than five days with a duration of more than five days. CONCLUSION: Parenteral Methylprednisolone is associated with a better improvement in the severity of moderate and severe COVID-19 compared to dexamethasone. Both steroids cause a similar increase in blood glucose levels, indicating that either steroid holds the risk of hyperglycemia and its potential complications. A longer duration of steroids is not associated with a significant difference in outcome compared to shorter duration of steroids, it also has a hyperglycemia risk similar to the latter.","output":"A Comparison of the Efficacy of Adjuvant Parenteral Methylprednisolone and Dexamethasone in Reducing Covid-19 Disease Severity and Mortality among the Moderate to Critical Patients -A Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Complexity and dynamicity of the social networks are categorized as NP-hard problems to solve and analyze These variables on social networks such as actions and interrelationships between the network's users, different behaviors, users' feedbacks and the networks' dynamics make them intractable Systems thinking and modeling methods orient the relationships between all parts in online social networks Complexity theories, system dynamics, and game theoretic approaches implemented by system thinkers help investigate the system's local parties' relationships These methods also present a useful tool to interpret the social networks' complex interactions, dynamic activities in online networks and communities between users and their online dynamic interactions In this paper, systems thinking concepts and organizational cybernetics are employed to analyze the armed protest demonstration against COVID-19 lockdown at Michigan capitol on May 12th through May 15th on Twitter Utilizing these methods, we also present a systematic analysis to control, analyze, and comprehend the actions, tweets, and retweets exchanged between users' supporting and opposing the campaign in a complex and dynamic environment ? 2020 IEEE","output":"How to Control Coronavirus Conspiracy Theories in Twitter?

In 2020, a survey evaluating factors related to career satisfaction and burnout was emailed to 1,374 American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) residents. Bivariate and multivariate (logistic) analyses were performed to characterize predictors of burnout and career satisfaction. 167 survey responses were received, with a response rate (12.2%) comparable to that of similar studies. Exclusion of incomplete responses yielded 111 complete responses. Most respondents were male (65.8%) and White (75.7%). Residents reported fewer work hours (67.6%) and concern that COVID-19 would impair their achievement of surgical milestones (65.8%). Burnout was identified in 29 (26.1%) respondents and career satisfaction in 82 (73.9%) respondents.

Approximately 10% of all births are preterm with nearly one million children dying each year due to PTB. It remains the most common cause of death among children under five years of age. The numbers for stillbirth are no less shocking with 2.6 million babies stillborn each year. With minimal impact on the rate of these adverse birth outcomes over the past decade there is an urgent need to identify more effective interventions to tackle these problems. In this retrospective cohort study, we used whole-of-population data, to determine if maternal immunization during pregnancy against influenza and/or pertussis, is associated with a lower risk of PTB, delivering a small-for-gestational age (SGA) infant, developing preeclampsia or stillbirth. Women with a singleton pregnancy at 28 or more weeks gestation delivering in Victoria, Australia from July 2015 to December 2018 were included in the analysis. Log-binomial regression was used to measure the relationship between vaccination during pregnancy against influenza and against pertussis, with preterm birth, SGA, preeclampsia and stillbirth. Variables included in the adjusted model were maternal age, body mass index, first or subsequent birth, maternal Indigenous status, socio-economic quintile, smoking, public or private maternity care and metropolitan or rural location of the hospital. Women who received influenza vaccine were 75% less likely to have a stillbirth (aRR 025; 95% CI 0.20, 0.31), and 31% less likely to birth <37 weeks (aRR 0.69; 95% CI 0.66, 0.72). Women who received pertussis vaccine were 77% less likely to have a stillbirth (aOR 0.23; 95% CI 0.18, 0.28) and 32% less likely to birth <37 weeks gestation (aRR 0.68; 95% CI 0.66, 0.71). Vaccination also reduced the odds of small for gestational age by 13% and reduced the odds of pre-eclampsia when restricted to primiparous women. This association was seen over four different influenza seasons and independent of the time of year suggesting that any protective effect on obstetric outcomes afforded by maternal vaccination may not be due to a pathogen-specific response but rather due to pathogen-agnostic immune-modulatory effects.","output":"Associations Between Maternal Immunisation and Reduced Rates of Preterm Birth and Stillbirth: A Population Based Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This survey analysis of randomized clinical trials registered within 100 days of the first reported case of coronavirus disease 2019 assessed recruitment and results reporting.","output":"Recruitment and Results Reporting of COVID-19 Randomized Clinical Trials Registered in the First 100 Days of the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3) inflammasome has recently become an intriguing target of several chronic and viral diseases.

In this study, we analyzed prognostic implications of presence or absence of GGO, size of the solid component, and predominant histology to identify the true prognostic determinant for early-stage NSCLC. Methods We retrospectively examined 384 patients with clinical stage I NSCLC (solid: 242, part solid: 142) who underwent complete resection between 2009 and 2013. Results Survival curves of the whole cohort revealed good separation using the current TNM classification. Nevertheless, the part-solid group had a favorable prognosis irrespective of solid component size. Conversely, patients in the solid tumor group with tumors between 3 and 4 cm had a worse prognosis than patients whose tumors were less than or equal to 3 cm. Thus, we propose the following novel T descriptor classification: IA, part-solid tumors; IB, solid tumors less than or equal to 3 cm; and IC, solid tumors between 3 and 4 cm. This novel classification system stratified patient prognosis better than the current classification. On pathologic evaluation, the part-solid group always had better prognoses than the solid group in each subgroup divided by pathologic grade. Conclusions These results suggest that presence of GGO is the true prognostic determinant of stage I NSCLC, irrespective of the size of the solid component.

A subset of children, however, present with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) that can lead to vascular complications and shock, but rarely death. The immune features of MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 or adult disease remain poorly understood. We analyzed peripheral blood immune responses in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected pediatric patients (pediatric COVID-19) and patients with MIS-C. MIS-C patients had patterns of T cell-biased lymphopenia and T cell activation similar to severely ill adults, and all patients with MIS-C had SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies at admission. A distinct feature of MIS-C patients was robust activation of vascular patrolling CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells that correlated with the use of vasoactive medication. Finally, whereas pediatric COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had sustained immune activation, MIS-C patients displayed clinical improvement over time, concomitant with decreasing immune activation. Thus, non-MIS-C versus MIS-C SARS-CoV-2 associated illnesses are characterized by divergent immune signatures that are temporally distinct from one another and implicate CD8+ T cells in the clinical presentation and trajectory of MIS-C.","output":"Deep immune profiling of MIS-C demonstrates marked but transient immune activation compared to adult and pediatric COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT Acute respiratory distress syndrome is characterised by activation of the inflammatory cascade. The only treatment that reduces the mortality rate associated with this syndrome is lung protective ventilation, which requires sedation of patients. Sedation in critical care units is usually induced intravenously, although there is reason to believe that inhaled anaesthetics are a suitable alternative. Sevoflurane has recently been shown to modulate the lung inflammatory response in a model of lung injury more favourably than propofol. OBJECTIVE The goal of this study was to confirm whether or not sevoflurane is more effective than propofol in ameliorating the inflammatory response in an animal model of acute respiratory distress syndrome. DESIGN A prospective, randomised, controlled study. SETTING Research foundation laboratory at the Hospital Clnico Universitario, Valencia, Spain. EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS Sixteen Landrace/large white crossbred pigs weighing 30 to 45 kg. INTERVENTIONS Animals were allocated randomly to one of two groups: one sedated with intravenous propofol 5 to 7 mg kg h (group P) and the other with sevoflurane, administered using an AnaConDa device to obtain an end-tidal concentration of 1.5% (group S). Monitoring, lung protective ventilation and anaesthetic management were identical in both groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The PaO2/FiO2 ratio and cytokine concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens were determined at 10, 150 and 240 min after confirmation of acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO2/FiO2 <26.7 kPa). RESULTS At 240 min, median and interquartile range (IQR) concentrations of cytokines in bronchial lavage specimens in group S were lower than those in group P [interleukin-1 (IL-1) 53, IQR 16-140 vs. 311, IQR 183-637 pg ml, P = 0.04; tumour necrosis factor- 347, IQR 161-433 vs. 552, IQR 475-649 pg ml, P = 0.04; and IL-6 101, IQR 76-282 vs. 580, IQR 369-701 pg ml, P = 0.03].

The OMT test requires participants to write freely descriptions associated with a set of provided images and questions. In this work, we explore different recent machine learning techniques and various text representation techniques for facing the problem of the OMT classification task. We focused on advanced language representations (e.g, BERT, XLM, and DistilBERT) and deep Supervised Autoencoders for solving the OMT task. We performed an exhaustive analysis and compared their performance against fully connected neural networks and traditional support vector classifiers. Our comparative study highlights the importance of BERT which outperforms the traditional machine learning techniques by a relative improvement of 7.9%. In addition, we performed an analysis of how the BERT attention mechanism is being modified. Our findings indicate that the writing style features acquire higher importance at the moment of accurately identifying the different OMT categories. This is the first time that a study to determine the performance of different transformer-based architectures in the OMT task is performed. Similarly, our work propose, for the first time, using deep supervised autoencoders in the OMT classification task.

Here we studied resilience, a successful adaptation despite risk and adversity, in five countries: Brazil, Colombia, Germany, Israel, and Norway. In April 2020, over 2,500 participants were recruited for an observational study measuring protective and obstructive factors for distress and paranoia. More than 800 of these participants also completed a follow-up study in July. We found that thriving, keeping a regular schedule, engaging in physical exercise and less procrastination served as factors protecting against distress and paranoia. Risk factors were financial worries and a negative mindset, e.g., feeling a lack of control. Longitudinally, we found no increase in distress or paranoia despite an increase in expectation of how long the outbreak and the restrictions will last, suggesting respondents engaged in healthy coping and adapting their lives to the new circumstances. Altogether, our data suggest that humans adapt even to prolonged stressful events. Our data further highlight several protective factors that policymakers should leverage when considering stress-reducing policies.","output":"Identifying Resilience Factors of Distress and Paranoia During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Five Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative treatment occurs frequently and influences the prognoses. The aim of this study was to determine prognostic factors affecting survival after IDR and the optimum therapy for IDR. METHODS A total of 115 patients with a single small primary HCC who had complete radiofrequency (RF) ablation were enrolled in this study. The prognostic factors and the optimum therapy affecting survival were statistically analyzed among patients with IDRs. RESULTS IDRs were observed in 59 (51.3%) patients with the median observation period of 19.6 months. The cumulative rates of IDRs were 11.8, 53.9, and 75.8% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. IDR nodules were present as a single nodule in 38 patients and as multiple nodules in 21 patients. In all, 23 patients died during the follow-up. A total of 30 patients were treated with RF ablation, and 27 were treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). The overall cumulative survival rates after IDRs were 92.7, 55.4, and 43.7% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. A multivariate analysis showed that treatment with RF ablation for IDR was a significant favorable prognostic factor after IDR (hazard ratio: 0.167, 95% confidence interval: 0.048-0.584, P=0.005). In a comparison of survival after IDR between patients treated with RF ablation and TACE, who were comparable with clinical and tumoral characteristics, the cumulative survival rate of patients treated with RF ablation was significantly higher than that of those treated with TACE (77.2 vs 28.5% at 3 years). The cumulative survival rates obtained from the initial RF ablation of the patients with IDRs treated with repeat RF ablation were similar to those of recurrence-free patients. CONCLUSIONS Repeat RF ablation should be attempted for IDR as much as possible despite tumor multiplicity for survival benefit; by reducing the need, it will help solve the problem of the current shortage of donors for liver transplantations.","output":"Repeat radiofrequency ablation provides survival benefit in patients with intrahepatic distant recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY BACKGROUND Easily accessible, inexpensive, and widely used laboratory tests that demonstrate the severity of COVID-19 are important Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between mortality in COVID-19 and platelet count, Mean Platelet Volume (MPV), and platelet distribution width METHODS In total, 215 COVID-19 patients were included in this study The patients were divided into two groups Patients with room air oxygen saturation &amp;lt;90% were considered as severe COVID-19, and patients with &amp;#8805;90% were considered moderate COVID-19 Patient medical records and the electronic patient data monitoring system were examined retrospectively Analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical software A p-value &amp;lt;0 05 was considered significant RESULTS The patients&#039;mean age was 64,32  16,07 years According to oxygen saturation, 81 patients had moderate and 134 had severe COVID-19 Our findings revealed that oxygen saturation at admission and the MPV difference between the first and third days of hospitalization were significant parameters in COVID-19 patients for predicting mortality While mortality was 8 4 times higher in patients who had oxygen saturation under 90 % at hospital admission, 1 unit increase in MPV increased mortality 1 76 times CONCLUSION In addition to the lung capacity of patients, the mean platelet volume may be used as an auxiliary test in predicting the mortality in COVID-19 patients RESUMO OBJETIVO Testes laboratoriais de fcil acesso, baixo custo e amplamente utilizados capazes de demonstrar a gravidade da COVID-19 s?o importantes Portanto, neste estudo, o nosso objetivo foi investigar a relao entre a mortalidade na COVID-19 e a contagem de plaquetas, volume plaquetrio mdio (VMP) e largura de distribuio de plaquetas MTODOS No total, 215 pacientes com COVID-19 foram includos no estudo Os pacientes foram divididos em dois grupos Pacientes com saturao de oxignio &amp;lt;90% em ar ambiente foram considerados casos graves de COVID-19 e pacientes com valores &amp;#8805;90% foram considerados casos moderados Os registros mdicos dos pacientes e o sistema eletr?nico de monitoramento de dados de pacientes foram analisados retrospectivamente As anlises foram realizadas utilizando o software estatstico SPSS Um valor de p &amp;lt;0,05 foi considerado significativo RESULTADOS A mdia de idade dos pacientes foi de 64,32  16,07 anos Com base na saturao de oxignio, 81 pacientes eram casos moderados e 134 tinham COVID-19 grave Nosso estudo revelou que a saturao de oxignio no momento da internao e a diferen?a nos valores de VPM entre o primeiro e terceiro dia de internao foram parametros significativos para predizer mortalidade de pacientes com COVID-19 A mortalidade foi 8,4 vezes maior nos pacientes com saturao abaixo de 90% no momento da internao, mas um aumento de apenas 1 unidade no valor de VPM aumentou a mortalidade 1,76 vezes CONCLUS?O Alm da capacidade pulmonar dos pacientes, o volume plaquetrio mdio pode ser utilizado como um teste auxiliar para prever a mortalidade de pacientes com COVID-19","output":"Effect of COVID-19 on platelet count and its indices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To describe, based on the French National Health Insurance (NHI) data, time trends in diabetes medications after treatment initiation in two consecutive cohorts of people newly treated for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in 2008 (1st cohort) and 2013 (2nd cohort).

Our previous studies have shown that, ethanolic extract of T. arjuna bark exhibits radical scavenging anti-oxidant activity and also effectively inhibited catalase activity. In this study, oleanane triterpenoids type compounds viz., oleanolic acid, arjunolic acid, arjunolitin, arjunetin were isolated from ethanolic bark extract as bio-active compound and their structures were elucidated using (1)H, (13)C NMR, HR-ESIMS, IR. Of the various compounds, Arjunetin showed significant inhibition of catalase activity as compared to the other compounds. Based on the structural similarity between arjunetin and current antiviral drugs, we propose that arjunetin might exhibit antiviral activity. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies showed that arjunetin binds to the binds to key targets of SARS-CoV-2 namely, 3CLpro, PLpro, and RdRp) with a higher binding energy values (3CLpro, ?8.4 kcal/mol; PLpro, ?7.6 kcal/mol and RdRp, ?8.1 kcal/mol) as compared with FDA approved protease inhibitor drugs to Lopinavir (3CLpro, ?7.2 kcal/mole and PLpro ?7.7 kcal/mole) and Remdesivir (RdRp ?7.6 kcal/mole). To further investigate this, we performed 200C500 ns molecular dynamics simulation studies. The results transpired that the binding affinity of Arjunetin is higher than Remdesivir in the RNA binding cavity of RdRp. Based on structural similarity between arjunetin and Saikosaponin (a known antiviral agents) and based on our molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies, we propose that arjunetin can be a promising drug candidate against Covid-19.

OBJECTIVE Shows the experience in four different neurointerventional centres in Barcelona with the PED (Covidien) between February 2010 and October 2013. METHODS We reviewed retrospectively patients treated with PED in four neurointerventional centres in Barcelona between February 2010 and October 2013. RESULTS Forty-two patients (89.4%) with non-ruptured aneurysms and five (10.6%) post-SAH were treated, with a mean age of 51 years (range 26-76). We treated 67 aneurysms with a mean of 1.4 1-3 PED per patient. We have no mortality and three post-procedural complications with clinical consequences, two of them severe with intracranial haemorrhage and the other with anterior choroidal artery thrombosis.

Early prevention of fractures has become essential in recent decades. This can be achieved by evaluating the related risk factors, as a reference for further intervention. This is especially useful for the vulnerable patient group with comorbidities. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a major complication of liver cirrhosis, may increase the rate of falls and weaken the bone. This study evaluated the correlation between hepatic encephalopathy and osteoporotic hip fracture in the aged population using a national database. METHODS This retrospective cohort study used data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database between 2000 and 2012. We included people who were older than 50 years with hepatic encephalopathy or other common chronic illnesses. Patients with and without hepatic encephalopathy were matched at a ratio of 1:4 for age, sex, and index year. The incidence and hazard ratios of osteoporotic hip fracture between the both cohorts were calculated using Cox proportional hazard regression models. RESULTS The mean age of the enrolled patients was 66.5 years. The incidence ratio of osteoporotic hip fracture in the HE group was significantly higher than that in the non-HE group (68/2496 [2.7%] vs 98/9984 [0.98%]). Patients with HE were 2.15-times more likely to develop osteoporotic hip fractures than patients without HE in the whole group. The risk ratio was also significantly higher in female and older individuals. The results were also similar in the comorbidity subgroups of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, senile cataract, gastric ulcer, and depression. Alcohol-related illnesses seemed to not confound the results of this study. CONCLUSIONS HE is significantly associated with an increased risk of osteoporotic hip fractures, and the significance is not affected by the comorbidities in people aged more than 50 years. The cumulative risk of fracture increases with age.","output":"Hepatic encephalopathy increases the risk of hip fracture: a nationwide cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Early differentiation between emergency department (ED) patients with and without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is very important. The diagnosis of COVID-19 depends on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). On imaging, computed tomography (CT) manifestations resemble those seen in viral pneumonias, with multifocal ground-glass opacities and consolidation in a peripheral distribution being the most common findings. Although these findings lack specificity for COVID-19 diagnosis on imaging grounds, CT could be used to provide objective assessment about the extension of the lung opacities, which could be used as an imaging surrogate for disease burden. We set out to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT scanning in detecting COVID-19 in a population with suspected COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional single-center study performed on 348 cases with clinical suspicion of COVID-19, all adult symptomatic ED patients had both a CT scan and a PCR upon arrival at. CT results were compared with PCR test (s) and diagnostic accuracy was calculated. RESULTS: Between February 15, 2020, and June 30, 2020, 348 symptomatic patients were included. In total, 62.3% of patients had a positive PCR and 69.8% had a positive CT, resulting in a sensitivity of 94.2%, specificity of 76.7%, likelihood ratio (LR) of +2.94 and (LR) ?0.18. The sensitivity of the CT tended to be higher in those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (100.0%, P = 0.017) and severe COVID-19 (98.5%, P = 0.027) than in patients with mild (82.5%, P = 0.047) and moderate COVID-19 (89.3%, P = 0.039). The diagnostic ability of chest CT was found to be high with 86.3% concordance between findings of CT and PCR. In 48 (13.7%) patients, discordant findings between CT and PCR were observed. In most cases, the CT scan was considered suspicious for COVID-19, while the PCR was negative (37/48, 77.0%). In the majority of these, the diagnosis at discharge was pulmonary infection (n = 26; 54.1%). CONCLUSION: The accuracy of chest CT in symptomatic COVID suspect patients is high, but when used as a single diagnostic test, CT cannot accurately diagnose or exclude COVID-19. Therefore, we recommend a combination of both CT and RT-PCR for future follow-up, management, and medical surveillance.","output":"Diagnostic accuracy of chest computed tomography in improving the false negative rate as compared to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia: A cross sectional analysis of 348 cases from India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The subpleural sparing pattern is a common finding on computed tomography (CT) of the lungs. It comprises of pulmonary opacities sparing the lung peripheries, typically 1cm and less from the pleural surface. This finding has a variety of causes, including idiopathic, inflammatory, infectious, inhalational, cardiac, traumatic, and bleeding disorders. Specific disorders that can cause subpleural sparing patterns include nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), organizing pneumonia (OP), pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), vaping-associated lung injury (VALI), cracked lung, pulmonary edema, pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), pulmonary contusion, and more recently, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Knowledge of the many etiologies of this pattern can be useful in preventing diagnostic errors. In addition, although the etiology of subpleural sparing pattern is frequently indistinguishable during an initial radiologic evaluation, the differences in location of opacities in the lungs, as well as the presence of additional radiologic findings, patient history, and clinical presentation, can often be useful to suggest the appropriate diagnosis.

Shared decision-making, based on tools such as patient decision aids (PtDAs), can help patients make an informed choice about vaccination with Comirnaty. OBJECTIVE: The French College of Teachers in General Practice (CNGE) aimed to create a PtDA for people who have to decide whether they will receive the Comirnaty vaccine. METHODS: Development of the PtDA was performed according to the International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS). The initial design was based on a literature review and semistructured interviews with 17 patients to explore and clarify patients expectations. A first draft of the PtDA was then alpha tested by a patient expert group and a physician expert group. The PtDA was finally beta tested in 14 prevaccine consultations.

Thus far, the majority of studies investigating the association between vitamin D and COVID-19 have been observational and rely on vitamin D levels obtained at the time of admission, limiting causal inference. Currently, clinical trials assessing the effects of vitamin D supplementation in individuals with COVID-19 infection are extremely limited.

METHODS This is a sub-study of the Translational Research Investigating Biomarker Endpoints in AKI (TRIBE-AKI) cohort, including 106 children ranging in age from 1 month to 18 years undergoing CPB. Plasma IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations were measured preoperatively and postoperatively [day 1 (within 6 h after surgery) and day 3]. RESULTS Stage 2/3 AKI, defined by at least a doubling of the baseline serum creatinine concentration or dialysis, was diagnosed in 24 (23%) patients. The preoperative IL-6 concentration was significantly higher in patients with stage 2/3 AKI [median 2.6 pg/mL, interquartile range (IQR) 2.6 0.6-4.9 pg/mL] than in those without stage 2/3 AKI (median 0.6 pg/mL, IQR 0.6-2.2 pg/mL) (p = 0.03). After adjustment for clinical and demographic variables, the highest preoperative IL-6 tertile was associated with a sixfold increased risk for stage 2/3 AKI compared with the lowest tertile (adjusted odds ratio 6.41, 95 % confidence interval 1.16-35.35). IL-6 and IL-10 levels increased significantly after surgery, peaking postoperatively on day 1.

The attention of infection control in aged care needs to shift towards the built environment, especially with relation to using the existing space to allow social distancing and isolation. Physical infrastructure of aged care facilities has been shown to present challenges to implementation of isolation procedures. To explore the relationship of the physical layout of aged care facilities on SARS-CoV-2 attack rates among residents, a meta-analysis was conducted. METHODS: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocol (PRISMA-P), studies were identified from five databases using a registered search strategy with PROSPERO. Meta-regression analysis for pooled attack rates of SARS-CoV-2 in residents and staff was conducted, with subgroup analysis for physical layout variables such as total number of beds, single rooms, number of floors, number of buildings in facility and staff per 100 beds RESULTS: We included 41 articles across 11 countries, reporting on 90 657 residents and 6521 staff in 757 facilities. The overall pooled attack rate among residents was 42.0% (95% CI: 38.0-47.0%) and 21.7% (95% CI: 15.0-28.4%) in staff. Attack rates in residents were significantly higher in single-site facilities with standalone buildings than facilities with smaller, detached buildings. Staff-to-bed ratio significantly explains some of the heterogeneity of the attack rate between studies.

METHODS: All adult COVID\\\\19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit from 25th February to 27th April 2020 were included. Lung function was evaluated through chest CT scan and pulmonary function tests (PFT). Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of persisting lung alterations. RESULTS: Forty\\\\nine patients (75%) completed lung assessment. Chest CT scan was performed after a median (interquartile range) time of 97 (89C105) days, whilst PFT after 142 (133C160) days. The median age was 58 (52C65) years and most patients were male (90%). The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 11 (6C16) days. Median tidal volume/ideal body weight (TV/IBW) was 6.8 (5.71C7.67) ml/Kg. 59% and 63% of patients showed radiological and functional lung sequelae, respectively. The diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DL(CO)) was reduced by 59%, with a median per cent of predicted DL(CO) of 72.1 (57.9C93.9) %. Mean TV/IBW during invasive ventilation emerged as an independent predictor of persistent CT scan abnormalities, whilst the duration of mechanical ventilation was an independent predictor of both CT and PFT abnormalities. The extension of lung involvement at hospital admission (evaluated through Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema, RALE score) independently predicted the risk of persistent alterations in PFTs.

To examine the single-label dataset, we employed an array of ten shallow learning classifiers. Furthermore, we added an ensemble model that adopts the majority-voting technique of all studied classifiers. The performance of the classifiers on the first dataset ranged between 87.7% (AdaBoost) and 97.9% (SVM). Analyzing some of the misclassified articles confirmed the need for a multi-label opposed to single-label categorization for better classification results. For the second dataset, we tested both shallow learning and deep learning multi-labeling approaches. A custom accuracy metric, designed for the multi-labeling task, has been developed for performance evaluation along with hamming loss metric. Firstly, we used classifiers that were compatible with multi-labeling tasks such as Logistic Regression and XGBoost, by wrapping each in a OneVsRest classifier. XGBoost gave the higher accuracy, scoring 84.7%, while Logistic Regression scored 81.3%.

HIV stigma reduction interventions are urgently needed to promote and protect the health of persons living with HIV (PLWH). Resilience has been identified as a potential leverage to mitigate the impact of HIV-related stigma among PLWH. METHODS: We examined whether two resilience measures (i.e., social support and resilience assets and resources [RAR]) moderated the relationship between experienced HIV stigma and the HIV care continuum as well as how they moderated the relationship between the consequences of experienced HIV stigma (CES) and the HIV care continuum among 300 PLWH in Louisiana. Separate bootstrapping analyses were conducted to test for evidence of moderated moderation. RESULTS: Most participants were Black (79%) and had been living with HIV for 10 years or more. A relatively high sample of men who have sex with men (MSM) were enrolled (37%). The most common CES were depression (67%). The most common manifestation of experienced HIV stigma was being gossiped about (53%). Participants reported moderate levels of social support. In terms of RAR, most participants (71%) reported that they knew of groups that could support them in responding to experienced HIV stigma. After adjusting for potential covariates, social support and RAR both significantly moderated the relationship between experienced HIV stigma and length of time since their last HIV care visit, B(SE) = .003(.001), p = .03. At high levels of RAR and high levels of social support, those with higher levels of experienced HIV stigma reported a longer length of time since their last HIV care visit than those who reported lower levels of experienced HIV stigma (B(SE) = .17(.04), p < .001). RAR moderated the relationship between social support and HIV care, B(SE) = .01(.004), p < .001. Those who experienced greater CES reported a longer length of time since their last doctors visit B(SE) = .04(.02), p < .05. Experienced HIV stigma was not significantly associated with viral load results. However, social support significantly moderated the relationship between experienced stigma and viral load results. At higher levels of social support, those who experienced lower levels of stigma were more likely to report an undetectable viral load than those who had higher levels of stigma, B(SE) = ? .13(.03), p < .001. Finally, both RAR and social support moderated the relationship between CES and viral load results. Those who reported higher levels of RAR B(SE) = ? .07(.02), p < .001, and social support, B(SE) = ? .02(.01), p < .05, also reported having an undetectable viral load at most recent HIV care visit. CES was not significantly related to reporting an undetectable viral load (p = .61). CONCLUSIONS: Enrolled PLWH already have some level of resilience which plays an important protective role within the context of the HIV care continuum up to a certain extent. Interventions to enhance the RAR and social support components may be useful especially among MSM and persons who have been living with HIV for a shorter period of time.","output":"Associations Between Experienced HIV Stigma, Resulting Consequences, and the HIV Care Continuum: Moderating Effects of Two Resilience Characteristics Among Persons Living with HIV (PLWH) in Louisiana"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Full attention must be given to the follow-up of patients recovered from Coronavirus disease 2019, which developed in Wuhan, China in December 2019.

This study aimed to examine the effect of radiation (method, dose, and dose rate) on the acid value (AV), peroxide value (PV), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) content, and fatty acid profile of fresh and freeze-dried largemouth bass fleshes. RESULTS: The AV, PV and TBARS presented dose dependent increase in fish meat for both cobalt-60 (60 Co) and electron beam (EB) irradiation. With a 6 kGy of radiation, all measured indices in 60 Co group were significantly higher than those in EB group (P<0.05 or P<0.01). With a 3 kGy of radiation, the AV, PV and TBARS in 200 Gy/min dose rate group were significantly lower than those in 2 Gy/min and 80 Gy/min groups (P<0.05). After 60 Co irradiation, the AV, PV and TBARS in most of fresh samples were significantly higher than those in freeze-dried samples (P<0.01). And 60 Co radiation decreased the unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) content in fresh samples and increased the UFA content in freeze-dried samples. Our study indicated that 60 Co irradiation, particularly at a low dose rate, accelerated lipid oxidation in fish meat. A large amount of muscle moisture enhances the amount of UFA loss in fish meat during 60 Co irradiation. CONCLUSION: Low dose (3 kGy) of EB irradiation, high dose rate (200 Gy/min) of 60 Co irradiation or freeze-drying treatment can alleviate the lipid oxidation of largemouth bass meat.

However, once vaccine production starts, it will probably take time before there is enough vaccine for everyone, evoking the question how to distribute it best. While present vaccination guidelines largely focus on individual-based factors, i.e. on the question to whom vaccines should be provided first, e.g. to risk groups or to individuals with a strong social-mixing tendency, here we ask if a strategic spatiotemporal distribution of vaccines, e.g. to prioritize certain cities, can help to increase the overall survival rate of a population subject to an epidemic disease. To this end, we propose a strategy for the distribution of vaccines in time and space, which sequentially prioritizes regions with the most new cases of infection during a certain time frame and compare it with the standard practice of distributing vaccines demographically. Using a simple statistical model we find that, for a locally well-mixed population, the proposed strategy strongly reduces the number of deaths (by about a factor of two for basic reproduction numbers of [Formula: see text] and by about 35% for [Formula: see text]). The proposed vaccine distribution strategy establishes the idea that prioritizing individuals not only regarding individual factors, such as their risk of spreading the disease, but also according to the region in which they live can help saving lives. The suggested vaccine distribution strategy can be tested in more detailed models in the future and might inspire discussions regarding the importance of spatiotemporal distribution rules for vaccination guidelines.","output":"Strategic spatiotemporal vaccine distribution increases the survival rate in an infectious disease like Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To date, there is no licensed treatment or approved vaccine to combat the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), and the number of new cases and mortality multiplies every day.

The purpose of this paper is to explore disparities in conditions associated with an increased severity risk of COVID-19 including race, personal factors, healthcare accessibility, and affordability. Using data from the 2018 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), univariate and multivariate analysis were performed. More Non-Hispanic (NH) Blacks (61.1%) and NH Whites (61.2%) had conditions associated with increased severity risk of COVID-19 compared to Hispanics (47.1%) (p < .001). Racial differences revealed a higher proportion of NH Blacks with increased severity risk of COVID-19 were female (p < .001), not married (p < .001), not employed for wages (p < .001), had accessibility issues with transportation (p < .001), and had affordability issues with paying for medicine (p < .001). A higher proportion of Hispanic persons had a health place change (p = .020), had accessibility issues (e.g. telephone (p < .001), longer wait times (p < .001), closed facility (p = .038)) and had affordability issue with worrying about pay (p < .001). Significant predictors that were positively associated with increased severity risk of COVID-19 for all racial/ethnic groups were being NH Black, older age, having appointment issues, and affordability issues with medicine. Differences in magnitude across racial group dynamics were observed. Racial disparities exist in conditions associated with increased severity risk of COVID-19. As future policies and interventions are developed, it is important to consider differentials across racial group dynamics.","output":"Racial Disparities and COVID-19: Exploring the Relationship Between Race/Ethnicity, Personal Factors, Health Access/Affordability, and Conditions Associated with an Increased Severity of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study uses the fourteen stock indices as the sample and then utilizes eight parametric volatility forecasting models and eight composed volatility forecasting models to explore whether the neural network approach and the settings of leverage effect and non-normal return distribution can promote the performance of volatility forecasting, and which one of the sixteen models possesses the best volatility forecasting performance.

AR has the potential to become a strategic component of neurosurgical training courses. In fact, over the years, there has been a progressive increase in the application of AR in the various fields of neurosurgery. In this study, the authors aim to define the diffusion of these augmented reality systems in recent years. This study describes future trends in augmented reality for neurosurgeons. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify research published from December 1st, 2011 to November 30th, 2021. Electronic databases (PubMed, PubMed Central, and Scopus) were screened. The methodological quality of studies and extracted data were assessed for augmented reality and neurosurgery. The data analysis focused on the geographical distribution, temporal evolution, and topic of augmented reality in neurosurgery. RESULTS: A total of 198 studies have been included. The number of augmented reality applications in the neurosurgical field has increased during the last 10 years. The main topics on which it is mostly applied are spine surgery, neuronavigation, and education. The geographical distribution shows extensive use of augmented reality in the USA, Germany, China, and Canada. North America is the continent that uses augmented reality the most in the training and education of medical students, residents, and surgeons, besides giving the greatest research contribution in spine surgery, brain oncology, and surgical planning. AR is also extensively used in Asia for intraoperative navigation. Nevertheless, augmented reality is still far from reaching Africa and other countries with limited facilities, as no publications could be retrieved from our search. CONCLUSIONS: The use of AR is significantly increased in the last 10 years. Nowadays it is mainly used in spine surgery and for neurosurgical education, especially in North America, Europe and China.

Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that it may have a protective effect against COVID-19. Recent research found that countries with universal BCG childhood vaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead, this paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took place in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led to a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate from 92% to 2% , thus allowing us to estimate the BCG's effect without all the biases associated with cross-country comparisons. Methods Numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations were recorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after that change, representing 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We used regression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19 related outcomes. This method used on such a large population allows for a high precision that would be hard to achieve using a classical randomized controlled trial. Results The odds ratio for Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 related hospitalizations were 0.9997 (CI95: [0.8002-1.1992]) and 1.1931 (CI95: [0.7558-1.6304]), respectively. We can thus reject with 95% confidence that universal BCG vaccination reduces the number of cases by more than 20% and the number of hospitalizations by more than 24% Conclusions While the effect of a recent vaccination must be evaluated, we provide strong evidence that receiving the BCG vaccine at birth does not have a protective effect against COVID-19.","output":"BCG vaccination in infancy does not protect against COVID-19.

Additionally, RNA-seq combined with gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses was used to obtain the targets of DHA, and these were verified by molecular docking, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting. As a result, we found that DHA significantly suppressed the proliferation, DNA synthesis, and invasive capabilities and induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in HCT116, DLD1, and RKO cells in vitro and in vivo. Further analyses indicated that the targets of DHA were predominantly enriched in cell cycle-associated pathways, including CDK1, CCNB1, and PLK1; and DHA could bind with the CDK1/CCNB1 complex and inhibit the activation of CDK1/CCNB1/PLK1 signaling. Moreover, cucurbitacin E, a specific inhibitor of the CDK1/CCNB1 axis, enhanced the inhibitory effects of DHA on DNA synthesis and colony formation in HCT116 and DLD1 cells.

The T-cell repertoire derives this high diversity through somatic recombination of the T-cell receptor (TCR) locus, a random process that results in repertoires that are largely private to each individual. However, factors such as thymic selection and T-cell proliferation upon antigen exposure can affect TCR sharing among individuals. By immunosequencing the TCR variable region of 426 healthy individuals, we find that, on average, fewer than 1% of TCR clones are shared between individuals, consistent with largely private TCR repertoires. However, we detect a significant correlation between increased HLA allele sharing and increased number of shared TCR clones, with each additional shared HLA allele contributing to an increase in ~0.01% of the total shared TCR clones, supporting a key role for HLA type in shaping the immune repertoire. Surprisingly, we find that shared antigen exposure to CMV leads to fewer shared TCR clones, even after controlling for HLA, indicative of a largely private response to major viral antigenic exposure. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that increased age is correlated with decreased overall TCR clone sharing, indicating that the pattern of private TCR clonal expansion is a general feature of the T-cell response to other infectious antigens as well. However, increased age also correlates with increased sharing among the lowest frequency clones, consistent with decreased repertoire diversity in older individuals. Together, all of these factors contribute to shaping the TCR repertoire, and understanding their interplay has important implications for the use of T cells for therapeutics and diagnostics.","output":"Impact of HLA type, age and chronic viral infection on peripheral T-cell receptor sharing between unrelated individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Objective: To investigate sociodemographic factors associated with the willingness to take the pandemic influenza vaccine.

Not willing to vaccinate in the future was strongly associated with not taking the pandemic influenza vaccine in 2010 (OR = 9.0, 95%CI 6.9 - 11.6). Among the unvaccinated, females, those aged &gt; 60 years, and non-health care workers were less willing to vaccinate in the future. Again, in the vaccinated group, females were less willing to vaccinate. Conclusion: Multidisciplinary efforts should be encouraged in order to identify reasons for refusing vaccination, focusing on the individual and group perceptions of susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers to vaccination. Such information is needed to identify target groups for the delivery of customized interventions towards preventing emerging pandemics, such as avian influenza and COVID-19.","output":"Willingness to vaccinate against influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 among Brazilian civil servants: Pr-Sade cohort study/ Disposio para vacinar contra influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 entre funcionrios tcnico-administrativos universitrios: estudo de coorte Pr-Sade"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies require an accurate indicator of influenza infection, often obtained through research testing independent of clinical (physician-ordered) testing. Clinical testing could be used to detect influenza in these studies if factors associated with clinical testing for influenza were better understood. METHODS: Adults hospitalized with ARI at three study sites during the study period were enrolled in CDCs 2015C16 Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN) study and tested for influenza by RT-PCR. Clinical testing information, presenting symptoms, and patient characteristics were collected from medical records and patient interview. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds of receiving a clinical test based on age, vaccination status, comorbidities, presentation with influenza-like illness (ILI; defined as fever and cough or sore throat) and other factors. RESULTS: Of 895 enrollees, 571 (64%) patients meeting study inclusion criteria received physician-ordered testing. Of these, 53% had a multipathogen panel, 13% had a rapid antigen test, 7% had singleplex PCR, <1% had viral culture, and 27% had multiple tests; influenza infection was detected in 55 (6%) patients. Of 150 influenza cases identified by study testing, 25 (17%) were not tested clinically. Enrollees who did not receive clinical testing were older, had longer time to admission, and were less likely to present with ILI. Immunosuppressive disorders (aOR=2.05), non-COPD lung conditions (aOR=1.68), presentation with ILI (aOR=4.03), and admission 2 days from symptom onset (aOR=1.89) were positively associated with receiving a clinical test (P < 0.01 for all; Figure 1). After adjusting for these factors, enrollees with influenza vaccination were 37% less likely (aOR=0.63) to receive a clinical test (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Patients with ARI who were clinically tested for influenza differed from those not tested. A lower likelihood of testing among influenza positive vaccinees could potentially bias VE estimates upward and requires further evaluation. Clinical testing alone may fail to detect a substantial proportion of influenza cases.

Electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP medicine information system (VIP), and Wanfang electronic databases were comprehensively searched from inception to 30, July 2021. Prospective randomized trials with glutamine vs. routine nutrition or blank therapy were selected. The immune function related indicators (including IgA, IgG, IgM, CD4+, CD8+, and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+), post-operative complications [including surgical site infection (SSI), anastomotic leakage, and length of hospital stay (LOS)], and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were assessed in the pooled analysis. Subsequently, the heterogeneity between studies, sensitivity, publication bias, and meta-regression analysis were performed. Consequently, 31 studies which contained 2,201 patients (1,108 in the glutamine group and 1,093 in the control group) were included. Results of pooled analysis indicated that glutamine significantly improved the humoral immune function indicators [including IgA (SMD = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.72C1.58), IgM (SMD = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.48C0.89), and IgG (SMD = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.70C1.50)], and the T cell immune function indicators [including CD4+ (SMD = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.53C0.99) and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ (SMD = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.57C1.28)]. Meanwhile, the content of CD8+ was decreased significantly (SMD = ?0.50, 95% CI: ?0.91 to ?0.10) followed by glutamine intervention. Pooled analysis of SSI (RR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.30C0.75), anastomotic leakage (RR = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.09C0.61), and LOS (SMD = ?1.13, 95% CI: ?1.68 to ?0.58) were decreased significantly in glutamine group compared with control group.

Because the SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly contagious, physical distancing was enforced and indoor public spaces, including schools and educational institutions, were abruptly closed and evacuated to ensure civilian safety. Accordingly, educational institutions rapidly transitioned to remote learning. We investigated the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on domestic U.S. college students, ages 18C24 years. METHODS: Through Pollfish?s survey research platform, we collected data from 200 domestic U.S. college students in this age range (N = 200) regarding the physical, emotional, and social impacts of COVID-19 as well as key background information (e.g. whether or not they are first-generation or if they identify with the LGBTQIA+ community). RESULTS: Our results indicate that students closer to graduating faced increases in anxiety (60.8%), feeling of loneliness (54.1%), and depression (59.8%). Many reported worries for the health of loved ones most impacted their mental health status (20.0%), and the need to take care of family most affected current and future plans (31.8%). Almost one-half of students took to exercising and physical activity to take care of their mental health (46.7%). While a third did not have strained familial relationships (36.5%), almost one half did (45.7%). A majority found it harder to complete the semester at home (60.9%), especially among those who had strained relationships with family (34.1%). Seventy percent spent time during the pandemic watching television shows or movies. Significantly more men, first-generation, and low-income students gained beneficial opportunities in light of the pandemic, whereas their counterparts reported no impact. First-generation students were more likely to take a gap year or time off from school. CONCLUSIONS: Although students found ways to take care of themselves and spent more time at home, the clear negative mental health impacts call for schools and federal regulations to accommodate, support, and make mental health care accessible to all students.

Children usually have mild disease with one-third of them being asymptomatic, which hinders diagnostics of this infection and does not prevent hospitalization of infected children with non-respiratory disorders to hospitals. Objective. To assess the incidence and specific characteristics of COVID-19 among children emergently admitted to a multidisciplinary hospital not intended for hospitalization of patients with COVID-19. Patients and methods. We performed retrospective analysis of medical records of children admitted to different departments of a multidisciplinary hospital in Moscow between 20.03.2020 and 20.07.2020 (9,779 were discharged during this period). Results. A total of 64 children aged 1 month to 17 years admitted to 10 different departments had positive PCR results for COVID-19 (nasal/oropharyngeal swabs) upon admission to hospital. Fifteen patients (23.4%) had asymptomatic coronavirus infection. These were primarily children of school age and less often of preschool age admitted to the Departments of Traumatology, Surgery with injuries, fractures, exacerbation of chronic nephrological or abdominal disorders. Twenty-four participants (37.5%) presented with mild or none catarrhal symptoms, whereas 12 children were diagnosed with pneumonia. The highest number of SARS-CoV-2-positive children (n = 30;46.9%) were admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases, as could be expected. Conclusion. Our findings suggest that, in general, the current situation reflects our knowledge about COVID-19. Children usually have mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 and play a significant role in virus transmission, contributing to the continuation of the pandemic. Our results have high clinical and epidemiological significance and require further investigations among children of different ages to accumulate the data. ? 2021, Dynasty Publishing House.

The voices of students were filtered through the authors interpretation as educators to provide several teaching recommendations that support student learning during challenging times. The recommendations align with a trauma-informed approach, given the high rates of death anxiety and ambiguous loss among students, and have immediate implications for educators teaching during the pandemic, and for years to come.

But the bioactive compounds and potential mechanisms of TJQW for COVID-19 prevention and treatment are unclear. This study aimed to explore the potential therapeutic mechanism of TJQW in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on an integrated network pharmacology approach. METHODS: TCMSP were used to search and screen the active ingredients in TJQW. The Swiss TargetPrediction was used to predict the potential targets of active ingredients. Genes co-expressed with ACE2 were considered potential therapeutic targets on COVID-19. Venn diagram was created to show correlative targets of TJQW against COVID-19. Cytoscape was used to construct a drug-active ingredient-potential target network, STRING were used to construct protein-protein interaction network, and cytoHubba performed network topology analysis. Enrichment of biological functions and signaling pathways of core targets was performed by using the clusterProfiler package in R software and ClueGO with CluePedia plugins in Cytoscape. RESULTS: A total of 156 active ingredients were obtained through oral bioavailability and drug-likeness screenings. Two hundred twenty-seven potential targets of TJQW were related to COVID-19. The top ten core targets are EGFR, CASP3, STAT3, ESR1, FPR2, F2, BCL2L1, BDKRB2, MPO, and ACE. Based on that, we obtained 19 key active ingredients: umbelliprenin, quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, praeruptorin E, stigmasterol, and oroxylin A. And the enrichment analysis obtained multiple related gene ontology functions and signaling pathways. Lastly, we constructed a key network of drug-component-target-biological process-signaling pathway. Our findings suggested that TJQW treatment for COVID-19 was associated with elevation of immunity and suppression of inflammatory stress, including regulation of inflammatory response, viral process, neutrophil mediated immunity, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, Complement and coagulation cascades, and HIF-1 signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered the pharmacological mechanism underlying TJQW treatment for COVID-19.

Here, we report the interaction site between an ANXA1-specific antibody known to inhibit T cell activation without adverse cytotoxic effects and ANXA1 using amide hydrogenCdeuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). For the epitope determination, we applied two bottom-up HDX-MS approaches with pepsin digestion in solution and immobilized on beads. Both strategies revealed the interaction region within domain III of ANXA1 in Ca(2+)-bound conformation. The antibody-binding region correlates with the hydrophobic binding pocket of the N-terminal domain formed in the absence of calcium. This study demonstrates that even cryptic and flexible binding regions can be studied by HDX-MS, allowing a fast and efficient determination of the binding sites of antibodies which will help to define a mode of action profile for their use in therapy.","output":"HDX-MS for Epitope Characterization of a Therapeutic ANTIBODY Candidate on the Calcium-Binding Protein Annexin-A1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study addresses the risk and vulnerability of Chilean salmon production to hazards resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic threat, including limited access to farms, limited processing capacity and reduced market demand The role of different management approaches in reducing risk and vulnerability is also explored Results suggest that concession areas having the largest accumulated and current biomass have the highest risk, which is also transferred to the municipal level The scenarios modelled with better management practices that reduce diseases were able to reduce risks by 30C40% The largest risk reduction is achieved when production biomass is divided in a more equitable manner among concession areas, suggesting the need for strategic improvements in spatial planning of the activity in the marine environment according to ecosystem carrying capacity and better practices Improving adaptation capacity can reduce vulnerability between 20% and 30% for municipalities;for example, providing local employment can be a win-win management measure under the COVID-19 threat because it reduces movement of people and facilitates handling and responses to emergencies A larger footprint in local economies and employment can also improve social perception and acceptance of the sector, thus contributing to improve adaptation changes and governance to face the threats The framework used here to perform a risk and vulnerability assessment of salmon farming to the pandemic-associated threats can also be useful for other aquaculture systems elsewhere, provided that relevant information is available","output":"Chilean salmon farming vulnerability to external stressors: The COVID 19 as a case to test and build resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically transformed the care of the liver transplant patient.

The main objective of this report is to communicate our experience in the therapeutic management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 3 liver transplant patients. Secondly, we stress the management and investigation of the contagious spreading into a liver transplant ward. CASE SUMMARY: The patients were two women (aged 61 years and 62 years) and one man (aged 68 years), all of them having recently received a liver transplant. All three patients required intensive care unit admission and invasive mechanical ventilation. Two of them progressed severely until death. The other one, who received tocilizumab, had a good recovery. In the outbreak, the wife of one of the patients and four healthcare professionals involved in their care were also infected.

One example is hernia repair, where fibrin gluing has become increasingly established as an alternative method for mesh fixation. Clinically, fixation with fibrin glue shows a reduced postoperative complication rate compared to other fixation methods (staples, sutures), particularly with regard to pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS Six different lightweight meshes were tested: TiMesh light, TiMesh extralight, Parietene light, Ultrapro, Optilene LP, and BARD Soft Mesh. Two millimeters Tissucol was used for fixation. Five meshes from each group were tested on muscular tissue with and without fibrin glue. The defined defect was 4.5 cm in diameter. The biomechanical measurements were taken in a standardized way using a materials testing machine. The minimum fixation strength required was 32 N, calculated from a corresponding model. RESULTS The fixation strength measurements without fibrin glue gave a mean value for all 30 meshes of 2.98 N with a SD of 0.92 N. This was far below the 32 N required. With fibrin glue, the mean of all the measurements (30 meshes) was 61.86 +/- 23.0 N (min 34.9 N, max 97.3 N). The lowest value was recorded for Ultrapro (34.9 +/- 12.5 N). All the other meshes had a significantly higher fixation strength when fixed with fibrin glue than Ultrapro (p = 0.001). The best results were found for Optilene LP, and this was significantly better than all the other meshes (97.3 +/- 8.9 N; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Given the adequate stability and superior biocompatibility of lightweight large pore monofilament polypropylene meshes, heavyweight polypropylene meshes should no longer be used. It is possible to achieve adequate fixation of the meshes using fibrin glue. However, careful consideration should be given to the particular structure of the mesh in each case. Not every mesh is equally suitable for this purpose.","output":"Mesh fixation with fibrin glue (Tissucol/Tisseel) in hernia repair dependent on the mesh structure--is there an optimum fibrin-mesh combination?--investigations on a biomechanical model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background:Ample of studies have been carried out on the causative agent, pattern of illness, treatment options which mainly concern regarding the patients and general population affected from COVID -19, however few studies have fo- cused on its adverse effects on front line health care workers ( HCW ) and other employees of health care facilities. The present retrospective study was planned to analyse the clinico-viro-epidemiological profile of different covid clusters in HCWs and non-health care employees of AIIMS, Bhubaneswar. Methods:A hospital based retrospective study was carried out on the HCWs and other employees of AIIMS, Bhubanes- war, who tested positive SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR test.

The effects that survivors experience have been reported but rarely from the point of view of the survivors regarding their life after treatment. OBJECTIVE: To examine the perceived late effects of pediatric cancer on survivors and their self-identified primary support persons in order to understand the multifaceted nature of living after a pediatric cancer diagnosis. METHODS: Using a pragmatic interpretive phenomenology approach, 10 survivors of pediatric cancer (aged 21-28 years) and 9 of their support persons (aged 23-73 years) participated, completing background questionnaires and semistructured, one-on-one interviews. Interview transcripts were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Both survivors and support persons acknowledged that survivors experienced negative physical and cognitive health outcomes that require follow-up care. Survivors acknowledged that their cancer experience and residual effects have changed the trajectory of their lives. CONCLUSIONS: Research on young adult survivors of pediatric cancer and the residual/late effects and emotional outcomes they experience is warranted. Longitudinal research can aid in understanding how effects develop or worsen over time. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings of this study support The Children's Oncology Group Long-term Follow-up Guidelines for practitioners. As the frontline caring for these individuals and families, nurses' involvement in transitional care out of treatment is necessary. Continued involvement and understanding of long-term pediatric cancer survivorship for nurses are also imperative for continuity for survivors and families.","output":"\\"There Is No Before Cancer There Is Only Cancer.\\" Perceived Late Effects of Pediatric Cancer on Survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The new coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) pandemic has laid unprecedented stress on healthcare workers and especially nurses.

Both medications prolong the QT interval and accordingly may put patients at increased risk for torsades de pointes and sudden death. Published guidance documents vary in their recommendations for monitoring and managing these potential adverse effects. Accordingly, we set out to conduct a systematic review of the arrhythmogenic effect of short courses of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. We searched on MEDLINE and Embase, as well as in the gray literature up to April 17, 2020, for the risk of QT prolongation, torsades, ventricular arrhythmia, and sudden death with short-term chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine usage.

We found evidence of ventricular arrhythmia in 2 COVID-19 patients from a group of 28 treated with high-dose chloroquine. Limitations of these results are unclear follow-up and possible publication/reporting bias, but there is compelling evidence that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine induce significant QT-interval prolongation and potentially increase the risk of arrhythmia.

METHODS In a single urban tertiary care center, a retrospective study examined the first complete lockdown period of Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was compared to the same time period the previous year. RESULTS During the pandemic, time to hospitalization was significantly decreased. There was also an overall reduction in surgical admissions yet with a higher percentage being hospitalized for further treatment (69.2% vs 23.5%). The patients admitted during this time had a higher APACHE-II score and Charlson comorbidity index score. During the pandemic, time to surgery was decreased, there were less laparoscopic procedures, and more RBC units were used per patient. There were no differences in overall complications, except when sub-analyzed for major complications (9.7% vs 6.3%). There was no significant difference in overall in-house mortality or morbidity. Length of hospitalization was significantly decreased in the elderly population during the pandemic.

Despite global efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is now found in over 200 countries and has caused an upward death toll of over 1 million human lives as of November 2020. To date, only one Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutic drug (Remdesivir) and a monoclonal antibody, MAb (Bamlanivimab) are available for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. As with other viruses, studying SARS-CoV-2 requires the use of secondary approaches to detect the presence of the virus in infected cells. To overcome this limitation, we have generated replication-competent recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 expressing fluorescent (Venus or mCherry) or bioluminescent (Nluc) reporter genes. Vero E6 cells infected with reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 can be easily detected via fluorescence or luciferase expression and display a good correlation between reporter gene expression and viral replication. Moreover, rSARS-CoV-2 expressing reporter genes have comparable plaque sizes and growth kinetics to those of wild-type virus, rSARS-CoV-2/WT. We used these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 to demonstrate their feasibility to identify neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) or antiviral drugs. Our results demonstrate that reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 represent an excellent option to identify therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, where reporter gene expression can be used as valid surrogates to track viral infection.

METHODS: The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) was calculated and used to classify neighborhood deprivation at the census tract level. A total of 17 US census variables were used to calculate the ADI for each of the 1148 census tracts in Louisiana. The data were extracted from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2018. The neighborhoods were categorized into quintiles as well as low and high deprivation. The publicly available COVID-19 cumulative case counts by census tract were obtained from the Louisiana Department of Health website on July 31, 2020.

State minimum wage and paid sick leave policies may affect whether people are vulnerable to employment and health shocks to income and affect food insufficiency. Methods We evaluated the relationship between state minimum wage policies and the outcome of household food insufficiency among participants younger than 65 during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used data from biweekly, state representative Census Pulse surveys conducted between August 19 and December 21, 2020. We conducted analyses in the full population under age 65 years, who are most likely to work, and in households with children. The primary exposure was state minimum wage policies in four categories: less than $8.00, $8.00 to $9.99, $10.00 to $11.99, and $12.00 or more. A secondary exposure was missing work due to COVID-19, interacted with whether participants reported not having paid sick leave. Food insufficiency was defined as sometimes or often not having enough to eat in the past seven days. Very low child food sufficiency was defined as children sometimes or often not eating enough in the past seven days because of inability to afford food. We conducted a multivariable modified Poisson regression analysis to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios and marginal effects. We clustered standard errors by state. To adjust for state health and social programs, we adjusted for health insurance and receipt of supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits, unemployment insurance, and stimulus payments. We conducted subgroup analyses among populations most likely to be affected by minimum wage policies: Participants who reported any work in the past seven days, who reported <$75,000 in 2019 household income, or who had a high school education or less. We conducted falsification tests among participants less likely to be directly affected by policies, []65 years or with >$75,000 in 2019 household income. Results In states with a minimum wage of less than $8.00, 14.3% of participants under age 65 and 16.6% of participants in households with children reported household food insufficiency, while 10.3% of participants reported very low child food sufficiency. A state minimum wage of $12 or more per hour was associated with a 1.83 percentage point reduction in the proportion of households reporting food insufficiency relative to a minimum wage of less than $8.00 per hour (95% CI: -2.67 to -0.99 percentage points). In households with children, a state minimum wage of $12 or more per hour was associated with a 2.13 percentage point reduction in household food insufficiency (95% CI: -3.25 to -1.00 percentage points) and in very low child food sufficiency (-1.16 percentage points, 95% CI: -1.69 to -0.63 percentage points) relative to a state minimum wage of less than $8.00 per hour. Minimum wages of $8.00 to $9.99 and $10.00 to $11.99 were not associated with changes in child food insufficiency or very low child food sufficiency relative to less than $8.00 per hour. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main results. Estimates were of a lesser magnitude (<0.6 percentage points) in populations that should be less directly affected by state minimum wage policies. Missing work due to COVID-19 without paid sick leave was associated with a 5.72 percentage point increase in the proportion of households reporting food insufficiency (95% CI: 3.59 to 7.85 percentage points). Discussion Food insufficiency is high in all households and even more so in households with children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Living in a state with at least a $12 minimum wage was associated with a decrease in the proportion of people reporting food insufficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic.

These modifications may have the added benefit of reducing the risk of pedestrian injury; however, there is a gap in the physical activity literature regarding how best to measure pedestrian injury. Examining the measures that have been used and related data sources can help inform the use of pedestrian injury data to evaluate whether safety is optimized as walking increases. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify studies that evaluated changes to the built environment that support walking and measures impacts on pedestrian injury as a measure of safety. We searched PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science to identify peer-review studies and websites of fifteen organizations to document studies from the grey literature published in English between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2018. Our search identified twelve studies that met the inclusion criteria. The few studies that measured changes in pedestrian injury used crash data from police reports. Injury frequency was often reported, but not injury severity, and no studies reported injury risk based on walking exposure. We conclude that few studies have measured pedestrian injury in the context of creating more walkable communities. Future research would benefit from using well-characterized measures from existing studies to support consistency in measurement, and from more longitudinal and evaluation research to strengthen the evidence on additional benefits of walkability. Increased collaborations with injury prevention professionals could bolster use of valid and reliable measures.","output":"Systematic review on quantifying pedestrian injury when evaluating changes to the built environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ribavirin is a guanosine ribonucleoside analog that displays broad-spectrum anti-viral activity and is currently used for the treatment of some viral infections.

Since the first laboratory confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 was reported from Kerala on January 30, 2020 novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (NCIP) has been presenting to the hospital emergencies as severe acute respiratory illness (SARI). We aim to find out the rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in SARI cases and further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP in New Delhi, India. Aims and Objectives To find out the rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in SARI cases presenting to the hospital emergency and describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. Design, Setting and Participants Retrospective, single-center case series of the 82 consecutive hospitalized patients with SARI and subsequent confirmed NCIP cases at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, New Delhi between 10th April 2020 and 30th April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. The primary composite end-point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation or death. Patients were categorized as severe pneumonia and non-severe pneumonia at time of admission and outcome data was compared. Results Of the 82 SARI cases, 32(39%) patients were confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. The median age of NCIP cases was 54.5 years (IQR, 46.25 - 60) and 19(59.3%) of them were males. 24(75%) cases were categorized as severe pneumonia on admission. 22(68.8%) patients had 1 or more co-morbidities. Diabetes mellitus 16(50%), hypertension 11(34.4%) and chronic obstructive airway disease 5(15.6%) were the most common co-existing illnesses. Compared with the patients who did not meet the primary outcome, patients who met the primary outcome were more likely to be having at least 1 underlying comorbidity (p-0.03), diabetes (p-0.003) and hypertension (p-0.03). Common symptoms included dyspnea 29(90.6%) followed by cough 27(84.4%), fever 22(68%), bodyache and myalgias 14(43.75%). Median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 3 days. The most common pattern on chest X-ray was bilateral patchy nodular or interstitial infiltration seen in 30(93.8%) patients. Leucopenia was present in 10(31.2%) of the patients, with majority of patients presenting with lymphocytopenia, 24(75%) [lymphocyte count (1106 cells/ dL), interquartile range {IQR}, (970-1487)]. Thrombocytopenia was seen in 14(43.8%) patients, pancytopenia in 10(31.2%) patients and anemia was seen in 14(43.8%) patients. Hypoalbuminemia was present in 22(68.8%) cases. Raised CK-MB was seen in 7(21.9%) patients. The primary composite end-point occurred in 12(37.5%) patients, including 9(28.13%) patients who required mechanical ventilation and subsequently expired. 3(9.3%) of these patients who recovered, were subsequently shifted to COVID-19 ward from the ICU. The patients who met the primary outcome were older in age (56.5 years vs 50 years), had significantly higher SOFA scores (6 vs 3.5), were in shock (41.7% vs 5%), in higher respiratory distress (66.7% vs 10%), had lower mean arterial oxygen saturation (85% vs 89.5%), had higher CK-MB values (66 vs 26)U/L [6(54.5%) vs 2(9.5%)], had hypoalbuminemia (100% vs 50%) and acute kidney injury 8(72.7%) vs 5(23.8%) on admission.

The COVID-19 pandemic had a severe psychological impact on HCWs, including the development of Post-Traumatic Stress symptoms. Specific subgroups of HCWs, such as front-line and female workers, were more prone to poor mental health outcomes and difficulties facing stress. Methods: The responses to an online questionnaire among HCWs in Saudi Arabia (KSA) were collected December 1-5, 2021, aiming to assess their Omicron variant's uncertainties, worries, resilience, and coping strategies. Three validated instruments were used to achieve the study's goals: the Brief Resilient Coping Scale, the Standard Stress Scale (SSS), and the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS) - Short Form. Results: The online survey was completed by 1285 HCWs. Females made up the majority (64%). The BRCS score of resilient coping was negatively and substantially linked with the SSS score of stress (r=-0.313, p = 0.010). Furthermore, the IUS had a positive and significant relationship with stress (r=0.326, p= 0.010). Increased stress levels were linked to a considerable drop in resilient coping scores. Furthermore, being a Saudi HCW or a nurse was linked to a significant reduction in resilient coping ratings. Coping by following healthcare authorities' preventative instructions and using the WHO website as a source of information was linked to a considerable rise in resilient coping. Conclusions: Following the emergence of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2021, a rapid investigation into the correlates of stress and resilient coping among the HCWs in KSA was conducted. The negative association between resilient coping and stress was clearly shown, as well as how underlying intolerance of uncertainty is linked to higher stress among HCWs quickly following the development of a new infectious threat.

Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, and several vaccines are currently available. Efforts need to be undertaken to counter the threat of the global COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We generated a Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, EBY100/pYD1-RBD, in which the full-length receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was expressed on the surface of yeast. Mice vaccinated orally with unadjuvanted EBY100/pYD1-RBD could produce significant humoral and mucosal responses as well as robust cellular immune responses. Notably, EBY100/pYD1-RBD elicited a mixed Th1/Th2-type cellular immune response with a Th1-biased immune response in a mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the importance of the RBD as a key target to design and develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and provide evidence of oral administration of a S. cerevisiae-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine eliciting significant immune responses. Most importantly, the S. cerevisiae surface display system can serve as a universal technology platform and be applied to develop other oral viral or bacterial vaccines.","output":"Immune response induced by oral administration with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Food insecurity has negative impacts on health, including the function of the immune system.

Demographic and socio-economic information was collected using a questionnaire. The Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) was used for assessing household food insecurity. The data analysis was performed by SPSS.22, using Chi-square test, ANOVA test, and Multinomial Logistic Regression Model. Results: The findings indicated that healthcare personnel were at higher risk of COVID-19 (CI = 1.90, 7.05;OR = 3.66;P < 0.001). It was also shown that HFIAS scores were significantly higher among infected people compared to noninfected (CI = 1.00, 1.05;OR = 1.03;P < 0.05). Women were at lower risk of infection compared to men (CI = 0.41, 0.87;OR = 0.60;P < 0.05).

Whereas, the pathogenesis underlying these neurological manifestations remains elusive. Although in vitro models and animal models are widely used in studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection, human organ models that can reflect the pathological alterations in a multi-organ context are still lacking. In this study, we propose a new strategy to probe the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on human brains in a linked alveolus-BBB organ chip platform. The new multi-organ platform allows to recapitulate the essential features of human alveolar-capillary barrier and blood-brain barrier in a microfluidic condition by co-culturing the organ-specific cells. The results reveal direct SARS-CoV-2 exposure has no obvious effects on BBB chip alone. While, infusion of endothelial medium from infected alveolus chips can cause BBB dysfunction and neuroinflammation on the linked chip platform, including brain endothelium disruption, glial cell activation and inflammatory cytokines release. These new findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could induce neuropathological alterations, which might not result from direct viral infection through hematogenous route, but rather likely from systemic inflammation following lung infection. This work provides a new strategy to study the virus-host interaction and neuropathology at an organ-organ context, which is not easily obtained by other in vitro models. This will facilitate to understand the neurological pathogenesis in SARS-CoV-2 and accelerate the development of new therapeutics. SUMMARY A linked human alveolus-BBB chip platform is established to explore the influences of SARS-CoV-2 on human brains in an organ-organ context. SARS-CoV-2 infection could induce BBB injury and neuroinflammation.

Informal social gatherings are a potentially important mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but studying their role in transmission is challenged by data and methodological limitations; birthdays offer an opportunity to empirically quantify the potential role of small social gatherings in COVID-19 spread. Objective: To assess the association between social gatherings and SARS-CoV-2 transmission by studying whether COVID-19 rates increase after birthdays in a household. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used nationwide data from January 1 to November 8, 2020, from 2.9 million US households with private insurance to compare COVID-19 infections between households with and without a birthday in the preceding 2 weeks, stratified according to county-level COVID-19 prevalence in that week and adjusting for household size and both week- and county-specific differences. The study also compared how birthday-associated infection rates differed by type of birthday (eg, child vs adult birthday, or a milestone birthday such as a 50th birthday), county-level precipitation on the Saturday of each week (which could move gatherings indoors), political leanings in the county, and state shelter-in-place policies. Main Outcomes and Measures: Household-level COVID-19 infection. Results: Among the 2.9 million households in the study, in the top decile of counties in COVID-19 prevalence, households with a birthday in the 2 weeks prior had 8.6 more diagnoses per 10a?000 individuals (95% CI, 6.6-10.7 per 10a?000 individuals) compared with households without a birthday in the 2 weeks prior, a relative increase of 31% above the county-level prevalence of 27.8 cases per 10a?000 individuals, vs 0.9 more diagnoses per 10a?000 individuals (95% CI, 0.6-1.3 per 10a?000 individuals) in the fifth decile (P < .001 for interaction). Households in the tenth decile of COVID-19 prevalence had an increase in COVID-19 diagnoses of 15.8 per 10a?000 persons (95% CI, 11.7-19.9 per 10a?000 persons) after a child birthday, compared with an increase of 5.8 per 10a?000 persons (95% CI, 3.7-7.9 per 10a?000 persons) among households with an adult birthday (P < .001 in a test of interactions). No differences were found by milestone birthdays, county political leaning, precipitation, or shelter-in-place policies.

METHODS Under good laboratory practice conditions, 26 pigs were investigated. A complex arteriovenous malformation (AVM) model was created in 16 animals, and a simple rete model was used in the remaining 10 animals. The novel material was used for embolization in 22 animals, and a commercially available liquid embolic material in 4 animals as a control group. Animals were killed at 2 days, 3 months and 6 months. Feasibility, efficacy and safety were evaluated radiologically, clinically and histologically. RESULTS Preparation was easy, without risk of catheter clogging or adhesiveness. Embolic delivery was well controlled under subtracted fluoroscopy. Visibility was homogeneous throughout the injection and the material behaved cohesively upon delivery. Best lesion penetration was obtained with the use of proximal microballoon occlusion. Unforeseen over-dilution of the test material by DMSO prefilled in the microballoon hub changed the material properties and caused inadvertent cerebral embolization leading to death in five animals. This phenomenon was avoided by practical measures. The casts produced no beam-hardening artefacts on CT scans. Histology showed excellent biocompatibility. CONCLUSIONS Embolization with this novel, iodinated, precipitating polymer was feasible and effective. Care should be taken during delivery to avoid over-dilution of the material by prefilled DMSO. The material is promising for embolization of AVMs and hypervascular lesions. KEY POINTS ? The intrinsically opaque precipitating polymer has adequate fluoroscopic visibility ? The polymer does not induce shading or beam-hardening artefacts on CT ? The novel liquid embolic material does not require lengthy preparation ?

Methods We retrospectively reviewed 39 patients with a large barrel-shaped uterus who were treated with GnRHa (leuprolide acetate) before single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy. During the same period, 134 patients without GnRHa pretreatment were included as control subjects. Results Patients with GnRHa treatment had an average increase in hemoglobin of 3.0 mg/dL and a decrease in uterine weight of 330.9 g (40.1%). Ancillary ports were required in 2 patients in the treatment group and none in the control group. There were no differences in uterine weights, operative time, and estimated blood loss in the 2 groups of patients. The estimated average operative time was shortened by 34 min after GnRHa treatment. However, bladder and ureter injuries were marginally higher (10.3% versus 2.2%) and days of hospital stay (3.7 versus 3.1) were significantly longer in the treatment group compared with controls. Complication rates were correlated with previous operative history, pelvic adhesion, and larger uterine weight but not with GnRHa treatment and operative sequence. Conclusions GnRHa pretreatment in patients with a large barrel-shaped uterus during SPH is feasible with shortened operative time. However, the higher complication rates in these patients suggest that a weight-reduced barrel-shaped uterus that is achieved with GnRHa treatment could still be difficult and should be handled in cautious.","output":"GnRHa Before Single-Port Laparoscopic Hysterectomy in a Large Barrel-Shaped Uterus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the financial context of the lives of female sex workers (FSWs) is essential to address structural drivers of HIV risk.

In Australia and Canada, the dominant narrative of resource extraction is that most of the benefits flow away from host regions. This paper draws on evolutionary economic geography, presenting a case study of the Limestone Coast in South Australia, which previously extracted and distributed gas locally to food and fibre manufacturing industries. New policies seeking to renew the gas industry in the region, provide subsidies for exploration. Scenarios were developed to help inform decisions about the role of gas within this region. Qualitative analysis of the scenarios emphasised that gas needs to be affordable and locally accessible. Quantitative modelling showed that using the gas locally by manufacturing industries as part of broader industrial expansion would lead to greater benefits compared with exporting all gas outside the region. We conclude that policy settings have gone some way towards realising increased benefits for the region.

A pilot virtual national teaching for OMFS specialty trainees (STs) during COVID received very positive feedback from STs last year. There is an unmet need for a systematic OMFS online learning resource for OMFS STs. BAOMS 2020 President Mr Rob Bentley has used part of his Presidential Fund to set up and support this online education programme in direct response to the shift to online learning. Methods: The programme will deliver monthly live lectures, with content mapped to the OMFS curriculum. These lectures will then be made available for access online permanently. Over a three-year period, the lectures will cover the syllabus. Additionally, how to do it videos will be added to FlexFacs. Quizzes and games based around the recorded lectures will be made available also. There are plans to make virtual reality surgery content available for trainees along with an indexed repository of webinar lectures on the FlexFacs website. Results: Feedback received from OMFS STs was very positive. 98 percent of the OMFS STs who attended the pilot webinars rated it as excellent or very good and 99 percent found the content extremely useful or very useful. The inaugural lecture was delivered on 21st September 2021. Conclusions: FlexFacs is the innovative, brand-new online training and educational resource for OMFS STs launched by the BAOMS.

OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 breakthrough infections among vaccinated individuals and to reassess the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination against severe outcomes using real-world data. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a series of observational retrospective analyses using the electronic health records (EHRs) of Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian (CUIMC/NYP) up to September 21, 2021. New York adult residence with PCR test records were included in this analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Poisson regression was used to assess the association between breakthrough infection rate in vaccinated individuals and multiple risk factors C including vaccine brand, demographics, and underlying conditions C while adjusting for calendar month, prior number of visits and observational days. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between vaccine administration and infection rate by comparing a vaccinated cohort to a historically matched cohort in the pre-vaccinated period. Infection incident rate was also compared between vaccinated individuals and longitudinally matched unvaccinated individuals. Cox regression was used to estimate the association of the vaccine and COVID-19 associated severe outcomes by comparing breakthrough cohort and two matched unvaccinated infection cohorts. RESULTS: Individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BNT162b2 (IRR against Moderna/mRNA-1273 [95% CI]: 1.66 [1.17 C 2.35]); were male (1.47 [1.11 C 1.94%]); and had compromised immune systems (1.48 [1.09 C 2.00]) were at the highest risk for breakthrough infections. Vaccinated individuals had a significant lower infection rate among all subgroups. An increased incidence rate was found in both vaccines over the time. Among individuals infected with COVID-19, vaccination significantly reduced the risk of death (adj. HR: 0.20 [0.08 C 0.49]). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: While we found both mRNA vaccines were effective, Moderna/mRNA-1273 had a lower incidence rate of breakthrough infections. Both vaccines had increased incidence rates over the time. Immunocompromised individuals were among the highest risk groups experiencing breakthrough infections. Given the rapidly changing nature of the SARS-CoV-2, continued monitoring and a generalizable analysis pipeline are warranted to inform quick updates on vaccine effectiveness in real time.","output":"A Retrospective Analysis of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Breakthrough Infections C Risk Factors and Vaccine Effectiveness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND This paper presents an improved radar-based imaging system for breast cancer detection that features p-slot ultrawideband antennae in a 32-array set-up. The improved reconstruction algorithm incorporates the phase coherence factor (PCF) into the conventional delay and sum (DAS) beamforming algorithm, thus effectively suppressing noise arising from side- and grating-lobe interferences. METHODS The system is tested by using several breast models fabricated from chemical mixtures formulated on the basis of realistic human tissues. Each model is placed in a hemispherical breast radome that was fabricated from polylactide material and surrounded by 32 p-slot antennae mounted in four concentric layers. These antennae are connected to an 8.5 GHz vector network analyser through two 16-channel multiplexers that automatically switch different combinations of transmitter and receiver pairs in a sequential manner. RESULTS The system can accurately detect 5 mm tumours in a complex and homogeneously dense 3D breast model with an average signal-to-clutter ratio and full-width half-maximum of 7.0 dB and 2.3 mm, respectively. These values are more competitive than the values of other beamforming algorithms even with contrasts of as low as 1:2. CONCLUSION The proposed PCF-weighted DAS is the best-performing algorithm amongst the tested beamforming techniques. This research paves the way for a clinical trial involving human subjects.

Our aim is to assess lung signal intensity in children on ultrashort echo-time (UTE) and zero echo-time (ZTE) sequences. We hypothesize that lung signal intensity can be correlated to lung physical density. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lung MRI was performed in 17 children with morphologically normal lungs (median age: 4.7 years, range 15 days to 17 years). Both lungs were manually segmented in UTE and ZTE images and the average signal intensities were extracted. Lung-to-background signal ratios (LBR) were compared for both sequences and between both patient groups using non-parametric tests and correlation analysis. Anatomical region-of-interest (ROI) analysis was performed for the normal cohort for assessment of the anteroposterior lung gradient. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between LBR of normal lungs using UTE and ZTE (p < 0.05). Both sequences revealed a LBR age-dependency with a high negative correlation for UTE (R(s) = C 0.77; range 2.98C1.41) and ZTE (R(s) = C 0.82; range 2.66C1.38)). Signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) were age-dependent for both sequences. SNR was higher for children up to 2 years old with 3D UTE Cones while for the rest it was higher with 4D ZTE. CNR was similar for both sequences. Posterior lung areas exhibited higher signal intensity compared to anterior ones (UTE 9.4% and ZTE 12% higher), both with high correlation coefficients (R(2)(UTE) = 0.94, R(2)(ZTE) = 0.97). CONCLUSION: The ZTE sequence can measure signal intensity similarly to UTE in pediatric patients.

Based on a comparative approach in two cave-dwelling bat species and high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, we demonstrated a clear signature in microbiota changes over the reproduction season, consistent across the multiple body habitats investigated, and associated with the sex, age and reproductive condition of bats. We observed in parallel highly dynamic shedding patterns for both bacteria and viruses, but did not find a significant association between viral shedding and bacterial microbiota composition. Indeed, only Leptospira shedding was associated with alterations in both the diversity and composition of the urinary microbiota. These results illustrate how seasonal reproduction in bats substantially affects microbiota composition and infection dynamics, and have broad implications for the understanding of disease ecology in important reservoir hosts, such as bats.","output":"Synchronized shift of oral, faecal and urinary microbiotas in bats and natural infection dynamics during seasonal reproduction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context The COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting health and economies across the world, although the nature of direct and indirect effects on Asian agrifood systems and food security has not yet been well understood. Objectives This paper assesses the initial responses of major farming and food systems to COVID-19 in 25 Asian countries, and considers the implications for resilience, food and nutrition security and recovery policies by the governments. Methods A conceptual systems model was specified including key pathways linking the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 to the resilience and performance of the four principal Asian farming and food systems, viz, lowland rice based;irrigated wheat based;hill mixed;and dryland mixed systems. Based on this framework, a systematic survey of 2504 key informants (4% policy makers, 6% researchers or University staff, 6% extension workers, 65% farmers, and 19% others) in 20 Asian countries was conducted and the results assessed and analysed. Results and conclusion The principal Asian farming and food systems were moderately resilient to COVID-19, reinforced by government policies in many countries that prioritized food availability and affordability. Rural livelihoods and food security were affected primarily because of disruptions to local labour markets (especially for off-farm work), farm produce markets (notably for perishable foods) and input supply chains (i.e., seeds and fertilisers). The overall effects on system performance were most severe in the irrigated wheat based system and least severe in the hill mixed system, associated in the latter case with greater resilience and diversification and less dependence on external inputs and long market chains. Farming and food systems' resilience and sustainability are critical considerations for recovery policies and programmes, especially in relation to economic performance that initially recovered more slowly than productivity, natural resources status and social capital. Overall, the resilience of Asian farming and food systems was strong because of inherent systems characteristics reinforced by public policies that prioritized staple food production and distribution as well as complementary welfare programmes. With the substantial risks to plant- and animal-sourced food supplies from future zoonoses and the institutional vulnerabilities revealed by COVID-19, efforts to improve resilience should be central to recovery programmes. Significance This study was the first Asia-wide systems assessment of the effects of COVID-19 on agriculture and food systems, differentiating the effects of the pandemic across the four principal regional farming and food systems in the region.","output":"Response and resilience of Asian agrifood systems to COVID-19: An assessment across twenty-five countries and four regional farming and food systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"National and international guidelines recommend droplet/airborne transmission and contact precautions for those caring for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in ambulatory and acute care settings. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, an acute respiratory infectious agent, is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. A recognized key to transmission of COVID-19, and droplet infections generally, is the dispersion of bioaerosols from the patient. Increased risk of transmission has been associated with aerosol generating procedures that include endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The knowledge that COVID-19 subjects can be asymptomatic and still shed virus, producing infectious droplets during breathing, suggests that health care workers (HCWs) should assume every patient is potentially infectious during this pandemic. Taking actions to reduce risk of transmission to HCWs is, therefore, a vital consideration for safe delivery of all medical aerosols. Guidelines for use of personal protective equipment (glove, gowns, masks, shield, and/or powered air purifying respiratory) during high-risk procedures are essential and should be considered for use with lower risk procedures such as administration of uncontaminated medical aerosols. Bioaerosols generated by infected patients are a major source of transmission for SARS CoV-2, and other infectious agents. In contrast, therapeutic aerosols do not add to the risk of disease transmission unless contaminated by patients or HCWs.","output":"Reducing Aerosol-Related Risk of Transmission in the Era of COVID-19: An Interim Guidance Endorsed by the International Society of Aerosols in Medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sudden appearance of COVID-19 has put the world in a serious situation. Due to the rapid spread of the virus and the increase in the number of infected patients and deaths, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic.

Despite the development and availability of different vaccines for COVID-19, scientists still warn the citizens of new severe waves of the virus, and as a result, fast diagnosis of COVID-19 is a critical issue. Chest imaging proved to be a powerful tool in the early detection of COVID-19. This study introduces an entire framework for the early detection and early prognosis of COVID-19 severity in the diagnosed patients using laboratory test results. It consists of two phases (1) Early Diagnostic Phase (EDP) and (2) Early Prognostic Phase (EPP). In EDP, COVID-19 patients are diagnosed using CT chest images. In the current study, 5, 159 COVID-19 and 10, 376 normal computed tomography (CT) images of Egyptians were used as a dataset to train 7 different convolutional neural networks using transfer learning. Data augmentation normal techniques and generative adversarial networks (GANs), CycleGAN and CCGAN, were used to increase the images in the dataset to avoid overfitting issues. 28 experiments were applied and multiple performance metrics were captured.

Prior research suggests starting a new job is an uncertain experience; we theorize that the COVID-19 pandemic creates additional environmental stressors that affect new hire engagement. First, we hypothesize that the occurrence of COVID-19 and unemployment rates relate negatively to engagement. Second, we theorize that the effects of the pandemic become more disruptive on new hire engagement as they gain tenure within the organization. Third, drawing from strategic management theory, we test whether States that introduce stronger COVID-19 policies help enhance the engagement of new hires. Examining a U.S. national sample of 12,577 newly hired (90 days or less) quick service restaurant employees across 9 months (January-September, 2020), we find support for these hypotheses. Subsequent model comparisons suggest there may be health stressors that shape engagement more strongly than purely economic stressors. These findings may be important because they highlight the experiences of workers more likely to be exposed to the pandemic and affected by COVID-related policies. Should the results generalize to other samples and jobs, this study offers potentially new research directions for understanding relationships between macro stressors and new hire perceptions and socialization. It also offers practical implications by helping organizations understand the importance of explicitly managing job insecurity, particularly in terms of COVID-19 policy.

BACKGROUND Arterial revascularization is a mainstay in patients with CLI. Previous diagnostic angiography is a crucial step that can be affected by CM injection discomfort compromising the revascularization results, and it could vary related to the CM agents. METHODS One hundred forty-eight patients received Iodixanol 270 mg iodine pro ml or Ioversol 320 mg iodine pro ml in a prospective, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial. Injection-associated discomfort was assessed by Visual Analogic Scale (VAS). Diagnostic efficacy and safety up to 1 week were evaluated. RESULTS The incidence of pain has been around 50% of the all population in study, with lesser incidence of pain (25.7% vs 74.3%; P < 0.0001) and of heat sensation (55.4% vs 85.1%; P < 0.0001), after Iodixanol than after Ioversol injection. Discomfort mean score, according to VAS assessment, was less in the Iodixanol group (8.1  15.3) than in the Ioversol group (36.0  29.7), after first injection (P < 0.001) and for all injections (P < 0.001). A significant difference was also observed in favor of Iodixanol (P < 0.001), respect to mean score of discomfort and heat sensation, assessed by the operators after all the CM injections. CONCLUSIONS Iodixanol caused less frequent and severe discomfort, characterized as pain and heat during intra-arterial administration compared with Ioversol. The pain severity is tightly related to image and diagnosis quality with an impact on the patients for additional injections and larger CM volumes.","output":"Discomfort assessment in peripheral angiography: randomized clinical trial of Iodixanol 270 versus Ioversol 320 in diabetics with critical limb ischemia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dysregulation of both the innate and adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2 have an impact on the course of COVID-19, and play a role in the clinical outcome of the disease.

In COVID-19 patients who required hospitalization we analyzed T cell subsets, including Treg cells, as well as TCR&#945;/? and ?3/?, NK cells, and B cells, during the first two weeks after admission to hospital due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, with marked reductions in leukocytes subpopulations, especially in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

Cognitive-communication disabilities may prevent individuals with TBI from accessing the opportunities for social connection afforded by computer-mediated communication, as individuals with TBI report lower overall usage of social media than noninjured peers and substantial challenges with accessibility and usability. Although adaptations for individuals with motor and sensory impairments exist to support social media use, there have been no parallel advances to support individuals with cognitive disabilities, such as those exhibited by some people with TBI. In this study, we take a preliminary step in the development process by learning more about patterns of social media use in individuals with TBI as well as their input and priorities for developing social media adaptations. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to characterize how and why adults with TBI use social media and computer-mediated communication platforms, to evaluate changes in computer-mediated communication after brain injury, and to elicit suggestions from individuals with TBI to improve access to social media after injury. METHODS: We conducted a web-based survey of 53 individuals with a chronic history of moderate-to-severe TBI and a demographically matched group of 51 noninjured comparison peers. RESULTS: More than 90% of participants in both groups had an account on at least one computer-mediated communication platform, with Facebook and Facebook Messenger being the most popular platforms in both groups. Participants with and without a history of TBI reported that they use Facebook more passively than actively and reported that they most frequently maintain web-based relationships with close friends and family members. However, participants with TBI reported less frequently than noninjured comparison participants that they use synchronous videoconferencing platforms, are connected with acquaintances on the web, or use social media as a gateway for offline social connection (eg, to find events). Of the participants with TBI, 23% (12/53) reported a change in their patterns of social media use caused by brain injury and listed concerns about accessibility, safety, and usability as major barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Although individuals with TBI maintain social media accounts to the same extent as healthy comparisons, some may not use them in a way that promotes social connection. Thus, it is important to design social media adaptations that address the needs and priorities of individuals with TBI, so they can also reap the benefits of social connectedness offered by these platforms. By considering computer-mediated communication as part of individuals broader social health, we may be able to increase web-based participation in a way that is meaningful, positive, and beneficial to broader social life.","output":"Computer-Mediated Communication in Adults With and Without Moderate-to-Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Survey of Social Media Use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the early days of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China, Saudi Arabia started to implement several preventative measures starting with the imposition of travel restrictions to and from China.

These non-pharmaceutical interventions aim to reduce the extent of the epidemic due to the implications of international travel and mass gatherings on the increase in the number of new cases locally and globally.

The predictions are based on the susceptible-infectious-recovered/removed (SIR) epidemic compartment model with a constant stationary ratio k=mu(t)/a(t) between the infection (a(t)) and recovery (mu(t)) rate. The fixed early doubling time then uniquely relates the initial infection rate a0 to the ratio k, which therefore determines the full temporal evolution of the omicron waves. For each country three scenarios (optimistic, pessimistic, intermediate) are considered and the resulting pandemic parameters are calculated. These include the total number of infected persons, the maximum rate of new infections, the peak time and the maximum 7-day incidence per 100000 persons. Among the considered European countries Denmark has the smallest omicron peak time and the recently observed saturation of the 7-day incidence value at 2478 is in excellent agreement with the prediction in the optimistic scenario. For Germany we predict peak times of the omicron wave ranging from 32 to 38 and 45 days after the start of the omicron wave in the optimistic, intermediate and pessimistic scenario, respectively, with corresponding maximum SDI values of 7090, 13263 and 28911, respectively. Adopting Jan 1st, 2022 as the starting date our predictions implies that the maximum of the omicron wave is reached between Feb 1 and Feb 15, 2022. Rather similar values are predicted for Switzerland. Due to an order of magnitude smaller omicron hospitalization rate, due to the high percentage of vaccinated and boostered population, the German health system can cope with maximum omicron SDI value of 2800 which is about a factor 2.5 smaller than the maximum omicron SDI value 7090 in the optimistic case. By either reducing the duration of intensive care during this period of maximum, and/or by making use of the nonuniform spread of the omicron wave across Germany, it seems that the German health system can barely cope with the omicron wave avoiding triage decisions. The reduced omicron hospitalization rate also causes significantly smaller mortality rates compared to the earlier mutants in Germany. In the optimistic scenario one obtains for the total number of fatalities 7445 and for the maximum death rate 418 per day which are about one order of magnitude smaller than the beta fatality rate and total number.","output":"Forecast of omicron wave time evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) is an X-linked dominant rare disease that refers to the most common hereditary hypophosphatemia (HH) caused by mutations in the phosphate-regulating endopeptidase homolog X-linked gene (PHEX; OMIM: * 300550).

However, a J- or U-shaped curve in the association between diastolic BP and cardiovascular events has been observed in epidemiological studies, suggesting that both high diastolic BPs and diastolic BPs below a certain nadir are associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Despite the potential for confounding and reverse causation, this association may caution against overly intensive BP lowering in some hypertensive adults who also have a low baseline diastolic BP. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent post-hoc analyses of the landmark Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) appear to contradict these J-curve concerns, finding that the benefit of more intensive BP treatment did not differ based on baseline blood pressure. Similarly, sensitivity analyses of The Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive Patients (STEP) randomized controlled trial found that patients experienced similar benefits from an intensive BP goal, regardless of whether their diastolic BP was above or below 60 mm Hg. Finally, several Mendelian randomization analyses, which are less susceptible to confounding and reverse causation, demonstrated a clear linear relationship between diastolic BP and cardiovascular events. These studies indicate that a potential reduction in CVD risk is possible, irrespective of baseline diastolic BP values. SUMMARY: Sufficient recent evidence indicates that low diastolic BP is not causal of worse cardiovascular outcomes but rather represents confounding or reverse causation. Therefore, while low diastolic BP can be considered a marker of CVD risk, this risk is not expected to increase with further BP lowering when necessary to control concomitant elevations of systolic BP. Indeed, BP reduction in this setting appears beneficial.","output":"The Diastolic Blood Pressure J-Curve in Hypertension Management: Links and Risk for Cardiovascular Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to correlate the radiographic findings of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) positive children with their clinical and laboratory findings and discuss the frequency and necessity of chest computed tomography (CT) used for the radiological imaging in paediatric patients with COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-nine paediatric inpatient cases were retrospectively analysed using their clinical, laboratory and imaging features. The National Public Health Guide was used in the diagnosis and treatment of paediatric patients. COVID-19 infections for all patients were confirmed by the COVID-19 nucleic acid test using a pharyngeal swab. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 11 years [3-15]. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (40.6%) and cough (33.3%). When the laboratory findings of patients were examined, the median white blood cell (WBC) count was 5.8/mm3 (4.8-8.05/mm3 ), median lymphocyte count was 2.3/mm3 (1.7-3.55/mm3 ) and median C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 2.3/mm3 (1-2.1/mm3 ). All patients had chest radiographs (CRXs), while only 44.9% of the patients underwent a chest CT. The 8.7% of CXRs and 12.8% of chest CT findings were found as pathological. Ground-glass opacity was the most frequent finding. In the tomography group, the count of lymphocytes was lower, and creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were significantly higher. The patients with pathological tomography findings demonstrated no statistically significant difference in lymphocyte count and CK and LDH levels; however, their CRP value was significantly higher. CONCLUSION: In this study, it is emphasised that chest CT should be requested by considering the underlying diseases and severity of clinical findings in paediatric patients. In this way, unnecessary chest CT could be prevented in the paediatric population.","output":"Use of radiological tests in COVID-19 positive child cases: Is chest computed tomography necessary?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The literature on coronaviruses counts more than 300,000 publications.

Reactive results were confirmed using an alternate target region TMA assay. Reactive MPs were tested by TMA after serial dilution to estimate viral load. Testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and infectivity was performed. RESULTS: A total of 17,995 MPs corresponding to approximately 258,000 donations were tested for vRNA. Three confirmed reactive MP16 were identified. The estimated prevalence of vRNA reactive donations was 1.16/100,000 (95% CI 0.40, 3.42). The vRNA-reactive samples were non-reactive for antibody, and the estimated viral loads of the (presumed single) positive donations within each MP ranged from <1000 to <4000 copies/ml. When tested, no infectivity was observed in inoculated permissive cell cultures. DISCUSSION: Blood donation MP-nucleic acid testing (NAT) indicated that SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia is infrequent and, when detected, the vRNA was at low concentrations. Only one RNA-reactive MP could be tested for infectivity for operational reasons and was not infectious in cell culture.

The world has had to face an unprecedented pandemic. Only, Spanish flu had similar disastrous consequences. As a result, drastic measures (lockdown) have been adopted worldwide. Healthcare service has been overwhelmed by the extraordinary influx of patients, often requiring high intensity of care. Mortality has been associated with severe comorbidities, including chronic diseases. Patients with frailty were, therefore, the victim of the SARS-COV-2 infection. Allergy and asthma are the most prevalent chronic disorders in children and adolescents, so they need careful attention and, if necessary, an adaptation of their regular treatment plans. Fortunately, at present, young people are less suffering from COVID-19, both as incidence and severity. However, any age, including infancy, could be affected by the pandemic.Based on this background, the Italian Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology has felt it necessary to provide a Consensus Statement.

Individual heterogeneity at the host and pathogen level is increasingly documented to influence transmission of endemic diseases and it is well understood that the final stages of elimination strategies for vaccine-preventable childhood diseases (e.g., polio, measles) are subject to stochasticity. Even so it appears IBMs for both these phenomena are not well established. We review a decade of IBM publications aiming to obtain insights in their advantages, pitfalls and rationale for use and to make recommendations facilitating knowledge transfer within and across disciplines. METHODS: We systematically identified publications in Web of Science and PubMed from 2006-2015 based on title/abstract/keywords screening (and full-text if necessary) to retrieve topics, modeling purposes and general specifications. We extracted detailed modeling features from papers on established vaccine-preventable childhood diseases based on full-text screening. RESULTS: We identified 698 papers, which applied an IBM for infectious disease transmission, and listed these in a reference database, describing their general characteristics. The diversity of disease-topics and overall publication frequency have increased over time (38 to 115 annual publications from 2006 to 2015). The inclusion of intervention strategies (8 to 52) and economic consequences (1 to 20) are increasing, to the detriment of purely theoretical explorations. Unfortunately, terminology used to describe IBMs is inconsistent and ambiguous. We retrieved 24 studies on a vaccine-preventable childhood disease (covering 7 different diseases), with publication frequency increasing from the first such study published in 2008. IBMs have been useful to explore heterogeneous between- and within-host interactions, but combined applications are still sparse. The amount of missing information on model characteristics and study design is remarkable. CONCLUSIONS: IBMs are suited to combine heterogeneous within- and between-host interactions, which offers many opportunities, especially to analyze targeted interventions for endemic infections. We advocate the exchange of (open-source) platforms and stress the need for consistent branding. Using (existing) conventions and reporting protocols would stimulate cross-fertilization between research groups and fields, and ultimately policy making in decades to come.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the CE-approved eazyplex? SARS-CoV-2, a ready-to-use real time RT-LAMP assay for identification of the SARS-CoV-2a?N and ORF8 genes from swabs in less than 30a?min without RNA extraction. STUDY DESIGN: Oropharyngeal and nasal swabs from 100 positive and 50 negative patients were inoculated into 0.9 % saline and tested by NeuMoDx&#8482; RT-PCR. An aliquot was diluted fivefold in Copan sputum liquefying (SL) solution and directly analyzed by eazyplex? SARS-CoV-2. In addition, 130 patient swabs were prospectively tested with both methods in parallel. Analytical sensitivity of the assay was determined using virus stock dilutions. RESULTS: Positive percent agreement (PPA) between the eazyplex? SARS-CoV-2 and RT-PCR was 74 % for samples with Ct values < 35. When using a Ct cut-off &#8804; 28 the PPA increased to 97.4 %. In the prospective part of the study overall PPA of the eazyplex? kit was 66.7 % but increased to 100 % when only Ct values &#8804; 28 were considered. There were no false positive results. The median time to positivity was 12.5a?min for the N gene and 16.75a?min for ORF8. Analytical sensitivity was 3.75 TCID50/mL. 105 virus copies/mL were reproducibly detected.

Although conventional vaccines are available, their protective efficacy is type or strain specific, and their production is time-consuming. For the control of an influenza pandemic in particular, agents that are immediately effective against a wide range of virus variants should be developed. Although pretreatment of various Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands have already been reported to be effective in the defense against subsequent IAV infection, the efficacy was limited to specific subtypes, and safety concerns were also raised. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of an attenuated bacterial outer membrane vesicle -harboring modified lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharide (fmOMV) against IAV infection and the underlying mechanisms. Administration of fmOMV conferred significant protection against a lethal dose of pandemic H1N1, PR8, H5N2, and highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses; this broad antiviral activity was dependent on macrophages but independent of neutrophils. fmOMV induced recruitment and activation of macrophages and elicited type I IFNs. Intriguingly, fmOMV showed a more significant protective effect than other TLR ligands tested in previous reports, without exhibiting any adverse effect.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in a university affiliated tertiary medical center. Included were patients scheduled for an appointment in the in-vitro fertilization (IVF) unit between March 18th and April 15th. A comparison was made between patients who chose telemedicine as opposed to face-to-face meetings. Additionally, the population of patients who chose to cancel their appointment was characterized. IVF cycle outcomes were additionally compared between the groups. RESULTS: Overall, 90 IVF clinic appointments were scheduled during the study period. Thirty-four (37.8 %) patients chose to arrive to the clinic in spite of the COVID 19 pandemic and partial quarantine, 27 (30.0 %) patients chose to avoid in person meeting and scheduled a telemedicine appointment and 29 (32.2 %) patients cancelled their appointment. On comparison between patients who chose telemedicine vs. face-to-face meeting, the telemedicine group had lower prevalence of primary infertility (20.0 % vs. 47.1 %, p = 0.037) and higher rates of preimplantation genetic testing indication for in-vitro fertilization (48.2 % vs. 20.6 %, p = 0.026). Rate of a first-ever clinic visit was higher in patients that arrived for a face-to-face meeting, as compared to telemedicine encounter (55.9 % vs. 28.0 %, respectively; p = 0.036). Patients that opted to avoid attending the clinic or meeting via telemedicine had higher rates of medical comorbidities compared to patients who chose to attend their appointment (51.7 % vs. 29.5 %, p = 0.016).

The aim of this project was to establish the core outcome measures for these domains for trials in coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Three online consensus workshops were convened to establish outcome measures for the four core domains of respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, shortness of breath, and recovery. SETTING: International. PATIENTS: About 130 participants (patients, public, and health professionals) from 17 countries attended the three workshops. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Respiratory failure, assessed by the need for respiratory support based on the World Health Organization Clinical Progression Scale, was considered pragmatic, objective, and with broad applicability to various clinical scenarios. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment was recommended for multiple organ failure, because it was routinely used in trials and clinical care, well validated, and feasible. The Modified Medical Research Council measure for shortness of breath, with minor adaptations (recall period of 24 hr to capture daily fluctuations and inclusion of activities to ensure relevance and to capture the extreme severity of shortness of breath in people with coronavirus disease 2019), was regarded as fit for purpose for this indication. The recovery measure was developed de novo and defined as the absence of symptoms, resumption of usual daily activities, and return to the previous state of health prior to the illness, using a 5-point Likert scale, and was endorsed.

METHODS The prospective data of 221 patients (183 women, 38 men) who underwent thyroid operation with intraoperative neuromonitoring for exploration of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve were evaluated retrospectively. The surface endotracheal tube-based Medtronic NIM3 (Medtronic, Jacksonville, FL) intraoperative neuromonitoring device was used. The function of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve was evaluated by cricothyroid muscle twitch. Additionally, the contribution of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve to vocal cord adduction was evaluated using electromyographic records. RESULTS A total of 374 (95.2%) of 393 external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves were identified; 145 (36.9%) external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves were identified visually before being stimulated with a probe, and 130 (33.1%) external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves were identified visually after being identified with a probe. Although 99 (25.2%) external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves were identified with a probe, they were not visualized. Intraoperative neuromonitoring provided meaningful contributions to visual (P = .001) and functional (P = .001) identification of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. Positive electromyographic responses were recorded from 257 external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves (68.7%).

We defined contact tracing effectiveness as the proportion of contacts of a positive case that was successfully traced and the vaccination rate as the proportion of daily doses administered per population in Malaysia. Sensitivity analyses on the untraced and infectious populations were conducted. RESULTS: At a vaccination rate of 1.4%, contact tracing with an effectiveness of 70% could delay the peak of untraced asymptomatic cases by 17 d and reduce it by 70% compared with 30% contact tracing effectiveness. A similar trend was observed for symptomatic cases when a similar experiment setting was used. We also performed sensitivity analyses by using different combinations of contact tracing effectiveness and vaccination rates. In all scenarios, the effect of contact tracing on COVID-19 incidence persisted for both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. CONCLUSIONS: While vaccines are progressively rolled out, efficient contact tracing must be rapidly implemented concurrently to reach, find, test, isolate and support the affected populations to bring COVID-19 under control.","output":"Vaccines alone are no silver bullets: a modeling study on the impact of efficient contact tracing on COVID-19 infection and transmission in Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the relaxation of the containment measurements around the globe, monitoring the social distancing in crowded public places is of grate importance to prevent a new massive wave of COVID-19 infections.

Based on data collected in February 2021, we present an analysis of the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures in three counties in Kenya. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional phone-based survey in three counties in Kenya to assess the level of disruption across seven domains: income, food insecurity, schooling, domestic tension/violence, communal violence, mental health, and decision-making. An overall disruption index was computed from the seven domains using principal component analysis. We used a linear regression model to examine the determinants of vulnerability to disruptions as measured by the index. We used concentration curves and indices to assess inequality in the disruption domains and the overall disruption index. Results: The level of disruption in income was the highest (74%), while the level of disruption for domestic tension/violence was the lowest (30%). Factors associated with increased vulnerability to the overall disruption index included: older age, being married, belonging in the lowest socio-economic tertile and receiving COVID-19 related assistance. The concentration curves showed that all the seven domains of disruption were disproportionately concentrated among households in the lowest socio-economic tertile, a finding that was supported by the concentration index of the overall disruption index (CI = - 0.022;p = 0.074). Conclusion: The COVID-19 mitigation measures resulted in unintended socio-economic effects that unfairly affected certain vulnerable groups such as those in the lowest socio-economic group and the elderly.

There is an increasing number of cases described as (meningo)encephalitis although evidence often lacks. Anosmia, another atypical form of COVID-19, has been considered as testimony of the potential of neuroinvasiveness of SARS-CoV-2, though this hypothesis remains highly speculative. We did a review of the cases reported as brain injury caused by SARS-CoV-2. Over 98 papers found, 21 were analyzed. Only four publications provided evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 within the central nervous system (CNS). When facing acute neurological abnormalities during an infectious episode it is often difficult to disentangle neurological symptoms induced by the brain infection and those due to the impact of host immune response on the CNS. Cytokines release can disturb neural cells functioning and can have in the most severe cases vascular and cytotoxic effects. An inappropriate immune response can lead to the production of auto-antibodies directed toward CNS components. In the case of proven SARS-CoV-2 brain invasion, the main hypothesis found in the literature focus on a neural pathway, especially the direct route via the nasal cavity, although the virus is likely to reach the CNS using other routes. Our ability to come up with hypotheses about the mechanisms by which the virus might interact with the CNS may help to keep in mind that all neurological symptoms observed during COVID-19 do not always rely on CNS viral invasion.","output":"Encephalitic syndrome and anosmia in COVID-19: Do these clinical presentations really reflect SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism?

On the 14th October England introduced a three-tier system of regional restrictions in an attempt to control the epidemic. This lasted until the 5th November when a new national lockdown was imposed. Tier 1 was the least and tier 3 the most restrictive tiers. We used publicly available data of daily cases by local authority (local government areas) and estimated the reproductive rate (R value) of the epidemic over the previous 14 days at various time points after the imposition of the tier system or where local authorities were moved into higher tiers at time points after reallocation. At day 0 there vas very little difference in the R value between authorities in the different groups but by day 14 the R value in tier 3 authorities had fallen to about 0.9, in tier 2 to about 1.0 and in tier 1 the R value was about 1.5. The restrictions in tier 1 had little impact on transmission and allowed exponential growth in the large majority of authorities. By contrast the epidemic was declining in most tier 3 authorities. In tier 2, exponential growth was being seen in about half of authorities but declining in half. We concluded that the existing three tier system would have been sufficient to control the epidemic if all authorities had been moved out of tier 1 into tier 2 and there had been more rapid identification and transfer of those authorities where the epidemic was increasing out of tier 2 into tier 3.

However, it is not known whether nsp10 functions in the regulation of CoV replication fidelity. To test this, we engineered single and double alanine substitution mutations into the genome of murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) containing ExoN activity [ExoN(+)] at positions within nsp10 known to disrupt the nsp10-nsp14 interaction in vitro. We show that an nsp10 mutant, R80A/E82A-ExoN(+), was five to ten times more sensitive to treatment with the RNA mutagen 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) than wild-type (WT)-ExoN(+), suggestive of decreased replication fidelity.

No change in 5-FU sensitivity was observed for R80A/E82A-ExoN(-) relative to MHV-ExoN(-), indicating that the decreased-fidelity phenotype of R80A/E82A-ExoN(-) is linked to the presence of ExoN activity. Our results demonstrate that nsp10 is important for CoV replication fidelity and support the hypothesis that nsp10 functions to regulate nsp14-ExoN activity during virus replication. IMPORTANCE The adaptive capacity of CoVs, as well as all other RNA viruses, is partially attributed to the presence of extensive population genetic diversity. However, decreased fidelity is detrimental to CoV replication and virulence; mutant CoVs with decreased replication fidelity are attenuated and more sensitive to inhibition by RNA mutagens. Thus, identifying the viral protein determinants of CoV fidelity is important for understanding CoV replication, pathogenesis, and virulence. In this report, we show that nsp10, a small, nonenzymatic viral protein, contributes to CoV replication fidelity. Our data support the hypothesis that CoVs have evolved multiple proteins, in addition to nsp14-ExoN, that are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the largest known RNA genomes.","output":"Mutations in coronavirus nonstructural protein 10 decrease virus replication fidelity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The December 2019 outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China was rapidly linked to a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV.

Our findings revealed that the disulfides mainly interacted with HIS41, MET49, CYS145, HIS64, MET165, and GLN189 residues of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The binding free energy decomposition results also showed that the van der Waals (vdW) energy plays the main role in the interaction of HIS41, MET49, CYS145, HIS64, MET165, and GLN189 residues with the inhibitors. Furthermore, it is found that the Z-isomer derivatives have a stronger interaction with SARS-CoV-2, and the strongest interaction belongs to the (Z)-1-(1-(methylthio)propyl)-2-(prop-1-enyl)disulfane (G = ?18.672kcal/mol).

It is confirmed that this virus has taken over 126,607 lives until today. Since the beginning of its spreading, many Artificial Intelligence researchers developed systems and methods for predicting the virus's behavior or detecting the infection. One of the possible ways of determining the patient infection to COVID-19 is through analyzing the chest X-ray images. As there are a large number of patients in hospitals, it would be time-consuming and difficult to examine lots of X-ray images, so it can be very useful to develop an AI network that does this job automatically. In this paper, we have trained several deep convolutional networks with the introduced training techniques for classifying X-ray images into three classes: normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19, based on two open-source datasets. Unfortunately, most of the previous works on this subject have not shared their dataset, and we had to deal with few data on covid19 cases. Our data contains 180 X-ray images that belong to persons infected to COVID-19, so we tried to apply methods to achieve the best possible results. In this research, we introduce some training techniques that help the network learn better when we have few cases of COVID-19, and also we propose a neural network that is a concatenation of Xception and ResNet50V2 networks. This network achieved the best accuracy by utilizing multiple features extracted by two robust networks.

However, the specific role of striatal GABAergic neuronal activity in the promotion of neurological recovery after ischemic stroke remains unknown. Here, we used optogenetic approach to investigate these effects and mechanism. METHODS Laser stimulation was delivered via an implanted optical fiber to inhibit or activate the striatal GABAergic neurons in Gad2-Arch-GFP or Gad2-ChR2-tdTomato mice (n=80) 1 week after 60-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Neurological severity score, brain atrophy volume, microvessel density, and cell morphological changes were examined using immunohistochemistry. Gene expression and protein levels of related growth factors were further examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. RESULTS Inhibiting striatal GABAergic neuronal activity improved functional recovery, reduced brain atrophy volume, and prohibited cell death compared with the control (P<0.05). Microvessel density and bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor) expression in the inhibition group were also increased (P<0.05). In contrast, activation of striatal GABAergic neurons resulted in adverse effects compared with the control (P<0.05). Using cocultures of GABAergic neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells, we further demonstrated that the photoinhibition of GABAergic neuronal activity could upregulate bFGF expression in endothelial cells, depending on the presence of astrocytes. The conditioned medium from the aforementioned photoinhibited 3-cell coculture system protected cells from oxygen glucose deprivation injury. CONCLUSIONS After ischemic stroke, optogenetic inhibition of GABAergic neurons upregulated bFGF expression by endothelial cells and promoted neurobehavioral recovery, possibly orchestrated by astrocytes.

In order to cope with the requirements of COVID-19 pandemic and prevent overwhelming of the healthcare systems, during 2020 social distancing measures were proposed, and generalized lockdown. Aim of our study is to ascertain whether non-pharmaceutical intervention did have any impact on the epidemiology of Legionnaires disease (LD), a respiratory infectious disease without interhuman spreading. METHODS. Official national reports from 4 index countries in European Union (i.e. Germany, France, Italy, and Spain) were retrieved. The study included all cases notified during 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, versus the cases referred during the same period in 2019. Subgroup analyses for hospital-associated and travel-associated LD cases, as well as for lethality estimates were performed. RESULTS. A sustained drop for incidence rate was confirmed, at EU-level (3.5 per 100,000 vs. 5.3 per 100,000) as well as in the national estimates. The decrease was particularly evident in Italy (RR 0.880, 95%CI 0.839 to 0.905), despite a transient surge in notification rates during the month of June, 2020. Subgroup analyses demonstrated a fall in travel-associated cases (-66.8% at EU level), while hospital-associated cases decreased in absolute number when compared to 2019, but where substantially stable in terms when compared to EU estimates. While Case Fatality Ratio increased in comparison with 2019, no significant trend was similarly identified in comparison to EU estimates. CONCLUSIONS. Lockdown measures have impacted on the epidemiology of LD in Europe during 2020, but some heterogeneities were identified both across the assessed countries, and the various subgroup. Even though the absolute number of total cases did substantially decrease in 2020 compared to 2019, the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions was mostly indirect, through a reduced interaction of individuals with environments at potentially high-risk for human infections (e.g. hospitals, accommodation sites, etc.).

This paper illustrates how to derive the principal scores from a weighted Principal Component Analysis using publicly available data. We show the detectable impact of interventions on the state of the epidemic and suggest that there is a single dominant trend observable through the principal score, but this is different across nations and waves. For example, the epidemic status can be tracked by cases in Scotland at a countrywide scale, whereas across waves and disjoint nations, hospitalisations are the dominant contributor to principal scores.

The aim of our study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 on Trauma and Orthopaedic trainees nationally. METHODS: Trauma and Orthopaedic (T&O) specialty trainees nationally were asked to complete an electronic survey specifically on the impact of COVID-19 on their training. This UK based survey was conducted between May 2020 and July 2020. RESULTS: A total of 185 out of 975 (19%) T&O specialty trainees completed the survey. Redeployment was experienced by 25% of trainees. 84% of respondents had experienced a fall in total operating numbers in comparison with the same time period in 2019. 89% experienced a fall in elective operating and 63% experienced a fall in trauma operating. The pandemic has also had an effect on the delivery of teaching, with face to face teaching being replaced by webinar-based teaching. 63% of training programmes delivered regular weekly teaching, whilst 19% provided infrequent sessions and 11% provided no teaching.

It is believed that fluid dynamic and thermodynamic behavior differ significantly at these scales from the bulk. From a materials perspective, it is important to be able to create complex structures at the nanometer scale, reproducibly, so that the fluid behavior may be studied. New advances in nanoscale-resolution 3D-printing offer opportunities to achieve this goal. In particular, additive manufacturing with two-photon polymerization allows creation of intricate structures. Using this technology, a creation of the first nano-3D-printed digital (shale) rock is reported. In this paper, focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) nano-tomography image dataset was used to reconstruct a high-resolution digital rock 3D model of a Marcellus Shale rock sample. Porosity of this 3D model has been characterized and its connected/effective pore system has been extracted and nano-3D-printed.

The role of corticosteroids (CS) treatment in these patients is still controversial. Some studies evidenced a possible role of an early short-term course of CS treatment in the treatment of severe pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective study considering the patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to our hospital between 9th March and 15th June 2020. Two groups were considered: early high-dose of methyl-prednisolone (eHDM; n a= a31) and the control group (n a= a52). Patients in the eHDM group received the dose of 5-8 amg/kg/day of methyl-prednisolone for 2 consecutive days. Primary outcome was the mortality evaluation; secondary outcomes were clinical improvement, side-effects and laboratory/radiographic changes. RESULTS: Significant differences between the two groups were: length of hospitalization (21.5 vs 28.4 days, p a= a0.026), length of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or mechanical ventilation (11.5 vs 14.5 days, p a= a0.031), death (5 vs 12, p a= a0.006) and clinical improvement (16 vs 11, p=0.018). The following factors were related to in-hospital mortality in the multivariate analysis: comorbidities (OR a= a2.919; 95%CI a= a1.515-16.705; p<0.001), days from the onset of symptoms and the hospital admission (OR a= a1.404; 95%CI a= a1.069-12.492; p a= a0.011), PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio (OR a= a3.111; 95%CI a= a2.334-16.991; p a= a0.009) and eHDM treatment (OR a= a0.741; 95%CI a= a0.129-0.917; p a= a0.007). CONCLUSION: The eHDM is an interesting and promising approach in the ARDS related to COVID-19 pneumonia, which reduces mortality, length of hospitalization and the need for mechanical ventilation.","output":"Role of the early short-course corticosteroids treatment in ARDS caused by COVID-19: A single-center, retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Information about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in HIV-infected individuals is scarce. In this prospective study, we included HIV (human immunodefeciency virus)-infected individuals (people living with HIV [PLWHIV]) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared them with PLWHIV negative for SARS-CoV-2. We compared 55 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with 69 asymptomatic PLWHIV negative for SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and/or serology. There was no significant difference between SARS-CoV-2 positive or negative patients for age distribution, gender, time with HIV infection, nadir CD4-cell counts, type and number of co-morbidities, current CD4 and CD8 counts and type of anti-HIV therapy. Positive patients presented with a median of three symptoms (interquartile range, 1-3). Most common symptoms were fever (76%), dyspnea (35%), anosmia (29%) non-productive cough (27%), fatigue 22%), and ageusia (20%). Ten patients (18%) were completely asymptomatic. Four (7.2%) subjects died of coronavirus disease 2019. Factors significantly (P < .05) associated with death included age and number of co-morbidities, while time from HIV infection and lower current CD4 counts were significant only in univariate analysis.

However, practical guidance for their routine use in CLD patients undergoing specific invasive procedures is lacking. Methods: These practice guidelines were developed by the Initiative Group for Central European Hepatologic Collaboration (CEHC), composed of nine hepatologist/gastroenterologist experts from Central Europe. Using an adapted Delphi process, the CEHC group selected ten invasive procedures most relevant to the hepatology/gastroenterology setting in the region. Consensus recommendations for each invasive procedure are reported as a final percentage of expert panel responses. Results: A consensus was agreed that TPO-RAs should be considered for raising platelet count in CLD patients undergoing scheduled abdominal surgery, high-bleeding risk dentistry, endoscopic polypectomy, endoscopic variceal ligation, liver biopsy, liver surgery, liver transplantation and percutaneous ablation, but it was also agreed that they are less beneficial or not necessary for endoscopy without intervention and paracentesis. Conclusions: Using a modified Delphi method, experts reached an agreement for TCP management in CLD patients undergoing ten invasive procedures.

OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence regarding humoral response to COVID-19 inactivated virus vaccination among pwMS on disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). METHODS: A cohort study was carried out in Isfahan, Iran, enrolling DMT-exposed pwMS and unexposed (UX) healthy participants. Post-vaccination anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike IgG serology testing was carried out among the participants and compared between participants based on their DMT exposure, using proper statistical tests. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to control for confounding. Association between the second vaccine dose-to-phlebotomy (vac2phleb) and the humoral response was investigated in each DMT-exposed cohort, using linear regression. Among the aCD20 cohort, the association of the last aCD20 infusion-to-first vaccine dose period with serostatus was investigated using an unpaired t-test. RESULTS: After enrolling 358 participants (144 pwMS and 214 healthy), blunted humoral responses were only observed in fingolimod (Log(10) mean diff. [SE]: 0.72 [0.18], P = 0.001) and aCD20 (Log(10) mean diff. [SE]: 0.75 [0.15], P < 0.001) cohorts compared to the UX cohort. Multivariable analysis confirmed the results. The study did not achieve enough statistical power to detect a significant association between the vac2phleb period and humoral responses. The last aCD20 infusion to first vaccination dose period was longer in the seroconverted pwMS on aCD20 (mean diff. [SE]: 8.43 weeks [2.57], P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: The results of this study mirrored the results of previous studies among mRNA- or viral vector-vaccinated pwMS on DMTs. Therefore, it can be concluded that mode of action contributes less than timing, to the efficiency of vaccination strategies among pwMS on DMTs C especially the ones on S1PR modulators and aCD20. Meanwhile, the mentioned pwMS should be advised to receive early boosters and remain vigilant until further data becomes available and more efficient vaccination strategies are crafted.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 serology among people with multiple sclerosis on disease-modifying therapies after BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm) inactivated virus vaccination: same story, different vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An extensive review of new resources to support the provision of evidence-based care for women and infants.

This review has identified several potential DDIs that could occur with the concomitant treatments of COVID-19 repurposed drugs and lung cancer medications. This information may be utilized by the healthcare professionals for screening and identifying potential DDIs with adverse outcomes, based on their severity and documentation levels and consequently design prophylactic and management strategies for their prevention.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been compared to the 2003 SARS outbreak;health care workers (HCWs) during that crisis experienced increased levels of emotional distress. As of March 2021, there have been over 830,000 cases of COVID-19 and 24,000 mortalities in New Jersey (NJ). Our study aimed to identify the point prevalence of PTSD and sub-threshold PTSD in HCWs across NJ during the second wave of the pandemic. Methods: We conducted a prospective survey study that was distributed electronically to physicians (attendings, fellows, and residents) and mid-level practitioners (MLPs) working in emergency departments across NJ from December 2020 C March 2021 using a secure, online survey platform. Results: All collected participant demographics are shown by training level in Table 1. There are several provisional diagnostic determinations of PTSD currently in use (Table 2). For continuous total severity score, the mean score and standard deviation (SD) for attending physicians was 13.9 (12.6), for resident/fellow physicians it was 15.4 (18.2), and for MLPs it was 20.4 (14.9), causing a statistically significant difference between the groups (p=0.01). Following the DSM-5 criteria, a total of 27 individuals were diagnosed with PTSD, where a significantly high proportion of those were MLPs (n (%) = 20 (25);p=0.02). DSM-5 criteria B-E (Table 2) is used to evaluate subthreshold PTSD. Regardless of whether two or three criteria were used for diagnosis, the proportion met was greatest for the MLPs, with criterion D being significantly associated with training level (p=0.01). Discussion: Physician burnout is well documented in the U.S. Current second-year emergency medicine residents had the highest contiguous severity score, most likely because their intern year was completely consumed by the COVID-19 crisis. The pandemic put a dent in the movement for physician wellness. Attending physicians in teaching hospitals are responsible for, in addition to patient care, the training of residents. The burden of navigating a mentorship role while managing the high volume of critical ill patients suffering from a novel disease can't be ignored. MLPs, along with their physician colleagues, experienced shortages in PPE, redeployment into other subspecialists, furlough and/or termination from their positions, and COVID morbidity. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant psychological trauma for HCWs. Regardless of training level, physicians and mid-level practitioners report symptoms suggestive of PTSD and sub-PTSD. MLPs were particularly affected by the trauma of the novel coronavirus and more research must be done to fully elucidate why this particular group of providers has been so negatively impacted.

These parameters are used to improve the performance of machine-learning-based prediction models for football matches played after the COVID-19 break. The study describes the statistical analysis on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on football match results in terms of the expected score and goal difference. It also shows that estimated parameters from the proposed model reflect the changed home advantage. Finally, the study verifies that these parameters, when included as additional features, enhance the performance of various football match prediction models.

The study aimed to clarify and provide a stronger foundation for the definition of sleep disturbance in the context of HIV to enhance the concepts development. Following Beth Rodgers concept analysis guidelines, two leading databases were searched, and 73 articles were used for this concept analysis. The attributes, surrogate terms, antecedents, and consequences of sleep disturbance have been identified using thematic analysis. In this analysis, two main attributes of sleep disturbance in the context of HIV were identified: a) subjective measures, including reduced total sleep time, difficulty falling asleep, nighttime and early morning awakenings, feeling sleepy and poorly rested after a nights sleep, frequent arousals, and irritability, and b) objective measures, including changes in sleep architecture and sleep continuity. Five antecedents of sleep disturbance in the context of HIV were identified. Meanwhile, the consequences of sleep disturbance in HIV are listed based on the frequency the points occur within the reviewed articles. The list is as follows: fatigue and pain; reduced neurocognitive functions; reduced health outcome and quality of life; poor anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy adherence; daytime sleepiness; depression, anxiety, and maladaptive coping; increased disease progression and cardiovascular mortality; and social phobia, living arrangement and sexual dysfunction.

However, growing human populations (particularly in mega-cities), urbanisation and socio-economic disparity threaten opportunities for people to engage and connect directly with ocean environments. Thus, a major challenge in engaging the whole of society in achieving ocean sustainability by 2030 is to develop strategies to improve societal connections to the ocean. The concept of ocean literacy reflects public understanding of the ocean, but is also an indication of connections to, and attitudes and behaviours towards, the ocean. Improving and progressing global ocean literacy has potential to catalyse the behaviour changes necessary for achieving a sustainable future. As part of the Future Seas project (https://futureseas2030.org/), this paper aims to synthesise knowledge and perspectives on ocean literacy from a range of disciplines, including but not exclusive to marine biology, socio-ecology, philosophy, technology, psychology, oceanography and human health. Using examples from the literature, we outline the potential for positive change towards a sustainable future based on knowledge that already exists. We focus on four drivers that can influence and improve ocean literacy and societal connections to the ocean: (1) education, (2) cultural connections, (3) technological developments, and (4) knowledge exchange and science-policy interconnections. We explore how each driver plays a role in improving perceptions of the ocean to engender more widespread societal support for effective ocean management and conservation. In doing so, we develop an ocean literacy toolkit, a practical resource for enhancing ocean connections across a broad range of contexts worldwide.

MAIN MEASURES: We assessed prevalence and perpetrators of racial and ethnic discrimination using the General Ethnic Discrimination Scale. We included an open-ended question asking respondents to recount experiences of discrimination and analyzed responses using grounded theory. KEY RESULTS: Of the 997 participants, 12.2% were females from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine (URM), 4.0% URM males, 10.1% Asian females, 4.7% Asian males, 49.1% non-Hispanic White females, and 19.8% non-Hispanic White males. Among healthcare workers of color, 85.2% reported discrimination. Over half of URM females (51.4%), URM males (52.6%), and Asian females (62.5%) reported discrimination by patients. About 20C25% of URM females, URM males, and Asian females reported discrimination by teachers, supervisors, co-workers, and institutions. In adjusted binary logistic models, URM females had 10.14 odds (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 5.13, 20.02, p<.001), URM males 6.23 odds (95%CI: 2.59, 14.98, p<.001), Asian females 7.90 odds (95%CI: 4.07, 15.33, p<.001), and Asian males 2.96 odds (95% CI: 1.47, 5.97, p=.002) of reporting discrimination compared with non-Hispanic White males. Needing more support was associated with 2.51 odds (95%CI: 1.54, 4.08, p<.001) of reporting discrimination. Our qualitative findings identified that the murder of George Floyd intensified URM healthcare workers experiences of discrimination through increased fear of violence and requests for unpaid diversity work.

Each submission was accompanied by a questionnaire requesting information pertaining to signalment, use, recent transportation, number of affected horses on the premise and presence of clinical signs at the time of sample collection. RESULTS The total number of horses testing qPCR-positive for ECoV in feces was 20 (7.2%), 4 of which also tested qPCR-positive for ECoV in nasal secretions. In the same population 9.0% of horses tested qPCR-positive for EHV-4, 6.1% for EIV, 4.3% for Streptococcus equi ss. equi, 3.2% for ERVs and 0.7% for EHV-1. Draft horses, pleasure use, multiple horses affected on a premise and lack of nasal discharge were significantly associated with ECoV qPCR-positive horses. INTERPRETATION The present study results showed that 7.2% of horses with acute onset of fever tested qPCR-positive for ECoV in feces, highlighting the importance of testing such horses for ECoV in feces. The various prevalence factors associated with ECoV qPCR-positive status likely relate to the high infectious nature of ECoV and breed-specific differences in management and husbandry practices. SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS ECoV infection should be suspected and tested for in horses presenting with acute onset of fever, lethargy and anorexia with no respiratory signs. A two-step approach should be consider in which respiratory secretions and feces should be collected from such horses and submitted to a diagnostic laboratory. If the respiratory secretions test negative by qPCR for a panel of respiratory pathogens, feces already submitted to the laboratory should be tested for ECoV.","output":"Frequency of molecular detection of equine coronavirus in faeces and nasal secretions in 277 horses with acute onset of fever."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Recently, patients with COVID-19 who showed persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results despite resolved clinical symptoms have attracted a lot of attention. We report the case of a patient with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), who achieved clinical recovery but showed persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results until Day 92 after disease onset. Case presentation: The patient is a 50-year-old man with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). He was quarantined for 105 days. Of these, inpatient quarantine lasted for 75 days. When the nucleic acid test results were negative for 3 consecutive days, the patient was discharged at Day 75 after disease onset. During this period, multiple samples were collected from the patients body surface, the surrounding environment, and physical surfaces, but none of these tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. These samples included those from anal swabs, hands, inner surface of mask, cell phone, bed rails, floor around the bed, and toilet bowl surface. However, nucleic acid retest results on Day 80 and Day 92 after disease onset were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. The patient continued with quarantine and observation at home. After the test results on Days 101 and 105 after disease onset were negative, quarantine was terminated at last. Conclusion: Per our knowledge, this is the longest known time that a patient has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. No symptoms were observed during follow-up. During hospitalization, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity was not observed in samples from the body surface and surrounding environment, and no verified transmission event occurred during the quarantine at home. After undergoing clinical recovery a minority of patients with COVID-19 have shown long-term positive results for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. This has provided new understanding and research directions for coronavirus infection. Long-term follow-up and quarantine measures have been employed for such patients. Further studies are required to analyze potential infectivity in such patients and determine whether more effective antiviral drugs or regimens to enable these patients to completely clear viral infection should be researched.","output":"Persistent SARS-COV-2 RNA positivity in a patient for 92 days after disease onset"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of an international, precompetitive, collaborative, ultraviolet (UV) research consortium is discussed as an opportunity to lay the groundwork for a new UV commercial industry and the supply chain to support this industry. History has demonstrated that consortia can offer promising approaches to solve many common, current industry challenges, such as the paucity of data regarding the doses of ultraviolet-C (UV-C, 200 nm to 280 nm) radiation necessary to achieve the desired reductions in healthcare pathogens and the ability of mobile disinfection devices to deliver adequate doses to the different types of surfaces in a whole-room environment. Standard methods for testing are only in the initial stages of development, making it difficult to choose a specific UV-C device for a healthcare application. Currently, the public interest in UV-C disinfection applications is elevated due to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes the respiratory coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). By channeling the expertise of different UV industry stakeholder sectors into a unified international consortium, innovation in UV measurements and data could be developed to support test methods and standards development for UV healthcare equipment. As discussed in this paper, several successful examples of consortia are applicable to the UV industry to help solve these types of common problems. It is anticipated that a consortium for the industry could lead to UV applications for disinfection becoming globally prolific and commonplace in residential, work, business, and school settings as well as in transportation (bus, rail, air, ship) environments. Aggressive elimination of infectious agents by UV-C technologies would also help to reduce the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.","output":"Models for an Ultraviolet-C Research and Development Consortium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To assess the effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection on the conjunctiva and tear film. METHODS Thirty-eight patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 31 healthy controls were included in this prospective and observational study. Individuals with COVID-19 formed the patient group, and healthy individuals formed the control group. Conjunctival impression cytology (CIC), TBUT, Schirmer II test, and ocular surface disease index were evaluated in all participants. RESULTS No significant difference was observed regarding the mean age and gender between the groups (P=0.786 and P=0.122, respectively). The mean TBUT and Schirmer II test results did not differ between the two groups (P=0.496 and P=0.447, respectively). The CIC results revealed decreased density and cell size of goblet cells and moderate to high enlargement, squamous changes, and increased nucleocytoplasmic ratio in nongoblet epithelial cells in the COVID-19 group compared with the control group. Based on the Nelson classification in CIC samples, 60.6% of the COVID-19 group and 19.4% of the control group had changes consistent with grade 2 or above. The presence of neutrophils in CIC was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (P<0.001), whereas the presence of lymphocyte was similar between the two groups (P=0.247).

We aimed to determine whether clinical phenotypes of patients with COVID-19 can be derived from clinical data, to assess the reproducibility of these phenotypes and correlation with prognosis, and to derive and validate a simplified probabilistic model for phenotype assignment. Phenotype identification was not primarily intended as a predictive tool for mortality. METHODS: In this study, we used data from two cohorts: the COVID-19@Spain cohort, a retrospective cohort including 4035 consecutive adult patients admitted to 127 hospitals in Spain with COVID-19 between Feb 2 and March 17, 2020, and the COVID-19@HULP cohort, including 2226 consecutive adult patients admitted to a teaching hospital in Madrid between Feb 25 and April 19, 2020. The COVID-19@Spain cohort was divided into a derivation cohort, comprising 2667 randomly selected patients, and an internal validation cohort, comprising the remaining 1368 patients. The COVID-19@HULP cohort was used as an external validation cohort. A probabilistic model for phenotype assignment was derived in the derivation cohort using multinomial logistic regression and validated in the internal validation cohort. The model was also applied to the external validation cohort. 30-day mortality and other prognostic variables were assessed in the derived phenotypes and in the phenotypes assigned by the probabilistic model. FINDINGS: Three distinct phenotypes were derived in the derivation cohort (n=2667)-phenotype A (516 [19%] patients), phenotype B (1955 [73%]) and phenotype C (196 [7%])-and reproduced in the internal validation cohort (n=1368)-phenotype A (233 [17%] patients), phenotype B (1019 [74%]), and phenotype C (116 [8%]). Patients with phenotype A were younger, were less frequently male, had mild viral symptoms, and had normal inflammatory parameters. Patients with phenotype B included more patients with obesity, lymphocytopenia, and moderately elevated inflammatory parameters. Patients with phenotype C included older patients with more comorbidities and even higher inflammatory parameters than phenotype B. We developed a simplified probabilistic model (validated in the internal validation cohort) for phenotype assignment, including 16 variables. In the derivation cohort, 30-day mortality rates were 25% (95% CI 14-43) for patients with phenotype A, 305% (285-326) for patients with phenotype B, and 607% (537-672) for patients with phenotype C (log-rank test p<00001). The predicted phenotypes in the internal validation cohort and external validation cohort showed similar mortality rates to the assigned phenotypes (internal validation cohort: 53% [95% CI 34-81] for phenotype A, 313% [285-342] for phenotype B, and 595% [488-693] for phenotype C; external validation cohort: 37% [20-64] for phenotype A, 237% [218-257] for phenotype B, and 514% [419-607] for phenotype C).

Serious games provide an underutilized tool to promote learning and innovation around global health crises. In order to explore the potential of Serious Games as a policy learning tool, Global Affairs Canada, in collaboration with the Department of National Defense and academic partners, developed and implemented a matrix game aimed at prompting critical reflection and gender-based analysis on infectious disease outbreak preparedness and response. This commentary, written by the core development team, reflects on the process and outcomes of the gaming exercise, which we believe will be of interest to others hoping to promote innovative thinking and learning around global health policy and crisis response, as well as the application of serious games more broadly. MAIN BODY: Participants reported, through discussions and a post-game survey, that they felt the game was reflective of real-world decision-making and priority-setting challenges during a crisis. They reflected on the challenges that emerge around global health co-operation and outbreak preparedness, particularly noting the importance of learning to work with private actors. While participants only sporadically applied gender-based analysis or considered the social determinants of health during the game, post-game discussions led to reflection on the ways in which equity concerns are put aside during a crisis scenario and on why this happens, offering critical learning opportunities. CONCLUSION: Matrix games provide opportunities for policy-makers and health professionals to experience the challenges of global health co-operation, test ideas and explore how biases, such as those around gender, influence policy-making and implementation.

In this pandemic context, cancer patients constitute a particularly fragile population that would benefit the best from such treatments, a present unmet need. TMPRSS2 is essential for COVID-19 replication cycle and it is under androgen control. Estrogen and androgen receptor dependent cues converge on TMPRSS2 regulation through different mechanisms of action that can be blocked by the use of hormonal therapies. We believe that there is enough body of evidence to foresee a prophylactic use of hormonal therapies against COVID-19 and this hypothesis can be easily tested on cohorts of breast and prostate cancer patients who follow those regimens. In case of pandemic, if the protective effect of hormonal therapies will be proven on cancer patients, the use of specific hormonal therapies could be extended to other oncological groups and to healthy individuals to decrease the overall risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2.Given the COVID-19 coronavirus emergency, a special focus is needed on the impact of this rapidly spreading viral infection on cancer patients. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling in the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) regulation is emerging as an important determinant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) susceptibility. In our study, we analyzed AR and TMPRSS2 expression in 17,352 normal and 9,556 cancer tissues from public repositories and stratified data according to sex and age. The emerging picture is that some patient groups may be particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and may benefit from antiandrogen- or tamoxifen-based therapies. These findings are relevant to choose proper treatments in order to protect cancer patients from concomitant SARS-CoV-2 contagion and related symptoms and put forward the idea that hormonal therapies could be used as prophylactic agents against COVID-19.","output":"Estrogen and Androgen Receptor Inhibitors: Unexpected Allies in the Fight Against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a range of negative social and economic effects that may contribute to a rise in mental health problems. In this observational population-based study, we examined longitudinal changes in the prevalence of mental health problems from before to during the COVID-19 crisis and identified subgroups that are psychologically vulnerable during the pandemic. METHODS: Participants (N = 14 393; observations = 48 486) were adults drawn from wave 9 (2017-2019) of the nationally representative United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) and followed-up across three waves of assessment in April, May, and June 2020. Mental health problems were assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). RESULTS: The population prevalence of mental health problems (GHQ-12 score a3) increased by 13.5 percentage points from 24.3% in 2017-2019 to 37.8% in April 2020 and remained elevated in May (34.7%) and June (31.9%) 2020. All sociodemographic groups examined showed statistically significant increases in mental health problems in April 2020. The increase was largest among those aged 18-34 years (18.6 percentage points, 95% CI 14.3-22.9%), followed by females and high-income and education groups. Levels of mental health problems subsequently declined between April and June 2020 but remained significantly above pre-COVID-19 levels. Additional analyses showed that the rise in mental health problems observed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic was unlikely to be due to seasonality or year-to-year variation.

The human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS), a SPECT and positron emission tomography reporter gene, was inserted into Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a recently emerged virus that can cause severe respiratory disease and death in afflicted humans to obtain a quantifiable and sensitive marker for viral replication to further MERS-CoV animal model development.

This strategy provides a sustainable and highly efficient approach for the disinfection of the SARS-CoV-2 viruliferous aerosols and wastewater.","output":"Inactivating SARS-CoV-2 by electrochemical oxidation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate the level of sexual function during the COVID-19 pandemic in pregnant women followed up in Baskent University Faculty of Medicine, Turkey, using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI)","output":"Risk factors for sexual dysfunction in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The talk opens with the following question: What role does our experience with uncertainty play in our creative thoughts and actions? The remainder of the talk is focused on addressing this question, starting with the assertion that there is no creativity without uncertainty and several other operating assumptions aimed at establishing a basis for this assertion. Next a model of creativity under uncertainty is introduced. The model outlines how encounters with uncertainty in a particular socio-cultural and historical moment can be experienced as epistemologically and ontologically destabilizing, and thereby, result in a state of genuine doubt. This state of doubt, when perceived as actionable, can open-up a horizon of new possibilities for creative activity. The model further outlines how taking creative action in the face of uncertainty can (temporarily) resolve our state of doubt and re-stabilize our experiences. Implications for inviting uncertainty into educational learning environments are also discussed.","output":"There is No Creativity Without Uncertainty: Dubito Ergo Creo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 infection induces an exacerbated inflammation driven by innate immunity components. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in the defense against viral infections, for instance plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), have the capacity to produce vast amounts of interferon-alpha (IFN-). In COVID-19 there is a deficit in DC numbers and IFN- production, which has been associated with disease severity. In this work, we described that in addition to the DC deficiency, several DC activation and homing markers were altered in acute COVID-19 patients, which were associated with multiple inflammatory markers. Remarkably, previously hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients remained with decreased numbers of CD1c+ myeloid DCs and pDCs seven months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the expression of DC markers such as CD86 and CD4 were only restored in previously nonhospitalized patients, while no restoration of integrin 7 and indoleamine 2,3-dyoxigenase (IDO) levels were observed.

Clinical studies produced promising data that encourage the further investigation of fluoxetine and fluvoxamine regarding their use in COVID-19. In this review, we summarize experimental data and the results of the performed clinical studies.

Many countries have reported a substantial and rapid reduction in hospital admissions for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and percutaneous coronary intervention. The reasons for such abrupt changes in healthcare delivery are multifactorial and include lockdowns, reduction in outpatient services, reluctance to seek medical attention for fear of contracting the virus, and restrictive visitation policies adopted during the pandemic. Diversion of hospital resources towards treating COVID-19 patients not only overwhelmed emergency medical services, the additional lack of appropriate resources to transfer patients to PCI-capable hospitals further added to reduced hospital admissions for acute MI.

We assume a Watts-Strogatz small-world network which allows to distinguish contacts within clustered cliques and unclustered, random contacts in the population, which have been shown to be crucial in sustaining the epidemic. In contrast to other works, which use coarse-grained network structures from anonymized data, like cell phone data, we consider the contacts of individual agents explicitly. We show that NPIs drastically reduced random contacts in the transmission network, increased network clustering, and resulted in a change from an exponential to a constant regime of newcases. In this regime, the disease spreads like a wave with a finite wave speed that depends on the number of contacts in a nonlinear fashion, which we can predict by mean field theory. Our analysis indicates that besides the well-known transitionbetween exponential increase and exponential decrease in the number of new cases, NPIs can induce a transition to another, previously unappreciated regime of constant new cases.","output":"Inferring the effect of interventions on COVID-19 transmission networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 pneumonia or coronavirus disease 2019-related acute respiratory distress syndrome is the primary cause of mortality in coronavirus disease 2019.

The Multimodal Restricted Boltzmann Machine approach (MM-RBM), which has the capability to connect the information about the multiple modalities, can be applied to the problem of drug repurposing. The present study utilized MM-RBM to combine two types of data, including the chemical structures data of small molecules and differentially expressed genes as well as small molecules perturbations. In the proposed method, two separate RBMs were applied to find out the features and the specific probability distribution of each datum (modality). Besides, RBM was used to integrate the discovered features, resulting in the identification of the probability distribution of the combined data. The results demonstrated the significance of the clusters acquired by our model. These clusters were used to discover the medicines which were remarkably similar to the proposed medications to treat COVID-19. Moreover, the chemical structures of some small molecules as well as dysregulated genes effect led us to suggest using these molecules to treat COVID-19.

Nav1.6 epilepsy-causing mutations are spread over the entire channel's structure and only 10 % of mutations have been characterized at the molecular level, with most of them being gain of function mutations. In this study, we analyzed three previously uncharacterized Nav1.6 epilepsy-causing mutations: G214D, N215D and V216D, located within a mutation hot-spot at the S3-S4 extracellular loop of Domain1. Voltage clamp experiments showed a 6-16 mV hyperpolarizing shift in the activation mid-point for all three mutants. V216D presented the largest shift along with decreased current amplitude, enhanced inactivation and a lack of persistent current. Recordings at hyperpolarized potentials indicated that all three mutants presented gating pore currents. Furthermore, trafficking experiments performed in cultured hippocampal neurons demonstrated that the mutants trafficked properly to the cell surface, with no significant differences regarding surface expression within the axon initial segment or soma compared to wild-type. These trafficking data suggest that the disease-causing consequences are due to only changes in the biophysical properties of the channel. Interestingly, the patient carrying the V216D mutation, which is the mutant with the greatest electrophysiological changes as compared to wild-type, exhibited the most severe phenotype. These results emphasize that these mutations will mandate unique treatment approaches, for normal sodium channel blockers may not work given that the studied mutations present gating pore currents.

Two ionic species, namely Na^{+} and Cl^{-}, have been considered here. E protein is one of the smallest structural protein which is embedded in the outer membrane of the virus. Once the virus is inside the host cell, this protein is expressed abundantly and is responsible for activities such as replication and budding of the virus. In the literature, we can find a few experimental studies focusing on understanding the activity of the channel formed by E proteins of different viruses. Here, we attempt the same study for the COVID-19 E protein ion channel through mathematical modeling. The channel geometry is calculated from the protein data bank file which was provided by NARLabs, Taiwan, using the hole program. Further, it was used to obtain the charge distribution using the pdbtopqr online program. The immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method (IB-LBM) has been implemented to numerically solve the system of equations in the channel generated by the protein data bank file.

LC-CD133(+) displayed higher Oct-4 expressions with the ability to self-renew and may represent a reservoir with proliferative potential for generating lung cancer cells. Furthermore, LC-CD133(+), unlike LC-CD133(?), highly co-expressed the multiple drug-resistant marker ABCG2 and showed significant resistance to chemotherapy agents (i.e., cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel) and radiotherapy. The treatment of Oct-4 siRNA with lentiviral vector can specifically block the capability of LC-CD133(+) to form spheres and can further facilitate LC-CD133(+) to differentiate into LC-CD133(?). In addition, knock-down of Oct-4 expression in LC-CD133(+) can significantly inhibit the abilities of tumor invasion and colony formation, and increase apoptotic activities of caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Finally, in vitro and in vivo studies further confirm that the treatment effect of chemoradiotherapy for LC-CD133(+) can be improved by the treatment of Oct-4 siRNA.

We evaluated symptoms and plasma hormones during enteral nutrient infusion and the association with impaired glucose tolerance and quality-of-life (QOL) scores in patients with functional dyspepsia vs. healthy controls. METHODS Enteral hormonal responses and symptoms were measured during isocaloric and isovolumic dextrose and lipid infusions into the duodenum in 30 patients with functional dyspepsia (n=27) or nausea and vomiting (n=3) and 35 healthy controls. Infusions were administered in randomized order over 120 min each, with a 120-min washout. Cholecystokinin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1), and peptide YY were measured during infusions. RESULTS Moderate or more severe symptoms during lipid (4 controls vs. 14 patients) and dextrose (1 control vs. 12 patients) infusions were more prevalent in patients than controls (P0.01), associated with higher dyspepsia symptom score (P=0.01), worse QOL (P=0.01), and greater plasma hormone concentrations (e.g., GLP1 during lipid infusion). Moderate or more severe symptoms during enteral infusion explained 18%, and depression score explained 21%, of interpatient variation in QOL. Eight patients had impaired glucose tolerance, associated with greater plasma GLP1 and peptide YY concentrations during dextrose and lipid infusions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Increased sensitivity to enteral dextrose and lipid infusions was associated with greater plasma enteral hormone concentrations, more severe daily symptoms, and worse QOL in functional dyspepsia.

Those affected suffer from severe functional impairment that can persist for years. First studies suggest a positive effect of physiotherapy and early mobilisation. However, the ideal intervention for a preferential functional outcome is not known. So far no randomised controlled trial has been conducted to specifically evaluate an early endurance and resistance training in the mechanically ventilated, critically ill patient. METHODS/DESIGN A randomised controlled trial with blinded assessors and 6-month follow-up will be conducted in a tertiary, interdisciplinary intensive care unit in Switzerland. Participants (n = 115; expected dropouts: n = 15) will be randomised to a control group receiving standard physiotherapy and to an experimental group that undergoes early mobilisation combined with endurance and resistance training. The inclusion criteria are being aged 18 years or older, expected mechanical ventilation for more than 72 h and qualitative independence before the illness. Primary endpoints are functional capacity (6-Minute Walk Test) and the ability to perform activities of daily living (Functional Independence Measure) measured at hospital discharge. Secondary endpoints include muscle strength (Medical Research Council sum score, handgrip strength and handheld dynamometry for quadriceps muscle), joint contractures (range of motion), exercise capacity (Timed 'Up & Go' Test) and health-related quality of life (Short Form 36). Safety will be monitored during interventions by indirect calorimetry and continuous intensive care standard monitoring. All previously defined adverse events will be noted. The statistical analysis will be by intention-to-treat with the level of significance set at p < 0.05. DISCUSSION This prospective, single-centre, allocation-concealed and assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial will evaluate participant's function after an early endurance and resistance training compared to standard care.

METHODS We used a qualitative descriptive design to examine facilitators and barriers to employment for rural women cancer survivors. We conducted interviews with 33 rural women with cancer histories. RESULTS Facilitators of employment included paid time off, flexible work arrangements, and supportive workplace social networks, while barriers to employment included compromised immunity, long-term treatment effects, stigma and discrimination, and limited rural job markets. Rural women with secure employment histories generally experienced facilitators of employment, while rural women with insecure (e.g., temporary, informal, non-standard) employment histories generally faced barriers to retaining jobs and finding employment. CONCLUSIONS Formal and informal workplace support helped rural women retain their jobs during and following cancer treatment, especially those with secure employment. However, women with insecure employment histories generally faced multiple barriers to retaining and finding employment. More inclusive policies to support workers facing disabling illnesses, such as paid medical leave, are needed to ensure cancer survivors can maintain employment and/or financial security during and following their cancer treatment.

Most of these modeling concepts use the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental models; however, wide imprecise outcomes in forecasting can occur with these models in the context of poor data, low testing levels, and a nonhomogeneous population. Objectives: To predict Brazilian ICU beds demand over time and during COVID-19 pandemic peak. Methods: In the present study, we describe a Bayesian COVID-19 model combined with a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm to forecast quantitative predictions of infections, number of deaths and the demand for critical care beds in the next month in the Brazilian context of scarce data availability. We also estimated COVID-19 spread tendency in the state of Sao Paulo and forecasted the demand for critical care beds, as Sao Paulo is the epicenter of the Latin America pandemic. Results: Our model estimated that the number of infected individuals would be approximately 6.5 million (median) on April 25, 2020, and would reach 16 to 17 million (median) by the end of August 2020 in Brazil. The probability that an infected individual requires ICU-level care in Brazil is 0.5833% . Our model suggests that the current level of mitigation seen in Sao Paulo is sufficient to reach Rt < 1, thus attaining a peak in the short term. In Sao Paulo state, the total number of deaths is estimated to be around 9,000 (median) with the 2.5% quantile being 6,600 deaths and the 97.5% quantile being around 13,350 deaths. Also, Sao Paulo will not attain its maximum capacity of ICU beds if the current trend persists over the long term. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic should peak in Brazil between May 8 and May 20, 2020 with a fatality rate lower than that suggested in the literature. The northern and northeastern regions of Brazil will suffer from a lack of available ICU beds, whereas the southeastern, southern, and central-western regions appear to have sufficient ICU beds only if they share private system beds with the publicly funded Unified Heath System (SUS). The model predicts that, if the current policies and population behavior are maintained throughout the forecasted period, by the end of August 2020, Brazil will have around 12% of its population immune to COVID-19.","output":"Brazilian Modeling of COVID-19 (BRAM-COD): a Bayesian Monte Carlo approach for COVID-19 spread in a limited data set context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The multifactorial nature of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease cannot be explained solely by genetic factors. Recent evidence revealed that DNA methylation changes take place at proximal promoters within susceptibility genes. This emphasizes the need for integrating multiple data types to provide a better understanding of the diseases pathogenesis. One such candidate gene is paraoxonase-1 (PON1). Substantial interindividual differences in PON1 are apparent and could influence disease risk later in life. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the different regulatory aspects of PON1 variability and to examine them in relation to the predisposition to obesity-associated fatty liver disease. RESULTS: A targeted multi-omics approach was applied to investigate the interplay between PON1 genetic variants, promoter methylation, expression profile and enzymatic activity in an adult patient cohort with extensive metabolic and hepatic characterisation including liver biopsy. Alterations in PON1 status were shown to correlate with waist-to-hip ratio and relevant features of liver pathology. Particularly, the regulatory polymorphism rs705379:C > T was strongly associated with more severe liver disease. Multivariable data analysis furthermore indicated a significant association of combined genetic and epigenetic PON1 regulation. This identified relationship postulates a role for DNA methylation as a mediator between PON1 genetics and expression, which is believed to further influence liver disease progression via modifications in PON1 catalytic efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that vertical data-integration of genetic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms generated a more in-depth understanding of the molecular basis underlying the development of obesity-associated fatty liver disease. We gained novel insights into how NAFLD classification and outcome are orchestrated, which could not have been obtained by exclusively considering genetic variation.

MethodsTwelve kindergartens were randomly selected in the Berlin metropolitan area, and a total of 720 participants were recruited (155 pre-school children, 78 staff, 487 household members). Participants were briefly examined and interviewed, and SARS-CoV-2 infections and anti-SARS-Cov-2 IgG antibodies were assessed. ResultsSigns and symptoms, largely resembling common cold, were present in 24.2% of children and 28.9% of staff. However, no SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected among 701 PCR-tested individuals, and only one childcare worker showed IgG seroreactivity (0.15%; 1/672).

It is urgent to conduct prediction research on the development and spread of the epidemic. In this article, a hybrid artificial-intelligence (AI) model is proposed for COVID-19 prediction. First, as traditional epidemic models treat all individuals with coronavirus as having the same infection rate, an improved susceptible-infected (ISI) model is proposed to estimate the variety of the infection rates for analyzing the transmission laws and development trend. Second, considering the effects of prevention and control measures and the increase of the public's prevention awareness, the natural language processing (NLP) module and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network are embedded into the ISI model to build the hybrid AI model for COVID-19 prediction. The experimental results on the epidemic data of several typical provinces and cities in China show that individuals with coronavirus have a higher infection rate within the third to eighth days after they were infected, which is more in line with the actual transmission laws of the epidemic. Moreover, compared with the traditional epidemic models, the proposed hybrid AI model can significantly reduce the errors of the prediction results and obtain the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) with 0.52%, 0.38%, 0.05%, and 0.86% for the next six days in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, and countrywide, respectively.","output":"Predicting COVID-19 in China Using Hybrid AI Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In sucker-rod pumping wells, due to the lack of an early diagnosis of operating condition or sensor faults, several problems can go unnoticed.

Often these nurses are unaware of Martin Heidegger's role in the German National Socialist Party of the 1930s and his allegiance to fascist ideology. We ask: can a bad person have good ideas? In line with pragmatic thinkers such as Richard Rorty, we argue that instead of value judgements on people and their ideas, nurses should consider ideas as a product of a historical/social and political time and space. In urging a critical political engagement, we argue for a Husserlian approach. In opposition to Heidegger's interpretivist phenomenology approach, in which the hegemony of the day is integral to the phenomena being studied, we propose that a more expressive, collaborative engagement using Husserlian descriptive phenomenology approach would serve better in encouraging a more critical engagement with how ideas are used by groups of people, how some groups might be advantaged and others disadvantaged. Our conclusion is that the separation of ideas from political and social context is dangerous, and nurses, including nurse researchers, must understand how their research ideas and methods influence and are influenced by political agendas.","output":"Why should nurses care if Heidegger was a Nazi?

We aimed to investigate prevalence and associated patient (demographic and clinical) characteristics of mental wellbeing (health-related quality of life [HRQoL] and symptoms of depression and anxiety) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in older patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. METHODS: An ongoing Dutch multicentre prospective cohort study enrols patients of 70 years with an eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73m(2) from October 2018 onward. With additional questionnaires during the pandemic (MayCJune 2020), disease-related concerns about COVID-19 and general anxiety symptoms were assessed cross-sectionally, and depressive symptoms, HRQoL, and emotional symptoms longitudinally. RESULTS: The 82 included patients had a median age of 77.5 years (interquartile range 73.9C82.1), 77% were male and none had tested positive for COVID-19. Cross-sectionally, 67% of the patients reported to be more anxious about COVID-19 because of their kidney disease, and 43% of the patients stated that their quality of life was reduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to pre-COVID-19, the presence of depressive symptoms had increased (11 to 22%; p = .022) and physical HRQoL declined (M = 40.4, SD = 10.1 to M = 36.1, SD = 10.4; p < .001), particularly in males. Mental HRQoL (M = 50.3, SD = 9.6 to M = 50.4, SD = 9.9; p = .913) and emotional symptoms remained similar.

METHODS A total of 14 experimental miniature pigs were randomly divided into four groups (55& 5-watt, 55& 8-watt, 65& 5-watt, and 65 & 8-watt groups). Spark was used for left and right renal artery radiofrequency ablation. Blood samples collected from renal arteries and veins as well as renal arteriography were performed on all animals before, immediately after, and three months after procedure to evaluate the effects of Spark on the levels of plasma renin, aldosterone, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II as well as the pathological changes of renal arteries. RESULTS One pig died of an anesthetic accident, 13 pigs successfully underwent the bilateral renal artery ablation. Compared with basic measurements, pigs in all the four groups had significantly decreased mean arterial pressure after procedure. Histopathological analysis showed that this procedure could result in intimal hyperplasia, significant peripheral sympathetic nerve damage in the renal arteries such as inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis in perineurium, uneven distribution of nerve fibers, tissue necrosis, severe vacuolization, fragmented and unclear nucleoli myelin degeneration, sparse axons, and interruption of continuity. In addition, the renal artery radiofrequency ablation could significantly reduce the levels of plasma renin, aldosterone, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II in pigs.

This system employs a panel of highly diverse inbred mouse strains, consisting of the founders and recombinant progeny of the Collaborative Cross project. Unlike natural populations, the structure of this panel allows the serial evaluation of genetically identical individuals and the quantification of genotype-specific effects of interventions such as vaccination. When analyzed in the aggregate, our panel resembled natural populations in several important respects: the animals displayed a broad range of susceptibility to M. tuberculosis, differed in their immunological responses to infection, and were not durably protected by BCG vaccination. However, when analyzed at the genotype level, we found that these phenotypic differences were heritable. M. tuberculosis susceptibility varied between lines, from extreme sensitivity to progressive M. tuberculosis clearance. Similarly, only a minority of the genotypes was protected by vaccination. The efficacy of BCG was genetically separable from susceptibility to M. tuberculosis, and the lack of efficacy in the aggregate analysis was driven by nonresponsive lines that mounted a qualitatively distinct response to infection.

Aim of the study is to evaluate the incidence of DVT in COVID-19 patients and its correlation with the severity of the disease and with clinical and laboratory findings. METHODS. 234 symptomatic patients with COVID-19, diagnosed according to the World Health Organization guidelines, were included in the study. The severity of the disease was classified as moderate, severe and critical. Doppler ultrasound (DUS) was performed in all patients. DUS findings, clinical, laboratorys and therapeutic variables were investigated by contingency tables, Pearson chi square test and by Student T test and Fisher's exact test. ROC curve analysis was applied to study significant continuous variables. RESULTS. Overall incidence of DVT was 10.7% (25/234): 1.6% (1/60) among moderate cases, 13.8% (24/174) in severely and critically ill patients. Prolonged bedrest and intensive care unit admission were significantly associated with the presence of DVT (19.7%). Fraction of inspired oxygen, P/F ratio, respiratory rate, heparin administration, D-dimer, IL-6, ferritin and CRP showed correlation with DVT. CONCLUSIONS. DUS may be considered a useful and valid tool for early identification of DVT. In less severely affected patients, DUS as screening of DVT might be unnecessary. High rate of DVT found in severe patients and its correlation with respiratory parameters and some significant laboratory findings suggests that these can be used as a screening tool for patients who should be getting DUS.","output":"Early Detection Of Deep Vein Thrombosis In Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019: Who to Screen and Who not to with Doppler Ultrasound?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"English : Discrimination against the approximately 500,000 African (mostly irregular) immigrants has recently spread in China. During the corona pandemic, it degenerates into a true Afrophobia. Shortly before, five Nigerians in Guangzhou had reportedly tested positive for COVID-19. Africans are widely accused as drug traffickers and criminals. Also, they would endanger China's global competitiveness for Africa's resources through media baiting abroad. Current reports testify the displacement of African migrants from homes and hotels in Guangzhou (Canton), where most of the Africans live. They are dependent on informal, mostly illegal networks in order to be able to stay in the country. In online social networks Afrophobia as cyber racism is particularly pronounced. Thereby, racism is more deeply rooted in the mentality of many Chinese than is commonly assumed. According to a traditional Chinese proverb, the greatest evil to be avoided is the destroyed nation and the annihilated race. In addition, since 2005 land-grabbing by Chinese entrepreneurs in sub-Saharan Africa arose international attention. Its main purpose is to ensure food security in China and to profit from international grain speculation. It was racially legitimized from the start, with slogans such as, only Chinese investments could save Africans from their traditional laziness. This repeats deeply rooted neo-colonial European prejudices of a wild, ahistoric and uncivilized Africa. The prejudices are still associated with a feeling of racial superiority. The social fabric of China has always embodied essential characteristics of the exclusion of foreigners, focused on ethnicity, race, religion, sexual orientation and gender. The African Union, various African governments and even the United States have sharply criticized Beijing for mistreating migrants, particularly those from Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and Uganda. Racist attacks on Africans in China have an oppressively long tradition, associated with the expansion of bilateral Chinese petty trade in sub-Saharan Africa in the early 2000s and the subsequent influx of African petty traders into China.

It serves as a natural experiment to explore changes in presentations for surgical diseases including acute appendicitis. The objective was to determine if the pandemic was associated with changes in incidence of acute appendicitis compared to a historical control and to determine if there were associated changes in disease severity. METHODS: The study is a retrospective, multicenter cohort study of adults (N = 956) presenting with appendicitis in nonpandemic versus pandemic time periods (December 1, 2019-March 10, 2020 versus March 11, 2020-May 16, 2020). Corresponding time periods in 2018 and 2019 composed the historical control. Primary outcome was mean biweekly counts of all appendicitis presentations, then stratified by complicated (n = 209) and uncomplicated (n = 747) disease. Trends in presentations were compared using difference-in-differences methodology. Changes in odds of presenting with complicated disease were assessed via clustered multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: There was a 29% decrease in mean biweekly appendicitis presentations from 5.4 to 3.8 (rate ratio = 0.71 [0.51, 0.98]) after the pandemic declaration, with a significant difference in differences compared with historical control (P = .003). Stratified by severity, the decrease was significant for uncomplicated appendicitis (rate ratio = 0.65 [95% confidence interval 0.47-0.91]) when compared with historical control (P = .03) but not for complicated appendicitis (rate ratio = 0.89 [95% confidence interval 0.52-1.52]); (P = .49). The odds of presenting with complicated disease did not change (adjusted odds ratio 1.36 [95% confidence interval 0.83-2.25]). CONCLUSION: The pandemic was associated with decreased incidence of uncomplicated appendicitis without an accompanying increase in complicated disease. Changes in individual health care-use behaviors may underlie these differences, suggesting that some cases of uncomplicated appendicitis may resolve without progression to complicated disease.","output":"Where did the patients go?

These same warnings are reverberating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Consideration of the impacts of EVD on maternal and child health services from facility data can be instructive during COVID-19. We surveyed all peripheral healthcare units (PHUs) in Sierra Leone in October 2014 and March 2015 to assess closures, staffing, amenities, medicines, supplies, and service utilization during May 2014-January 2015 and October 2013-January 2014. We report PHU characteristics and service utilization changes for equivalent 4-month periods during the epidemic and the prior year. We present utilization changes by district and service type, and model excess child mortality. PHU closures (-8%) and staff attrition (-3%) were limited, but many facilities lacked amenities, medicines, and supplies. Utilization of preventive and scheduled services fell more than individualized, clinical care interventions, aside from malaria treatment which declined significantly. Ebola virus disease intensity in districts was weakly associated with utilization, aside from two districts that were severely affected. Modeling suggests utilization declines resulted in 6,782 excess under-five deaths (an increase of 21%) between 2014 and 2015. Ebola virus disease negatively affected service provision, but utilization declined relatively more, particularly for preventive and scheduled interventions. Although these findings are specific to Sierra Leone's EVD epidemic, they illustrate the magnitude of possible effects in other settings due to COVID-19-induced service disruptions, where collateral impacts on child mortality from other preventable causes may far outweigh COVID-19 mortality.","output":"The Effect of Ebola Virus Disease on Maternal and Child Health Services and Child Mortality in Sierra Leone, 2014-2015: Implications for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers the possibility to monitor both host and pathogens transcriptomes at the cellular level.

METHODS A systematic search was conducted in May 2018 of the following databases: Web of Science Core Collections, Embase and Medline. Included studies were randomised controlled trials involving people with Multiple Sclerosis who completed an intervention, compared to any comparator. Outcomes included subjective or objective measures of physical activity or sedentary behaviour. Quality assessment was performed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. RESULTS Twenty-five trials were included covering 1697 participants, the majority of which had mild-moderate disability (average Physiotherapy Evidence Database score 6.2  1.5). Experimental interventions included exercise prescription (n = 5), behaviour change interventions (n = 10), combined exercise, and behaviour change techniques (n = 7) and education (n = 3). Generally, subjective but not objective physical activity improved in those with mild-moderate disability. Insufficient data existed on the effectiveness on sedentary behaviour. CONCLUSIONS A discrepancy seems to exists between the effectiveness of physical activity interventions in people with Multiple Sclerosis depending on whether physical activity was assessed objectively or subjectively, with the latter indicating effects. Effects on sedentary behaviour remain to be elucidated. Implications for Rehabilitation Remaining physically active is important to maintain functional ability, independence, quality of life, and to reduce the incidence of co-morbidity. Exercise prescription, behaviour change interventions, combined exercise and behaviour change interventions, and health promotion education appear to subjectively improve physical activity in people with Multiple Sclerosis with mild-moderate disability, yet this is often not the case when measured objectively.

METHODS: Consecutive patients who presented to all five of the emergency rooms of the Reggio Emilia province between February 27 and March 23, 2020, for suspected COVID-19, underwent chest CT, and had a positive swab within 10 days were included in this retrospective study. Age, sex, comorbidities, days from symptom onset, and laboratory data were retrieved from institutional information systems. CT disease extension was visually graded as < 20%, 20-39%, 40-59%, or &#8805; 60%. The association between clinical and CT variables with death was estimated with univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models; model performance was assessed using k-fold cross-validation for the area under the ROC curve (cvAUC). RESULTS: Of the 866 included patients (median age 59.8, women 39.2%), 93 (10.74%) died. Clinical variables significantly associated with death in multivariable model were age, male sex, HDL cholesterol, dementia, heart failure, vascular diseases, time from symptom onset, neutrophils, LDH, and oxygen saturation level. CT disease extension was also independently associated with death (HR = 7.56, 95% CI = 3.49; 16.38 for &#8805; 60% extension). cvAUCs were 0.927 (bootstrap bias-corrected 95% CI = 0.899-0.947) for the clinical model and 0.936 (bootstrap bias-corrected 95% CI = 0.912-0.953) when adding CT extension.

Despite the growing evidence, current knowledge on the subject remains insufficient, so that data obtained with different tools, from multiple centers and in distinct scenarios are welcome. Yet, the predictive value of olfactory dysfunction in terms of the overall prognosis of COVID-19 is unknown. This study aims to evaluate the olfactory function of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and the impact of the results on their clinical outcomes. METHODS: Patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) admitted to a university tertiary hospital were recruited and divided into those with ARDS due to COVID-19, and those with ARDS of any other cause. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected at baseline and the patients had their objective olfactory function evaluated by the Alcohol Sniff Test on admission and during hospital stay. The participants were then followed up until reaching an endpoint: hospital discharge, endotracheal intubation, transfer to the intensive care unit, or death. Patients with COVID-19 were also subgrouped and compared according to their olfactory thresholds and to their overall clinical outcomes. The obtained data was analyzed using R software. Level of significance was set at 0.05. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients were included (of which 58 had COVID-19). 87.93% of the patients with COVID-19 had diminished olfactory dysfunction on admission. The mean length of hospital stay among patients with olfactory dysfunction was greater (7.84 vs 6.14 days) and nine individuals in this subgroup had poor overall outcomes.

Epidemiological studies interrogating the relationship between stress and cancer have reported mixed results. The impact of the topic and the lack of consensus has sparked this review of the literature to investigate gaps in knowledge and identify areas of research. We first present a brief summary of the biopsychosocial model generally used to conduct research on stress. We then divide the overview of the literature into areas of research focus. These include the role of distressing life events in breast cancer incidence, the role of adverse childhood events in later breast cancer incidence, the importance of race and socioeconomic status (SES) as social determinants of breast cancer incidence, and the specific role of chronic stress in relation to breast cancer. For each topic, we discuss the potential of stress as a risk factor and possible intervention strategies that could reduce the effects of stress. We then identify further research questions to be probed to fill the gaps in knowledge. We conclude with a discussion of future research directions for stress research as it relates to breast cancer incidence.","output":"The Role of Stress in Breast Cancer Incidence: Risk Factors, Interventions, and Directions for the Future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Splinting is first line treatment in mild to moderate cases of carpal and cubital tunnel syndrome. During COVID-19 lockdown, patients experience prolonged waiting time for their splints from specialist service if not requiring surgery. Many of our patients have not trialled splinting prior to their specialist appointments. We aimed to look at the quality of splints commercially available for the general public to purchase thereby starting treatment earlier. METHOD: Hand splints for nerve entrapment are readily available through two of the biggest UK online retailers, Amazon.co.uk and eBay.co.uk. We searched the terms carpal and cubital tunnel splints on both sites, the top 5 results were assessed for their suitability, accessibility, and affordability. RESULTS: The average cost of splints for carpal tunnel syndrome on Amazon and eBay are 9 and 8 respectively, and 15 on Amazon and 10 on eBay for cubital tunnel syndrome. We found that all top 5 hand splints found on these websites are suitable for the conditions they advertised. The average time for free delivery of splints is 2 days for Amazon and 3 days for eBay. Splints are easily sized by using the sellers wrist/elbow circumference measurement guide. CONCLUSIONS: This study has given us the confidence to encourage patients to purchase splints, at an affordable price, from online sites whilst either waiting for specialist appointments or as part of their specialist recommended treatment. With early initiation of treatment, patients may have symptomatic relief and, in some cases, avoid the need for further treatment, leading to reduced hospital footfall.","output":"1076 Online Availability of Hand Splints for Patients with Common Upper Limb Nerve Entrapment Syndromes During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although health care-associated methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and clostridium difficile strains are primarily a risk to hospital patients, people are increasingly concerned about their potential to circulate in the community and the home.

Health care systems globally are amid an unprecedented challenge. Since its emergence in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the virus has spread to 185 countries worldwide, with more than 2.63 million cases confirmed and more than 183 thousand related deaths (as of 23/04/2020). According to current evidence, the novel coronavirus is transmitted from human-to-human mainly via respiratory droplets of different sizes, contact with bodily fluids, or from contaminated surfaces. In the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures that generate aerosols are performed. The common clinical symptoms of the highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic virus include fever, cough, fatigue, ageusia and anosmia and in some patients, gastrointestinal infection symptoms. The elderly and patients with comorbidities are susceptible to infection and prone to severe complications, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokines storm. Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation. Under these circumstances, it is critical for health care settings, including nuclear medicine departments to take infection control measures, to prevent a potential spread not just among patients but also to staff members as well as to reconsider the performance of randomized clinical trials. There have already been papers on the radiology preparedness that should be applied to radiology and nuclear medicine departments to support the care of patients with COVID-19 and maintain radiologic diagnostic and interventional support for the entirety of the hospital and healthcare system, particularly for emergencies, without jeopardizing an outbreak in the units. Since most nuclear medicine diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are non-urgent, the general guidance from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for infection prevention and control is to postpone scheduled procedure after cautious risk assessment, with certain exceptions. Individualized approach of each case is a sine qua non of ensuring low transmission of COVID-19 as well as effective and safe management of patients admitted to nuclear medicine departments. Another major issue raised is the possible impact COVID-19 on the transport of medical radioisotopes. By the 1st of April 2020, the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA) co-chaired the European Observatory on Supply of Medical Radioisotope expressing their concerns related to the impact of COVID-19 on the supply chain and inconsequence on the availability of the most vital medical radioisotopes used in nuclear medicine. Due to the current lockdown situation, extended border controls, reductions and elimination of many commercial passenger flights, competition and cost of cargo and charter options, required appropriate additional support.

DESIGN Prospective case series. SETTING A university teaching hospital and a regional hospital in Hong Kong. PATIENTS All patients undergoing single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy from August 2009 to March 2011. RESULTS Fifty patients underwent single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the study period. The indications for surgery included symptomatic gallstones (n=43) and gallbladder polyps (n=7). The mean operating time was 78 (standard deviation, 24) minutes. Forty-five of the patients successfully underwent single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy, giving a success rate of 90%. In the remaining five patients, additional working ports were constructed to obtain better exposure and dissection around Calot's triangle. On comparing the results of the initial 25 cases to the subsequent 25 cases, in the latter group the operating time was significantly shorter (86 vs 71 minutes; P=0.02), and the success rate was higher (80% vs 100%; P=0.05). During the median follow-up period of 6.8 months, four patients had complications, which included: postoperative urinary retention (n=2), one each with a haematoma and an incisional hernia. No patient endured bile duct injury, postoperative bile leakage, or haemorrhage in our series.

In clinics in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and Western Cape (WC) provinces, South Africa, we estimated clinic visit duration, time spent indoors and outdoors, and occupancy density of waiting rooms. Methods We used unique barcodes to track attendees' movements in 11 clinics in two provinces, multiple imputation to estimate missing arrival and departure times, and mixed-effects linear regression to examine associations with visit duration. Results 2,903 attendees were included. Median visit duration was 2 hours 36 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 01:36-3:43). Longer mean visit times were associated with being female (13.5 minutes longer; p<0.001) and attending with a baby (18.8 minutes longer; p<0.01), and shorter mean times with later arrival (14.9 minutes shorter per hour after 0700; p<0.001) and attendance for tuberculosis or ante/postnatal care (24.8 and 32.6 minutes shorter, respectively, than HIV/acute care; p<0.01). Overall, attendees spent more of their time indoors (median 95.6% [IQR 46-100]) than outdoors (2.5% [IQR 0-35]). Attendees at clinics with outdoor waiting areas spent a greater proportion (median 13.7% [IQR 1-75]) of their time outdoors. In two clinics in KZN (no appointment system), occupancy densities of ~2.0 persons/m2 were observed in smaller waiting rooms during busy periods. In one clinic in WC (appointment system), occupancy density did not exceed 1.0 persons/m2 despite higher overall attendance. Conclusions Longer waiting times were associated with early arrival, being female, and attending with a young child. Attendees generally waited where they were asked to.

METHODS: Participants underwent spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging and autorefraction at 20 (baseline) and 28 years old. The enhanced depth imaging mode on the SD-OCT was used to obtain images of the choroid. Scans were exported from the SD-OCT and analyzed with a custom software that automatically measures the central ChT. The longitudinal change in subfoveal ChT and association between baseline subfoveal ChT and 8-year change in refractive error (spherical equivalent) were determined using linear mixed models. RESULTS: In total, 395 eyes of 198 participants (44% men; 18C22 years at baseline) were included. Over 8 years, mean spherical equivalent decreased by 0.25 diopters (D) and axial length increased by 0.09 mm. Subfoveal choroid thickened by 1.3 m/year (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6C2.0), but this was reduced by 0.9 m/year (95% CI = 1.6C0.2) for every 1 mm increase in axial length.

We aimed to describe the course of disease and early post-transplantation outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19 who failed to show lung recovery despite optimal medical management and were deemed to be at imminent risk of dying due to pulmonary complications. METHODS: We established a multi-institutional case series that included the first consecutive transplants for severe COVID-19-associated ARDS known to us in the USA, Italy, Austria, and India. De-identified data from participating centres-including information relating to patient demographics and pre-COVID-19 characteristics, pretransplantation disease course, perioperative challenges, pathology of explanted lungs, and post-transplantation outcomes-were collected by Northwestern University (Chicago, IL, USA) and analysed. FINDINGS: Between May 1 and Sept 30, 2020, 12 patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS underwent bilateral lung transplantation at six high-volume transplant centres in the USA (eight recipients at three centres), Italy (two recipients at one centre), Austria (one recipient), and India (one recipient). The median age of recipients was 48 years (IQR 41-51); three of the 12 patients were female. Chest imaging before transplantation showed severe lung damage that did not improve despite prolonged mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The lung transplant procedure was technically challenging, with severe pleural adhesions, hilar lymphadenopathy, and increased intraoperative transfusion requirements. Pathology of the explanted lungs showed extensive, ongoing acute lung injury with features of lung fibrosis. There was no recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in the allografts. All patients with COVID-19 could be weaned off extracorporeal support and showed short-term survival similar to that of transplant recipients without COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: The findings from our report show that lung transplantation is the only option for survival in some patients with severe, unresolving COVID-19-associated ARDS, and that the procedure can be done successfully, with good early post-transplantation outcomes, in carefully selected patients.

Along with CD4, HIV-1 requires a chemokine receptor, CCR5 or CXCR4, as an entry co-receptor, and differential co-receptor selectivity is an important determinant of viral diversity and pathogenesis. CCR5 and CXCR4 blockers have been the focus of much research and are now entering clinical trials. RECENT FINDINGS Several CCR5 antagonists with anti-HIV-1 activity have been developed, including small-molecule agents, monoclonal antibodies and modified chemokines. At least four small-molecule and one antibody CCR5 inhibitor are in various stages of preclinical and clinical testing. Most or all infected individuals harbor CCR5-using variants, and promising findings have been reported from very preliminary clinical studies. CXCR4 antagonists under development include small-molecule and short-peptide inhibitors. Only a subset of late-stage individuals harbor CXCR4-using strains, and early clinical studies of CXCR4 inhibition showed some evidence of suppression in certain individuals. SUMMARY Chemokine receptor antagonists offer great promise as a much-needed new class of antiviral agent. They also raise questions that are unique to agents targeting these cellular receptors, including whether drug resistance will lead to variants with altered co-receptor selectivity, the tolerability of chronically blocking receptors involved in inflammation (CCR5, CXCR4) or essential in development and hematopoesis (CXCR4), and the role of co-receptor phenotyping in selecting blocking agents. In addition to HIV-1 infection, these drugs may also have utility in inflammation, cancer, stem cell transplant and other areas.","output":"Co-receptor antagonists as HIV-1 entry inhibitors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To determine clinical features and biochemical markers in COVID-19 patients at a tertiary care hospital, in Multan.

The most common type of malignancy diagnosed in pregnant women is breast cancer, whose incidence is expected to raise in the next future due to delayed childbirth, as well as to the increased occurrence of the disease at young age. Pregnant women diagnosed with breast cancer are exposed to multiple sources of stress, which may lead to poorer obstetric outcomes, such as preterm birth and low birth weight. In addition, pregnancy involves physiological changes in the breasts that may blur the signs of cancer, with delayed diagnosis and poor prognosis. However, the lived experience of these women was investigated in very few studies. Given this scenario, we conducted this qualitative study to describe and understand womens subjective experience of being diagnosed with breast cancer during pregnancy. The study was conducted following the principles of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Participants were five women with breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy, purposefully recruited at a public hospital during medical visits and interviewed at treatment initiation. The interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. The textual analysis led to the identification of three main themes related to: (1) the emotional storm experienced after cancer diagnosis, and the importance of receiving appropriate information and being focused on treatment decisions; (2) physical changes and comparisons with healthy women, associated with feelings of sadness and inadequacy; (3) being positive, feeling free to disclose all kinds of emotions, religion and spirituality as sources of strength.

Methods: We obtained all clinical notes of patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 at a large medical institution in the OMNY Health System Database during one month in late 2020. Patients were excluded if the U07.1 ICD-10-CM code was not present in their structured diagnosis data. We processed the notes using ACM-ICD10 and obtained the ICD-10 concept mappings for each note. Results: After exclusions, 63 patients remained for analysis. These 63 patients had 791 diagnoses in their structured diagnosis data. Processing the 1,488 notes of the 63 patients through ACM-ICD10 yielded 81,599 ICD-10 concept mappings, none of which contained the U07.1 code. However, mappings were observed that related to symptoms and alternative diagnoses of COVID-19 including dyspnea, unspecified (R06.00;518 times;0.6%), shortness of breath (R06.02;505 times;0.6%), unspecified infectious disease (B99.9;466 times;0.6%), and viral infection, unspecified (B34.9;292 times;0.4%). Specifically, text containing the covid substring was mapped to ICD-10 concepts 75 times, most commonly to viral infection, unspecified (B34.9;5 times) and encephalitis and encephalomyelitis, unspecified (G04.90;5 times). Conclusions: While ACM-ICD10 was not effective at mapping COVID-19-related text to its standard code (U07.1) as recommended by the CDC, it often mapped such text to symptoms and signs of COVID-19 infection. These results suggest that commercial NER tools may need to be recalibrated periodically to account for new and emerging illnesses.","output":"PIN64 Identifying COVID-19 Patients from Unstructured Notes: Performance of a Commercial Clinical Named Entity Recognition System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using data from 17,077 banks in 85 tourism economies during 1995C2016, this study analyzes the impact of international tourism receipts on banks profitability and hence financial stability.

Developing and low-income countries experience the greatest negative impact on profitability. Banks in European countries suffer the highest negative impact, whereas those in the United States are affected the least. Commercial and savings banks experience the highest negative impact of tourism. The findings of the study emphasize prudence in fiscal spending in countries where tourism constitutes a significant part of government revenue. The deleterious impact of COVID-19 on the flow of tourism revenue is likely to affect bank profitability and financial stability of the countries dependent on tourism. Therefore, it is of great significance to policy planners worldwide. The study also opens new vistas for research.","output":"Do tourism receipts affect bank profitability?

A very significant new recommendation is that for safety, short-acting 2-agonists (SABA) should now be given in combination with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). In adolescents, GINA steps 1 and 2 are combined and a low-dose ICS formoterol combination as needed is recommended for asthma problems. Alternatively, separation into step 1, with inhalation of SABA and an ICS as needed, and step 2, with daily inhalation of an ICS and SABA as needed, as before, is recommended. This path is suggested as the preferred treatment in children aged 6C11 years. However, these recommendations have not been adopted by all national and international guidelines, because the evidence is weak, especially in children. Tiotropium, mepolizumab, and dupilumab were added to the therapy for severe asthma. Children with asthma do not become ill with COVD-19 more often or more severely than children without asthma. Various mechanisms, such as a possible protective effect of type 2 inflammation, the antiviral and immunomodulatory effects of ICS, and the downregulation of ACE2 receptors by allergic sensitization could be responsible for this.","output":"Neuerungen durch GINA 2020 bei Kindern und die Auswirkungen von COVID-19 auf Kinder mit Asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Eczema can have a considerable impact on quality of life.

An abnormal and overactivated inflammatory response is occasionally elicited by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this hyperinflammation is associated with worse prognosis of COVID-19. Theoretically, one would expect patients with asthma to be at a greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection considering their increased susceptibility to common respiratory virus-associated exacerbations. Surprisingly, current data do not consistently suggest an increased prevalence of asthma among patients with COVID-19. Considering the high global prevalence of asthma, the characteristics of the disease and/or their conventional therapy might play a role in their potential defense against COVID-19. This may be attributed to the T helper type 2 immune response predominantly seen in patients with asthma. Likewise, asthma therapeutics, including corticosteroids and biologics, may in fact benefit the patients with asthma by alleviating the development of hyperinflammation. On the other hand, elevated IL-17 levels are characteristically seen in a subset of asthma patients with severe disease as well as in patients with COVID-19. Targeting the IL-17 pathway as a treatment strategy could plausibly alleviate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with COVID-19 and asthma demonstrating a predominant T helper type 17 response.

We evaluated the extent to which self-isolation of mildly ill people delays the peak of outbreaks and reduces the need for this care in each Canadian province. METHODS We developed a computational model and simulated scenarios for COVID-19 outbreaks within each province. Using estimates of COVID-19 characteristics, we projected the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) bed requirements without self-isolation, assuming an average number of 2.5 secondary cases, and compared scenarios in which different proportions of mildly ill people practised self-isolation 24 hours after symptom onset. RESULTS Without self-isolation, the peak of outbreaks would occur in the first half of June, and an average of 569 ICU bed days per 10 000 population would be needed. When 20% of cases practised self-isolation, the peak was delayed by 2-4 weeks, and ICU bed requirement was reduced by 23.5% compared with no self-isolation. Increasing self-isolation to 40% reduced ICU use by 53.6% and delayed the peak of infection by an additional 2-4 weeks. Assuming current ICU bed occupancy rates above 80% and self-isolation of 40%, demand would still exceed available (unoccupied) ICU bed capacity. INTERPRETATION At the peak of COVID-19 outbreaks, the need for ICU beds will exceed the total number of ICU beds even with self-isolation at 40%.

While the debate continues as to whether COVID-19 ARDS is clinically different from non-COVID ARDS, there is little data on whether the physiological effects of prone positioning differ between the two conditions. We aimed to compare the physiological effect of prone positioning between patients with COVID-19 ARDS and those with non-COVID ARDS. Methods: : We retrospectively compared 23 patients with COVID-19 ARDS and 145 patients with non-COVID ARDS treated using prone positioning while on mechanical ventilation. Changes in PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio and static respiratory system compliance (Crs) after the first session of prone positioning were compared between the two groups: first, using all patients with non-COVID ARDS, and second, using subgroups of patients with non-COVID ARDS matched 1:1 with patients with COVID-19 ARDS for baseline PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio and static Crs. We also evaluated whether the response to the first prone positioning session was associated with the clinical outcome. Results: : When compared with the entire group of patients with non-COVID ARDS, patients with COVID-19 ARDS showed more pronounced improvement in the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio (adjusted difference 39.3 [95% CI 5.2C73.5] mmHg) and static Crs (adjusted difference 3.4 [95% CI 1.1C5.6] mL/cmH 2 O). However, these between-group differences were not significant when the matched samples (either PaO 2 /FiO 2 -matched or compliance-matched) were analyzed.

RESULTS: There was no significant difference in bond strength between the MC and AP before and after thermocycling, whereas VP showed significantly lower values. XPS revealed that the titanium acquired hydrophilic properties after the airborne-particle abrasion. CONCLUSIONS: The novelty of this study is that it shows that the presence/absence of the silane had no effect on the bonding of cast titanium with an acrylic resin.

STUDY DESIGN: In this observational study Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) assay was done on pooled serum samples of the recipients of primary two doses of inactivated BBIBP-CorV and on the pooled serum samples of recipients of a booster dose of inactive BBIBP-CorV. The neutralizing antibody titers against the wild (Wuhan) strain and the variants of concern (alpha, beta and delta) were compared. RESULTS: The serum sample pool from the booster cohort had high neutralizing antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 variants compared to the pooled serum samples of the recipients of primary two doses of inactivated BBIBP-CorV and the difference was statistically significant. The observed fold reduction in antibody titers from the serum pool of recipients of two doses of BBIBP-CorV vaccine were 3.7-fold, 14.6-fold and 10.4-fold compared to 1.8 -fold, 6.5-fold and 3.8-fold reduction against the alpha, beta and delta lineages respectively in the serum pool of recipient of a booster dose (three doses of BBIBP-CorV).

Most of all, how vaccination modifies the stability, sensitivity, and the reproduction number of a susceptible population. METHODS: The proposed COVID-19 compartmental model (SVEIRD) has seven compartments. Namely, susceptible (S), vaccinated (V), exposed (E, infected but not yet infectious), symptomatic infectious (I(s)), asymptomatic infectious (I(a)), recovered (R), and dead by Covid-19 disease (D). We have developed a computational code to mimic the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in a state like New York (NYS). FINDINGS: First a stability analysis was carried out. Next, a sensitivity analysis showed that the more relevant parameters are birth rate, transmission coefficient, and vaccine failure. We found an alternative procedure to easily calculate the vaccinated reproductive number of the proposed SVEIRD model. Our graphical results allow to make a comparison between unvaccinated (SEIRD) and vaccinated (SVEIRD) populations. In the peak of the first wave, we estimated 21% (2.5%) and 6% (0.8%) of the unvaccinated (vaccinated) susceptible population was symptomatic and asymptomatic, respectively. At 180 days of the NYS pandemic, the model forecast about 25786 deaths by coronavirus. A vaccine with 95% efficacy could reduce the number of deaths from 25786 to 3784. CONCLUSION: The proposed compartmental model can be used to mimic different possible scenarios of the pandemic not only in NYS, but in any country or region. Further, for an unvaccinated reproductive number R > 1, we showed that the vaccine's efficacy must be greater than the herd immunity to stop the spread of the COVID-19 disease.","output":"Assessing the impact of vaccination in a COVID-19 compartmental model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The evolution of mankind has constantly been influenced by the pathogens encountered.

BACKGROUND Coronary artery obstruction is a rare but fatal complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). METHODS We lacerated pericardial leaflets in vitro using catheter electrosurgery, and tested leaflet splaying after benchtop TAVR. The procedure was tested in swine. BASILICA was then offered to patients at high risk of coronary obstruction from TAVR and ineligible for surgical aortic valve replacement. BASILICA used marketed devices. Catheters directed an electrified guidewire to traverse and lacerate the aortic leaflet down the center line. TAVR was performed as usual. RESULTS TAVR splayed lacerated bovine pericardial leaflets. BASILICA was successful in pigs, both to left and right cusps. Necropsy revealed full length lacerations with no collateral thermal injury. Seven patients underwent BASILICA on a compassionate basis. Six had failed bioprosthetic valves, both stented and stent-less. Two had severe aortic stenosis, including 1 patient with native disease, 3 had severe aortic regurgitation, and 2 had mixed aortic valve disease. One patient required laceration of both left and right coronary cusps. There was no hemodynamic compromise in any patient following BASILICA. All patients had successful TAVR, with no coronary obstruction, stroke, or any major complications. All patients survived to 30 days. CONCLUSIONS BASILICA may durably prevent coronary obstruction from TAVR. The procedure was successful across a range of presentations, and requires further evaluation in a prospective trial.

Sleep is essential to health, and children and adolescents with primary headaches have more sleep complaints than do healthy controls. A treatment approach that addresses multifactorial causes is likely important. Nonpharmacological interventions seem promising. However, knowledge about effective strategies is limited. The objective of this review is to assess the effect of nonpharmacological interventions in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) among children and adolescents with primary headache in order to identify useful strategies. Patients and methods Outcome measures are pain, sleep, Qol, and coping versus no intervention or control intervention. Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched for eligible trials. ClinicalTrials.gov. was searched for ongoing trials. Initial searches yielded 2588 publications. After initial screening and subsequent full-text review and quality assessment, 13 RCTs reported in 15 articles were selected for review. All reviewers independently assessed study quality using the CONSORT criteria for nonpharmacological interventions. Results Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), including education on pain-related topics, sleep, coping, and stress management, is an effective strategy for reducing headache and pain within groups over time. Fifteen studies assessed pain, 3 studies assessed sleep, 6 studies assessed Qol, and 11 studies assessed coping. Conclusion Strategies identified as useful were parts of CBT interventions. However, it was not possible to identify a single effective intervention addressing pain, sleep, Qol, and coping in children and adolescents with headache, primarily because sleep was infrequently addressed. Various aspects of Qol and coping strategies were assessed, rendering comparison difficult. Strategies for future interventions should include descriptions of theory-driven CBT interventions, depending on clinical setting and based on local resources, to promote a solid evidence base for nonpharmacological interventions.","output":"Nonpharmacological Interventions Addressing Pain, Sleep, and Quality of Life in Children and Adolescents with Primary Headache: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims at providing new insights into poverty, vulnerability, and their correlates in Mozambique, applying synthetic panels techniques and expanding on earlier analyses.

With worsening diffuse ST-segment elevation on electrocardiograms and reduced ejection fraction on echocardiography in the setting of systemic inflammation, fulminant myocarditis was highly suspected. Despite optimal medical treatment, the patient's condition deteriorated and was complicated by cardiac arrest that failed resuscitation. Although myocarditis was initially suspected, the autopsy revealed no evidence of myocarditis or pericarditis but did demonstrate multiple microscopic sites of myocardial ischemia together with thrombi in the left atrium and pulmonary vasculature. Additionally, scattered microscopic cardiomyocyte necrosis with pathological diagnosis of small vessel micro-thrombotic occlusions. These findings are potentially exacerbated by inflammation-induced coagulopathy, hypoxia, hypotension, and stress, that is, a multifactorial etiology.

Laboratory experiments with various polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polycarbonate (PC) and gelatin filters in conjunction with Button? Inhalable samplers and three-piece cassettes were undertaken. Both biological and non-biological test aerosols were used: Bacillus atrophaeus, MS2, polystyrene latex (PSL), and sodium chloride (NaCl). The B.atrophaeus endospores had an aerodynamic diameter of 900 nm, whereas MS2 virion particles ranged from 10 to 80 nm. Monodisperse 350 nm PSL particles were used as this size was believed to have the lowest filtration efficiency. NaCl solution (1% weight by volume) was used to create a polydisperse aerosol in the 10C600 nm range. The physical collection efficiency was determined by measuring particle concentrations size-selectively upstream and downstream of the filters. The PTFE and gelatin filters showed excellent collection efficiency (>93%) for all of the test particles. The PC filters showed lower collection efficiency for small particles especially <100 nm. Among the tested filters, the lowest collection efficiencies, 49 and 22%, were observed for 1 and 3-m pore size PC filters at the particle sizes of 47 and 63 nm, respectively. The results indicate that the effect of filter material is more significant for the size range of single virions than for bacteria. The effect of filter loading was examined by exposing filters to mixtures of PSL particles, which aimed at mimicking typical indoor dust levels and size distributions.

The baseline sample included 1957 participants (response rate: 99.03%) and followed up at 1-year later (n = 1836, retention rate: 93.8%). Anxiety symptoms, childhood maltreatment, the tendency of coping styles, morning cortisol level, depressive symptoms, self-esteem, and other demographics were measured. Overall, the mean age of the baseline students was 13.6 (SD: 1.5) years. The final results showed that childhood emotional abuse (unstandardized -estimate = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.07C0.18), physical abuse (unstandardized -estimate = 0.08, 95% CI = 0.01C0.16), and sexual abuse (unstandardized -estimate = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.04C0.29) were positively associated with anxiety symptoms at follow-up after adjusting for significant covariates at baseline. Additionally, the stratified analyses demonstrated that only among students with negative coping styles, childhood emotional abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse were associated with subsequent anxiety symptoms; the differences between the positive and negative coping style strata were significant (P < 0.05).

The study was conducted by retrospective analysis of COVID-19 records from the ministry of health between the months of September 2020 and August 2021. The environmental data such as average temperature (C), humidity (%), wind speed (m/s) and sun exposure (kwh/m(2)) were retrieved from official sites. The data was analyzed to determine the effect of these factors on the spread of COVID-19. SPSS IBM 25 software was used to conduct the analysis and p < 0.05 was considered to indicate the significance of the results. RESULTS: According to the findings, the rate of infection was greater between April and July 2021. Six climatic zones experienced high temperatures, little humidity, consistent wind flow, and intense sun exposure throughout this time. The correlation study revealed a significant (p < 0.05) relationship between the environmental factors and the spread of COVID-19. The data suggested that during summer condition when the weather is hot, less humid, and steady wind flow with lots of sun exposure, the COVID-19 infection rate got augmented in Saudi Arabia.

The neuroimmune mechanism(s) that produces SARS-CoV-2-induced neuroinflammation has not been characterized. Proposed mechanisms include peripheral cytokine signaling to the brain and/or direct viral infection of the CNS. Here, we explore the novel hypothesis that a structural protein (S1) derived from SARS-CoV-2 functions as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) to induce neuroinflammatory processes independent of viral infection. Prior evidence suggests that the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is inflammatory in vitro and signals through the pattern recognition receptor TLR4. Therefore, we examined whether the S1 subunit is sufficient to drive 1) a behavioral sickness response, 2) a neuroinflammatory response, 3) direct activation of microglia in vitro, and 4) activation of transgenic human TLR2 and TLR4 HEK293 cells. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intra-cisterna magna (ICM) with vehicle or S1. In-cage behavioral monitoring (8 h post-ICM) demonstrated that S1 reduced several behaviors, including total activity, self-grooming, and wall-rearing. S1 also increased social avoidance in the juvenile social exploration test (24 h post-ICM). S1 increased and/or modulated neuroimmune gene expression (Iba1, Cd11b, MhcII, Cd200r1, Gfap, Tlr2, Tlr4, Nlrp3, Il1b, Hmgb1) and protein levels (IFN, IL-1, TNF, CXCL1, IL-2, IL-10), which varied across brain regions (hypothalamus, hippocampus, and frontal cortex) and time (24 h and 7d) post-S1 treatment. Direct exposure of microglia to S1 resulted in increased gene expression (Il1b, Il6, Tnf, Nlrp3) and protein levels (IL-1, IL-6, TNF, CXCL1, IL-10). S1 also activated TLR2 and TLR4 receptor signaling in HEK293 transgenic cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that structural proteins derived from SARS-CoV-2 might function independently as PAMPs to induce neuroinflammatory processes via pattern recognition receptor engagement.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 subunit induces neuroinflammatory, microglial and behavioral sickness responses: Evidence of PAMP-like properties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors model the evolution of the number of confi rmed cases of COVID-19 in Germany.

Here, we compared B.1.617 variants for neutralization resistance by convalescent sera, mRNA vaccine-elicited sera, and therapeutic neutralizing antibodies using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and AY.1 pseudoviruses showed a modest 1.5- to 4.4-fold reduction in neutralization by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited sera.

If ischemia is the mechanism, can supplemental oxygen reduce pain? The Reducing Tourniquet Associated Pain study investigated whether this simple treatment could extend tourniquet tolerance time to facilitate hand surgery under local or regional anesthesia. METHODS The Reducing Tourniquet Associated Pain study was a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of healthy volunteers. Participants received either 50% inhaled oxygen or air placebo via a face mask for 3 minutes before and up to 30 minutes after upper arm tourniquet inflation to 250 mmHg. Pain scores were recorded at 2-minute intervals using a validated 100-mm visual analogue scale. The primary outcomes were (1) difference in visual analogue scale score and (2) difference in time taken to reach visual analogue score of 40 mm or more in oxygen and air groups. RESULTS Fifty participants enrolled and, after exclusion criteria were applied, 46 were analyzed (oxygen, n = 23; air, n = 23). Oxygen supplementation was associated with a 29 percent mean reduction in pain on visual analogue scoring compared with air placebo over the entire period of inhalation (p = 0.027).

In multiplex immunoassay analyses of MAPK phosphoproteins in acutely isolated microglia and brain tissue from 5xFAD mice, we found phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was the most strongly upregulated phosphoprotein within the MAPK pathway in acutely isolated microglia, but not whole-brain tissue from 5xFAD mice. The importance of ERK signaling in primary microglia cultures was next investigated using transcriptomic profiling and functional assays of amyloid- and neuronal phagocytosis, which confirmed that ERK is a critical regulator of IFN-mediated pro-inflammatory activation of microglia, although it was also partly important for constitutive microglial functions. Phospho-ERK was an upstream regulator of disease-associated microglial gene expression (Trem2, Tyrobp), as well as several human AD risk genes (Bin1, Cd33, Trem2, Cnn2), indicative of the importance of microglial ERK signaling in AD pathology. Quantitative proteomic analyses of postmortem human brain showed that ERK1 and ERK2 were the only MAPK proteins with increased protein expression and positive associations with neuropathological grade. In a human brain phosphoproteomic study, we found evidence for increased flux through the ERK signaling pathway in AD. Overall, our analyses strongly suggest that ERK phosphorylation, particularly in microglia in mouse models, is a regulator of pro-inflammatory immune responses in AD pathogenesis.","output":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinase regulates microglial immune responses in Alzheimer's disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Atemnot, auch als Dyspnoe bezeichnet, ist ein h?ufiges und l?hmendes Symptom.

At autopsy, bone marrow, lymphoid tissue, and brain tissue from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)infected individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and those without AIDS and from HIV-uninfected individuals were screened for parvovirus B19, PARV4, and HBoV DNA by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses. Results. B19 DNA was detected both in HIV-infected study subjects (13 of 24) and in HIV-uninfected study subjects (8 of 8), whereas PARV4 DNA was detected only in HIV-infected study subjects (17 of 24). HBoV DNA was not detected in any study subjects. The degree of immunosuppression with HIV infection did not influence B19 or PARV4 viral loads. B19 or PARV4 plasma viremia was not detected in any study subjects (n = 76; viral load <25 DNA copies/mL). A significantly older age distribution was found for study subjects infected with B19 genotype 2, compared with those infected with B19 genotype 1. Two genotypes of PARV4 were detected; study subjects carrying prototype PARV4 (genotype 1) were younger (all born after 1958) than those infected with genotype 2 (PARV5; study subjects born between 1949 and 1956). Conclusions. Tight immune control of replication of B19 and PARV4 was retained despite profound immunosuppression. Recent genotype replacement of PARV4, combined with absent sequence diversity among genotype 1 sequences, suggests a recent, epidemic spread in the United Kingdom, potentially through transmission routes shared by HIV.","output":"Comparison of Tissue Distribution, Persistence, and Molecular Epidemiology of Parvovirus B19 and Novel Human Parvoviruses PARV4 and Human Bocavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been a significant research focus since its discovery in 2012. Since 2012, 2,040 cases and 712 deaths have been recorded (as of August 11, 2017), representing a strikingly high case fatality rate of 36%. Over the last several years, MERS-CoV research has progressed in several parallel and complementary directions. This review will focus on three particular areas: the origins and evolution of MERS-CoV, the challenges and achievements in the development of MERS-CoV animal models, and our understanding of how novel proteins unique to MERS-CoV counter the host immune response. The origins of MERS-CoV, likely in African bats, are increasingly clear, although important questions remain about the establishment of dromedary camels as a reservoir seeding human outbreaks. Likewise, there have been important advances in the development of animal models, and both non-human primate and mouse models that seem to recapitulate human disease are now available. How MERS-CoV evades and inhibits the host innate immune response remains less clear. Although several studies have identified MERS-CoV proteins as innate immune antagonists, little of this work has been conducted using live virus under conditions of actual infection, but rather with ectopically expressed proteins. Accordingly, considerable space remains for major contributions to understanding unique ways in which MERS-CoV interacts with and modulates the host response.

Contraction occurs mainly in the lateral epidermal cells, while the dorsoventral epidermis plays a more passive role. Two parallel pathways trigger actinomyosin contraction, one mediated by LET-502/Rho kinase and the other by PAK-1/p21 activated kinase. A number of genes mediating morphogenesis have been shown to be sufficient when expressed either laterally or dorsoventrally. Additional genes show either lateral or dorsoventral phenotypes. This led us to a model where contractile genes have discrete functions in one or the other cell type. We tested this by examining several genes for either lateral or dorsoventral sufficiency. LET-502 expression in the lateral cells was sufficient to drive elongation. MEL-11/Myosin phosphatase, which antagonizes contraction, and PAK-1 were expected to function dorsoventrally, but we could not detect tissue-specific sufficiency. Double mutants of lethal alleles predicted to decrease lateral contraction with those thought to increase dorsoventral force were previously shown to be viable. We hypothesized that these mutant combinations shifted the contractile force from the lateral to the dorsoventral cells and so the embryos would elongate with less lateral cell contraction. This was tested by examining ten single and double mutant strains. In most cases, elongation proceeded without a noticeable alteration in lateral contraction. We suggest that many embryonic elongation genes likely act in both lateral and dorsoventral cells, even though they may have their primary focus in one or the other cell type.","output":"Tissue-specific regulation of epidermal contraction during C. elegans embryonic morphogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To the best of our knowledge, here, we describe the first hospital-wide outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 that occurred in Germany in April 2020.

However, the prognostic meaning and time-line changes of lung injury assessed by LUS in COVID-19 hospitalised patients, is unknown. METHODS: Prospective cohort study designed to analyse prognostic value of LUS in COVID-19 patients by using a quantitative scale (LUZ-score) during the first 72a? h after admission. Primary endpoint was in-hospital death and/or admission to the intensive care unit. Total length of hospital stay, increase of oxygen flow or escalate medical treatment during the first 72a? h, were secondary endpoints. RESULTS: 130 patients were included in the final analysis; mean age was 56.713.5a? years. Time since the beginning of symptoms until admission was 6a? days (4-9). Lung injury assessed by LUZ-score did not differ during the first 72a? h (21 points [16-26] at admission versus 20 points [16-27] at 72a? h; p=0.183).

An unbiased setting to measure overdiagnosis in breast cancer screening requires comparative data from a screened and an unscreened cohort for at least 30 years. Such randomized data will not become available, leaving us with observational data over shorter time periods and outcomes of modelling. This collaborative effort of the International Cancer Screening Network quantified the variation in estimated breast cancer overdiagnosis in organized programs with evaluation of both observed and simulated data, and presented examples of how modelling can provide additional insights. Reliable observational data, analysed with study design accounting for methodological pitfalls, and modelling studies with different approaches, indicate that overdiagnosis accounts for less than 10% of invasive breast cancer cases in a screening target population of women aged 50 to 69. Estimates above this level are likely to derive from inaccuracies in study design. The widely discrepant estimates of overdiagnosis reported from observational data could substantially be reduced by use of a cohort study design with at least 10 years of follow-up after screening stops. In contexts where concomitant opportunistic screening or gradual implementation of screening occurs, and data on valid comparison groups are not readily available, modelling of screening intervention becomes an advantageous option to obtain reliable estimates of breast cancer overdiagnosis.

Seven test microorganisms were prepared and inoculated on the surface of seven types of PPE (respirator mask, face shield, shoe, glove, cap, safety glasses and lab coat). The tests were performed on previously contaminated PPE using a manikin with a motion device for exposure to the chamber with biocidal agent (sodium hypochlorite) for 10 and 30s. In 96.93% of the experimental conditions analyzed, the percentage reduction was >99% (the number of viable cells found on the surface ranged from 4.3x10(6) to <10 CFU/mL). The samples of E. faecalis collected from the glove showed the lowest percentages reduction, with 86.000 and 86.500% for exposure times of 10 and 30 s, respectively.

We aim to explore the impact of domestic tethers on the career paths of physicians by studying gendered differences in domestic burdens of physicians as well as differences in perceptions around the impact of domestic work on professional advancement. METHODS: A web-based survey including 38 questions was sent to all 3866 physician alumni of the top academic medical school in Lebanon. Data was collected between November 2018 and January 2019, with up to three invite reminders. Overall, 382 were included in the final analysis, 124 women (32%), 258 men (68%). RESULTS: The study had a response rate of 10.4%. Findings show that a greater percentage of men were married and had children (77.5% vs 62.1%, p = 0.004, 77.9% vs 51.6%, <0.001, respectively). Majority of both women and men held full-time positions (82.1% and 87.1%), having children however reduced the odds significantly [OR = 0.2, 95% CI: (0.1C0.6), p = 0.01]for women, while only older age reduced it for men (OR = 0.1,95% CI: (0.04C0.2), p<0.001]. Among full-time physicians, men and women spent similar time on professional activities (60.2hrs/wk vs 58.3hrs/wk, p = 0.32). Women spent more time on parenting and household work (23.5hrs/wk vs 10.4hrs/wk, <0.001; 8.9hrs/wk vs 6.0hrs/wk, p = 0.001, respectively). Women physicians spouses contributed to 14.5 hours/week of total time on domestic activities whereas men physicians spouses spent two folds more time on domestic activities (35.0 hours/week, P<0.001). Of physicians with children, a higher percentage of women than men reported that children prevented their career advancement or their participation in development opportunities (43.8% vs 15.9%, p<0.001; 50.0% vs 19.4%, p<0.001, respectively). A greater percentage of women than men scaled back their career after first child (31.3% vs 3.5%, <0.001). Of married/partnered physicians, fewer women than men reported their career took priority over their partners when conflicts arose, (52.0% vs 86.0%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the heavier impact of domestic tethers on the career paths of women physicians than men physicians. Men are more likely than women to hold full-time positions in the early advancement defining phases of their careers. Full-time women shoulder more domestic work than men and experience more professional advancement concessions.

Five major identity themes were identified: Clinician, Dispenser, Business Person, Patient Counsellor and Physician Supporter. The dispenser identity was the most widespread, but it was viewed by many pharmacists as undesirable. The clinician identity also had a strong presence but was viewed as an identity that pharmacists aspire to embody. CONCLUSIONS This scoping review illustrates that pharmacists do not uniformly perceive themselves to be clinicians.

The proposed hypothesis suggests that the Gyrodactylidae originated on the South American continent about 60 Mya after geographical dispersal and host switching of its common ancestor to demersal freshwater catfishes by a marine ancestor. Development of hyperviviparity and the consequent loss of sticky eggs in conjunction with other symplesiomorphic and apomorphic features allowed rapid diversification coupled with high dispersal to new host groups and geographical areas by viviparous members of the Gyrodactylidae.","output":"Context of diversification of the viviparous Gyrodactylidae (Platyhelminthes, Monogenoidea)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has provided an unparalleled experience of disruption of individual everyday routinary lives as well as of societal organization. Sport as a field of practices and as an economic sector has been strongly affected by the lockdown as a global response, suffering from the shutdown of competitive sports at all levels and from the postponement of mega-events. Within these hard times, imposing strong limitations to the possibility for athletes and the general population to move around, work out and socialize, sport workers were compelled to come up with new ways to make people exercise: one of the solutions adopted has been by using social media and online platforms to host training activities. In this article we will analyze data from an online survey involving coaches, athletic trainers and other sport workers from three sport sub-fields: a team sport, basketball;an individual sport, tennis;and a wide array of activities, the fitness and wellness world. We will focus on the impact of going online in those three sport subfield, exploring the different attitudes and practices adopted to adjust sport training by providing exercising through online communication devices without physical co- presence. ? 2021.

Aquatic ecosystems seem at particular risk from invasive species because of threats to biodiversity and human needs for water resources. Here, we review some known aspects of aquatic invasive species (AIS) and explore several new questions. We describe impacts of AIS, factors limiting their dispersal, and the role that humans play in transporting AIS. We also review the characteristics of species that should be the greatest threat for future invasions, including those that pave the way for invasions by other species (invasional meltdown). Susceptible aquatic communities, such as reservoirs, may serve as stepping stones for invasions of new landscapes. Some microbes disperse long distance, infect new hosts and grow in the external aquatic medium, a process that has consequences for human health. We also discuss the interaction between species invasions and other human impacts (climate change, landscape conversion), as well as the possible connection of invasions with regime shifts in lakes. Since many invaders become permanent features of the environment, we discuss how humans live with invasive species, and conclude with questions for future research.","output":"Aquatic invasive species: challenges for the future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, called coronavirus disease - 2019 (COVID-19), has affected more than 200 countries across the globe with a higher fatality rate among the elderly population. Aim of the study is to highlight the vulnerability of the aged amidst the current COVID-19 pandemic, and in the light of the recent international evidence, suggests what government could do to mitigate their vulnerability. METHODS: Data from the recently released (November 2019) 75th Round National Sample Survey (NSS), which was conducted from July 2017 to June 2018, across 8077 rural villages and 6181 urban wards was used for this study. Data collected from 555,115 individuals (rural: 325,232; urban: 229,232) included 42,762 elderly individuals (60 years or above). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used for the calculation. RESULTS: Of the total sample of elderly individuals, 27.7% reported suffering from an ailment in the last 15 days, whereas 8.5% had been hospitalized during the last 365 days. Among the elderly, hospitalization rate was higher in the urban areas (OR: 1.23), general social category (OR: 1.18), richest economic quintile (OR: 1.69), and among those living alone (OR: 2.40). Also, among the elderly, 64% of those in the scheduled tribe (social group) and 51% in the poorest economic quintile utilized public facilities for hospitalization. Cardiovascular ailments were the major cause for hospitalization (18.1%) and outpatient visit (32%) among the elderly. Ailments related to diabetes and hypertension constituted 55% of outpatient visit for the elderly. Only 18.9% of the elderly had health insurance though chances of facing catastrophic health expenditures were high among the elderly. 6.6% of elderly female and 1.6% male live alone, and 27.5% of age 80 years and above are immobile. 50% of male and 90% of female are financially dependent on others and more so in poorer economic quintiles. CONCLUSIONS: The vulnerability of Indias elderly increases across economic levels, and other dimensions such as the place of residence, gender, social group (caste), marital status, living arrangements, surviving children, and economic dependence. The current COVID-19 pandemic poses a greater risk of social isolation among the elderly, which may cause detrimental health impact.

High-affinity variants of sACE2, engineered using high-throughput mutagenesis, are capable of neutralizing COVID-19 infection as decoy receptors. These variants compete with native ACE2 present on cells by binding with spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, making native ACE2 on cell surfaces available to convert angiotensin II to angiotensin-1,7, thus alleviating the exaggerated inflammatory response associated with COVID-19 infection.

Over 80% of adults aged 65 and older have multiple chronic conditions. Concerns have arisen about how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the management of chronic conditions. Delay, avoidance, and poor management of healthcare during the COVID- 19 pandemic may increase the risk of unnecessary hospitalizations and mortality. This study aims to understand the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare access in a U.S. sample of Americans 50 years of age or older. Participants completed an online survey about healthcare access and other risk factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multinomial regression analysis examined the results of two key access points: healthcare provider /doctor (n=468) and medication (n=754). One-half (56%) of those who needed access to a provider were able to be seen. Participants who were older, had multiple chronic conditions, and those with a provider were more likely to have access. However, when individuals with more chronic conditions did not have access, they indicated that this lack of access was due to COVID-19. When not receiving access to medications, unemployed participants attributed the lack of access more often to COVID-19 than other reasons. These findings demonstrate an important lack of access to providers and medication among older adults during the pandemic. In multivariate models, this lack of access was most often due to COVID-19, in addition to traditional factors such as insurance, employment, and medical and behavioral comorbidity.

Miers (Menispermaceae) is a Mediterranean herb, used in Ayurvedic, Siddha, Unani, and folk medicines. The herb is also used in conventional medicine to treat oxidative stress-related diseases and conditions, including inflammation, pain, diarrhea, asthma, respiratory infections, cancer, diabetes, and gastrointestinal disorders. AIM OF THE REVIEW The taxonomy, botanical classification, geographical distribution, and ethnobotanical uses of T. cordifolia, as well as the phytochemical compounds found in the herb, the toxicology of and pharmacological and clinical studies on the effects of T. cordifolia are all covered in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS To gather information on T. cordifolia, we used a variety of scientific databases, including Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, and Springer Link. The information discussed focuses on biologically active compounds found in T. cordifolia, and common applications and pharmacological activity of the herb, as well as toxicological and clinical studies on its properties. RESULTS The findings of this study reveal a connection between the use of T. cordifolia in conventional medicine and its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, antidiabetic, anticancer, immunomodulatory, and other biological effects. The entire plant, stem, leaves, root, and extracts of T. cordifolia have been shown to have a variety of biological activities, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiviral, antiparasitic, antidiabetic, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic, hepatoprotective, and cardioprotective impact. Toxicological testing demonstrated that this plant may have medicinal applications. T. cordifolia contains a variety of biologically active compounds from various chemical classes, including alkaloids, terpenoids, sitosterols, flavonoids, and phenolic acids. Based on the reports researched for this review, we believe that chemicals in T. cordifolia may activate Nrf2, which leads to the overexpression of antioxidant enzymes such as CAT, GPx, GST, and GR, and thereby induces the adaptive response to oxidative stress. T. cordifolia is also able to reduce NF-B signalling by inhibiting PI3K/Akt, activating AMPK and sirtuins, and downregulating PI3K/Akt. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that the pharmacological properties displayed by T. cordifolia back up its conventional uses. Antimicrobial, antiviral, antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, antidiabetic, nephroprotective, gastroprotective, hepatoprotective, and cardioprotective activities were all demonstrated in T. cordifolia stem extracts. To validate pharmacodynamic targets, further research is needed to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of the known compounds against gastrointestinal diseases, inflammatory processes, and microbial infections, as immunostimulants, and in chemotherapy. The T. cordifolia safety profile was confirmed in a toxicological analysis, which prompted pharmacokinetic assessment testing to confirm its bioavailability.","output":"Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.)

Though the number of COVID-19 cases is still increasing in almost infected areas, normal activities are coming back with health care protocols where public areas are opened as usual with certain restrictions. In order to have observations of spreading impact of COVID-19, the basic reproduction number (Ro) i.e. the reproduction number (Ro) is the ratio between 2 parameters of SIR model where SIR stands for Susceptible individuals, Infected individuals, and Recovered individuals respectively. The reproduction numbers are computed as discrete values depending on time. The used research method is finite difference scheme for computing rate of change parameters in SIR models based on the COVID-19 cases in Indonesia (global area), Jakarta (medium area) and Salatiga (small area) by considering the number of people in these areas respectively. The simple forward finite difference is employed to the SIR model to have time dependent of parameters. The second approach is using the governing linear system to obtain the values of parameter daily. These parameters are computed for each day such that the values of Ro are obtained as function of time. The research result shows that 3 types areas give the same profiles of parameters that the rate of changes of reproduction numbers are decreasing with respect to time. This concludes that the reproduction numbers are most likely decreasing.","output":"Simple forward finite difference for computing reproduction number of COVID-19 in Indonesia during the new normal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tailings dams are large, often self-contained, storage facilities of mine residue. On self-contained tailings dams the tailings material itself is used to raise the containment embankments holding newly deposited residue. To develop the necessary strength, it is essential that material must dry out sufficiently. Despite substantial advancements in the field of instrumentation, these parameters are rarely measured on tailings dams and their evolution over time is poorly understood. Understanding the role of pore water suction and water content evolution over time can benefit from the installation of sensors and data acquisition systems (DAQ) capable of continuously monitoring these parameters. Such monitoring remains difficult and expensive owing to the challenges of measuring negative water pressures and the often-remote locations and harsh operating environments typical of mining operations. This paper describes the development, testing and validation of a low-cost DAQ for the measurement of the unsaturated pore pressure regime in a platinum tailings dam located in the Limpopo province of South Africa. The Tailings Dam DAQ (referred to as TD-DAQ) is designed to measure the negative pore pressure, moisture content and temperature in fine-grained material over extended periods of time. These measurements are stored on the DAQ and transmitted in parallel using new wireless network communications technologies (Sigfox) suited to remote, battery powered applications. The successful deployment of the TD-DAQ presents a real-time, low-cost instrumentation solution to improve the efficiency of condition monitoring of tailings storage facilities, contributing to a reduction in the probability of failure events.","output":"TD-DAQ: A low-cost data acquisition system monitoring the unsaturated pore pressure regime in tailings dams"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Le syndrome de Guillain-Barr est une PRNA.

Herein, we have applied bioinformatics approach for screening of chemical compounds from Indian spices as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDBID: 6Y84). The structure files of Indian spices chemical compounds were taken from PubChem database or Zinc database and screened by molecular docking, by using AutoDock-4.2, MGLTools-1.5.6, Raccoon virtual screening tools. Top 04 hits based on their highest binding affinity were analyzed. Carnosol exhibited highest binding affinity -8.2 Kcal/mol and strong and stable interactions with the amino acid residues present on the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Arjunglucoside-I (-7.88 Kcal/mol) and Rosmanol (-7.99 Kcal/mol) also showed a strong and stable binding affinity with favourable ADME properties. These compounds on MD simulations for 50 ns shows strong hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protein active site and remains stable inside the active site.

Artificial insemination is an essential process to establish hybrid lines and for the operation of sperm repositories. The existing mouth-pipetting technique for artificial insemination of live-bearing fishes has not been substantially upgraded since the first implementation in the 1950s. The goal of this work was to develop a standardized artificial inseminator device (SAID) to address issues routinely encountered in insemination by mouth-pipetting, including lack of reproducibility among different users, difficulty in training, and large unreportable variation in sample volume and pressure during insemination. Prototypes of the SAID were designed as relatively inexpensive (<USD 80) open hardware based on commercially available and 3-D printed components to enable broad community access. A linear actuator was used to accurately control the position of a piston for fluid transfer with a standard deviation of <0.1 mm over a 4 mm range of travel. The volume of sample transfer was precisely controlled with a linear relationship (r2 > 0.99) between the piston position and volume. Pressure generation from eight mouth-pipetting operators and SAID prototypes were assessed by pressure sensors. The pressure control by SAID was superior to that produced by mouth-pipetting, yielding lower pressures (31-483 Pa) and smaller variations (standard deviation <11 Pa). These pressures were sufficient to deliver 1-5 L of fluid into female reproductive tracts yet low enough to avoid physical injury to fish. Community-level enhancements of the SAID prototype could enable standardized insemination with minimal training and facilitate the participation of research communities in the use of cryopreserved genetic resources.","output":"An Open-Hardware Insemination Device for Small-Bodied Live-Bearing Fishes to Support Development and Use of Germplasm Repositories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A big race for the search for novel lead has begun due to the emergence of COVID-19 across the globe.

In order to better public health, the economic and environmental atmosphere must be stable and clean, respectively. Thus, this paper emphasizes on nexus between economic, public health, and the environment. Therefore, the objective of this paper is whether healthcare and environmental expenditures affect economic efficiency and vice versa. So, this study evaluates the performance of the country's economic efficiency and investigates the effect of healthcare and environmental expenditures for 62 Belt and Road Initiative countries for the period from 1996 to 2020. Suitable input-output variables are employed under the framework of DEA-window and Malmquist Index Productivity, and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). In addition, this study estimates the relationship between economic efficiency, healthcare, and environmental expenditures by fixed and random effects models. Therefore, the analytical outcomes reveal that countries are economically efficient. On the contrary, SFA estimation concludes that countries are found to be inefficient, because higher variation is exists in efficiency change compared to technological efficiency change and total factor productivity change on average. In addition, it is worth notable that healthcare and environmental expenditures improve the country's economic efficiency. Furthermore, public health is also influenced by economic efficiency. Thus, this study suggests that countries should better utilize given resources and invest a specific portion of national income in order to improve economic efficiency.","output":"Nexus Between Economic Efficiency, Healthcare, and Environmental Expenditures: A Perspective of BRI Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study aims to investigate the impact of project communication on project success with the mediating role of trust and the moderating role of authentic leadership.

Since quarantine can impact on mental health, this study aimed to estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleeping disturbances in the Italian population during lockdown. The factors that might influence such outcomes were explored. A national cross-sectional survey was performed during the last 14 days of the Italian lockdown. Questionnaires assessed socio-demographics characteristic, behaviors and healthcare access. The outcomes were assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire-2 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2. Participants with sleep disturbances completed the Insomnia Severity Index. The sample size was 1515. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderate/severe insomnia. Being female, an increased time spent on the internet and an avoidance of activities through peer pressure increased the likelihood of at least one mental health outcome. Increasing age, an absence of work-related troubles and being married or being a cohabitant reduced such a probability.

Since melatonin is produced in the mitochondria of all other cells in a non-circadian manner, the amount synthesized by the pineal gland is less than 5% of the total. Melatonin produced in mitochondria influences glucose metabolism in all cells. Many pathological cells adopt aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) in which pyruvate is excluded from the mitochondria and remains in the cytosol where it is metabolized to lactate. The entrance of pyruvate into the mitochondria of healthy cells allows it to be irreversibly decarboxylated by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). The exclusion of pyruvate from the mitochondria in pathological cells prevents the generation of acetyl-CoA from pyruvate. This is relevant to mitochondrial melatonin production, as acetyl-CoA is a required co-substrate/co-factor for melatonin synthesis. When PDH is inhibited during aerobic glycolysis or during intracellular hypoxia, the deficiency of acetyl-CoA likely prevents mitochondrial melatonin synthesis. When cells experiencing aerobic glycolysis or hypoxia with a diminished level of acetyl-CoA are supplemented with melatonin or receive it from another endogenous source (pineal-derived), pathological cells convert to a more normal phenotype and support the transport of pyruvate into the mitochondria, thereby re-establishing a healthier mitochondrial metabolic physiology.","output":"Melatonin and Pathological Cell Interactions: Mitochondrial Glucose Processing in Cancer Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"37 Table 1Question Parents feedback How did you find the layout of the new multidisciplinary review clinic? ?

We determined the proportion of screening and surveillance colonoscopies appropriate for rescheduling to a future year through strict adoption of US Multi-Society Task Force (USMSTF) guidelines. METHODS: We conducted a single-center observational study of patients scheduled for open-access colonoscopyordered by a primary care provider without being seen in gastroenterology clinicover a 6-week period during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each chart was reviewed to appropriately assign a surveillance year per USMSTF guidelines including demographics, colonoscopy history and family history. When guidelines recommended a range of colonoscopy intervals, both a conservative and liberal guideline adherence were assessed. RESULTS: We delayed 769 open-access screening or surveillance colonoscopies due to COVID-19. Between 14.8% (conservative) and 20.7% (liberal), colonoscopies were appropriate for rescheduling to a future year. Conversely, 415 (54.0%) patients were overdue for colonoscopy. Family history of CRC was associated with being scheduled too early for both screening (OR 3.9; CI 1.9C8.2) and surveillance colonoscopy (OR 2.6, CI 1.0C6.5). The most common reasons a colonoscopy was inappropriately scheduled this year were failure to use new surveillance colonoscopy intervals (28.9%), incorrectly applied family history guidelines (27.2%) and recommending early surveillance colonoscopy after recent normal colonoscopy (19.3%). CONCLUSION: Up to one-fifth of patients scheduled for open-access colonoscopy can be rescheduled into a future year based on USMSTF guidelines. Rigorously applying guidelines could judiciously allocate colonoscopy resources as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Herein, we present evidence that HIV-1 infects normal HBECs and the viral DNA is integrated in the genome to establish the viral latency. To prove that HIV productively infects HBECs, we demonstrate: (a) along with CXCR4, HBECs express the HIV-receptor CD4, and are induced to express CCR5 by IL-13 treatment; (b) following infection with HIV, HBECs produce HIV-p24 and contain the latent HIV provirus, which is activated by endotoxin and/or vorinostat; (c) DNA from HIV-1 infected HBECs contains the HIV-specific gag and nef genes, along with Alu sequences, confirming the integration of HIV in the host DNA; (d) the lung epithelial cells of HIV-infected subjects and SHIV-infected cynomolgus macaques are positive for HIV-specific transcripts.

METHODS: One hundred forty patients referred for FDG PET/CT during February and March 2021 after first or second vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna were retrospectively included. FDG-avidity of ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes was measured and compared. Assuming no knowledge of prior vaccination, metastatic risk was analyzed by two readers and the clinical impact was evaluated. RESULTS: FDG PET/CT showed FDG-avid lymph nodes ipsilateral to the vaccine injection in 75/140 (54%) patients with a mean SUVmax of 5.1 (range 2.0 - 17.3). FDG-avid lymph nodes were more frequent in patients vaccinated with Moderna than Pfizer-BioNTech (36/50 [72%] vs. 39/90 [43%] cases, p < 0.001). Metastatic risk of unilateral FDG-avid axillary lymph nodes was rated unlikely in 52/140 (37%), potential in 15/140 (11%), and likely in 8/140 (6%) cases. Clinical management was affected in 17/140 (12%) cases. CONCLUSIONS: FDG-avid axillary lymph nodes are common after COVID-19 vaccination. The avidity of lymph nodes is more frequent in Moderna compared to that in Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. To avoid relatively frequent clinical dilemmas, we recommend carefully taking the history for prior vaccination in patients undergoing FDG PET/CT and administering the vaccine contralateral to primary cancer.

One common feature, however, is pulmonary permeability edema, which leads to an increased alveolar diffusion pathway and, subsequently, impaired oxygenation and decarboxylation. A novel inhaled peptide agent (AP301, solnatide) was shown to markedly reduce pulmonary edema in animal models of ARDS and to be safe to administer to healthy humans in a Phase I clinical trial. Here, we present the protocol for a Phase IIB clinical trial investigating the safety and possible future efficacy endpoints in ARDS patients. METHODS: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind intervention study. Patients with moderate to severe ARDS in need of mechanical ventilation will be randomized to parallel groups receiving escalating doses of solnatide or placebo, respectively. Before advancing to a higher dose, a data safety monitoring board will investigate the data from previous patients for any indication of patient safety violations. The intervention (application of the investigational drug) takes places twice daily over the course of 7 days, ensued by a follow-up period of another 21 days. DISCUSSION: The patients to be included in this trial will be severely sick and in need of mechanical ventilation. The amount of data to be collected upon screening and during the course of the intervention phase is substantial and the potential timeframe for inclusion of any given patient is short. However, when prepared properly, adherence to this protocol will make for the acquisition of reliable data. Particular diligence needs to be exercised with respect to informed consent, because eligible patients will most likely be comatose and/or deeply sedated at the time of inclusion.

There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Objective: To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications. Design: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. Setting: News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China. Measurements: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. Results: There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Limitation: Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases. Conclusion: This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS.

However, the potential interaction between gut microbiota and host metabolism in growing hens under metabolic disorder induced by chronic heat exposure (CHE) remains inconclusive. The aim of our study was to examine the potential association among the cecal microbiota community, physiological indicators, and serum metabolite profiles in CHE hens. One hundred and eighty Hy-Line Brown hens were randomly allocated into three groups: thermoneutral control (TN), heat stress (HS), and pair-fed (PF). The experiment lasted for 5 weeks, with the first 2 weeks serving as the adaptation period. Results showed that the expression level of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in both serum and cecal tissues was significantly increased in the HS group. Serum parameters analysis also revealed that CHE caused physiological function damage and metabolic disorders. These results suggest the experiment was successful, inducing chronic heat stress. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis showed that the CHE can clearly induce dysbiosis of the gut microbial community reflected in the increment of the F/B ratio. Besides, serum untargeted metabolomics revealed the relative concentrations of 40 metabolites were significantly altered in the HS group compared with the TN group. Pathway analysis showed that these metabolites were mainly involving the increased proteolysis rather than lipolysis, and this tendency could be a specific metabolic adaptation of the poultry. The pair-feed experiment showed that the above changes induced by CHE were partly independent from the reduction of feed intake. Mantel correlation analysis between gut microorganisms and physiological indicators showed that the phylum Firmicutes and Euryarchaeota have a potential interaction with a serum lipid parameter. Random forest analysis showed that both genus Faecalibacterium and Methanobrevibacter were important predictors of the CHE-induced lipid metabolism disorder. Taken together, our findings may contribute to a better understanding of the metabolic mechanisms underlying the energy metabolism imbalance caused by the CHE and provide novel insights into the host-microbes interactions and its effects on the metabolic adaptation of hens under chronic heat exposure.","output":"Gut Microbiota and Serum Metabolite Potential Interactions in Growing Layer Hens Exposed to High-Ambient Temperature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic reminds people of the 1918 influenza pandemic which lasted for two years and which is estimated to have taken between 17 million to 50 million lives.

Patients were directly discharged in 55.2% of cases in 2020, as opposed to 47.8% in 2019 (P = 0.044); referred directly for physiotherapy in 32.9% of cases in 2020, as opposed to 28.9% in 2019 (P = 0.173); and referred to a fracture clinic in 11.9% of cases in 2020, as opposed to 23.7% in 2019 (P < 0.001). Also, 3.0% of patients returned to the clinic after discharge in 2020, compared with 4.4% in 2019 (P = 0.237); 4.5% of patients were referred for surgery in 2020, as opposed to 2.2% in 2019 (P = 0.105). The VFC proved to be an efficient tool in managing ambulatory trauma throughout the pandemic. Upscaling the VFC to include all ambulatory trauma is a safe, effective method in reducing clinic attendances and hospital footfall, whilst ensuring that high care standards are maintained.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic research of the literature, collecting data regarding the evidence on tumor degeneration from AWE after CS. Moreover, we reported a case of clear cell borderline tumor (CCBT) originating from AWE. RESULTS: We included data of 37 patients with diagnosis of CCC. The average time between the last CS and the diagnosis of CCC was around 15 years. Overall, 26.0% and 73.9% patients received exclusive local abdominal resection of the lesion and additional surgery, respectively. Lymph nodes involvement was detected in 26.0 % patients and adjuvant chemotherapy was administered in 52.0 % cases. During follow-up period, 15.2% patients died of disease, 32.6% had no evidence of disease, and 17.4% recurred. We diagnosed a CCBT arose in a patients with AWE and a personal history of several surgical procedures for endometriosis, a CS and a subsequent transverse laparotomy. We performed an open bilateral ovariectomy and a large excision of the endometriotic abdominal lesion. CONCLUSION: Tumor degeneration from AWE seems to be a real occurrence with an increasing number of events. Considering the lack of risk factors and diagnostic instruments for tumor degeneration, the removal of AWE localization could be advisable, even though there was long average time between the trigger surgery and the tumor finding.","output":"Clear cell degeneration associated with endometriosis of abdominal wall after cesarean section: A case report and systematic review of literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic had a considerable impact on US healthcare systems, straining hospital resources, staff, and operations. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on incidence and trends of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in a network of hospitals. Methods This was a retrospective review of central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), C. difficile infections (CDI), and ventilator-associated events (VAE) in 51 hospitals from 2018 to 2021. Descriptive statistics were reported as mean hospital-level monthly incidence rates (IR) and compared using Poisson regression GEE models with period as the only covariate. Segmented regression (SR) analysis was performed to estimate changes in monthly IR of CAUTIs, CLABSIs and CDI in the baseline period (01/2018 C 02/2020) and the Pandemic period (03/2020 C 03/2021). SR model was not appropriate for VAE based on the plot. All models were constructed using SAS v.9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary NC). Results Compared to the baseline period, CLABSIs increased significantly by 50% from 0.6 to 0.9/ 1000 catheter days (P< 0. 001). In contrast, no significant changes were identified for CAUTI (P=0.87). Similar trends were seen in SR models for CLABSI and CAUTI (Figures 1, 2 and Table 1). While overall CDIs decreased significantly from 3.5 to 2.5/10,000 patient days in the pandemic period (P< 0.001), SR model showed increasing pandemic trend change (Figure 3). VAEs increased > 700% from 6.9 to 59.7/1000 ventilator days (P=0.15), but displayed considerable variation during the pandemic period (Figure 4). Compared to baseline period, there was a significant increase in central line days (647 vs 677, P=0.02), ventilator days (156 vs 215, P< 0.001), but no change in urinary catheter days (675 vs 686, P=0.32) during the pandemic period. Figure 1: Segmented Regression model showing baseline and pandemic period trends of CLABSI Figure 2: Segmented Regression model showing baseline and pandemic period trends of CAUTI Figure 3: Segmented Regression model showing baseline and pandemic period trends of C. difficile (HO-CDI) infections Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with substantial increases in CLABSIs and VAEs, no change in CAUTIs, and an increasing trend in CDI incidence. These variations in trends of different HAIs are likely due, in part, to unique characteristics of the underlying infection, resource shortages, staffing concerns, increased device use, changes in testing practices, and the limitations of surveillance definitions.

Nevertheless, current vaccines must be ultra-cold or cold-stored. Vaccine coolers' energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions lead to a significant environmental impact. This article predicts the environmental and energy impacts of some COVID-19 vaccines: Moderna, Janssen, CoronaVac, Pfizer, AstraZenecaCOxfordCCovishield, and Sputnik V, in terms of carbon dioxide emissions using a new approach for the TEWI (Total Equivalent Warming Impact) methodology, with several options of refrigerants from halogenated to natural fluids such as propane, which is natural gas with low GWP (global warming potential). Through the application of new optimization indexes, it is concluded that the evaporation temperature of the refrigerant gas has a great influence on the sizing of the coolers. For example, for the same number of vaccines, the thermal load of Pfizer is more than double that of AstraZenecaCCovishield, CoronaVac, or Janssen, while the direct environmental impact is seven times greater. Another relevant factor is the choice of refrigerant. For example, the greenhouse effect varies greatly for the same brand of vaccine. The Moderna vaccine's global warming potential (GWP) is 776 times higher using R-449A gas than using R-290 (propane gas). In Brazil, the refrigerators used to store the Pfizer vaccine have a total TEWI almost two times higher than the total TEWI of refrigerators using propane to store the Janssen vaccine. At this time of the pandemic, these optimization indexes can be used to support important decisions regarding the future selection of vaccine brands considering the energy consumption and environmental impact required for their storage.","output":"Evaluating the Energy Efficiency and Environmental Impact of COVID-19 Vaccines Coolers through New Optimization Indexes: Comparison between Refrigeration Systems Using HFC or Natural Refrigerants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In low-flow anesthesia (LFA), there is a wash-in period in which usually high fresh gas flow (FGF) rates are used to achieve the required initial concentration of anesthetic agent in the alveoli.

Eighty patients, who were scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation, were enrolled in the study. Wash-in was accomplished with 1 L/min FGF (50% O2, 50% air) and 18% desflurane in group 1; and by 4 L/min FGF (50% O2, 50% air) and 6% desflurane in group 2. Throughout the surgery, the vaporizer was adjusted to maintain 0.6 to 0.8 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC). The time required to reach 0.7 MAC was shorter in group 1 (160 seconds [135-181] vs 288 seconds [240-500], P < .001). In 6 patients in group 1 and 13 in group 2, vaporizer settings were adjusted to maintain 0.6 to 0.8 MAC (P = .048). Desflurane consumption in the first hour and total desflurane consumption were higher in group 2 (P < .001 and P = .012, respectively).

Diagnosis on clinical grounds alone is difficult and depends on laboratory support. However, no confirmatory tests are available, which is rapid and can be performed with minimum facilities available. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the diagnostic utility, accuracy and reproducibility of a rapid real time-PCR based method (Truenat?) for early diagnosis of leptospirosis, and its usage in low resource settings. METHODS: The Truenat? test was performed using plasma sample collected from confirmed patients and controls. DNA was extracted from plasma samples and the reaction was performed as per the manufacturers instructions. Leptospiral isolates were also used to assess the performance using different serovars. RESULTS: Evaluation of the Truenat? test with RT-PCR as the gold standard showed that Truenat? had a sensitivity of 97.4 per cent and a specificity of 98.6 per cent. The overall agreement with RT-PCR was 98.2 per cent. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the test would be a useful tool for early diagnosis of leptospirosis in settings with minimal facilities and the test results could be obtained within an hour. This indicates that a specific therapy can be instituted during the early phase of the disease even at peripheral healthcare facilities as well during the outbreaks.","output":"Truenat? - micro real-time-polymerase chain reaction for rapid diagnosis of leptospirosis at minimal resource settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This review investigates the use of social media at surgical conferences and possible effects of prepublication data release in surgical fields. Potential risks include patient harm by the preliminary application of research that lacks sufficient peer review, infringements on intellectual property, and loss of research novelty. METHODS: A literature review of the current use of social media in dispersion of prepublication data was performed. Current submission guidelines for surgical conferences and journals were analyzed for data release embargos and social media use policies. RESULTS: Conference abstract guidelines mentioned data embargos half of the time and the use of social media less than one third of the time. Eighty percentage of journal instructions to authors contained guidelines on both. CONCLUSIONS: In nonsurgical fields, the appropriateness of the use of social media to release prepublication data is increasingly being discussed. Little guidance exists on how surgical conference attendees should use social media while at conferences. Given the potential for patient harm and negative impact on intellectual property and attribution, further discussion is warranted.

With frequent power cuts and crumbling infrastructure, mainly due to the damage inflicted upon several power plants and grid assets as well as the lack of maintenance, many Libyans are left without electricity for several hours a day. As the country has a staggeringly immense potential of solar energy, it is inevitable to exploit such potential, to avert system-wide blackouts. This paper investigates the use of small-scale PV systems in local communities as non-wires alternative (NWA), offering excess energy exchange within local/neighboring microgrids (MGs) for reliable electric power supply. Different combinations of PV/storage/diesel distributed generations (DGs), with grid-interface options, were applied on a case study of a typical dwelling in the Eastern Libyan city of Benghazi. Technical and financial feasibility assessments were carried out to contrast between various supply combinations. Sensitivity analysis of the PV-grid system was also conducted using Net Present Value (NPV) and the payback time indicators to determine the impacts of Feed-in Tariff (FiT) rates, financial incentives, electricity tariff, and inflation rate on the economic viability of the PV grid system. Results show that the PV-grid system has a promising potential under reasonable set of varying system parameters. On top of its social and environmental-friendly advantages, the PV-battery system is found to be more economical when adopted as a standalone NWA solution as compared to the diesel generator option, even at the lowest diesel price. The PV-grid system does not only provide a short-term remedy to the rolling blackouts in Libya but also enhances system operational reliability by providing a NWA to rundown or shattered grid infrastructure, thus bolstering energy provision in residential neighborhoods.","output":"Revitalizing Operational Reliability of the Electrical Energy System in Libya: Feasibility Analysis of Solar Generation in Local Communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The recent emergence of the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) disease had been associated with reports of fungal infections such as aspergillosis and mucormycosis especially among critically ill patients treated with steroids. The recent surge in cases of COVID-19 in India during the second wave of the pandemic had been associated with increased reporting of invasive mucormycosis post COVID-19. There are multiple case reports and case series describing mucormycosis in COVID-19. PURPOSE: In this review, we included most recent reported case reports and case-series of mucormycosis among patients with COVID-19 and describe the clinical features and outcome. RESULTS: Many of the mucormycosis reports were eported from India, especially in COVID-19 patients who were treated and recovered patients. The most commonly reported infection sites were rhino-orbital/rhino-cerebral mucormycosis. Those patients were diabetic and had corticosteroids therapy for controlling the severity of COVID-19, leading to a higher fatality in such cases and complicating the pandemic scenario. The triad of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), corticosteroid use and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus have been evident for significant increase in the incidence of angioinvasive maxillofacial mucormycosis. In addition, the presence of spores and other factors might play a role as well. CONCLUSION: With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and increasing number of critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, it is important to develop a risk-based approach for patients at risk of mucormycosis based on the epidemiological burden of mucormycosis, prevalence of diabetes mellitus, COVID-19 disease severity and use of immune modulating agents including the combined use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents in patients with cancer and transplants.","output":"COVID-19 and mucormycosis superinfection: the perfect storm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health care workers (HCW) are a high-risk population to acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection from patients or other fellow HCW.

Robust measures for the validation of 3D reconstructions and atomic models are essential for appropriate interpretation of the data. The resolution of data and availability of software tools that work across a range of resolutions often limit the quality of derived models. Hence, the final atomic model is often incomplete or contains regions where atomic positions are less reliable or incorrectly built. Extensive manual pruning and local adjustments or rebuilding are usually required to address these issues. The presented research introduces a software tool for the validation of the backbone trace of atomic models built in the cryo-EM density maps. In this study, we use the false discovery rate analysis, which can be used to segregate molecular signals from the background. Each atomic position in the model can be associated with an FDR backbone validation score, which can be used to identify potential mistraced residues. We demonstrate that the proposed validation score is complementary to existing validation metrics and is useful especially in cases where the model is built in the maps having varying local resolution.

RESULTS: Of 505,968 intravitreal injections from 110,547 eyes administered, 85 of 294,514 (0.0289%; 1 in 3,464 injections) cases of presumed endophthalmitis occurred in the \\"no face mask\\" group, and 45 of 211,454 (0.0213%; 1 in 4,699) cases occurred in the \\"universal face mask\\" group (odds ratio [OR], 0.74; 95%CI, 0.51-1.18; p=0.097). In the \\"no face mask\\" group, there were 27 cases (0.0092%; 1 in 10,908 injections) of culture-positive endophthalmitis compared to 9 cases (0.004%; 1 in 23,494) in the \\"universal face mask\\" group (OR, 0.46; 95%CI, 0.22-0.99; p=0.041). Three cases of oral flora-associated endophthalmitis occurred in the \\"no face mask\\" group (0.001%; 1 in 98,171 injections) compared to one (0.0005%; 1 in 211,454) in the \\"universal face mask\\" group (p=0.645). Patients presented a mean (range) 4.9 (1-30) days after the causative injection, and mean logMAR visual acuity at endophthalmitis presentation was 2.04 [a20/2200] for \\"no face mask\\" group compared to 1.65 [a20/900] for the \\"universal face mask\\" group (p=0.022), although no difference was observed three months after treatment (p=0.764). CONCLUSION: In a large, multicenter, retrospective study, physician and patient face mask use during intravitreal anti-VEGF injections did not alter the risk of presumed acute-onset bacterial endophthalmitis, but there was a reduced rate of culture-positive endophthalmitis. Three months following presentation, there was no difference in visual acuity between the groups.","output":"The influence of universal face mask use on endophthalmitis risk after intravitreal anti-VEGF injections during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research develops a framework that combines crisis stages, stakeholder engagement, and crisis challenges. The framework is applied to small firms in Macao during the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic crisis. We conduct a qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews with the leaders of six small firms in Macao. The findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has turned into a normal context, which blurs the traditional crisis termination stage. We also find that participating firms engage more with internal stakeholders than external ones. The strategies adopted by small firms include flexible human resource (HR) practices, cost reduction, enhancing customer relations, and using government support schemes. These strategies are effective in the short term; firms need to pay attention to diversity and learning for the long term.","output":"Crisis challenges of small firms in Macao during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The structure of humic substances (HSs) and the humification process are critical topics for understanding the dynamics of carbon on the planet. This study aimed to assess the structural patterns of 80 humic acid (HA) samples isolated from different soils, namely, Histosols, Ferralsols, Cambisols, Mollisols, Planosols and vermicompost, by spectroscopic characterization using solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance cross-polarization/magic angle spinning combined with chemometric techniques. All 80 HAs had a similar structural pattern, regardless of their source of origin, but they had different relative quantities of organic C species. The different structural amounts of the various organic C fractions generated different properties in each of the HAs. This explains why there were similarities in the HS functions but why the intensities of these functions varied among the samples from the different soil types and environments, confirming that HSs are a group of compounds with a structural identity distinct from the molecules that give rise to them. There appears to be no single definition for the humification process; therefore, for the soils from each source of origin, a specific humification process occurs that depends on the characteristics of the local environment. Humification can be understood as a process that is similar to a chemical reaction, where the key factor that determines the formation of the products is the structural characteristics of the reactants (organic substrates deposited in the soil). The degree to which the reaction progresses is governed by the reaction conditions (chemical, physical, and biological properties of the soil). The structural patterns for HSs obtained in this study justify the existence of HSs structured as self-assembled, hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains that, under certain conditions, can undergo transformations, altering the balance of organic carbon in the environment.","output":"Spectroscopic-chemometric modeling of 80 humic acids confirms the structural pattern identity of humified organic matter despite different formation environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate differences by race/ethnicity in clinical characteristics and outcomes among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). METHODS: The MGH Covid-19 Registry includes confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients hospitalized at MGH and is based on manual chart reviews and data extraction from electronic health records (EHRs). We evaluated differences between White/Non-Hispanic and Hispanic patients in demographics, complications and 14-day outcomes among the N = 866 patients hospitalized with Covid-19 from March 11, 2020-May 4, 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 43% of patients hospitalized with Covid-19 were women, median age was 60.4 [IQR = (48.2, 75)], 11.3% were Black/non-Hispanic and 35.2% were Hispanic. Hispanic patients, representing 35.2% of patients, were younger than White/non-Hispanic patients [median age 51y; IQR = (40.6, 61.6) versus 72y; (58.0, 81.7) (p<0.001)]. Hispanic patients were symptomatic longer before presenting to care (median 5 vs 3d, p = 0.039) but were more likely to be sent home with self-quarantine than be admitted to hospital (29% vs 16%, p<0.001). Hispanic patients had fewer comorbidities yet comparable rates of ICU or death (34% vs 36%). Nonetheless, a greater proportion of Hispanic patients recovered by 14 days after presentation (62% vs 45%, p<0.001; OR = 1.99, p = 0.011 in multivariable adjusted model) and fewer died (2% versus 18%, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized Hispanic patients were younger and had fewer comorbidities compared to White/non-Hispanic patients; despite comparable rates of ICU care or death, a greater proportion recovered.

DESIGN A randomized, controlled clinical trial (Canadian Task Force classification I). SETTING Private gynecologic clinic in Medellin, Colombia. PATIENTS One hundred fifty women who underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign pathology. INTERVENTIONS The patients underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy with intracorporeal closure of the vaginal cuff and were randomized to 2 groups, 1 using a barbed suture (V-Loc 90; Medtronic/Covidien, New Haven, CT) and 1 using polyglactin 910 (coated Vicryl suture; Ethicon/Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The total operative time, closing time of the vaginal vault, presence of complications in the cuff, and incidence of postoperative dyspareunia were recorded. The patients were evaluated at a postoperative office visit 2 weeks after the procedure and by telephone interview at 24 weeks. Seventy-five patients were included in the barbed suture group and 75 patients in the polyglactin 910 group. The average time to complete the suture of the vaginal cuff was 12.01 minutes ( 5.37 standard deviation) for the barbed suture group versus 13.49 minutes ( 6.48) in the polyglactin 910 group (95% confidence interval, -.44 to 3.4; p = .130).

ULs can cause excessive bleeding, pain and infertility1, and are a common cause of hysterectomy2. They emerge through at least three distinct genetic drivers: mutations in MED12 or FH, or genomic rearrangement of HMGA23. Here we created genome-wide datasets, using DNA, RNA, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and HiC chromatin immunoprecipitation (HiChIP) sequencing of primary tissues to profoundly understand the genesis of UL. We identified somatic mutations in genes encoding six members of the SRCAP histone-loading complex4, and found that germline mutations in the SRCAP members YEATS4 and ZNHIT1 predispose women to UL. Tumours bearing these mutations showed defective deposition of the histone variant H2A.Z. In ULs, H2A.Z occupancy correlated positively with chromatin accessibility and gene expression, and negatively with DNA methylation, but these correlations were weak in tumours bearing SRCAP complex mutations. In these tumours, open chromatin emerged at transcription start sites where H2A.Z was lost, which was associated with upregulation of genes. Furthermore, YEATS4 defects were associated with abnormal upregulation of bivalent embryonic stem cell genes, as previously shown in mice5. Our work describes a potential mechanism of tumorigenesis-epigenetic instability caused by deficient H2A.Z deposition-and suggests that ULs arise through an aberrant differentiation program driven by deranged chromatin, emanating from a small number of mutually exclusive driver mutations.","output":"Deficient H2A.Z deposition is associated with genesis of uterine leiomyoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ISSUES ADDRESSED To obtain a baseline of public perception, attitudes and knowledge (PAK) of Australians about microbes, antibiotics and hygiene like hand washing and use of probiotics.

SUMMARY The objective of the study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sustainable forest management in southern Africa. The study employed a targeted approach, also referred to as purposive sampling, to select respondents from the various sectors. The results show that COVID-19 had an 80% impact on forest management operations. The COVID-19 pandemic did not have a significant effect on the conversion of land from forest to other land uses. However, there was severe illegal logging and moderate to severe fires. The COVID-19 pandemic also had a severe impact on the agriculture, environment and ecotourism sectors, with nature reserves completely closed. From the forest production perspective, the impact of COVID-19 on production, supply, demand and the price of timber was generally low due to the commercial nature of the forestry sector in South Africa;the largest economy in SADC being classified as an essential sector. . ? 2021 Commonwealth Forestry Association.

A detailed literature search was done in PubMed and Embase from December 1, 2019, till May 1, 2020. Studies reporting cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 patients were included. Irrespective of the heterogeneity of data, a random effects model with inverse-variance approach was used for pooling the prevalence using meta package in R version 3.6.2. RESULTS: Out of 15,143 articles, 2086 articles were selected for full-text read. Forty-three articles were selected for qualitative analysis, of which 10 articles (N = 1682) were included for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of overall cutaneous lesions was 5.69 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.87-15.98; I2 88%). The pooled prevalence of other outcome parameters were as follows: viral exanthem-like presentation 4.15 (95% CI: 1.33-12.23; I2 88%), maculopapular rash 3.81 (95% CI: 1.02-13.18; I2 87%), vesiculobullous lesions 1.67 (95% CI: 0.70-3.96; I2 0%).

This production gap was substituted with cheap goods from the overseas countries where salaries and working and environmental standards are much lower. A GDP gap was compensated with services sector. However, in this paper it was shown that, during recent Great economic crisis, the speed of recovery of the countries with stronger manufacturing was higher than in the countries with low manufacturing participation in GDP. An econometric model is built, showing how share of manufacturing in GDP of the countries of EU is negatively related to the length of recession in these countries: each 1% point rise in that share shortnes crisis by 0,27 quarters. The model also included a composite governance quality index: each index point rise is related to the 0,15 recession quarters shortening. Also, countries' economic ability to interveine, measured as a share of public debt in GDP, showed that each 1% point of public debt in GDP prolongues recession by 0,05 quarters. The analysis has also shown that, based on the initial conditions before the epidemics, the new risis would last 13,5% longer than The great crisis. These findings provide useful ground for studying deindustrialization processes and its negative effects on the automatic stabilization, which is of utter importance for the imminent crisis caused by COVID-19 disease.","output":"Deindustrijalizacija I Njezin Utjecaj Na Ubla?avanje Budu?e Krize - Slu?aj Europske Unije"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital psychiatry and e-mental health have proliferated and permeated vastly in the current landscape of mental health care provision.

In this study, we investigate the clinical and laboratory features and short-term outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: All patients with COVID-19 admitted to Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China, between 3 January and 1 February 2020 were included. All those patients were with laboratory-confirmed infections. Epidemiological, clinical, and radiological characteristics; underlying diseases; laboratory tests; treatments; complications; and outcomes data were collected. Outcomes were followed up at discharge until 15 February 2020. RESULTS: The study cohort included 102 adult patients. The median age was 54 years (interquartile ranger, 37-67 years), and 48.0% were female. A total of 34 patients (33.3%) were exposed to a source of transmission in the hospital setting (as health-care workers, patients, or visitors) and 10 patients (9.8%) had a familial cluster. There were 18 patients (17.6%) who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 17 patients died (mortality, 16.7%; 95% confidence interval, 9.4-23.9%). Those patients who survived were younger, were more likely to be health-care workers, and were less likely to suffer from comorbidities. They were also less likely to suffer from complications. There was no difference in drug treatment rates between the survival and nonsurvival groups. Those patients who survived were less likely to require admission to the ICU (14.1% vs 35.3% of those admitted). Chest imaging examinations showed that patients who died were more likely to have ground-glass opacity (41.2% vs 12.9% in survivors). CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate was high among the COVID-19 patients described in our cohort who met our criteria for inclusion in this analysis. The patient characteristics seen more frequently in those who died were the development of systemic complications following onset of the illness and a severity of disease requiring admission to the ICU. Our data support those described by others indicating that COVID-19 infection results from human-to-human transmission, including familial clustering of cases, and from nosocomial transmission. There were no differences in mortality among those who did or did not receive antimicrobial or glucocorticoid drug treatments.","output":"Clinical Features and Short-term Outcomes of 102 Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Hashimoto's thyroiditis is known to cluster with other systemic autoimmune disorders. Rheumatic manifestations, such as a seronegative non-erosive polyarthritis have been described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the characteristics and the prevalence of rheumatic features in thyroiditis patients, and to ascertain whether the association with systemic autoimmune disorders improved the arthritis manifestations. METHODS In total, 180 thyroiditis patients were enrolled. Major clinical and demographic characteristics have been recorded. Patients underwent a rheumatological clinical assessment and extra-articular manifestations allowing for a differential diagnosis with systemic autoimmune diseases and spondyloarthropathy. Presence of systemic autoimmune diseases was recorded. RESULTS A total of 8.33% of thyroiditis patients shown a peripheral inflammatory arthritis (P = 0.002). Female gender (P = 0.042) and thyroid peroxidase (TPOAbs) positivity (P = 0.001) were more frequent. In total, 37 patients had systemic autoimmune diseases (P = 0.0003). A significant high prevalence of coeliac disease and Addison disease was found (P = 0.034 and P = 0.049, respectively). In patients with coeliac disease, the articular manifestations were more frequent (21.21%) (P = 0.001) and the risk to develop joint involvement was 2.96. CONCLUSION Although we found an articular involvement in about one-third of thyroiditis patients, the prevalence of inflammatory arthropathy was only 8.33%. The prevalence of other coexisting autoimmune disorders was 34.26% with a significant prevalence of coeliac disease (7.41%).

Intranasal (IN) administration of pIC has recently been used to adjuvant influenza virus vaccines; however, the effects of IN pIC administration on pulmonary T cell responses remain unclear. Here we show that a single IN administered dose of dsRNA into mice induced local Th1 chemokine production in the lungs and airways, and generated a biphasic and sustained migration of T lymphocytes to the airways. Furthermore, IN pIC-induced chemokine production and T cell recruitment to the airways were interferon- receptor (IFNAR) signaling dependent. The effect of dsRNA on T cell recruitment to the airways was also dependent on the presence of high molecular weight (HMW) pIC, as a low molecular weight (LMW) pIC preparation known to only interact with TLR3 did not elicit the same effect on T cell migration to the airways, suggesting that the observed effects were dependent upon dsRNA recognition by multiple pattern recognition receptors (PPRs). IN pIC was additionally capable of stimulating low levels of T cell proliferation in the draining lymph nodes approximately 4C6 days after treatment that preceded a small population of de-novo T cells found in the airways by day 10. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the adjuvant effect of IN pIC that results in enhanced T cell proliferation and sustained T cell recruitment to the airways requires multiple PRRs and IFNAR signaling.","output":"Intranasal Administration of dsRNA Analog Poly(I:C) Induces Interferon- Receptor-Dependent Accumulation of Antigen Experienced T Cells in the Airways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Molecular clones representing the first 2,000 bases from the 3' end of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus genome and the first 2,160 bases from the 3' end of the bovine enteric coronavirus genome were used in dot blot hybridization assays to detect viral RNA from cell culture and from fecal specimens.

To appropriately design policies and anticipate behavioral change, it is important to understand how different Americans' social distancing behavior shifts in relation to policy announcements according to individual characteristics, and community vulnerability. Methods: This cross-sectional study used Unacast's social distancing data from February 24th - May 10th, 2020 to study how social distancing changed before and after: 1) The World Health Organization's declaration of a global pandemic, 2) White House announcement of \\"Opening Up America Again\\" (OUAA) guidelines, and 3) the week of April 27 when several states reopened. To measure intention to social distance, we assessed the difference between weekday and weekend behavior as more individuals have more control over weekend leisure time. To investigate social distancing's sensitivity to different population characteristics, we compared social distancing time-series data across county vulnerability as measured by the COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) which defines vulnerability across socioeconomic, household composition, minority status, epidemiological, and healthcare-system related factors. We also compared social distancing across population groupings by race, 2016 presidential election voting choice, and employment sectors. Results: Movement reduced significantly throughout March reaching peak reduction on April 12th (-56.1%) prior the enactment of any reopening policies. Shifts in social distancing began after major announcements but prior to specific applied policies: Following the WHO declaration, national social distancing significantly increased on weekdays and weekends (-18.6% and -41.3% decline in mobility, respectively). Social distancing significantly declined on weekdays and weekends after OUAA guidelines (i.e. before state reopening) (+1.1% and +5.3% increase in mobility, respectively) with additional significant decline after state reopening (+10.0% and +20.9% increase in mobility, respectively). Social distancing was significantly greater on weekends than weekdays throughout March, however, the trend reversed by early May with significantly less social distancing on weekends, suggesting a shift in intent to social distance during leisure time. In general, vulnerable counties social distanced less than non-vulnerable counties, and had a greater difference between weekday and weekend behavior until state reopening. This may be driven by structural barriers that vulnerable communities face, such as higher rates of employment in particular sectors. At all time periods studied, the average black individual in the US social distanced significantly more than the average white individual, and the average 2016 Clinton voter social distanced significantly more than the average 2016 Trump voter. Social distancing behavior differed across industries with three clusters of employment sectors. Conclusion: Both signaling of a policy change and implementation of a policy are important factors that seem to influence social distancing. Behaviors shifted with national announcements prior to mandates, though social distancing further declined nationwide as the first states reopened. The variation in behavioral drivers including vulnerability, race, political affiliation, and employment industry demonstrates the need for targeted policy messaging and interventions tailored to address specific barriers for improved social distancing and mitigation.","output":"Social distancing across vulnerability, race, politics, and employment: How different Americans changed behaviors before and after major COVID-19 policy announcements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of protective face mask usage during the postoperative period on carbon dioxide retention in children during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Long-acting muscarinic antagonists and ?2-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids inhibit the exacerbation of COPD and bronchial asthma caused by infection with viruses, including HCoV-229E. However, the effects of these drugs on HCoV-229E replication and infection-induced inflammation in the human airway are unknown. METHODS: Primary human nasal (HNE) and tracheal (HTE) epithelial cell cultures were infected with HCoV-229E. RESULTS: Pretreatment of HNE and HTE cells with glycopyrronium or formoterol decreased viral RNA levels and/or titers, the expression of the HCoV-229E receptor CD13, the number and fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes where HCoV-229E RNA enters the cytoplasm, and the infection-induced production of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and IFN-?. Treatment of the cells with the CD13 inhibitor 2'2'-dipyridyl decreased viral titers. Pretreatment of the cells with a combination of three drugs (glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide) exerted additive inhibitory effects on viral titers and cytokine production. Pretreatment of HNE cells with glycopyrronium or formoterol reduced the susceptibility to infection, and pretreatment with the three drugs inhibited activation of nuclear factor-kappa B p50 and p65 proteins. Pretreatment with formoterol increased cAMP levels and treatment with cAMP decreased viral titers, CD13 expression, and the fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that glycopyrronium, formoterol, and a combination of glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide inhibit HCoV-229E replication partly by inhibiting receptor expression and/or endosomal function and that these drugs modulate infection-induced inflammation in the airway.","output":"Inhibitory effects of glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide on coronavirus HCoV-229E replication and cytokine production by primary cultures of human nasal and tracheal epithelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The real meaning of the words 'epidemic' and 'pandemic' The pandemic in history: the Antonine plague in the Roman Empire and the epidemic in Athens The issue of the role of law in managing extraordinary events: the modern perspective and the Roman law perspective in comparison Carl Schmitts theory of 'Ausnahmezustand' and the need to overcome this model The importance of law and legal science in times of emergency ? 2020, International Center for Animal Law and Policy All rights reserved","output":"Covid-19 and law: The legal science of the xxi century in the age of the 'great pandemic'"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a life-threatening lung disease of immunocompromised humans, caused by the opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus.

DESIGN AND SETTING A systematic review of studies analyzing cleaning products that inactivate coronavirus, conducted within the evidence-based health program of a federal university in S?o Paulo (SP), Brazil. METHODS A systematic search of the relevant literature was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL and LILACS databases, for articles published up to May 27, 2020, relating to studies evaluating cleaning products that inactivate coronavirus in the environment. RESULTS Seven studies were selected. These analyzed use of 70% alcohol, detergent, detergent containing iodine, household bleach, sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, chlorine dioxide, glutaraldehyde, ultraviolet irradiation and plasma air purifier. The effectiveness of treating sewage with sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide was also evaluated. CONCLUSION Disinfection of environments, especially those in ordinary use, such as bathrooms, needs to be done constantly.

Herein, we characterize the outcomes of a cohort of patients with cancer who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by routine screening (RS) in comparison with those diagnosed on the basis of clinical suspicion or exposure history (nonroutine screening [NRS]). METHODS: A multisite prospective observational study was conducted at three major and five satellite campuses of the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center between March 18 and July 31, 2020. The primary outcome was COVID-19-related hospital admission. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit admissions and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Five thousand four hundred fifty-two patients underwent RS in the outpatient setting only, and 44 (0.81%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. RS detected 19 additional patients from the scheduled inpatient admissions for surgical or interventional procedures or inpatient chemotherapy. One hundred sixty-one patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 on the basis of NRS. COVID-19-related hospitalization rate (17.5% v 26.7%; P = .14), intensive care unit admission (1.6% v 5.6%; P = .19), and mortality (4.8% v 3.7%; P = .72) were not significantly different between the RS and NRS groups.

METHODS: Lung US examinations were performed in 63 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to a university hospital. Lung involvement was evaluated on a 4-point scale with a 12-area pulmonary division, obtaining a lung score (LS). Ultrasound findings and clinical characteristics were recorded. RESULTS: All patients showed US involvement in at least 1 area (mean  SD, 8  3.5). The total LS was 15.3  8.1, without differences between left and right lungs. Most affected regions were the lower region (95.2%) and the posterior region (73.8%). The total LS showed a strong correlation (r = -0.765) with the oxygen pressure-to-fraction of inspired oxygen ratio; by lung region, those with a higher correlation were the LS of the anterior region (r = -0.823) and the LS of the upper region (r = -0.731). In total, 22.2% of patients required noninvasive respiratory support (NIRS). A multivariate analysis showed that the anterior region LS, adjusted for age and sex, was significant (odds ratio, 2.159; 95% confidence interval, 1.309-3.561) for the risk of requiring NIRS. An anterior region LS of 4 or higher and a total LS of 19 or higher had similar characteristics to predict the need for NIRS. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia is bilateral and heterogeneous. Most affected regions are the posterior and the lower regions. The anterior region has prognostic value because its involvement strongly correlates with the risk of requiring NIRS, and an anterior region LS of 4 or higher has high sensitivity and specificity for predicting the need for NIRS.","output":"Findings and Prognostic Value of Lung Ultrasound in COVID-19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zur Eind?mmung der Corona-Pandemie wurden die Schulen in Deutschland und in vielen anderen L?ndern im M?rz geschlossen Homeschooling sollte verhindern, dass die Leistungen der Schlerinnen und Schler abnehmen und die Ungleichheit der Bildungsleistungen steigt Fehlende Konzepte und Erfahrungen der Lehrkr?fte mit digitalem Fernunterricht sowie Ausstattungsm?ngel lie?en jedoch vermuten, dass grere Lerndefizite entstanden sein drften Eine erste Studie aus Belgien best?tigt diese Befrchtungen Die Ergebnisse drften sich auf Deutschland bertragen lassen, denn auch hier bestehen erhebliche Defizite an digitalgesttzten Lehrkonzepten Um Vorsorge fr den Fall neuerlicher Schulschlie?ungen zu treffen und die Lcken zumindest in Teilen wieder zu verringern, sollte man die Chancen der Digitalisierung zur Verbesserung des Unterrichts nutzen Erste Impulse hat es bereits gegeben: Die Ausstattung mit digitalen Endger?ten bessert sich, Lehrplattformen stehen zur Verfgung, digitale Bildungsinhalte werden entwickelt Auch der WLAN-Zugang an den Schulen soll in den kommenden Jahren im Zuge der praktischen Umsetzung des Digitalpakts verbessert werden Als n?chste Schritte gilt es die Lehrkr?fte weiterzubilden, Feedback-Mechanismen zum Unterricht zu schaffen, die Lehrkr?fte durch IT-Support zu untersttzen und Lerninhalte auf den Plattformen motivierend und effektiv darzureichen, begleitet durch wissenschaftliche Evaluation Alternate abstract:To contain the corona pandemic, schools in Germany and in many other countries were closed in March Homeschooling should prevent student achievement from deteriorating and educational inequality from increasing However, the teachers' lack of concepts and experience with digital distance learning as well as lack of equipment suggested that greater learning deficits may have arisen A first study from Belgium confirms these fears The results should be transferable to Germany, because here too there are considerable deficits in digitally supported teaching concepts In order to take precautions in the event that schools are closed again and to at least partially reduce the gaps, one should use the opportunities of digitization to improve teaching The first impulses have already been given: The equipment with digital devices is improving, teaching platforms are available, and digital educational content is being developed WLAN access in schools is also to be improved in the coming years as part of the practical implementation of the digital pact The next steps are to train the teachers, create feedback mechanisms for the lessons, support the teachers with IT support and present learning content on the platforms in a motivating and effective way, accompanied by scientific evaluation","output":"Schulische Bildung zu Zeiten der Corona-Krise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The semiautomated Evidence Investigator has been applied to the simultaneous specific measurement of soluble adhesion molecules: L-, P-, E- selectins, VCAM-1, ICAM-1 using a reduced volume of sample.

METHODS: A novel EMR, cataloguing pediatric CNS tumors was used to collect data from August 2017 to March 2020 at National Institute of Neurosciences and Hospital (NINS&H) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-nine pediatric patients with a CNS tumor were admitted to NINS&H. Fifty-eight percent of patients were male, and the median age was 8 years. A total of 188/249 patients (76%) underwent surgery during their index admission. Radiographic locations were known for 212/249 (85%) of cases; the most common radiographic locations were infratentorial (81/212; 38%), suprasellar (45/212; 21%), and supratentorial (29/212; 14%). A histopathological classification was reported on 156/249 (63%) of patients cytology. The most common infratentorial pathologies were medulloblastoma (22/47; 47%) and pilocytic astrocytoma (14/47; 30%). The median time between admission and surgery was 36 days, while the median post-operation stay was 19.5 days. CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility of a basic EMR platform for a busy pediatric neurosurgery department in a lower-middle income country is demonstrated, and preliminary clinical data is reviewed. A wide variety of pediatric CNS tumors were observed, spanning the spectrum of anatomic locations and histopathologic subtypes. Surgical intervention was performed for the majority of patients. Barriers to care include limited molecular diagnostics and unavailable data on adjuvant therapy.

Then, appropriate distances between normalized time series are used to further analyze the relationships between case trajectories on a month-by-month basis. Our algorithm shows that 31 states are experiencing second surges, while four of the 10 largest states are still in their first surge, with case counts that have never decreased.

The Computerized chest analysis Tomography of scan is assumed to be one of the efficient solutions for detecting and classifying lung nodules. The necessity of high accuracy of analyzing C.T. scan images of the lung is considered as one of the crucial challenges in detecting and classifying lung cancer. A new long-short-term-memory (LSTM) based deep fusion structure, is introduced, where, the texture features computed from lung nodules through new volumetric grey-level-co-occurrence-matrices (GLCM) computations are applied to classify the nodules into: benign, malignant and ambiguous. An improved Otsu segmentation method combined with the water strider optimization algorithm (WSA) is proposed to detect the lung nodules. Otsu-WSA thresholding can overcome the restrictions present in previous thresholding methods. Extended experiments are run to assess this fusion structure by considering 2D-GLCM computations based 2D-slices fusion, and an approximation of this 3D-GLCM with volumetric 2.5D-GLCM computations-based LSTM fusion structure. The proposed methods are trained and assessed through the LIDC-IDRI dataset, where 94.4%, 91.6%, and 95.8% Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are obtained, respectively for 2D-GLCM fusion and 97.33%, 96%, and 98%, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively, for 2.5D-GLCM fusion. The yield of the same are 98.7%, 98%, and 99%, for the 3D-GLCM fusion.

The largest at risk population is undoubtedly the frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) who are using personal protective equipment (PPE), essentially face masks, to battle against this deadly virus. This study was conducted with the prime intention to reveal an association between face mask and acne and measure the prevalence of acne amongst HCWs amidst COVID-19 outbreak in Karachi. Furthermore, this study aimed to identify the type of mask generating acne, locate the common sites, assess the severity and establish an association of mask use with the skin type. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out at Medicare Cardiac and General Hospital, Jinnah Medical College Hospital, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and Jamal Noor Hospital located in Karachi, Pakistan. A total of 348 HCWs were interviewed, of which only 193 met the inclusion criteria. All information was recorded on a predesigned proforma and analyzed using SPSS 25.0. RESULTS: Among 193 participants, acne was prevalent in 103 (53.4%) participants with maximum cases reported in female HCWs, and in doctors (p<0.05). Out of 73 HCWs using N-95 masks, 46 (44.7%) developed acne, with a p-value of 0.036. Skin type and past history of acne also yielded statistically significant results. Among all the skin types, HCWs with oily skin (64, 62.1%) were prone to face resurgence of acne or new-onset acne. The most common sites of eruption of acne were along the cheeks (45.1%) followed by the nose (40.9%). Majority of the population suffered from mild acne. Moderate and severe acne eruption was particularly observed in those wearing N-95 and surgical masks. CONCLUSION: The use of face masks is associated with high rates of acne eruption. Disseminating the guidelines and indications of World Health Organization (WHO) regarding proper use of mask, encouraging awareness among HCWs and following proper doffing and donning protocol as endorsed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will possibly minimize the adverse reactions.","output":"Association of Acne with Face Mask in Healthcare Workers Amidst the COVID-19 Outbreak in Karachi, Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and relevant prevention and control measures may affect the mental health and induce depressive symptoms in fathers with concurrent partner delivery exposure. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of depression in fathers with simultaneous exposure to COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of family functions on paternal perinatal depression (PPD) risk. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among the perinatal fathers recruited in a large tertiary hospital in Wuhan across the whole pandemic period from 31 December 2019 to 11 April 2020. Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and APGAR family function scale were used to evaluate PPD and family function, respectively. Chi-square test and multivariable-adjusted logistic regression model were applied for data analysis. RESULTS: Among the 1187 participants, the prevalence of PPD was 13.82% throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with that in the time period before the announcement of human-to-human transmission on 19 January 2020, the depression risk was significantly lower during the traffic restriction (OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.86) and public transportation reopening periods (OR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.59). Poor/fair family functions was associated with elevated depression risk (OR = 2.93, 95% CI: 1.90, 4.52). Individuals reporting a low family income and smoking had high depression risks. CONCLUSIONS: A declined risk of PPD was observed over the traffic restriction period of the COVID-19 pandemic. An improved family function may help alleviate the risk of PPD during the pandemic.

The European Green Deal is a comprehensive strategy to transform the EU into a modern resource-efficient and competitive economy, which takes into account all dimensions of sustainable development, including animal protection. Member States are required to develop and implement strategic plans approved by the European Commission to implement the new strategy. The article is of a scientific and research character. The author put forward research hypotheses and tried to prove them within the framework of the conducted analysis. First, the coronavirus crisis highlighted the importance of a robust and resilient food system and the interconnectedness of animal health, supply chains, and public health. Second, with sustainability as a cornerstone of the EUs functioning, undesirable interplay can also be observed with respect to biodiversity, climate change, and other environmental issues. Climate change can affect the emergence of new diseases, the prevalence of existing diseases and the geographical distribution of pathogens and vectors, including those that affect wildlife. Thirdly, in order to ensure high animal and public health standards and rational development of agriculture, legislative solutions at the EU level should be put in place which would contribute to the completion of the internal market and to preventing the spread of communicable diseases. This legislation should also ensure, as far as possible, that the existing animal health status of the EU is maintained and promoted.

Although many efforts have already been put forward for developing potential vaccines; however, most of them are proved to possess negative consequences. Therefore, in this study, immunoinformatics methods were exploited to design a novel epitope-based subunit vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2, targeting four essential proteins of the virus i.e., spike glycoprotein, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, membrane glycoprotein, and envelope protein. The highly antigenic, non-allergenic, non-toxic, non-human homolog, and 100% conserved (across other isolates from different regions of the world) epitopes were used for constructing the vaccine. In total, fourteen CTL epitopes and eighteen HTL epitopes were used to construct the vaccine. Thereafter, several in silico validations i.e., the molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation (including the RMSF and RMSD studies), and immune simulation studies were also performed which predicted that the designed vaccine should be quite safe, effective, and stable within the biological environment. Finally, in silico cloning and codon adaptation studies were also conducted to design an effective mass production strategy of the vaccine. However, more in vitro and in vivo studies are required on the predicted vaccine to finally validate its safety and efficacy.","output":"Engineering a novel subunit vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 by exploring immunoinformatics approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Theory-of-mind (ToM), a human ability to infer the intentions and thoughts of others, is an essential part of empathetic experiences. We provide here the framework for using NLP models to measure ToM expressed in written texts. For this purpose, we introduce ToM-Diary, a crowdsourced 18,238 diaries with 74,014 Korean sentences annotated with different ToM levels. Each diary was annotated with ToM levels by trained psychology students and reviewed by selected psychology experts. The annotators first divided the diaries based on whether they mentioned other people: self-focused and other-focused. Examples of self-focused sentences are\\"I am feeling good\\". The other-focused sentences were further classified into different levels. These levels differ by whether the writer 1) mentions the presence of others without inferring their mental state(e.g., I saw a man walking down the street), 2) fails to take the perspective of others (e.g., I don't understand why they refuse to wear masks), or 3) successfully takes the perspective of others (It must have been hard for them to continue working). We tested whether state-of-the-art transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) could predict underlying ToM levels in sentences. We found that BERT more successfully detected self-focused sentences than other-focused ones. Sentences that successfully take the perspective of others (the highest ToM level) were the most difficult to predict.

Such reports have yet to be empirically validated. Here we combined data from multi-catch rodent stations (providing data on rodent captures), rodent bait stations (providing data on rodent activity) and residents complaints to explore the effects of a six week lockdown period on rodent populations within the City of Sydney, Australia. The sampling interval encompassed October 2019 to July 2020 with lockdown defined as the interval from April 1st to May 15th, 2020. Rodent captures and activity (visits to bait stations) were stable prior to lockdown. Captures showed a rapid increase and then decline during the lockdown, while rodent visits to bait stations declined throughout this period. There were no changes in the frequency of complaints during lockdown relative to before and after lockdown. There was a non-directional change in the geographical distribution of indices of rodent abundance suggesting that rodents redistributed in response to resource scarcity. We hypothesize that lockdown measures initially resulted in increased rodent captures due to sudden shortage of human-derived food resources. Rodent visits to bait stations might not show this pattern due to the nature of the binary data collected, namely the presence or absence of a visit. Relocation of bait stations driven by pest management goals may also have affected the detection of any directional spatial effect.

The comparative method is used to compare the changes taking place in the European and Asian shipbuilding industries. The statistical method is used to illustrate the dynamics of the economic and financial situations of shipyards. Findings: Shipyards operate on a competitive world market which experiences cyclical fluctuations in demand for ships. The dominant position of East Asian shipyards in the world market in the 21st century is the result of state subsidies, low labor costs, and the establishment of shipbuilding groups. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, shipowners reduced orders for ships in the wake of a decline in demand for sea transport. The pandemic crisis hit shipyards in Europe specializing in the construction of cruise ships hardest.

FIT was utilised at our hospital to prioritise urgency of colonoscopy referrals. We aimed to determine whether this caused a delay in the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in this cohort. Methods: Consecutive colonoscopy referrals (urgent, semi-urgent and routine) from September 2020 to April 2021 were prioritised by FIT result. Any patient with a FIT>/=10mcg were deemed category 1 (colonoscopy within 30 days) and FIT<10mcg were deemed category 2 (colonoscopy within 90 days). Demographic data were collected along with procedure result and histology. Results: One hundred and twelve patients (52% female) had a FIT test and a subsequent diagnostic test (96 had a colonoscopy, 12 had a flexible sigmoidoscopy, 3 had a CT colonography and 1 patient declined a colonoscopy but later had a CT abdomen and pelvis. Patients who did not go on to have a diagnostic test were excluded. Sixty four patients had a FIT<10 (mean age 61), 35 had a FIT 10-400 (mean age 64) and 13 patients had a FIT>400 (mean age 52). Median number of days from FIT result to diagnostic test was 56 (range -9-163) in the group with FIT<10, 44 (-28-93) in the group with FIT 10-400 and 44 (10-89) in the group with FIT>400. There were no cancer diagnoses in the FIT<10 group. No patients in this group had colonic inflammation. of the patients with FIT 10-400;4 had colonic or ileocaecal valve inflammation, 12 had polyps and 2 had a CRC. of the patients with inflammation one had mild right sided inflammation (FIT 228), one had colitis (FIT 367), one had proctitis (FIT 87) and one had ileitis of the ileocaecal valve (FIT 119). of the patients with FIT>400;4/13 had a colorectal malignancy (one of which was a polyp cancer), 4/13 had colonic polyps and 3/13 had active colonic inflammation. of the patients with inflammation one had right sided inflammation, likely crohns disease, one had severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) and one had mild proctitis, likely UC. Conclusion: In this cohort there were no CRC or IBD diagnoses in the patients with FIT<10. Therefore there was no delay in investigation of any patient subsequently diagnosed with IBD. This suggests that FIT may be safely used to stratify the priority of referrals for colonoscopy in symptomatic patients.

Consequently, many EDs are in a situation where the number of patients in the ED is temporarily beyond the capacity for which the ED is designed and resourced to manageDa phenomenon called Emergency Department (ED) crowding. ED crowding can impair the quality of care delivered to patients and lead to longer patient waiting times for ED doctors consult (time to provider) and admission to the hospital ward. In Singapore, total ED attendance at public hospitals has grown significantly, that is, roughly 5.57% per year between 2005 and 2016 and, therefore, emergency physicians have to cope with patient volumes above the safe workload. The purpose of this study is to create a virtual ED that closely maps the processes of a hospital-based ED in Singapore using system dynamics, that is, a computer simulation method, in order to visualize, simulate, and improve patient flows within the ED. Based on the simulation model (virtual ED), we analyze four policies: (i) co-location of primary care services within the ED, (ii) increase in the capacity of doctors, (iii) a more efficient patient transfer to inpatient hospital wards, and (iv) a combination of policies (i) to (iii). Among the tested policies, the co-location of primary care services has the largest impact on patients average length of stay (ALOS) in the ED. This implies that decanting non-emergency lower acuity patients from the ED to an adjacent primary care clinic significantly relieves the burden on ED operations.

METHODS Twelve healthy female pigs (weight 30.94  2.49 kg) underwent a transparietal injection of sterile alginate at the level of Z-line (n = 6) and at the pre-pyloric area (n = 6) creating a model of gastric submucosal pseudotumor. The operative procedures included intragastric resection with ML and SI approaches of cardiac and pre-pyloric lesions, with gastroscopic assistance. After resection, the gastric mucosal layer was closed using intracorporeal sutures. The operative time, complication rate and clinical evolution after 1 month were compared in the four groups that the pigs were arranged. RESULTS The pseudotumors ranged in size from 3 to 6 cm in diameter. The access of the gastric cavity and resection of the experimental SMP and suturing of the mucosa were performed successfully in 12 animals using both approaches. Mean time to perform the exeresis of gastric cardia tumors was significantly higher in single-incision approach. No significant differences were observed in the surgical time during pyloric surgery. Minilaparoscopic approach reduced significantly the mucosa closure time in esophagogastric and pyloric pseudotumors. One month after, no alterations were shown in the abdominal cavity using exploratory laparotomy. CONCLUSIONS The technical feasibility of performing safe and efficient intragastric approach of submucosal pseudotumors in swine model was verified in this study. Intragastric ML has advantages over SI, namely regarding the reduction in total surgical times and the fewer technical difficulties.","output":"Comparison of minilaparoscopy and single-incision intragastric surgery for gastric submucosal tumor resection in a porcine model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND We examine how changes in a surrogate marker of tumour vessel density correlate with response and resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy. METHODS In metastatic renal cancer patients treated with anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors, arterial phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography was used to simultaneously measure changes in: (a) tumour size, and (b) tumour enhancement (a surrogate marker of tumour vessel density) within individual lesions. RESULTS No correlation between baseline tumour enhancement and lesion shrinkage was observed, but a reduction in tumour enhancement on treatment was strongly correlated with reduction in lesion size (r=0.654, P<0.0001). However, close examination of individual metastases revealed different types of response: (1) good vascular response with significant tumour shrinkage, (2) good vascular response with stabilisation of disease, (3) poor vascular response with stabilisation of disease and (4) poor vascular response with progression. Moreover, contrasting responses between different lesions within the same patient were observed. We also assessed rebound vascularisation in tumours that acquired resistance to treatment. The amplitude of rebound vascularisation was greater in lesions that had a better initial response to therapy (P=0.008).

The lack of effective therapeutics exacerbates the impact of outbreaks associated with SARS-CoV-2 and IBV infections. Thus, novel drugs or therapeutic agents are highly in demand for controlling viral transmission and disease progression. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) secreted factors (secretome) are safe and efficient alternatives to stem cells in MSC-based therapies. This study aimed to investigate the antiviral potentials of human Whartons jelly MSC secretome (hWJ-MSC-S) against SARS-CoV-2 and IBV infections in vitro and in ovo. The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)), cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)), and selective index (SI) values of hWJ-MSC-S were determined using Vero-E6 cells. The virucidal, anti-adsorption, and anti-replication antiviral mechanisms of hWJ-MSC-S were evaluated. The hWJ-MSC-S significantly inhibited infection of SARS-CoV-2 and IBV, without affecting the viability of cells and embryos. Interestingly, hWJ-MSC-S reduced viral infection by >90%, in vitro. The IC(50) and SI of hWJ-MSC secretome against SARS-CoV-2 were 166.6 and 235.29 g/mL, respectively, while for IBV, IC(50) and SI were 439.9 and 89.11 g/mL, respectively. The virucidal and anti-replication antiviral effects of hWJ-MSC-S were very prominent compared to the anti-adsorption effect. In the in ovo model, hWJ-MSC-S reduced IBV titer by >99%. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) analysis of hWJ-MSC-S revealed a significant enrichment of immunomodulatory and antiviral proteins. Collectively, our results not only uncovered the antiviral potency of hWJ-MSC-S against SARS-CoV-2 and IBV, but also described the mechanism by which hWJ-MSC-S inhibits viral infection. These findings indicate that hWJ-MSC-S could be utilized in future pre-clinical and clinical studies to develop effective therapeutic approaches against human COVID-19 and avian IB respiratory diseases.","output":"Human Whartons Jelly Mesenchymal Stem Cells Secretome Inhibits Human SARS-CoV-2 and Avian Infectious Bronchitis Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the last year, SARS-CoV-2 caused the infection of more than 80 million people and about 1.8 million deaths.

Aqueous solutions of the anionic surfactant Sodium dodecylbenzne sulfonate (SDBS) and/or the thickener Sodium carboxymethylcellulose (SCMC) were applied in a contaminated horizontal layer in the simulated laboratory aquifer model followed by gas sparging. Fluorescein sodium salt (FSS) was added to the SDBS/SCMC solutions and represented the organic contaminant. Air and ozone were injected to generate gas sparging. A modified surfactant-enhanced ozone sparging method was also tested by applying additional air venting ports installed in the aquifer above the gas injection zone. Both non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) and water-dissolved TCA were applied to the SDBS-applied region to evaluate the removal of contaminants during gas sparging. A significant expansion of the de-saturated zone for the SDBS-applied region was observed during air sparging. During ozone sparging, the fluorescence by FSS in the SDBS-applied layer disappeared over a much wider range than that of the control experiment. SCMC application enhanced the performance of the SDBS-applied gas sparging process. The TCA mass removed by volatilization during air sparging from the SDBS-applied layer was 2.3 times the application in the absence of SDBS. Among five regions of injected NAPL contamination located above the single gas injection port, and during 2 h of ozone sparging, with SDBS applied, more than 50% of fluorescence in the NAPL was removed, whereas under the same conditions with no SDBS applied, less than 30% was removed. Diverted gas flow through the venting ports installed in the aquifer model induced a horizontally expanded oxidative reaction zone during ozone sparging.

Hypoxia is an important biological state under numerous pathological conditions. In this study, we investigated glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis under hypoxic conditions in the MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cell line using a cell cytotoxicity assay, flow cytometry, and western blotting. 6-Methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSL) more effectively induced apoptosis and G0/G1 arrest of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts under hypoxic conditions than under normoxic conditions. Correspondingly, MPSL more effectively upregulated cellular levels of cleaved caspase 3, p53, and its target p21, and downregulated cyclin D1 levels in hypoxia. Moreover, overexpression of Akt abrogated the MPSL activation of p53, p21, and cleaved caspase 3 and the attenuation of cyclin D1 expression and rescued osteoblasts from MPSL-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, indicating that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling might play an essential role in MPSL-induced inhibition of osteoblasts. Furthermore, the suppression of PI3K/Akt signaling and upregualtion of cellular p85 monomer levels by MPSL were more pronounced under hypoxic conditions than under normoxic conditions. Finally, we found that the enhancement of the effects of MPSL under hypoxic conditions was attributed to hypoxia-upregulated glucocorticoid receptor activity. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that MPSL, a synthetic glucocorticoid receptor agonist, promotes the level of p85 and inhibits PI3K/Akt signaling to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in osteoblasts, and that this effect is enhanced under hypoxic conditions.","output":"Hypoxia enhances glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in osteoblastic cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"¹ڷ,ҸҽӦ,ҽԺԻΪġӦվաӦξΡ ԻпƼѧͬҽѧԺͬҽԺΪ,¹ڷȷﻼ,ҽԺͨ¹ڷ׻ߵķ,ҽԺսʱ̹ЧϢŻ˿,෽ҽԺ¹ڷڷطĵŻ,ָٴ֮е,ʱΪؽײ","output":"Prevention and control practice in general hospital wards in the COVlD-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Square matrices appear in many machine learning problems and models.

In this paper, we propose to approximate a large square matrix with a product of sparse full-rank matrices. In the approximation, our method needs only N(logN)2 non-zero numbers for an NN full matrix. Our new method is especially useful for scalable neural attention modeling. Different from the conventional scaled dot-product attention methods, we train neural networks to map input data to the non-zero entries of the factorizing matrices. The sparse factorization method is tested for various square matrices, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method gives a better approximation when the approximated matrix is sparse and high-rank. As an attention module, our new method defeats Transformer and its several variants for long sequences in synthetic data sets and in the Long Range Arena benchmarks.

We sought to report elective surgical case distribution, associated gross hospital revenue and regional hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity as elective surgical cases are cancelled and then resumed under simulated trends of COVID-19 incidence. METHODS: A retrospective, cohort analysis was performed using insurance claims from 161 million enrollees from the MarketScan database from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2017. COVID-19 cases were calculated using Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation models. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports on the number of hospitalized and intensive care patients by age estimated the number of cases seen in the ICU, the reduction in elective surgeries and the financial impact of this from historic claims data, using a denominator of all inpatient revenue and outpatient surgeries. RESULTS: Assuming 5% infection prevalence, cancelling all elective procedures decreases ICU overcapacity from 160 to 130%, but these elective surgical cases contribute 78% (IQR 74, 80) (1.1 trillion (T) US dollars) to inpatient hospital plus outpatient surgical gross revenue per year. Musculoskeletal, circulatory and digestive category elective surgical cases compose 33% ($447B) of total revenue. CONCLUSIONS: Procedures involving the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and digestive system account for the largest loss of hospital gross revenue when elective surgery is postponed. As hospital bed capacity increases following the COVID-19 pandemic, restoring volume of these elective cases will help maintain revenue. In these estimates, adopting universal masking would help to avoid overcapacity in all states.","output":"Balancing revenue generation with capacity generation: case distribution, financial impact and hospital capacity changes from cancelling or resuming elective surgeries in the US during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Until June 23th 2020, 9,195,635 laboratory-confirmed cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have been reported worldwide, including 473,127 deaths.

Past studies have shown inadequate maintenance practices but how far regarding Nigerian public hospital buildings is yet to receive empirical research. This paper aims to investigate the underlying issues leading to inadequate maintenance practices and proffers policy options to improve Nigerian public hospital buildings via an unexplored dimension. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a mixed research design method involving both qualitative and quantitative data. First, results from the qualitative phase were analysed and verified at the quantitative phase through a well-structured questionnaire, developed from the qualitative findings across hospital maintenance experts (work/maintenance department, health-care provider, design team and health-care building/service contractor) in Abuja, Lagos and Benin City. Findings: Insufficient funds for maintenance works, absence of planned maintenance programmes, inadequately trained personnel, etc., emerged as the maintenance inadequacies in the public hospital buildings across the cities covered. The paper categorised the cause of inadequate maintenance practices of public hospital buildings into six groups: statutory requirements, design stage, construction stage, budget for maintenance task, managing maintenance unit activities and users perception regarding maintenance management. Research limitations/implications: This paper is limited to maintenance practices of Nigerian public hospital buildings. Future research is needed to evaluate factors that will enhance outsourcing maintenance and the use of the 4th industrial revolution (building information modelling for refurbishment and building automation systems) amongst others in maintenance practices of public hospital buildings. Practical implications: As part of the practical implication, the government and hospital administrators should make provision for adequate funding and accountability of annual maintenance budgetary allocation. Also, the government should establish a national maintenance policy for public infrastructure with an emphasis on preventive maintenance and contractors reputation, outstanding pedigree, technical and financial soundness during build maintenance contract award, etc., were recommended. Originality/value: This paper reveals that the stakeholders, especially hospital administrators, policymakers and political office holders that are concern with maintenance budget, approval and disbursement concerning maintenance practices in public hospital buildings need to reawaken to her responsibility because of the inadequate implementation across the cities covered. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Maintenance of public hospital buildings in Nigeria C an assessment of current practices and policy options"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ferrets are becoming increasingly popular as pets in the United States.

Newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2), recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain entry into different cells. Interestingly, besides SARS-CoV2, four other human coronaviruses (HCoVs) use three different ectopeptidases (ACE2, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 and aminopeptidase N) as receptors independent of their common peptidase activity. This issue has led to the important question \\"why do several HCoVs rely on peptidases as their receptors?\\". In this article we discussed to answer this question. Mostly, it seems that the use of peptidases by HCoVs may be more related to their widespread presence on target cells and also viruses prefer to take advantage of molecules with relatively low affinity for their natural ligands through evolving a stronger binding affinity to the surface receptors for entry and endocytosis. Meanwhile evolutionary conservation of these receptors may allow HCoVs to switch between different host species. Finally the choice of peptidases by HCoVs may reflect the 'trial and error' nature of evolution. In conclusion substantial efforts are needed to get a strong picture of this fascinating question and poorly-explored area. Detailed understanding of the entry mechanisms offers opportunities for the development of refined strategies to stop viruses. This article is protected by copyright.

INTRODUCTION: Decompensation of heart failure leading (HF) to hospitalisation is the single most important drain on healthcare resources when managing patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Cardiac resynchronisation therapy with/without defibrillators (CRT-P/D) decreases hospitalisation due to HF and improves survival while implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICD\\"s) have a favourable effect on the former. Proprietary software algorithms embedded in these complex devices give an early warning to clinicians when decompensation of HF is imminent allowing preventative action to be undertaken. HeartLogic (HL) is one such new algorithm in Boston Scientific CRT-D/ICD devices using multiple sensors to track 5 physiological parameters, combining them into one composite Index, with an Alert being triggered if the Index is >16. The COVID-19 pandemic, due to multiple reasons, resulted in a significant decrease in availability of routine HF services in the United Kingdom, especially during the initial lockdown period from 23rd March to 1st July 2020. AIM: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, using HL, in patients with HF and complex devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients in a tertiary care cardiac centre in whom the HL software had been activated in March/April 2019 (n = 49) and comparison of those with (Group A n = 21) and without (Group B n = 28) an Alert (HLA) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results (Table): Whole cohort n = 49. Age: 72  12 years, Median: 75, Range: 36-95. 36/49 (73.5%) males. Type of device implanted: Resonate X4 CRT-D: 28/49 (57.1%); Momentum CRT-D: 8/49 (16.3%); Resonate ICD: 13/49 (26.5%). Ischaemic aetiology of HF: 35/49 (71.4%), Total duration of HL monitoring: 632  7 days (median: 632; range: 626-672). There was no difference in the age, gender, and type of device implanted between Group A and Group B. Over nearly 1 year of monitoring in each of the groups, Group A had more unstable HF with 10/21 (47.6%) having their first HLA during the pandemic. Multiple HLA\\"s, longer period in HLA and those with ischaemic aetiology of HF were higher in Group A. 17/40 (42.5%) HLA\\"s in Group A were within the first lockdown period (March - July). 24/28 (85.7%) patients in Group B had no HLA\\"s either before or during the pandemic. There was no difference in the HLA score between Groups A and B. CONCLUSION: In this limited group of patients with a medium term follow-up, using the HeartLogic software, patients with ischaemic aetiology of HF and those with more HLA\\"s prior to the pandemic did worse than those who no HLA\\"s. First HLA\\"s, multiple alerts and longer duration of alerts in this group of patients suggests a lack of access to adequate HF services during the pandemic. It has implications with regard to how HF services are configured in future whenever resources are constrained.","output":"Observations during the COVID-19 pandemic in chronic heart failure patients with complex devices in a tertiary care cardiac centre using the HeartLogic software"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"University buildings are one of the most relevant closed environments in which the COVID-19 event clearly pointed out stakeholders needs toward safety issues, especially because of the possibility of day-to-day presences of the same users (i.e. students, teachers) and overcrowding causing long-lasting contacts with possible infectors. While waiting for the vaccine, as for other public buildings, policy-makers measures to limit virus outbreaks combine individuals strategies (facial masks), occupants capacity and access control. But, up to now, no easy-to-apply tools are available for assessing the punctual effectiveness of such measures. To fill this gap, this work proposes a quick and probabilistic simulation model based on consolidated proximity and exposure-time-based rules for virus transmission confirmed by international health organizations. The building occupancy is defined according to university scheduling, identifying the main attraction areas in the building (classrooms, break-areas). Scenarios are defined in terms of occupants densities and the above-mentioned mitigation strategies. The model is calibrated on experimental data and applied to a relevant university building. Results demonstrate the model capabilities. In particular, it underlines that if such strategies are not combined, the virus spreading can be limited by only using high protection respiratory devices (i.e. FFP3) by almost every occupant. On the contrary, the combination between access control and building capacity limitation can lead to the adoption of lighter protective devices (i.e. surgical masks), thus improving the feasibility, users comfort and favorable reception. Simplified rules to combine acceptable mask filters-occupants density are thus provided to help stakeholders in organizing users presences in the building during the pandemic.

No ethical framework, however, has been proposed as a standard to guide care in this crucial matter. METHODS: Our analysis begins with definitions of ethically relevant terms. We then cycle an illustrative clinical vignette through the mathematically permissible possibilities to account for all conceivable scenarios. Scenarios with ethical tension are examined. RESULTS: Patients have the negative right to refuse care including CPR, but they do not have the positive right to demand it. Our detailed ethical analysis and recommendations support CPR if and only if 1) CPR is judged medically beneficial, and in line with the patient's and values and goals, 2) allocations or scarce resources follow a just and transparent triage system, and 3) providers are protected from contracting the disease. CONCLUSIONS: CPR is an intervention like any other, with attendant risks and benefits and with responsibility for the utilization of limited resources.

Clinical outcomes: death, length of hospital stay. An early clinical response to TCZ (48-72 h after the administration) was assessed by variations in respiratory function markers, Brescia COVID Respiratory Severity Scale (BCRSS), inflammatory parameters, and patients' and physicians' opinion. Associations were tested by multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: From a cohort of 236 patients, 77 patients treated with TCZ were included (median age 62 years (IQR 53.0-72.0), 64.9% were males), 42.9% had Charlson index &#8805;3; hypertension (41.6%), obesity (34.7%), and diabetes (20.8%). Median follow-up was 83.0 days (78.0-86.5), no patient was readmitted. ICU admission was required for 42 (54.5%), invasive mechanical ventilation in 38 (49.4%) and 10 patients died (12.9% global, 23.8% at ICU admitted).

When data are anonymized, the quantity and quality of extractable information decrease significantly. From the perspective of a clinical researcher, a method of achieving pseudonymized data without degrading data quality while also preventing data loss is proposed herein. As the level of pseudonymization varies according to the research purpose, the pseudonymization method applied should be carefully chosen. Therefore, the active participation of clinicians is crucial to transform the data according to the research purpose. This can contribute to data security by simply transforming the data through secondary data processing. Case studies demonstrated that, compared with the initial baseline data, there was a clinically significant difference in the number of datapoints added with the participation of a clinician (from 267,979 to 280,127 points, P < 0.001). Thus, depending on the degree of clinician participation, data anonymization may not affect data quality and quantity, and proper data quality management along with data security are emphasized. Although the pseudonymization level and clinical use of data have a trade-off relationship, it is possible to create pseudonymized data while maintaining the data quality required for a given research purpose.

Patients with cancer may have factors which place them at high risk for COVID 19 morbidity or mortality. Highly immunosuppressive chemotherapy regimens and possible exposure to COVID-19 during treatment may put patients at additional risk. The Society of Gynecologic Oncology convened an expert panel to address recommendations for best practices during this crisis to minimize risk to patients from deviations in cancer care and from COVID-19 morbidity. Methods An expert panel convened to develop initial consensus guidelines regarding anti-neoplastic therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to gynecologic cancer care and clinical trials. Results COVID-19 poses special risks to patients who are older, have medical co-morbidities, and cancer. In addition, this pandemic will likely strain resources, making delivery of cancer care or conduct of clinical trials unpredictable. Recommendations are to limit visits and contact with health care facilities by using telemedicine when appropriate, and choosing regimens which require less frequent visits and which are less immunosuppressive. Deviations will occur in clinical trials as a result of limited resources, and it is important to understand regulatory obligations to trial sponsors as well as to the IRB to ensure that clinical trial and patient safety oversight are maintained. Conclusions The ongoing crisis will strain resources needed to deliver cancer care.

We use narrative medicine, a field primarily concerned with honouring the intersubjective narratives shared between patients and providers, in our attempt to deepen the discussion about the ways Healthcare Heroes engenders military metaphor, antiscience discourse, and xenophobia in the USA. We argue that the militarised metaphor of Healthcare Heroes not only robs doctors and nurses of the ability to voice concerns for themselves and their patients, but effectively sacrifices them in a utilitarian bargain whereby human life is considered the expendable sacrifice necessary to 'open the U.S. economy'. Militaristic metaphors in medicine can be dangerous to both doctors and patients, thus, teaching and advocating for the critical skills to analyse and alter this language prevents undue harm to providers and patients, as well as our national and global communities.","output":"Military metaphors and pandemic propaganda: unmasking the betrayal of 'Healthcare Heroes'"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present study, a neural network-based predictive model has been used to predict the trend of the second wave of COVID-19 in a few countries, namely the US, UK, Brazil, South Africa, and India.

Design: Observational, descriptive study of ICUs monitored by a tele-ICU system across Northwell Health. Inclusion criteria: All patients admitted to Northwell Health tele-ICUs during 2019 and between March 23, 2020 and April 6, 2020. Exposure: A data extract was developed to collect data every hour for each ICU bed in the Northwell tele-critical care program as a quality reporting initiative to understand ICU capacity and resource utilization. A similar extract was developed for each hour of 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Average of any given hour during the pre-COVID-19 and pandemic periods for the following metrics: proportion of beds occupied, proportion of ventilated patients, severity of illness (measured by the ICU Discharge Readiness Score (DRS)), and length of stay (LOS). Results: Hourly analysis of data from 186 ICU beds from 14 ICUs and 9 hospitals were included, representing 10,714 patients in 2019 and 465 patients between March 23 and April 6, 2020. Average hourly occupancy increased from 64% to 78%, while the proportion of patients invasively ventilated increased from 33.9% to 84.2%. Median DRS (severity of illness score) increased from 1.08 (IQR: 0.24-6.98) to 39.38 (IQR: 12.00-71.28).

Arm-crank exercise (ACE) is the most common form of volitional aerobic exercise used by people with SCI outside a hospital. However, evidence regarding the specific effects of ACE alone on fitness and health in adults with SCI is currently lacking. Hence, this review aimed to determine the effects of ACE on cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, motor function, health-related quality of life (QoL), and adverse events in adults with chronic SCI. Inclusion criteria were: inactive adults (18 years) with chronic SCI (>12 months post injury); used ACE alone as an intervention; measured at least one of the following outcomes; cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, cardiovascular disease risk factors, motor function, health-related QoL, and adverse events. Evidence was synthesized and appraised using GRADE. Eighteen studies with a combined total of 235 participants having an injury between C4 to L3 were included. There was a moderate certainty of the body of evidence on ACE improving cardiorespiratory fitness. Exercise prescriptions from the included studies were 30-40 min of light to vigorous-intensity exercise, 3-5 times per week for 2-16 weeks. GRADE confidence ratings were very low for ACE improving body composition, CVD risks factors, motor function, or health-related QoL. No evidence suggests ACE increases the risk of developing shoulder pain or other injuries. Overall, this review recommends adults with chronic SCI should engage in regular ACE to improve cardiorespiratory fitness. More high-quality, larger-scale studies are needed to increase the level of evidence of ACE in improving cardiorespiratory fitness and to determine the effects of ACE on other outcomes.

Here, we provide a comprehensive description of all the conditions that must be fulfilled to successfully accomplish this transformation. Strong support from all hospital departments was crucial, as their activity was modified by the change. Healthcare workers from various units, notably the paediatric anaesthesiology department, worked in the adult ICU to ensure sufficient staffing. The number of physiotherapists and psychologists was increased. A support system for both healthcare workers and patients relatives was set up with the help of the mobile paediatric palliative care and support team. Supplies suitable for adults were ordered. Protocols for numerous procedures were written within a few days. Video tutorials, checklists, and simulation sessions were circulated to the entire staff. The head nurses guided and supported the new staff and usual PICU staff. The transformation was achieved within a week. The main difficulties were healthcare worker stress, changes in recommendations over time, absence of visits from relatives, and specific adult issues that paediatricians are unfamiliar with. Conclusion: For the staff, caring for adult patients was made easier by working in their familiar unit instead of being moved to an adult hospital with unfamiliar staff members and equipment.

Yet, global influenza circulation has been heavily suppressed by public health measures and travel restrictions since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, the influenza B/Yamagata lineage has not been conclusively detected since April 2020, and A(H3N2), A(H1N1), and B/Victoria viruses circulate with considerably less genetic diversity. Travel restrictions have largely confined regional outbreaks of A(H3N2) to South and Southeast Asia, B/Victoria epidemics in China, and A(H1N1) in West Africa. Seasonal influenza transmission lineages continue to perish globally, except in select hotspots, which will likely seed future epidemics. Waning population immunity and sporadic case detection will further challenge influenza vaccine strain selection and epidemic control.

A lack of permissive cell lines has limited investigations into WU virus pathogenesis and prevalence. METHODS: The encoding region of the capsid protein VP2 gene was amplified from a WU virus DNA-positive clinical specimen and expressed as a recombinant Histagged protein in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The expressed VP2 was identified by expected molecular weight and immunoreactivity with anti-His monoclonal antibody in Western blotting assay. Serum samples collected from 455 individuals of all ages in Beijing without symptoms of ARI were tested for IgG antibodies against the affinity-purified recombinant VP2 protein by Western blotting to investigate the prevalence of natural WU virus infection. In addition, serum samples from four ARI pediatric patients, whose nasopharyngeal aspirates were positive for WU virus DNA and negative for all other respiratory-related viruses, were tested for IgM antibody against the recombinant VP2. RESULTS: Of the 455 serum samples, 238 reacted with the recombinant VP2, yielding an overall positive rate of 52.3% for IgG against VP2 of WU virus. The positive rate was the highest in serum samples from infants and children between 1 to 4 years of age. One of four ARI pediatric patients was positive for IgM against WU virus VP2, implicating WU virus as the causative disease agent. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of IgG against WU polyomavirus in Beijing-based study population indicates that WU virus infection is common in Beijing.

The modest mutation rate and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 prevents the reconstruction of transmission chains from consensus genome sequences, but within-host genetic diversity could theoretically help identify close contacts. Here we describe the patterns of within-host diversity in 1181 SARS-CoV-2 samples sequenced to high depth in duplicate. 95.1% of samples show within-host mutations at detectable allele frequencies. Analyses of the mutational spectra revealed strong strand asymmetries suggestive of damage or RNA editing of the plus strand, rather than replication errors, dominating the accumulation of mutations during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Within- and between-host diversity show strong purifying selection, particularly against nonsense mutations. Recurrent within-host mutations, many of which coincide with known phylogenetic homoplasies, display a spectrum and patterns of purifying selection more suggestive of mutational hotspots than recombination or convergent evolution. While allele frequencies suggest that most samples result from infection by a single lineage, we identify multiple putative examples of co-infection. Integrating these results into an epidemiological inference framework, we find that while sharing of within-host variants between samples could help the reconstruction of transmission chains, mutational hotspots and rare cases of superinfection can confound these analyses.","output":"Patterns of within-host genetic diversity in SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction As COVID-19 rapidly developed across the UK, health services were forced to make radical changes.

Financial strain, personal debt, recent job loss and housing insecurity are important risk factors for the mental health of working-age adults. Community interventions have the potential to attenuate the mental health impact of these stressors. We examined the effectiveness of community interventions for protecting and promoting the mental health of working-age adults in high-income countries during periods of financial insecurity. METHODS: Eight electronic databases were systematically screened for experimental and observational studies published since 2000 measuring the effectiveness of community interventions on mental health outcomes. We included any non-clinical intervention that aimed to address the financial, employment, food or housing insecurity of participants. A review protocol was registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42019156364) and results are reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. RESULTS: From 2326 studies screened, 15 met our inclusion criteria. Five categories of community intervention were identified: advice services colocated in healthcare settings; link worker social prescribing; telephone debt advice; food insecurity interventions; and active labour market programmes. In general, the evidence for effective and cost-effective community interventions delivered to individuals experiencing financial insecurity was lacking. From the small number of studies without a high risk of bias, there was some evidence that financial insecurity and associated mental health problems were amenable to change and differences by subpopulations were observed.

Hemodynamic depression (i.e., periprocedural systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg or heart rate <60 beats/min), AKI (i.e., an increase of 0.3 mg/dl in the serum creatinine concentration at 48 h), and 30-day major adverse events (including death, stroke, and acute myocardial infarction) were assessed. RESULTS AKI occurred in 26 patients (21%). Although baseline kidney function and contrast volume were similar in the AKI group and the non-AKI group, the risk score was higher (10  3 vs. 8  3; p = 0.032), and hemodynamic depression (mostly due to hypotension) (65.5% vs. 35%; p = 0.005) was more common in the AKI group.

Chronic absenteeism due to health concerns was identified as a barrier to academic success. METHODS: The DOE and a public university created Hawaii Keiki: Healthy and Ready to Learn (HK), a program to provide school-based services for 170 Title 1 schools in urban and rural settings and build momentum for statewide collective action. HK has maintained support from public and private entities to address student health. RESULTS: This paper describes 5 years of program development, implementation, and continuing challenges. Most recently in 2020-2021, HK pivoted in the face of school campus closings due to COVID-19 with strategic plans, including telehealth, to move forward in this changed school environment.

The multipronged approach of building awareness of need, providing direct services, educating future care providers, and supporting sound policy development, has an impact that goes beyond any one individual area.","output":"Five Years and Moving Forward: A Successful Joint Academic-Practice Public Partnership to Improve the Health of Hawaii's Schoolchildren"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Subclinical inflammation has been associated with psychosis; however, it remains unknown whether this phenomenon appears also in the premorbid phase. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing peripheral blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines between individuals at risk of psychosis and controls. Moreover, we tested the hypothesis that the levels of these markers may be different in high-risk converters versus non-converters. Two independent reviewers searched electronic databases until Dec 16th, 2020. After reviewing publication records, 16 studies (548 high-risk individuals and 559 controls) were included. Random-effects meta-analyses with Hedges' g as the effect size estimate were performed. Individuals at clinical risk of psychosis had significantly higher levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) compared to controls (g = 0.33, 95%CI: 0.06-0.60, p = 0.018). Heterogeneity was not significant in this subgroup analysis. Changes in the levels of IL-6 in subjects at familial risk of psychosis were not significant (g = 0.04, 95%CI: -0.24 to 0.31, p = 0.798). The use of antidepressants was associated with significantly higher levels of IL-6 in high-risk individuals (Beta = 1.56, 95%CI: 0.60-2.53, p = 0.001). No significant differences in the levels of immune-inflammatory markers were found between high-risk converters and non-converters. Our findings suggest that individuals at clinical risk of psychosis show subclinical inflammation in terms of elevated IL-6 levels. This phenomenon might be related to the use of antidepressants. The present meta-analysis does not support the usefulness of single immune-inflammatory markers in predicting transition to psychosis.","output":"Immune-inflammatory markers and psychosis risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1007/s00477-020-01827-8.].","output":"Correction to: A machine learning forecasting model for COVID-19 pandemic in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article investigates the performance of the industrial structure in different emerging markets under exogenous shocks during the COVID-19 Based on the ICIO database, we use System Dynamics to simulate the evaluation of the economic system under different types of exogenous shocks (instantaneous shocks like entertainment restrictions, and continuous shocks like trade controls) We find that there are significant differences in the shock absorption capability of a country, that capability is not related to the magnitude of the shock, but related to the type of shock and the industrial structure","output":"Exogenous Shocks on the Dual-country Industrial Network: A Simulation Based on the Policies during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the demographic characteristics, clinical and pathological factors, and the outcome of cancer and COVID-19 patients in Mexico. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective, multicentric study was performed through a digital platform to have a national registry of patients with cancer and positive SARS-CoV-2 test results through reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). We performed the analysis through a multivariate logistic regression model and Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: From May to December 2020, 599 patients were registered with an average age of 56 years with 59.3% female; 27.2% had hypertension. The most frequent diagnoses were breast cancer (30.4%), lymphoma (14.7%), and colorectal cancer (14.0%); 72.1% of patients had active cancer and 23.5% of patients (141/599) were deceased, the majority of which were men (51.7%). This study found that the prognostic factors that reduced the odds of death were gender (OR = 0.42, p = 0.031) and oxygen saturation (OR = 0.90, p = 0.0001); meanwhile, poor ECOG (OR = 5.4, p = 0.0001), active disease (OR = 3.9, p = 0.041), dyspnea (OR = 2.5, p = 0.027), and nausea (OR = 4.0, p = 0.028) increased the odds of death.

As a recent example, the -coronavirus family virion, SARS-CoV-2, has quickly evolved as a pandemic leading to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been declared by the World Health Organization as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. To date, no definitive treatment or vaccine application exists for COVID-19. Although new investigations seek to repurpose existing antiviral treatments for COVID-19, innovative treatment strategies not normally considered to have antiviral capabilities may be critical to address this global concern. One such avenue that may prove to be exceedingly fruitful and offer exciting potential as new antiviral therapy involves the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its associated pathways of mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1), mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2), and AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK). Recent work has shown that mTOR pathways in conjunction with AMPK may offer valuable targets to control cell injury, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the onset of hyperinflammation, a significant disability associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, pathways that can activate mTOR may be necessary for anti-hepatitis C activity, reduction of influenza A virus replication, and vital for type-1 interferon responses with influenza vaccination. Yet, important considerations for the development of safe and effective antiviral therapy with mTOR pathways exist. Under some conditions, mTOR can act as a double edge sword and participate in virion replication and virion release from cells. Future work with mTOR as a potential antiviral target is highly warranted and with a greater understanding of this novel pathway, new treatments against several viral pathogens may successfully emerge.","output":"The Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR): Novel Considerations as an Antiviral Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel zoonotic virus identified as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has crossed species and infected humans.

The anesthetic technique used in outpatient surgery should contribute to a faster functional recovery, better pain control, and fewer complications. The aim of this study was to compare peribulbar block and balanced general anesthesia, in patients undergoing outpatient vitrectomy. Methods A prospective cohort study was carried out, including adult patients undergoing ambulatory vitrectomy, between January and February 2018. Peribulbar block or balanced general anesthesia was the independent variable analyzed. Clinical and perioperative variables were evaluated, namely, postoperative pain, nausea, and vomiting in the postoperative period, intraoperative hypotension, patient satisfaction with the anesthetic technique, time to oral diet introduction and to hospital discharge, operating room occupancy time, and pharmacological costs. SPSS? 27 was used for statistical analyses. Results Twenty-one patients were evaluated, 11 of whom underwent peribulbar block and 10 underwent balanced general anesthesia. Patients undergoing peribulbar block did not experience postoperative pain when compared to patients undergoing balanced general anesthesia (p=0.001). Intraoperative hypotension occurred in 18.2% of patients undergoing peribulbar block and in 70% of those undergoing balanced general anesthesia (p=0.03).

One way to reduce the morbidity and mortality rates from infectious diseases is through preventative or targeted vaccinations. Current vaccination strategies, however, rely on the highly specific individual contact information that is difficult and costly to obtain, in order to identify influential spreading individuals. Current approaches also focus only on direct contacts between individuals for spreading, and disregard indirect transmission where a pathogen can spread between one infected individual and one susceptible individual that visit the same location within a short time-frame without meeting. This paper presents a novel vaccination strategy that relies on coarse-grained contact information, both direct and indirect, that can be easily and efficiently collected. Rather than tracking exact contact degrees of individuals, our strategy uses the types of places people visit to estimate a range of contact degrees for individuals, considering both direct and indirect contacts. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of our strategy in comparison to the state of the art's vaccination strategies. Results show that our strategy achieves comparable performance to the oracle approach and outperforms all existing strategies when considering indirect links.","output":"Vaccination strategies on dynamic networks with indirect transmission links and limited contact information"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (LGBQ) youth continue to be disproportionately at risk for depression During COVID-19 social distancing, LGBQ youth who live with family may be more consistently exposed to potentially discriminatory family situations, and may receive reduced community and mental health support However, the Internet offers opportunities to interact with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) communities by watching videos of, and developing one-way relationships-or parasocial relationships-with, LGBTQ media personalities on platforms such as YouTube The current study explored how parasocial relationships with LGBTQ YouTubers may moderate the links between family support, loneliness, and depression symptoms among LGBQ emerging adults living with their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic A sample of 183 LGBQ emerging adults (age 18-23) was recruited from the United States in mid-July 2020 Results of a moderated mediation regression indicated that parasocial relationship strength moderated the links between family support and loneliness, and loneliness and depression symptoms The associations between family support and loneliness, and between loneliness and depression symptoms, were weakened by high parasocial relationship strength These findings contribute to understanding parasocial relationships' connections to well-being among marginalized groups during a crisis and highlight the potential of online solutions to emerging mental health disparities being experienced by LGBQ youth disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Public Significance Statement-Parasocial relationships are one-way relationships with media personalities that may have associations with well-being for socially marginalized groups In our study, high parasocial relationship strength weakened the associations between family support and loneliness, and between loneliness and depression, among LGBQ emerging adults living with their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Parasocial relationships and depression among LGBQ emerging adults living with their parents during COVID-19: The potential for online support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) has forced many universities to abruptly change the delivery of courses from in-person to online.

The early diagnosis of this disease will lead to the rapid separation of COVID-19 and non-COVID cases, which will be helpful for health care authorities to optimize resource allocation plans and early prevention of the disease. In this regard, a growing number of studies are investigating the capability of deep learning for early diagnosis of COVID-19. Computed tomography (CT) scans have shown distinctive features and higher sensitivity compared to other diagnostic tests, in particular the current gold standard, i.e., the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Current deep learning-based algorithms are mainly developed based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify COVID-19 pneumonia cases. CNNs, however, require extensive data augmentation and large datasets to identify detailed spatial relations between image instances. Furthermore, existing algorithms utilizing CT scans, either extend slice-level predictions to patient-level ones using a simple thresholding mechanism or rely on a sophisticated infection segmentation to identify the disease.

This study included patients hospitalized between March 1, 2020 and September 17, 2020 in a 5-hospital health care system in Northeast United States, who had a positive RT-PCR assay of nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 performed during hospitalization. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using admission weight and height, and the WHO classification was used to define obesity. Both bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association of obesity and other clinical parameters with mortality (defined as in-hospital death or transition to hospice care) and intensive care use (defined by transfer to intensive care unit [ICU]). Multivariate model was adjusted for demographics and 8 pertinent comorbidities. Among 3246 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, median age was 65 years (interquartile range, 51C78), 49.9% were female, 30.5% overweight, and 43.2% had obesity (20.8%, 12.1%, and 10.4% with class I, II, and III obesity, respectively). A total of 542 (16.7%) patients died or received hospice care, and 811 (25.0%) required ICU care. In unadjusted analyses, patients with obesity had lower mortality compared with normal weight adults (13.0% vs. 23.1%) but a higher risk of ICU care (26.5% vs. 22.5%) and longer duration of ICU stays (9.510.6 vs. 6.68.5 [days]; all p-values <0.05). Obesity was associated with a higher incidence of hypoxic respiratory failure requiring invasive (17.8% vs. 9.3%) and noninvasive (22.7% vs. 14.0%) ventilatory support. In multivariate analysis, older age, male sex, and diabetes were significantly associated with both mortality and ICU care. In contrast, obesity was not associated with a significantly higher mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.14; 95% CI, 0.91C1.43) but was associated with a higher risk of ICU care (OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.07C1.51 for all obesity and OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.51C2.82 for class III obesity compared with normal weight).

The potential ecological risk of chemical additives is of international concern so key differences in governance between the European Union and New Zealand to appropriately characterize their risk are highlighted.","output":"Plastic additives: challenges in ecotox hazard assessment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late December 2019, a new disease reported at the time by an unknown pathogen was reported, which was later found to be a new variant of coronavirus, now called SARS-CoV2. This new disease had a very rapid global spread, causing multiple deaths in a short time, and which led to putting the entire world on health alert. In patients who have this disease, they present bilateral opacities in frosted multilobar glass with peripheral distribution. Some authors have suggested the use of ultrasound at the point of care for its early recognition. In this study, we evaluated the findings of lung ultrasound in 25 patients admitted to the General Hospital Dr. Enrique Cabrera, Mexico, with a diagnosis confirmed by RT-PCR of SARS CoV2. This small retrospective study suggests that artifacts like glass rockets with or without the Birolleau variant (White lung), confluent B-lines, thick irregular pleural lines, and variable size (subpleural) consolidations are typical findings of lung ultrasound in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The presence of these findings is useful when evaluating patients with suspected COVID-19. In resource-limited and austere settings where chest radiography, CT, and RT-PCR are not available or the response time is long, lung ultrasound performed by trained personnel can be an aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19.","output":"Lung Ultrasound Findings in Mexican Patients with Sars Cov2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The diversity and density of urban functions have been known to affect urban vibrancy positively, but the relation between the two has not been empirically examined; if high density is associated with low diversity in an area, its vibrancy may not increase. To obtain a better understanding of the metabolism of cities and directions for urban planning interventions, this paper offers empirical evidence on the association between the diversity and density of urban functions in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area, using a robust density index that was determined via a Monte Carlo simulation. By conducting association analyses, it was found that highly dense station areas tended to display low diversity at multiple scales. Further investigation indicated that this negative correlation was owing to different spatial characteristics of functions and complementary functioning among highly accessible station areas. This paper argues for considering both diversity and density in urban planning to make station areas vibrant and resilient.","output":"Diversity and density of urban functions in station areas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes chemosensory dysfunction. AIMS/OBJECTIVES: To determine the characteristics of chemosensory dysfunction and to identify factors associated with chemosensory complete recovery and time to recovery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included all patients presenting with chemosensory dysfunction and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from May to August 2020 who underwent telemedicine follow-up after 1 year to assess their chemosensory recovery. RESULTS: A total of 372 patients were included, of which 53.8% were male. The mean age  SD was 37.45  13.44. The majority experienced combined (olfactory and gustatory) dysfunction (85.7%), and 315 patients (84.7%) had complete loss of chemosensory function. The independent predictors associated with a low likelihood of complete recovery were parosmia (aOR 0.16, p < .001), upper respiratory tract symptoms (aOR 0.28, p = .001), and dyspnoea (aOR 0.21, p < .001), whereas the factors associated with a long recovery period were parosmia (aOR 12.04, p = .002), headache (aOR 7.19, p = .007), and hypertension (aOR 7.76, p = .039). CONCLUSIONS: A full recovery outcome was predominant. The presence of parosmia was linked to both an incomplete recovery and a long time to recovery.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected blood transfusion services all over the world. But its impact on donor deferral rate and the pattern is unclear in light of the new donor deferral policy due to the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was divided into pre-COVID and COVID (15 March 2019-14 March 2021). All the deferred donors were divided into six different categories: (1) medical causes, (2) surgical causes, (3) drugs and vaccination, (4) risk of transfusion-transmitted diseases, (5) miscellaneous causes and (6) flu-like symptoms. In addition, COVID-related deferrals were also incorporated. All these above categories along with the donor demography were analysed by SPSS software version 25. RESULTS: The donor deferral rate was 17.03% and 12.74% during the pre-COVID and COVID periods, respectively. During the pre-COVID period, Category 3 deferrals and during COVID period, Category 6 deferrals were significantly higher. A reversal in pattern with increased blood pressure (40.2% vs. 24.04%) over-riding low haemoglobin (34.77% vs. 55.5%) was noted in the Category 1 deferral during the COVID period. Category 1 deferral was more in middle-aged adults as compared to young and old adults (p < 0.05). Among middle-aged adults, deferral due to flu-like symptoms was also significantly more during the COVID period (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 significantly affected the donor pool and changed the pattern of donor deferral. Understanding donor deferral patterns may help in identifying targeted donor populations and planning donor recruitment strategies in future pandemic crises.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on blood donor deferral patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic: A retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Acute appendicitis is the most common emergency in abdominal surgery, but remains a continuing controversy regarding the most appropriate method of removing the inflamed appendix. MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2002 to December 2012, 1037 women underwent appendectomy (average age: 2515.7 y; range: 6 to 91 y). Of these, 519 underwent open appendectomy (OA) and 518 underwent laparoscopic appendectomy (LA). For all the patients we determined the postoperative hospital stay, the eventual readmissions within 30 days after discharge, the length of surgical procedures (data were available only for the period from January 2008 to December 2012), the costs for the OA and LA, and the rate of negative appendicitis. RESULTS In our cohort of patients, 189 women (18.2%) had a negative appendectomy. Considering the postoperative hospital stay (average: 4.23.6 d; range: 1 to 32 d in OA group and average: 3.93.1 d; range: 1 to 21 d in LA group; P=0.15) there were no statistical differences between 2 groups. The average length of surgical procedures in LA group was 42.318.4 minutes (range: 8 to 135 min) and 43.219 minutes in the OA group (range: 10 to 135 min) (P=0.63). The average net cost of LA was 1203.61 euros, whereas for OA it was 95.18 euros. In this study, we considered only the surgical materials. CONCLUSIONS LAs are not associated with a lower complication rate than the OAs and, above all, LAs are more expensive than OAs.

While farm management and surrounding landscape can influence wild pollinator contributions, managed pollinator contributions may be primarily driven by their stocking densities, though this is not well studied across crops. We selected 20 southern highbush blueberry farms along two independent gradients of honey bee Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) stocking density (~1-11 hives/acre) and bumble bee Bombus impatiens Cresson (Hymenoptera: Apidae) stocking density (0 - 3 colonies/acre) ensuring that stocking densities were not correlated with farm or landscape attributes. Across farms, we observed managed and wild bee visitation rates, and measured yield estimates. Farms with greater bumble bee stocking densities had higher bumble bee visitation rates and yield estimates, but farms with higher honey bee stocking densities only received higher honey bee visitation rates at the end of bloom and did not have higher yield estimates. The main wild pollinator, the southeastern blueberry bee Habropoda laboriosa (Fabricius) (Hymenoptera: Apidae), showed higher visitation rates on organic farms and in late bloom. In general, higher visitation rates by honey bees, bumble bees, and H. laboriosa were correlated with higher yields. Our results suggest that yields are limited by bee visitation rates, and that within the stocking density ranges studied, increasing managed bumble bees, but not honey bees, increases their visitation rates. While H. laboriosa had the greatest effect on yield estimates, its activity appears to be limited by both a phenological mismatch with crop bloom and farm management.","output":"Blueberry Yields Increase With Bee Visitation Rates, but Bee Visitation Rates are not Consistently Predicted by Colony Stocking Densities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the overall health and functioning in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is scarce.

Methods: Data from axSpA patients participating in the first phase of the REUMAVID study were analysed. REUMAVID is a cross-sectional, observational study collecting data through an online questionnaire of unselected patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs), recruited by patient organizations. The survey was disseminated during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (April-July 2020) in seven European countries (Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom). Patients with axSpA who completed the ASAS health index (ASAS-HI) questionnaire were included in this analysis. Descriptive analyses were used to present socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as daily habits. Overall health and functioning were defined according to the ASAS-HI (0-17), as follows: good health (ASAS-HI 5), acceptable health (ASAS-HI 6-11), and poor health (ASAS-HI 12). As secondary outcomes, well-being (WHO-5), self-perceived health status, and HADS for anxiety and depression were assessed. Results: Out of 670 axSpA patients, 587 (87.6%) completed ASAS-HI. Of these, 70.4% were female, 72.6% were married or in a relationship, 46.7% had university studies and 37.6% were currently employed. Mean age was 49.912.8 years and mean BMI was 26.75.5. Regarding extraarticular manifestations, 13.6% had psoriasis, 12.1% inflammatory bowel disease and 18.7% uveitis. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, 50.9% were receiving biological drugs, 46.3% NSAIDs, 26.4% painkillers, 24.7% conventional DMARDs, and 11.9% oral corticosteroids.

Helmet NIV has seen an increase in use during the COVID-19 pandemic because it is low-cost, readily available, and provides viral filters between the patient and clinician. Helmet NIV may also provide better patient outcomes by delaying or eliminating the need for invasive ventilation. Its widespread adoption has been limited, however, by the lack of a respiratory monitoring system that is needed to address known safety vulnerabilities and to provide clinicians with a respiratory profile of the patient. To address this safety need, we have developed an inexpensive respiratory monitoring system that is based on readily available commercial components and is suitable for rapid local manufacture. The system is designed for use in conjunction with the COVID-19 Helmet developed by Sea-Long Medical Systems, but is modular and can be used with other ventilation systems. The monitoring system comprises one or more flow and pressure sensors and a central remote station that can be used to remotely monitor up to 20 patients simultaneously. The system reports flow, pressure, and clinically relevant metrics including respiratory rate, tidal volume equivalent, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and the ratio of inspiratory time to expiratory time (I:E). The device will sound alarms based on clinician-set thresholds. In bench tests using a commercial ventilator and artificial lung system, our device performs comparably to a commercial single-patient respiratory monitor.

Complete survival protection was observed in mice upon a single dose of mDEF201 administration 1 days prior to virus challenge. Viral load in the serum and multiple organs were significantly reduced upon mDEF201 administration in a dose dependent manner as compare with adenovirus 5 vector placebo set. Histological analysis of the mice tissue revealed that mDEF201 could significantly reduce the tissue morphological abnormities, mainly infiltration of immune cells and muscle fibre necrosis caused by CHIKV infection. In addition, administration of mDEF201 at 6 hours post CHIKV challenge also showed promising inhibitory effect against viral replication and dissemination.

Thus, MERS-CoV was found to be more prevalent in Saudi Arabia especially in Riyadh, where 756 cases (52.4%) were the worst hit area of the country identified, followed by the western region Makkah where 298 cases (20.6%) were recorded. This prevalence update indicates that the Arabian Peninsula, particularly Saudi Arabia, is the hardest hit region regarding the emerging MERS-CoV infections worldwide. GCC countries including Saudi Arabia now have the infrastructure in place that allows physicians and scientific community to identify and immediately respond to the potential risks posed by new outbreaks of MERS-CoV infections in the region. Given the continuum of emergence and the large magnitude of the disease in our region, more studies will be required to bolster capabilities for timely detection and effective control and prevention of MERS-CoV in our region.","output":"Occurrence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) across the Gulf Corporation Council countries: Four years update"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The high transmissibility rate of Covid, obliged us to adapt and transform our symptomatic clinic to be able to continue diagnosing and treat breast cancer and at the same time protect patients and staff.Prior analysis of clinical activity suggests at least 80 per cent of patient attending breast clinics are either healthy or found to have benign conditions, identification of this group of patients ahead of time would allow assess and treat them safely with a telephone clinic consultation insteadOn this tenet we worked, in compliance to new and emerging guidance about breast cancer care during the pandemic from the Association of Breast Surgeons and the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, to devise a novel vetting system for stratifying and prioritizing all new referral to out-patient clinics.All changes were discussed at MDTS. Adjustments and refinements were made as necessary due to the dynamic and evolving situation;changing guidance and staff availability due to illness, need for self-isolation and those shielding at home.Patients were stratified according to their history and symptoms and their likely cancer risk,.Patients with high risk of cancer were offered face-to-face consultation, those at low risk were offered telephone consultation.From 23rd March to 1st May 2020, we moved all possible patients to phone consultations. 299 new patients were vetted: 149 allocated phone appointment, 150 attended face-to-face clinics, of these 62 were diagnosed with breast cancer.Initial phone contact appears safe with low risk patients.

Timely and accessible neuroimaging, however, can be limited in clinical stroke pathways. Here, portable magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI) acquired at very low magnetic field strength (0.064 T) is used to obtain actionable bedside neuroimaging for 50 confirmed patients with ischemic stroke. Low-field pMRI detected infarcts in 45 (90%) patients across cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar structures. Lesions as small as 4 mm were captured. Infarcts appeared as hyperintense regions on T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted imaging sequences. Stroke volume measurements were consistent across pMRI sequences and between low-field pMRI and conventional high-field MRI studies. Low-field pMRI stroke volumes significantly correlated with stroke severity and functional outcome at discharge. These results validate the use of low-field pMRI to obtain clinically useful imaging of stroke, setting the stage for use in resource-limited environments.","output":"Portable, low-field magnetic resonance imaging enables highly accessible and dynamic bedside evaluation of ischemic stroke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE We compared the immediate surgical outcomes of single-port laparoscopic cystectomy (SLC) and conventional laparoscopic cystectomy (CLC) for managing ovarian dermoid cysts.

The outcome measures included operative time, blood loss, postoperative pain, analgesic use, and serum levels of hormones, including estrogen (E2), follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and anti-Mullerian hormone. RESULTS SLC was associated with less time required for specimen retrieval (1.3  0.8 vs. 12.0  3.4 minutes, p < 0.001), fewer ruptured bags (0% vs. 10.8%, p = 0.049), and less need of additional wound elongation (0% vs. 27.0%, p = 0.001) when respectively compared with CLC. Additionally, patients who underwent SLC reported lower postoperative lower abdominal pain and less accumulated postoperative analgesics when respectively compared with patients who underwent CLC.

In this study, coronavirus sequences were detected using a nested RT-PCR targeting 440 bp of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in six of 79 fecal samples collected from an urban colony of E. helvum in Ibadan, Nigeria. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all six sequences were monophyletic and clustered in lineage D of Betacoronavirus. The extension of two fragments allowed us to classify our sequences within the RdRp Group Unit defined for Kenyan Betacoronavirus from the same host species.

The high mortality in African-Americans and males, in general, raises the concern for a possible X-linked mediated process that could affect the viral pathogenesis and the immune system. We hypothesized that G6PD, the most common X linked enzyme deficiency associated with redox status, may have a role in severity of pneumonia. Retrospective chart review was performed in hospitalized patients with COVID19 pneumonia needing supplemental oxygen. A total of 17 patients were evaluated;six with G6PD deficiency (G6PDd), and 11 with normal levels. The two groups (Normal and G6PDd) were comparable in terms of age, sex and co-morbidities, and laboratory parameters-LDH, IL-6, CRP, and Ferritin, respectively. Thirteen patients needed ventilatory support with 8 in the normal group and 5 in the G6PDd group (72% vs.83%).

Here, we investigate Torquetenovirus (TTV) DNA load - a marker reflecting the intensity of the overall immune response - as well as SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and IgM/IgG antibodies in COVID-19-positive patients. Methods Two hundred and fifteen COVID-19-positive patients were enrolled, including 87 severe cases and 128 mild-moderate cases. SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and IgM/IgG antibodies, as well as TTV DNA loads, were measured on longitudinal plasma samples. Results The rate of severe cases was higher in patients with low TTV DNA load in plasma considering a threshold of 700 copies/mL. In severe patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia positivity rates were higher than those in mild-moderate cases at any timepoint. When combined, TTV DNA load and SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia allowed to predict the outcome of COVID-19 infection, with a higher risk (HR=12.4) of ICU admission in patients with low TTV DNA load and positive SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia.

This current review is one of the few kinds of research, which has sought to check the effect of the coronavirus on mental health issues and the need for psychological well-being in the standard population and patients in response to the global wake of the epidemic and its effects in Pakistan. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study has utilized the data on coronavirus patients from the Ministry of Health, National Institute of Health Pakistan. The age of the confirmed coronavirus patients ranged from 12 to over 80 years, including international and local transmitters. RESULTS: Recorded data delivered by the National Institute of Health, Pakistan has quantified that the outbreak of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) entered Pakistan through international travelers. They carried the virus after they visited different countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, the USA, China, and European countries. By April 30, 2020, there were 16,473 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Total deaths are 361, with a mortality rate of 2.20%, and ultimately recovered cases reported 4,105 with a percentage of 24.90%. As of October 24, 2020, there were 327,063 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 in Pakistan, which posed vast social, economic, health, and environmental problems in the society. The epidemic has affected individuals across the country and confirmed patients in the country increased rapidly. CONCLUSION: The government officials had initially estimated over 50,000 corona patents by April 30, which would be a great challenge; however, the situation remained under control because of suppression and smart-lockdown strategies by the Government.

DESIGN: Mixed-methods study in 5 of the 26 facilities; the facilities were affiliated to an academic network of nursing homes. PARTICIPANTS: Visitors and healthcare professionals. INTERVENTION: Allowing visitors using local regulations based on national guidelines. MEASUREMENTS: Digital questionnaire, analyzing documentation such as infection prevention control protocols, attending meetings of COVID-19 crisis teams, in-depth telephone or in-person interviews with visitors and healthcare professionals, and on-site observations. RESULTS: National guidelines were translated with great variety into local care practice. Healthcare professionals agreed that reopening would increase the well-being of the residents and their loved ones. However, there were also great worries for increasing workload, increasing the risk of emotional exhaustion, and the risk of COVID-19 infections. Compliance with local regulations was generally satisfactory, but maintaining social distance and correctly wearing face masks appeared to be difficult. Care staff remained ambivalent for fear of infections. In general, allowing visitors was experienced as having a positive impact on the well-being of all stakeholders. Nevertheless, some residents with dementia showed negative effects. CONCLUSION: The complete lockdown of Dutch nursing homes had a substantial impact on the well-being of the residents.

Clinical experience suggests a lower documented prevalence. This could cause longer admissions and complications, such as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). We carried out a service evaluation to investigate the recognition and management of catatonia on inpatient units in Southern Health Foundation Trust (SHFT). We reviewed the local documented prevalence of catatonia, treatment offered and prevalence of complications. METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic records of 95 consecutive admissions to four adult inpatient units in SHFT, starting on 1st August 2020. We reviewed notes for the admission to establish whether catatonia was suspected and identified. We applied the screening questions from the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) to the documented mental state examinations (MSE) prior to, and shortly after, admission. We also recorded the prescriptions issued during the first 72 hours of admission, and whether patients developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), serotonin syndrome or required admission to a general hospital during admission. RESULT: Catatonia was documented as a possibility for 2 patients (2.1%). One showed possible posturing and stupor, while there were no documented symptoms for the other. In both cases the possibility was discounted by the clinical team. Twelve patients (12.6%) showed one or more possible or confirmed signs of catatonia. Eleven of these were prescribed regular antipsychotic medication on admission, but only 3 were prescribed regular benzodiazepines. NMS was more likely to be suspected in patients with a BFCRS of 1 or more compared with those with a score of 0, with an odds ratio of 8.1 (95% CI [1.03-64.0], Fisher's exact test = 7.79, p = .076). CONCLUSION: Catatonia is likely under-recognised and under-treated locally among psychiatric inpatients. Although only approaching statistical significance, the higher rate of suspected NMS in patients showing possible catatonia is noteworthy and needs further investigation. Regular benzodiazepines were not frequently prescribed in this group, while antipsychotics, prescribed in all of these patients, can precipitate NMS. Alternatively, this finding could reflect the overlap in clinical presentation between NMS and catatonia. Data collection was limited by the frequent use of remote clerking, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the quality of mental state examinations was often not sufficient to draw any conclusions on the possible presence or absence of catatonic symptoms.

While the disease is mainly confined to three of the nine provinces, most local transmissions occur because of importation of cases from neighbouring countries. The government of South Africa has reiterated its commitment to eliminate malaria within its borders. To support the achievement of this goal, this study presents a costCbenefit analysis of malaria elimination in South Africa through simulating different scenarios aimed at achieving malaria elimination within a 10-year period. METHODS: A dynamic mathematical transmission model was developed to estimate the costs and benefits of malaria elimination in South Africa between 2018 and 2030. The model simulated a range of malaria interventions and estimated their impact on the transmission of Plasmodium falciparum malaria between 2018 and 2030 in the three endemic provinces of Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal. Local financial, economic, and epidemiological data were used to calibrate the transmission model. RESULTS: Based on the three primary simulated scenarios: Business as Usual, Accelerate and Source Reduction, the total economic burden was estimated as follows: for the Business as Usual scenario, the total economic burden of malaria in South Africa was R 3.69 billion (USD 223.3 million) over an 11-year period (2018C2029). The economic burden of malaria was estimated at R4.88 billion (USD 295.5 million) and R6.34 billion (~ USD 384 million) for the Accelerate and Source Reduction scenarios, respectively. Costs and benefits are presented in midyear 2020 values. Malaria elimination was predicted to occur in all three provinces if the Source Reduction strategy was adopted to help reduce malaria rates in southern Mozambique. This could be achieved by limiting annual local incidence in South Africa to less than 1 indigenous case with a prediction of this goal being achieved by the year 2026. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria elimination in South Africa is feasible and economically worthwhile with a guaranteed positive return on investment (ROI). Findings of this study show that through securing funding for the proposed malaria interventions in the endemic areas of South Africa and neighbouring Mozambique, national elimination could be within reach in an 8-year period.

Thus this research was suggested to examine the association between maintenance of regular aerobic exercise at a recommended level and depression and HRQOL in patients with gastric cancer during or after treatment. The findings indicated that exercise can have a synergistic effect on improvement in HRQOL via indirect positive effects on depression and direct effects on HRQOL in patients with gastric cancer. The findings of this research may add the evidence on the benefits of exercise for HRQOL and depression in patients with gastric cancer to the research community. ABSTRACT: The benefits of exercise for health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and depression in patients with gastrointestinal disease remain unclear, and studies on gastric cancer are scant. This study examines the association between the maintenance of regular aerobic exercise at a recommended level and depression and HRQOL in patients with gastric cancer during or after treatment. In this cross-sectional study, a face-to-face survey was used to collect data from 126 patients with primary gastric cancer during or after treatment in a tertiary acute-care hospital in Korea. Regular exercise was defined as regularly maintained aerobic exercise of at least moderate intensity consuming 4 metabolic equivalents for 150 min/wk for at least 6 months. Depression was measured using the 9-item version of the Patient Health Questionnaire, and HRQOL was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30. Patients who maintained aerobic exercise at a recommended level were less likely to have depression and more likely to have improved global QOL, as well as physical, role, and emotional functioning.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control, ADR nephrosis, and simvastatin-treated ADR nephrosis groups. ADR nephropathy was induced by a single-tail intravenous injection of ADR (6.5 mg/kg). Anti-inflammatory effects of simvastatin were studied by evaluating the expression of the inflammatory mediators interleukin-1 beta (IL-1), transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1), and transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B). In addition, renal function, serum lipid levels, and histopathology were compared between groups. Simvastatin significantly decreases IL-1 and TGF-1 expression and NF-B activation, accompanied by significant attenuation of glomerulosclerosis and renal function at 12 weeks after ADR injection, and these changes occurred in the absence of lowering of serum lipids. These results suggest that overexpression of inflammation in the renal region may contribute to development of glomerulosclerosis in ADR-induced-nephropathy rats, and simvastatin treatment prevented glomerulosclerosis independent of the lipid-lowering effects. The beneficial effect of simvastatin might be mediated by the effect of anti-inflammatory action through a reduction of NF-B activation, and IL-1 and TGF- expression.","output":"Simvastatin ameliorates glomerulosclerosis in Adriamycin-induced-nephropathy rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Respiratory infections are life-threatening and therapeutic antibodies (Ab) have a tremendous opportunity to benefit to patients with pneumonia due to multidrug resistance bacteria or emergent virus, before a vaccine is manufactured. In respiratory infections, inhalation of anti-infectious Ab may be more relevant than intravenous (IV) injection-the standard route-to target the site of infection and improve Ab therapeutic index. One major challenge associated to Ab inhalation is to prevent protein instability during the aerosolization process. Ab drug development for IV injection aims to design a high-quality product, stable to different environment stress. In this study, we evaluated the suitability of Ab formulations developed for IV injection to be extended for inhalation delivery. We studied the aerosol characteristics and the aggregation profile of three Ab formulations developed for IV injection after nebulization, with two mesh nebulizers. Although the formulations for IV injection were compatible with mesh nebulization and deposition into the respiratory tract, the Ab were more unstable during nebulization than exposition to a vigorous shaking. Overall, our findings indicate that Ab formulations developed for IV delivery may not easily be repurposed for inhalation delivery and point to the requirement of a specific formulation development for inhaled Ab.

We report on the effectiveness and safety of intra-arterial/intravenous (IA/IV) glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (tirofiban) infusion for treating thromboembolism during endovascular coil embolization of cerebral aneurysm. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of 242 patients with ruptured or unruptured cerebral aneurysms (n=264) who underwent endovascular coil embolization from January 2011 to June 2014. Thromboembolism occurred in 20 patients (7.4%), including 14 cases of ruptured aneurysms and 6 cases of unruptured aneurysms. The most common site of aneurysms was the anterior communicating artery (n=8), followed by middle cerebral artery (n=6). When we found an enlarged thromboembolism during coil embolization, we tried to dissolve it using tirofiban administered via IA and IV loading (5 g/kg, respectively) for 3-5 minutes followed by IV maintenance (0.08 g/kg/min) for approximately 4-24 hours. RESULTS In 4 of 5 patients with total vessel occlusion, the vessel was recanalized to Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction Perfusion Scale (TICI) grade 3, and in 1 patient to TICI grade 2a. In 2 patients with partial vessel occlusion and 13 patients with minimal occlusion, the vessel recanalized to TICI grade 3.

METHODS: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 70 postmenopausal women who referred to the gynecology clinic of Baqiyatallah and 502 Artesh hospitals in Tehran, Iran, and met the all inclusion criteria were randomly allocated into two equal groups (intervention and control groups) using block randomization. The intervention group received self-care training program in physical, psychological, social and sexual dimensions in 5 sessions during a week. The control group also had 5 sessions exactly the same as the intervention group, except that they received only routine care and training. Data were collected pre- and post-intervention using Menopause Symptoms' Severity Inventory (MSSI-38) questionnaire and the Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale (RDAS) questionnaire. RESULTS: In the control and intervention groups before the intervention, socio-demographic characteristics (P > 0.05), the mean scores of MSSI-38 (P = 0.388) and RADS (P = 0.476) were not statistically significant. However, in the intervention group the mean scores of MSSI-38 (49.88  3.3 vs. 39.33  3.7, P < 0.001) and RADS (35.15  4.3 vs. 49.48  3.2, P < 0.001) after the intervention changed significantly and this change were statistically significant compared to the control group. Significant inverse correlation between severity of menopausal symptoms and marital satisfaction was observed with r = -0.461, P < 0.001.

METHODS This study applied a mathematical model to estimate the increase in the number of cases in S?o Paulo state, Brazil during four epidemic periods and the subsequent 300 days. We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days. CONCLUSIONS: Although the predictive capacity of this model was limited by the accuracy of the available data, our results showed that social distancing is currently the best non-pharmacological measure.","output":"Modeling transmission dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in S?o Paulo, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is wreaking havoc around the world.

Recommendations have been introduced to reduce the transmission risk of virulent airborne viral particles by increasing ventilation rates, expressed in air-changes-per-hour (ACH), effectively improving the dilution of airborne pathogens via mechanical ventilation. However, the infrastructural and operational costs associated with upgrades of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems make these solutions expensive. It is well documented that UVC disinfection can help lower exposure risks by inactivating viruses in shared enclosed spaces, and the performances of such solutions be translated into equivalent ventilation (equivalent ACH or eACH). Here, we present the first framework to extract the optimum UVC output requirements for a target eACH, and improve facilities ability to comply with ventilation guidelines at lower energy costs. The Kahn-Mariita (KM) model considers the air quality of a shared enclosed space over time by supplementing existing mechanical ventilation with localized UVC air treatment, whether in recirculating units or upper-air systems, and extracts the systems requirements based on end-user needs by incorporating variables such as room size, occupancy, existing ventilation, and target eACH. An example of a conference room shows that a UVC chamber with an air recirculation rate of 160m3/h increases the ventilation from ACH=3 to eACH=7.9 and reduce down-time from 46 minutes to <10 minutes with as little 1W of UVC output. A recirculation rate of 30m3/h however offers no noticeable benefits above 200mW, with a maximum reachable eACH=3.9 and down-time of approximately 31 minutes. The KM model is unique in that it allows for the first time to find the optimum UVC output needs to ensure air quality is maintained and transmission risk minimized, while increasing energy savings. Recent studies suggest mechanically increasing fresh air supply will more than double the energy costs of HVAC systems, while the use of UVC reduces energy demand as much as by 50%. The KM model approaches air quality and energy efficiency in a unified way by incorporating UVC as a supplement to existing ventilation to increase eACH, reduce down-time, and increase the closed space occupancy.","output":"Quantifying the impact of UVC in reducing airborne pathogen transmission and improving energy efficiency for healthy buildings: Kahn-Mariita equivalent ventilation model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the hallmarks of SARS-CoV-2 infection is an induced immune dysregulation, in some cases resulting in cytokine storm syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Circulating miRNAs in patients who underwent ARDS and needed mechanical ventilation (MV+; n = 15) were analyzed by next generation sequencing in comparison with patients who had COVID-19 poor symptoms but without intensive care unit requirement (MV?; n = 13). A comprehensive in silico analysis by integration with public gene expression dataset and pathway enrichment was performed. Whole miRNA sequencing identified 170 differentially expressed miRNAs between patient groups. After the validation step by qPCR in an independent sample set (MV+ = 10 vs. MV? = 10), the miR-369-3p was found significantly decreased in MV+ patients (Fold change ? 2.7). After integrating with gene expression results from COVID-19 patients, the most significant GO enriched pathways were acute inflammatory response, regulation of transmembrane receptor protein Ser/Thr, fat cell differentiation, and regulation of biomineralization and ossification.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are structurally more complicated as compared to other RNA viruses. This viral epidemic has led to the deaths of many, including the elderly or those with chronic disease or compromised immunity. Viruses cause infection and diseases in humans of varying degrees, upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) cause common cold while lower respiratory tract infections induce pneumonia, bronchitis, and even severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The costs of COVID-19 are not limited. It equally affects all the medical, sociological, psychological, and economic aspects globally. This is regarded as the third deadly outbreak in the last two decades after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS (2002C2003) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome MERS (2012). Based on the sequence homology of SARS-CoV-2, different animal sources including bats, snakes, and pangolins have been reported as potential carriers of this viral strain. Real-time RT-PCR represents the primary method for the diagnosis of new emerging viral strain SARS-CoV-2.

However, initiatives implemented seem insufficient to overcome the challenges regarding the integral development and improvement of the nutritional status of children in Brazil. The initial developmental stages of a child include pregnancy, breastfeeding, and complementary feeding, which are determinants in future aspects of health and nutritional status. Therefore, the strategies addressing problems during these three periods of life have the potential to positively impact the promotion of healthy eating habits and food security throughout life. Developing countries with huge dimensions and vast inequalities, like Brazil, are marked by differences in regional, cultural, and social contexts that may hinder the implementation of programs and policies with a broad scope. Extensive operational and professional costs, in addition to time-consuming activities that are necessary to apply, monitor, and evaluate interventions may jeopardize the proper assessment of programs and policy goals, generating the inefficiency and waste of resources in the health system. Thus, programs and policies aimed at creating and modifying habits should consider an intersectoral action within local contexts, involving health professionals, universities, policy managers, and the community.

My conclusion is that ever since the time of the Bible, Judaism has viewed the maintenance of health as having social, religious, and medical importance. Rabbis over the last centuries have justified separating and isolating the sick and extending that isolation to individuals who are in danger of succumbing to the illness.

The purpose of this research is to investigate whether the TAT of our laboratory has changed since the adoption of TLA, as well as to optimize laboratory workflow, improve laboratory testing efficiency, and provide better services of clinical diagnosis and treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Laboratory data was extracted from our laboratory information system in two 6-month periods: pre-TLA (July to December 2019) and post-TLA (July to December 2020), respectively. RESULTS: The median TAT for positive cultures decreased significantly from pre-TLA to post-TLA (65.93 vs 63.53, P<0.001). For different types of cultures, The TAT of CSF changed the most (86.76 vs 64.30, P=0.007), followed by sputum (64.38 vs 61.41, P<0.001), urine (52.10 vs 49,57, P<0.001), blood (68.49 vs 66.60, P<0.001). For Ascites and Pleural fluid, there was no significant difference (P>0.05). Further analysis found that the incidence of broth growth only for pre-TLA was 12.4% (14/133), while for post-TLA, it was 3.4% (4/119). The difference was statistically significant (P=0.01).

Methods: Using the frequency of the number of new daily COVID 19 infections in the 110 Italian provinces during the period from 25 February 2020 to 15 March 2021, we estimated Taylor's Law using a system of simultaneous equations in five time sub-periods. Results: The infection in Italy initially manifested itself almost exclusively in a few provinces in the north and was very intense. Within a month, the infection spread to the whole country, with varying intensity between provinces. Subsequently, partly as a result of the introduction of containment measures or their relaxation, the infection manifested itself in different ways depending on both the time frame and the geographical area. Conclusions: Our results show that Taylors law fits well the temporal dynamics of infection density and can therefore be considered as a useful tool to predict the spatial variability of the Covid-19 infection density. Its slope parameter reflects the temporal correlation of infection density and the effect of nationwide lockdown on the disease spread through the lens of two stochastic population growth models. Our finding suggests that Taylor's law may be used to monitor the Covid-19 outbreak development and to predict the spatial spread of the infection density in the Italian provinces in successive pandemic waves of Covid-19.","output":"Taylor's Law Detects and Interprets Temporal Trends of the Spatial Distribution of Covid-19 Daily Infection Density Across Italian Provinces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Physical activity has been associated with a decreased risk for dementia, but the mechanisms underlying this association remain to be determined. Our objective was to assess whether cardiovascular risk factors mediate the association between physical activity and brain integrity markers in older adults. METHODS: Participants from the Age-Well study underwent, at baseline, a physical activity questionnaire, cardiovascular risk factors collection (systolic blood pressure, body mass index [BMI], current smoker status, HDL-cholesterol, total-cholesterol, insulin) and multimodal neuroimaging (structural-MRI, diffusion-MRI, FDG-PET, Florbetapir-PET). Multiple regressions were conducted to assess the association between physical activity, cardiovascular risk factors, and neuroimaging. Mediation analyses were performed to test whether cardiovascular risk factors mediated the associations between physical activity and neuroimaging. RESULTS: 134 cognitively unimpaired older adults (65 years) were included. Higher physical activity was associated with higher grey matter (GM) volume (?=0.174, p=0.030) and cerebral glucose metabolism (?=0.247, p=0.019), but not with amyloid deposition or white matter integrity. Higher physical activity was associated with lower insulin and BMI, but not with the other cardiovascular risk factors. Lower insulin and BMI were related to higher GM volume, but not to cerebral glucose metabolism. When controlling for insulin and BMI, the association between physical activity and cerebral glucose metabolism remained unchanged, while the association with GM volume was lost. When insulin and BMI were entered in the same model, only BMI remained a significant predictor of GM volume. Mediation analyses confirmed that insulin and BMI mediated the association between physical activity and GM volume. Analyses were replicated within Alzheimer's disease-sensitive regions, and results remained overall similar. CONCLUSIONS: The association between physical activity and GM volume is mediated by changes in insulin and BMI. In contrast, the association with cerebral glucose metabolism seems to be independent from cardiovascular risk factors. Older adults practicing physical activity have cardiovascular benefits, through the maintenance of a lower BMI and insulin, resulting in greater structural brain integrity. This study has strong implications as understanding how physical activity affects brain health may help developing strategies to prevent or delay age-related decline.

Other studies have also found that individualism can inspire uptake of preventative behaviors as a means of personal protection. It is possible that these cultural orientations may promote different patterns of prevention (e.g. mask wearing vs. social distancing). Furthermore, existing studies examining the role of individualism and collectivism during the COVID-19 pandemic have frequently failed to account for other psychological processes, including differences in personality, which could help provide a better understanding of the psychological process underlying prevention behavior. METHODS: Participants were recruited using social media advertisements. The Cultural Orientations Scale measured individualismCcollectivism and hierarchism-egalitarianism. The Ten Item Personality Inventory measured the five factor model of personality. Multivariable models, dominance analyses and structural equation mediation tests were used to identify the most important predictors of COVID-19 prevention behavior (i.e. mask-wearing, hand-washing, reducing social interactions, physical distancing, staying at home and social bubbling), controlling for demographic and situational factors. RESULTS: Among 774 participants, most (i.e. 60C80%) reported uptake of COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Higher vertical (hierarchical) collectivism was associated with staying at home and higher horizontal (egalitarian) individualism was associated with mask-wearing and reducing social interactions. Neither Vertical Collectivism nor Horizontal Collectivism were significantly associated with any of the prevention behaviors when controlling for personality traits and confounding variables. Agreeableness was identified as a key mediator of the correlation between these cultural orientations on general uptake of COVID-19 prevention behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Cultural orientations (e.g. collectivism-individualism, hierarchism-egalitarianism) and personality traits (e.g. Agreeableness) are salient correlates of COVID-19 prevention behaviors and therefore should be accounted for in the development, design and delivery of health promotion messages aiming to increase uptake of these behaviors.","output":"Collectivism, individualism and COVID-19 prevention: a cross sectional study of personality, culture and behavior among Canadians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The complete lifting of travel restrictions to KSA takes place after 3rd of January 2021.There are fears that KSA will confront a new COVID-19 wave, especially when the most of countries that resumed the international flights are suffering now from the second surge.

This technology is primarily used in fabrication of micro/nano-scale functional surfaces, geometrical features, optical and holographic components that are cut in ferrous and difficult-to-cut tooling materials with high form accuracy and surface quality. The main objective of this study was to demonstrate the positive effect of EVC motions on cutting force reduction and stabilization. For this purpose, a series of cutting trials involving the fabrication of micro V-grooves by means of the ultraprecise single point cutting (USPC) were performed. To maintain a constant level of the cutting force, an axial multi-pass cutting strategy with constant cutting area was employed. The influence and advantages brought by EVC over the conventional no-EVC USPC scenario were initially assessed by means of the theoretical considerations of the cutting force. Following that, experimental generation of V-grooves has demonstrated that the integration of EVC kinematics with USPC motions has the ability to reduce the no-EVC cutting forces by more than 90%, to values around 0.1 N for the main axial component. The addition of EVC motions caused a minimal decrease in surface quality whose areal roughness increased from 14 nm in the no-EVC case to 16 nm in the with-EVC scenario. These observations are expected to open new opportunities in micromachining of micro/nano products, systems, sensors, functional surfaces, and lighting and holographic optics.","output":"Reduction of cutting forces by elliptical vibration in multi-pass ultraprecise single point axial cutting of V-grooves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the direction of Governor Phil Scott, the Vermont National Guard rapidly erected a 400-bed alternative healthcare facility field hospital to increase the states medical capacity early in the COVID-19 pandemic when information was limited and cases were rapidly rising across the country.

METHODS: We collected and cleaned disease-related data (eg, case counts, vaccination rates, and indicators related to disease transmission) from several data sources including the World Health Organization (WHO), Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), World Bank, and Gideon. We combined these data with machine learning and visual analytics into a tool called RED Alert to detect re-emergence for the following 4 diseases: measles, cholera, dengue, and yellow fever. We evaluated the performance of the machine learning models for re-emergence detection and reviewed the output of the tool through a number of case studies. RESULTS: Our supervised learning models were able to identify 82%-90% of the local re-emergence events, although with 18%-31% (except 46% for dengue) false positives. This is consistent with our goal of identifying all possible re-emergences while allowing some false positives. The review of the web-based tool through case studies showed that local re-emergence detection was possible and that the tool provided actionable information about potential factors contributing to the local disease re-emergence and trends in global disease re-emergence. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tool that focuses specifically on disease re-emergence and addresses the important challenges mentioned above.","output":"Improving Detection of Disease Re-emergence Using a Web-Based Tool (RED Alert): Design and Case Analysis Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While large scale mobility data has become a popular tool to monitor the mobility patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic, the impacts of non-compulsory measures in Tokyo, Japan on human mobility patterns has been under-studied. Here, we analyze the temporal changes in human mobility behavior, social contact rates, and their correlations with the transmissibility of COVID-19, using mobility data collected from more than 200K anonymized mobile phone users in Tokyo. The analysis concludes that by April 15th (1 week into state of emergency), human mobility behavior decreased by around 50%, resulting in a 70% reduction of social contacts in Tokyo, showing the effectiveness of non-compulsory measures. Furthermore, the reduction in data-driven human mobility metrics showed correlation with the decrease in estimated effective reproduction number of COVID-19 in Tokyo.

Social, political and economic inequities as well as inequities in health care are major contributing factors to these health disparities. Emergency care is an important health services resource for First Nations people. First Nations partners, academic researchers, and health authority staff are collaborating to examine emergency care visit characteristics for First Nations and non-First Nations people in the province of Alberta. METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study examining all Alberta emergency care visits from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2017 by linking administrative data. Patient demographics and emergency care visit characteristics for status First Nations persons in Alberta, and non-First Nations persons, are reported. Frequencies and percentages (%) describe patients and visits by categorical variables (e.g., Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale). Means, medians, standard deviations and interquartile ranges describe continuous variables (e.g., age). RESULTS: The dataset contains 11,686,288 emergency care visits by 3,024,491 unique persons. First Nations people make up 4% of the provincial population and 9.4% of provincial emergency visits. The population rate of emergency visits is nearly 3 times higher for First Nations persons than non-First Nations persons. First Nations women utilize emergency care more than non-First Nations women (54.2% of First Nations visits are by women compared to 50.9% of non-First Nations visits).

Several measures have been put in place to prevent its spread among the population. However, for these preventive measures to be effective, the population requires appropriate and sufficient knowledge, attitude, and practices. Thus, a survey to assess knowledge, attitude, and self-reported practice toward measures for prevention of the spread of COVID-19 was conducted among Ugandans. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted among during the lockdown in Uganda. An online structured questionnaire was used, applying a snowballing sampling approach for recruitment of participants 18 years and above and residing in Uganda. Data collection was done from 6th to 15th April 2020, during which 1,763 people participated. We analyzed all data using STATA 14.2, applying appropriate statistical tests. Results: Out of 1,763 participants, 80% were highly knowledgeable. For attitude, 72.4% reported following recommendations given by the Ministry of health to prevent the spread of COVID-19; 89.0% were worried about contracting COVID-19 and 73.3% agreed that COVID-19 can be cured and 99.3% reported good practice toward measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

METHODS: The prospective study included 2 phases; modification of the original DT and its associated problem list (PL), and evaluation of this m-DT in measuring the prevalence of psychological distress among COVID-19 patients. Egyptian adult subjects with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 at 2 University Hospitals were enrolled. Binary logistic regression tests were carried out to explore the association between the m-DT cut-off scores of 4 and the clinical variables.

But any deviation from perfection may cause an orthorhombic distortion of its tetragonal phase. At pressures above 100 GPa, the bcchcp transition exists in both metals, and the phase boundary has a domed shape and does not rise in temperature above 2 kK. This behavior of the phase boundary with the increasing temperature is caused by the softer phonon modes of the bcc structure and the smaller contribution of lattice vibrations to the free energy of the crystal compared to the hcp phase. At pressures above 2.5 TPa and T1 kK, lead can also undergo another structural transition, hcpfcc, but at >1.5 kK there must exist the more energetically preferable bccfcc transition.","output":"Ab initio calculations of the phase diagrams of tin and lead under pressures up to a few TPa."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked disorder of glycosphingolipid metabolism caused by pathogenic variants within the alpha-galactosidase A (GLA) gene, often leading to neurological manifestations including stroke.

To date, little is known about the characteristics of pulmonary auscultation in novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to explore the features and clinical significance of pulmonary auscultation in COVID-19 pneumonia using an electronic stethoscope in isolation wards. METHODS This cross-sectional, observational study was conducted among patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at Wuhan Red-Cross Hospital during the period from January 27, 2020, to February 12, 2020. Standard auscultation with an electronic stethoscope was performed and electronic recordings of breath sounds were analyzed. RESULTS Fifty-seven patients with average age of 60.6 years were enrolled. The most common symptoms were cough (73.7%) during auscultation. Most cases had bilateral lesions (96.4%) such as multiple ground-glass opacities (69.1%) and fibrous stripes (21.8%). High-quality auscultation recordings (98.8%) were obtained, and coarse breath sounds, wheezes, coarse crackles, fine crackles, and Velcro crackles were identified. Most cases had normal breath sounds in upper lungs, but the proportions of abnormal breath sounds increased in the basal fields where Velcro crackles were more commonly identified at the posterior chest. The presence of fine and coarse crackles detected 33/39 patients with ground-glass opacities (sensitivity 84.6% and specificity 12.5%) and 8/9 patients with consolidation (sensitivity 88.9% and specificity 15.2%), while the presence of Velcro crackles identified 16/39 patients with ground-glass opacities (sensitivity 41% and specificity 81.3%). CONCLUSIONS The abnormal breath sounds in COVID-19 pneumonia had some consistent distributive characteristics and to some extent correlated with the radiologic features.

While they are structurally similar to hydrocarbon acenes (e.g., pentacene) the presence of increasing numbers of N-heteroatoms introduces several different additional features of the compounds so that they can be considered for investigations beyond those suggested for acenes (i.e., organic field-effect transistors, solar cell components). Pyrazinacenes are in several ways complementary to C-H-only acenes based on the increasing stability of reduced states of the compounds with increasing numbers of fused pyrazine rings, although an acene-like electronic structure persists in the compounds so far studied. However, the introduction of multiple N atoms leads to properties that depart from C-H-only acenes. In particular, the compounds exhibit a delocalization of NH protons in extended reduced compounds and oxidation state switchability in solution and at interfaces. The presence of NH groups also allows an easy introduction of solubilizing groups at the pyrazinacene chromophore. In this Account, we will describe the preparation of extended pyrazinacenes from dipyrazino[2,3-b:2',3'-e]pyrazine (1,4,5,8,9,10-hexaazaanthracene; N6) derivatives up to 1,4,5,6,7,8,9,12,13,14,15,16,17,18-tetradecaazaheptacene (N14) and also assess structures of the relevant compounds based on X-ray crystallographic studies. Emergent properties of the molecules include highly unusual linear tautomeric processes based on a delocalization of protons (and the corresponding formation of orbitals based on multiple adjacent N lone electron pair interactions), which suggest special transport properties based on molecular protonics. Molecules such as decazapentacene (N10) exhibit multistability of oxidation state, and this is predicted to promote the redox catalytic properties of the compounds. The oxidation-state switching of on-surface processes is also described and has been investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy. The longest known pyrazinacene chromophore (N14) exhibits amphiprotism with its state of protonation being strongly coupled to its fluorescence emission properties in the near-infrared region indicating possible uses in pH-coupled bioimaging applications. The synthesis of the pyrazinacenes is flexible and allows the preparation of symmetrically or unsymmetrically substituted derivatives for the development of more complex molecules and for control of the electronic structure of the acene unit. Overall, the pyrazinacenes represent an emerging class of highly nitrogenous heteroacenes with unique properties and excellent potential for development in different applications based on their special supramolecular properties including guest binding or interactions in biological systems.","output":"The Pyrazinacenes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Eukaryotic Pathogen Genomics Database Resource (EuPathDB, http://eupathdb.org) is a collection of databases covering 170+ eukaryotic pathogens (protists & fungi), along with relevant free-living and non-pathogenic species, and select pathogen hosts.

Governments all over the world have begun to strengthen biosafety measures, and there is an urgent need for effective materials to deal with biosafety threats. Antimicrobial material is an important component of biosafety materials, and is committed to solve the thorny biosafety problem of microbial infections. Traditional antimicrobial strategies include sterilization, antimicrobial adhesion and antimicrobial composite. The traditional strategy is mainly based on sterilization, which takes effect quickly. However, the antimicrobial agents used in materials are easy to lose, thus making poor biocompatibility. Whats worse, it may lead to microbial resistance issue. Therefore, the development of new antimicrobial strategies is of great significance. The stereochemical strategy is based on the reversible recognition of the microbes on a material surface, allowing the microbes to autonomously leave the surface when they distinguish the stereochemical signals of the materials. This strategy, in line with the development trend, can effectively inhibit the adhesion, propagation and spread of various microorganisms. This review briefly summarizes the research progress of antibacterial materials in the past five years, and the current researches of stereochemical antimicrobial strategies.

In this study, we used transcriptome sequencing technology to investigate changes in the transcriptome profiles after infection with EV-A71 and CV-A16 in human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells. Using systematic bioinformatics analysis, we then searched for useful clues regarding the pathogenesis of HFMD. As a result, a total of 111 common differentially expressed genes were present in both EV-A71- and CV-A16-infected cells. A trend analysis of these 111 genes showed that 91 of them displayed the same trend in EV-A71 and CV-A16 infection, including 49 upregulated genes and 42 downregulated genes. These 91 genes were further used to conduct GO, pathway, and coexpression network analysis. It was discovered that enriched GO terms (such as histone acetylation and positive regulation of phosphorylation) and pathways (such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis and DNA replication) might be closely associated with the pathogenic mechanism of these two viruses, and key genes (such as TBCK and GPC) might be involved in the progression of HFMD. Finally, we randomly selected 10 differentially expressed genes for qRT-PCR to validate the transcriptome sequencing data.

Although disinfection and infection control protocols are well developed, they lack the ability to passively reduce the pathogenic load of high-touch surfaces. Copper and its alloys have been suggested as a surface that exhibit continuous biocidal effects. Antimicrobial studies on these surfaces are prevalent, while virucidal studies are not as well explored. The goal of this study was to first determine the virucidal activity of a copperCnickelCzinc alloy and to then examine the effect of soiling and virus preparation on virucidal activity. METHODS: A baculovirus vector was used as an easily quantifiable model of an infectious enveloped animal cell virus. Droplets containing virus were deposited on surfaces and allowed to stay wet using humidity control or were dried onto the surface. Virus was then recovered from the surface and assayed for infectivity. To examine how the composition of the droplet affected the survival of the virus, 3 different soiling conditions were tested. The first two were recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the third consisted of cell debris resulting from virus amplification. RESULTS: A copperCnickelCzinc alloy was shown to have strong virucidal effects for an enveloped virus. Copper, nickel, and zinc ions were all shown to leach from the alloy surface and are the likely cause of virucidal activity by this surface. Virucidal activity was achieved under moderate soiling but lost under high soiling generated by routine virus amplification procedures. The surface was able to repeatably inactivate dried virus droplets under moderate soiling conditions, but unable to do so for virus droplets kept wet using high humidity. CONCLUSION: Ion leaching was associated with virucidal activity in both wet and dried virus conditions. Soiling protected the virus by quenching metal ions, and not by inhibiting leaching.

This is because the majority are racialized women from the Global South, the gendered nature of caregiving work has historically been undervalued, and their working and living spheres are intertwined which makes application of labor laws and surveillance almost impossible. Their invisible position in the fabric of Canadian society along with their precarious employment and immigration status place their mental health at jeopardy. There is a paucity of research about psychological support for this population. OBJECTIVE: Our pilot study Women EmpowermentCaregiver Acceptance and Resilience E-Learning (WE2CARE) aimed to assess the efficacy of a 6-week online delivery of a psychological intervention based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) in reducing psychological distress and promoting resiliency among live-in care givers in the Greater Toronto Area. METHODS: A pilot randomized wait list controlled design was used. Participants were recruited by two community peer champions working with community health organizations serving migrant live-in caregivers. A total of 36 participants were recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention and wait list control groups; 7 dropped out of the study due to competing life priorities. Standardized self-reported surveys were administered online pre-, post-, and 6-week postintervention to assess mental distress (DASS-21), psychological flexibility (AAQ-2), mindfulness (CAMS-R), and Multi-System Model of Resilience (MSMR-I). Independent and dependent t tests were used to compare study outcomes at pre, post, and 6-week follow-up across and within both arms of the study. Linear mixed effects models were created for each outcome of interest from baseline to postintervention among intervention and control participants. Self-reported impact of the WE2CARE intervention was examined using independent t tests across the study arms. RESULTS: Average age of participants was 38 years. Many were born in the Philippines (23/29, 79%). The data on the impact of the psychological intervention showed a lower level of depression, anxiety, and stress among the intervention group compared with the control. However, the differences were not significant due to small sample size and COVID-19 crisis (6.94 vs 9.50, P=.54; 6.94 vs 10.83, P=.20; 7.76 vs 10.33, P=.44, respectively). There was a significant improvement in mindful qualities and external resilience, particularly in life satisfaction and accessible support among the intervention group (37.18 vs 32.92, t(22)=2.35, P=.03; 20.29 vs 16.5, t(21)=2.98, P=.007; 8.47 vs 6.75, t(14)=2.41, P=.03; 7.59 vs 5.33, t(16)=.008, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: WE2CARE is among the first studies exploring the efficacy of online delivery of ACT in addressing mental health challenges among live-in caregivers. While there are increased web-based ACT interventions, few use group videoconferencing to promote peer connection and mutual support. WE2CARE showed promising results in reducing psychological distress and promoting mindfulness and resiliency.

Methods Retrospective review of electronic records and drug charts of patients diagnosed with malaria from Jan 2019- March 2021. Results 109 cases of malaria were identified representing travellers from 11 Sub-Saharan African countries: Nigeria(38%), Sierra Leone(33%), Ivory Coast(10%). The age range varied from 4 to 76 years with a mean of 44, 66% of the cohort was male. 22 cases occurred during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The commonest symptoms were Fever (97%), Headache (92%) and malaise (72%). P. falciparum was present in 99% cases. A travel history was taken in 94% of cases. Malaria was considered by the first clinician in 82% of cases with the second highest differential being a viral illness. In 6 cases, it took 4 to 11 medical reviews before malaria was considered. 29 patients met the UK criteria for severe malaria. Door to antimalarial time varied from 1 to 128 hours, with a median of 7.4 hours. 46% of the cohort received intravenous Artesunate as their first antimalarial. Extreme delays occurred were clinicians did not consider malaria, patients had negative films or a patient did not declare a travel history when asked. 1 patient died of cerebral malaria with a door to needle time of 2hr 3min. Where a reason for delay is documented, drug availability represented the highest cause with mean delay from prescribing antimalarial to giving antimalarial of 2.7 hours. There was no difference in door to antimalarial administration during the COVID-19 Pandemic, but patients did have a delay in presentation to hospital from onset of symptoms, mean 6.2 days pre-pandemic, 10.5 days during pandemic, this was not statistically significant (P= 0.198). 3 patients presenting during the Pandemic had covid-19 swabs prior to admission and 10 had attended primary care services.

Viral suppression in paediatric patients at the feeder clinics of a rural South African hospital was anecdotally far below the aim of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) of 90%. METHODS: A quality improvement approach was used to conduct a baseline assessment of HIV viral suppression in paediatric patients and other process measures, implement a clinical mentorship intervention and evaluate its effectiveness. RESULTS: An initial audit of 235 clinical folders of paediatric patients with HIV revealed a viral suppression of 55.3%. Other poor measures included prescription accuracy, viral loads performed within schedule and response to successive high viral loads. A clinical mentorship intervention using dedicated doctor outreach was implemented and the audit repeated after 12 months (263 folders). Viral suppression improved to 67.4%, as did most other process measures. CONCLUSION: The quality improvement approach regarding the aim to significantly improve viral suppression in paediatric patients through the implementation of clinical mentorship was successful.","output":"Not yet 90-90-90: A quality improvement approach to human immunodeficiency virus viral suppression in paediatric patients in the rural Eastern Cape, South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Breast cancer is the leading cause of female mortality in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Early detection of breast cancer, either through screening or early diagnosis initiatives, led by community health workers (CHWs) has been proposed as a potential way to address the unjustly high mortality rates. We therefore document: (1) where and how CHWs are currently deployed in this role; (2) how CHWs are trained, including the content, duration and outcomes of training; and (3) the evidence on costs associated with deploying CHWs in breast cancer early detection. METHODS We conducted a systematic scoping review and searched eight major databases, as well as the grey literature. We included original studies focusing on the role of CHWs to assist in breast cancer early detection in a country defined as a LMIC according to the World Bank. FINDINGS 16 eligible studies were identified. Several roles were identified for CHWs including awareness raising and community education (n=13); history taking (n=7); performing clinical breast examination (n=9); making onward referrals (n=7); and assisting in patient navigation and follow-up (n=4). Details surrounding training programmes were poorly reported and no studies provided a formal cost analysis. CONCLUSIONS Despite the relative paucity of studies addressing the role of CHWs in breast cancer early detection, as well as the heterogeneity of existing studies, evidence suggests that CHWs can play a number of important roles in breast cancer early detection initiatives in LMICs. However, if they are to realise their full potential, they must be appropriately supported within the wider health system.","output":"Community health workers and early detection of breast cancer in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic scoping review of the literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Quantitative evaluation of renal cortical echogenicity (RCE) has been tried and developed in human and veterinary medicine. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to propose a method for evaluating RCE quantitatively and intuitively, and to determine associations between ultrasonographic renal structural distinction and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in canine chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: Data were collected on 63 dogs, including 27 with normal kidney function and 36 CKD patients. Symmetric dimethylarginine and creatinine concentrations were measured for calculating eGFR. RCE was evaluated as 3 grades on ultrasonography images according to the distinction between the renal cortex and outer medulla. The RCE grade of each kidney was measured. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in eGFR between the group normal and CKD (p < 0.001). As mean of RCE grades (the mean values of each right and left kidney's RCE grade) increases, the proportion of group CKD among the patients in each grade increases (p < 0.001). Also, severity of RCE (classified as \\"high\\" if any right or left kidney evaluated as RCE grade 3, \\"low\\" otherwise) and eGFR is good indicator for predicting group CKD (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The degree of distinction between the renal cortex and the outer medulla is closely related to renal function including eGFR and the RCE grade defined in this study can be used as a method of objectively evaluating RCE.","output":"Can distinction between the renal cortex and outer medulla on ultrasonography predict estimated glomerular filtration rate in canine chronic kidney diseases?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: This study aimed to determine whether COVID-19 free surgical pathways were associated with lower postoperative pulmonary complication rates compared to hospitals with no defined pathway. Method: This international multi-centre cohort study included patients undergoing elective surgery for 10 solid cancer types, without preoperative suspicion of SARS-CoV-2. Participating hospitals included patients fromlocal emergence of SARS-CoV-2 until 19 April 2020. At the time of surgery, hospitals were defined as having a COVID-19 free surgical pathway (complete segregation of the operating theatre, critical care, and inpatient ward areas) or no defined pathway (incomplete or no segregation, areas shared with COVID-19 patients). The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative pulmonary complications. Results: Of 9171 patients from 447 hospitals in 55 countries, 2481 were operated in COVID-19 free surgical pathways. After adjustment, pulmonary complication rates were lower with COVID-19 free surgical pathways (2.2% versus 4.9%, OR: 0.62 [0.44-0.86]). This was consistent in sensitivity analyses and a propensity-score matched model. The postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection rate was also lower in COVID-19 free surgical pathways (2.1% versus 3.6%;OR 0.53 [0.36-0.76]). Conclusions: Within available resources, dedicated COVID-19 free surgical pathways should be established to provide safe elective cancer surgery during current and before future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.","output":"1015 Elective Cancer Surgery In COVID-19 Free Surgical Pathways During The SARS-Cov-2 Pandemic: An International, Multi-Centre, Comparative Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread to all the continents posing a serious threat to global health.

The identification of characteristics that place people at high risk for occupational stress is the basis of managing and intervening in this condition. In this study, we aimed to identify and validate the risk features for occupational stress among medical workers using a risk model and nomogram. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1988 eligible participants from Henan Province in China. Occupational stress and worker-occupation fit were measured with the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and Worker-Occupation Fit Inventory (WOFI). The identification of risk features was achieved through constructing multiple logistic regression model, and the risk features were used to develop the risk model and nomogram. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration plots were generated to assess the effectiveness and calibration of the risk model. RESULTS: Among 1988 participants in our study, there were 42.5% (845/1988) medical workers experienced occupational stress. The risk features for occupational stress included poor work-occupation fit (WOF score < 25, expected risk: 77.3%), nurse population (expected risk: 63.1%), male sex (expected risk: 67.2%), work experience duration of 11C19 years (expected risk: 54.5%), experience of a traumatic event (expected risk: 65.3%) and the lack of a regular exercise habit (expected risk: 60.2%). For medical workers who have these risk features, the expected risk probability of occupational stress would be 90.2%. CONCLUSION: The current data can be used to identify medical workers at risk of developing occupational stress. Identifying risk features for occupational stress and the work-occupation fit can support hierarchical stress management in hospitals.

It involves the installment of either single ubiquitin (Ub) moieties or one of eight different polyUb linkage types, each giving a distinct cellular outcome. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) reverse Ub signaling by disassembly of one or multiple poly-Ub chain types and their malfunction is often associated with human disease. The Ub system displays significant crosstalk with structurally homologous ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls), including SUMO, Nedd8, and ISG15. This can be seen with the existence of heterogeneous chains made from UbCUbl mixtures as well as the proteolytic cross reactivity displayed by several DUBs toward other Ubl systems. In addition, numerous pathogens have been found to encode Ub(l)-ligases and deconjugating enzymes in order to facilitate infection and fight the host immune response. Studying the activity of DUBs and Ubl-specific proteases, both human as well as pathogen-derived, gives fundamental insights into their physiological roles. Activity-based probes (ABPs) have proven to be valuable tools to achieve this, as they report on enzyme activities by making a (often irreversible) covalent complex, rather than on their relative abundance. In this chapter, we explain the potential of ABPs to assess substrate preferences, structural features, and activity of Ub and Ubl deconjugating enzymes. We further demonstrate the practical use of ABPs to (1) characterize the activity of viral proteases toward Ub and Ubls and (2) to gain more insight in the structural determinants of substrate preference of DUBs.","output":"Profiling DUBs and Ubl-specific proteases with activity-based probes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has had devastating effects on global health and worldwide economy. Despite an initial reluctance to perform autopsies due to concerns for aerosolization of viral particles, a large number of autopsy studies published since May 2020 have shed light on the pathophysiology of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review summarizes the histopathologic findings and clinicopathologic correlations from autopsies and biopsies performed in patients with COVID-19. PubMed and Medline (EBSCO and Ovid) were queried from June 4, 2020 to September 30, 2020 and histopathologic data from autopsy and biopsy studies were collected based on 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 58 studies reporting 662 patients were included. Demographic data, comorbidities at presentation, histopathologic findings, and virus detection strategies by organ system were collected. Diffuse alveolar damage, thromboembolism, and nonspecific shock injury in multiple organs were the main findings in this review. The pathologic findings emerging from autopsy and biopsy studies reviewed herein suggest that in addition to a direct viral effect in some organs, a unifying pathogenic mechanism for COVID-19 is ARDS with its known and characteristic inflammatory response, cytokine release, fever, inflammation, and generalized endothelial disturbance. This study supports the notion that autopsy studies are of utmost importance to our understanding of disease features and treatment effect to increase our knowledge of COVID-19 pathophysiology and contribute to more effective treatment strategies.","output":"Histopathological findings and clinicopathologic correlation in COVID-19: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is an important endemic, systemic disease in Latin America caused by Paracoccidioides spp. This mycosis has been associated with high morbidity and sequels, and its clinical manifestations depend on the virulence of the infecting strain, the degree and type of immune response, infected tissues, and intrinsic characteristics of the host. The T helper(Th)1 and Th17/Th22 cells are related to resistance and control of infection, and a Th2/Th9 response is associated with disease susceptibility. In this study, we focused on interleukin(IL)-12p35 (IL12A), IL-18 (IL18), and IFN- receptor 1 (IFNGR1) genetic polymorphisms because their respective roles have been described in human PCM. Real-time PCR was employed to analyze IL12A-504 G/T (rs2243115), IL18-607 C/A (rs1946518), and IFNGR1-611 A/G (rs1327474) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). One hundred forty-nine patients with the acute form (AF), multifocal chronic (MC), or unifocal chronic (UC) forms of PCM and 110 non-PCM individuals as a control group were included. In the unconditional logistic regression analysis adjusted by ethnicity and sex, we observed a high risk of the IL18-607 A-allele for both AF [p = 0.015; OR = 3.10 (95% CI: 1.24C7.77)] and MC groups [p = 0.023; OR = 2.61 (95% CI: 1.14C5.96)] when compared with UC. The IL18-607 A-allele associated risk for the AF and MC groups as well as the protective role of the C-allele in UC are possibly linked to higher levels of IL-18 at different periods of the course of the disease. Therefore, a novel role of IL18-607 C/A SNP is shown in the present study, highlighting its importance in the outcome of PCM.","output":"Polymorphism in the Promoter Region of the IL18 Gene and the Association With Severity on Paracoccidioidomycosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Existing manufacturing systems are isolated from the outside world to protect their sites and systems. However, following the trend of the 4th Industrial Revolution, manufacturing systems have also increased the connectivity of various domains and the convergence of numerous technologies. These systems are referred to as smart manufacturing systems. However, this trend has increased the challenge of network anomaly detection methods, which are a major approach to network security in smart manufacturing. Existing methods define normality under the premise that network components are static, and network operation is periodic compared to the information technology environment. Therefore, comprehensive and volatile network environments require significant time, cost, and labor to define normality. Consequently, artificial intelligence (AI)-based anomaly detection studies have been actively conducted to solve this problem. However, such studies require manual analysis based on expert knowledge of each site during the preprocessing stage to extract the learning features from the collected network data. To solve the above problems, this study proposes a protocol reverse engineering method corresponding to the preprocessing stage of exiting AI studies. Through this method, existing AI-based anomaly detection studies can directly use the collected network data to learn normality without expert knowledge of the site. Furthermore, non-polling or reporting network operating environments that are rarely studied in the manufacturing security domain are targeted. Finally, we propose an anomaly detection method that uses an external signature, time information, the pattern of time intervals, and classified messages.

Action self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, risk perception, intention, planning and action control regarding facemask wearing and hand washing were assessed at baseline (Time 1), and behaviors were assessed a week later (Time 2). Data were collected from 30 January to 16 February 2020. Two structural equation models were specified to test the theory-driven determinants of the facemask wearing and hand washing respectively. The results showed that action self-efficacy predicted intentions to wear facemasks and wash hands. Intention and action control predicted both behaviors at Time 2. Associations between planning and behaviors were mixed. Mediation analyses revealed that action control significantly mediated the relationship between intention and both behaviors (facemask wearing: 90% CI [0.01, 0.12]; hand washing: 95% CI [0.01, 0.21]). Planning did not mediate the relationship between intention and the two behaviors.

The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between medical masks and cloth masks. SETTING: 14 secondary-level/tertiary-level hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam. PARTICIPANTS: 1607 hospital HCWs aged 18 years working full-time in selected high-risk wards. INTERVENTION: Hospital wards were randomised to: medical masks, cloth masks or a control group (usual practice, which included mask wearing). Participants used the mask on every shift for 4 consecutive weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinical respiratory illness (CRI), influenza-like illness (ILI) and laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection. RESULTS: The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical mask arm. Cloth masks also had significantly higher rates of ILI compared with the control arm. An analysis by mask use showed ILI (RR=6.64, 95% CI 1.45 to 28.65) and laboratory-confirmed virus (RR=1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.94) were significantly higher in the cloth masks group compared with the medical masks group. Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally.

AIM: To examine the change in use of 2WW referrals in England over 10 years (2009/2010 to 2018/2019) and the practice and population factors associated with cancer detection. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective cross-sectional study of English general practices and their 2WW referral and Cancer Waiting Times database detection data (all cancers other than non-melanoma skin cancers) from 2009/2010 to 2018/2019. METHOD: A retrospective study conducted using descriptive statistics of changes over 10 years in 2WW referral data. Yearly linear regression models were used to determine the association between cancer detection rates and quintiles of practice and population characteristics. Predicted cancer detection rates were calculated, as well as the difference between lowest to highest quintiles. RESULTS: Over the 10 years studied there were 14.89 million 2WW referrals (2.24 million in 2018/2019), and 2.68 million new cancer diagnoses, of which 1.26 million were detected following 2WW. The detection rate increased from 41% to 52% over the time period. In 2018/2019 an additional 66 172 cancers were detected via 2WW compared with 2009/2010. Higher cancer detection via 2WW referrals was associated with larger practices and those with younger GPs.

Standard diagnostic mechanisms for ASD, which involve lengthy parent questionnaires and clinical observation, often result in long waiting times for results. Recent advances in computer vision and mobile technology hold potential for speeding up the diagnostic process by enabling computational analysis of behavioral and social impairments from home videos. Such techniques can improve objectivity and contribute quantitatively to the diagnostic process. OBJECTIVE: In this work, we evaluate whether home videos collected from a game-based mobile app can be used to provide diagnostic insights into ASD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study attempting to identify potential social indicators of ASD from mobile phone videos without the use of eye-tracking hardware, manual annotations, and structured scenarios or clinical environments. METHODS: Here, we used a mobile health app to collect over 11 hours of video footage depicting 95 children engaged in gameplay in a natural home environment. We used automated data set annotations to analyze two social indicators that have previously been shown to differ between children with ASD and their neurotypical (NT) peers: (1) gaze fixation patterns, which represent regions of an individuals visual focus and (2) visual scanning methods, which refer to the ways in which individuals scan their surrounding environment. We compared the gaze fixation and visual scanning methods used by children during a 90-second gameplay video to identify statistically significant differences between the 2 cohorts; we then trained a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to determine if gaze indicators could be predictive of ASD. RESULTS: Our results show that gaze fixation patterns differ between the 2 cohorts; specifically, we could identify 1 statistically significant region of fixation (P<.001). In addition, we also demonstrate that there are unique visual scanning patterns that exist for individuals with ASD when compared to NT children (P<.001). A deep learning model trained on coarse gaze fixation annotations demonstrates mild predictive power in identifying ASD. CONCLUSIONS: Ultimately, our study demonstrates that heterogeneous video data sets collected from mobile devices hold potential for quantifying visual patterns and providing insights into ASD. We show the importance of automated labeling techniques in generating large-scale data sets while simultaneously preserving the privacy of participants, and we demonstrate that specific social engagement indicators associated with ASD can be identified and characterized using such data.","output":"Identification of Social Engagement Indicators Associated With Autism Spectrum Disorder Using a Game-Based Mobile App: Comparative Study of Gaze Fixation and Visual Scanning Methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Understanding the spectrum of disease severity and death are critical for identifying unrecognized risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). The purpose of this study was to describe the baseline characteristics, clinical presentation, and outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in a major hotspot in the U.S. Southeast. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective chart review included adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19, defined by laboratory-detected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, in Southwest Georgia. The primary outcome was mortality, which was assessed through discharge or June 14, 2020, whichever occurred first. Secondary outcomes included comorbidities, laboratory and radiographic findings, as well as clinical course. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients were included with a median age of 61 years (IQR 50C72). The majority were African American (73%) and female (56%). Comorbidities on admission were present in 88% of patients; most prevalent were hypertension (76%), diabetes mellitus (55%), and chronic pulmonary disease (27%). Median Charlson comorbidity index was 4 (IQR 2C6) and BMI was 32.8 kg/m(2) (IQR 26.2C39.5). On presentation, patients most often complained of dyspnea (69%), fever (63%), and cough (53%), with a median SOFA score of 2 (IQR 2C4). Most patients were admitted to the general ward (71%), of which 17% were subsequently transferred to ICU. During hospitalization, 27% were mechanically ventilated for a median 11 days (IQR 5C13.5), 18% developed ARDS, and 43% developed AKI. Median length of stay was 9.5 days (IQR 3.75C14).

However, when exploring intra-city patterns, we find distinctive intra-city spatial dynamics featuring strong suburbanisation of couch surfing in state capital cities, contrasting with shifts in severe crowding numbers toward middle and inner regions of most state capitals. We argue that these dynamics reflect the retreat of affordable rental housing supply to the outer suburban fringe, and the coping strategies that couch surfers and those aspiring to live in the inner cities are compelled to follow in response to the changing spatial configuration of affordable housing.","output":"The Spatial Dynamics of Homelessness in Australia: Urbanisation, Intra-City Dynamics and Affordable Housing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Robotic-assisted abdominal wall repair (RAWR) has seen an exponential adoption over the last 5 years.

Setting 81 countries, between March 24 and April 10, 2020. Participants 714 maternal and newborn healthcare providers. Main outcome measures Preparedness for and response to COVID-19, experiences of health workers providing care to women and newborns, and adaptations to 17 outpatient and inpatient care processes during the pandemic. Results Only one third of respondents received training on COVID-19 from their health facility and nearly all searched for information themselves. Half of respondents in LMICs received updated guidelines for care provision compared with 82% in HICs. Overall, only 47% of participants in LMICs, and 69% in HICs felt mostly or completely knowledgeable in how to care for COVID-19 maternity patients. Facility-level responses to COVID-19 (signage, screening, testing, and isolation rooms) were more common in HICs than LMICs. Globally, 90% of respondents reported somewhat or substantially higher levels of stress. There was a widespread perception of reduced use of routine maternity care services, and of modification in care processes, some of which were not evidence-based.

The authors sought to determine the impact of COVID-19 on cancer treatment, anxiety, and financial distress among low-income patients with gynecologic cancer during the peak of the NYC pandemic. METHODS: Medicaid-insured women who were receiving gynecologic oncology care at 2 affiliated centers were contacted by telephone interviews between March 15 and April 15, 2020. Demographics and clinical characteristics were obtained through self-report and retrospective chart review. Financial toxicity, anxiety, and cancer worry were assessed using modified, validated surveys. RESULTS: In total, 100 patients completed the telephone interview. The median age was 60 years (range, 19-86 years), and 71% had an annual income <$40,000. A change in employment status and early stage cancer (stage I and II) were associated with an increase in financial distress (P < .001 and P = .008, respectively). Early stage cancer and telehealth participation were significantly associated with increased worry about future finances (P = .017 and P = .04, respectively). Lower annual income (<$40,000) was associated with increased cancer worry and anxiety compared with higher annual income (>$40,000; P = .036 and P = .017, respectively). When controlling for telehealth participation, income, primary language, and residence in a high COVID-19 prevalence area, a delay in medical care resulted in a 4-fold increased rate of anxiety (P = .023, 95% CI, 1.278-14.50). Race was not significantly associated with increased financial distress, cancer worry, or anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Low socioeconomic status was the most common risk factor for increased financial distress, cancer worry, and anxiety. Interventions aimed at improving access to timely oncology care should be implemented during this ongoing pandemic.","output":"Financial toxicity, mental health, and gynecologic cancer treatment: The effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic among low-income women in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The gastrointestinal lumen is a rich source of eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses which, together with bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms comprise the gut microbiota.

Moreover, no research had reported the health consequences in health care workers (HCWs) with COVID-19 after discharge. We aimed to investigate the health consequences in HCWs with severe COVID-19 after discharge from hospital in Hubei Province, China. METHODS: We conducted an ambidirectional cohort study in Rehabilitation Care Project for Medical Staff Infected with COVID-19 in China. The participants were asked to complete three physical examinations (including the tests of functional fitness, antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and immunological indicators) at 153.4 (143.3, 164.8), 244.3 (232.4, 259.1), and 329.4 (319.4, 339.3) days after discharge, respectively. Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, t test, one-way ANOVA, (2), and Fishers exact test were used to assess the variance between two or more groups where appropriate. RESULTS: Of 333 HCWs with severe COVID-19, the HCWs median age was 36.0 (31.0, 43.0) years, 257 (77%) were female, and 191 (57%) were nurses. Our research found that 70.4% (114/162), 48.9% (67/137), and 29.6% (37/125) of the HCWs with severe COVID-19 were considered to have not recovered their functional fitness in the first, second, and third functional fitness tests, respectively. The HCWs showed improvement in muscle strength, flexibility, and agility/dynamic balance after discharge in follow-up visits. The seropositivity of IgM (17.0% vs. 6.6%) and median titres of IgM (3.0 vs. 1.4) and IgG (60.3 vs. 45.3) in the third physical examination was higher than that in the first physical examination. In the third physical examination, there still were 42.1% and 45.9% of the HCWs had elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-, and 11.9% and 6.3% of the HCWs had decreased relative numbers of CD3(+) T cells and CD4(+) T cells. CONCLUSION: The HCWs with severe COVID-19 showed improvement in functional fitness within 1 year after discharge, active intervention should be applied to help their recovery if necessary. It is of vital significance to continue monitoring the functional fitness, antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and immunological indicators after 1 year of discharge from hospital in HCWs with severe COVID-19.

Since both Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and COVID-19 case definitions overlap, we re-investigated the ILI cases using PCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in 739 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from November 2019 to March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in 37 samples (5%) collected mostly during February 2020. It was followed by confirmation of evolutionary and spatial relationships using next generation sequencing (NGS). We observed that the overall incidence of ILI cases during 2019C2020 influenza season was considerably higher than previous years and was gradually replaced with SARS-CoV-2, which indicated a silent transmission among ambulatory patients. Sequencing of representative isolates confirmed independent introductions and silent transmission earlier than previously thought. Evolutionary and spatial analyses revealed clustering in the GH clade, characterized by three amino acid substitutions in spike gene (D614G), RdRp (P323L) and NS3 (Q57H). P323L causes conformational change near nsp8 binding site that might affect virus replication and transcription. In conclusion, assessment of the community transmission among patients with mild COVID-19 illness, particularly those without epidemiological link for acquiring the virus, is of utmost importance to guide policy makers to optimize public health interventions. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in ILI cases shows the importance of ILI surveillance systems and warrants its further strengthening to mitigate the ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

With specific reference to Kenya, the paper exposed the state of the country's unpreparedness in terms of instructional technologies, a situation that had contributed to an almost total shutdown of institutions following the outbreak. It was notable that whereas Kenya-like most African countries-had not borne the brunt of COVID-19 infections in comparison to other countries outside the continent, its education sector was adversely affected. This followed the social distancing requirement that limited in-person gatherings-the low rate of infections notwithstanding-implying that its learning institutions, most of which operated on in-person mode, had to close. Since most universities in Africa had hitherto operated on this mode, the shift to online learning was not easy. Save for a few universities that had digital infrastructure, the rest encountered difficulties in moving to remote learning. Many had to quickly assemble digital curricula, the quality of which could not be guaranteed. Even if an institution managed to do so, not all students could be brought on board. Digital exclusion became more pronounced than ever before, with learners who were economically, technologically, and geographically disadvantaged missing out. Inequalities in education were laid bare and exacerbated. All this notwithstanding, Africa learnt lessons. The whole experience prompted various stakeholders-university management, faculty, and government-to rethink their modes of education delivery, with quality and access in mind.

METHODS: i) A focus group with 13 Aboriginal Immunisation Healthcare Workers; and ii) a cross-sectional survey of Aboriginal people aged &#8805;18 years at the 2017 New South Wales Koori Knockout (29 September-2 October). RESULTS: The focus group nominated poor identification of Aboriginality in general practice.

More than half (52%) believed the vaccine could cause influenza, 40% reported there were better ways than vaccination for avoiding infection and 30% said they would not have the vaccine if it was offered to them. Regarding health service access, few reported experiencing difficulty (17%), feeling uncomfortable (15%) or being discriminated against (8%), but 53% reported not receiving a reminder from a health professional. CONCLUSIONS: Misconceptions about influenza disease and vaccine among Aboriginal people and inadequate identification of Aboriginality in general practice appear to be the greatest barriers to vaccination, rather than health service access in general.

RECENT FINDINGS: Most of the research on the topic suggests that for the moment our ability to estimate whether SARS-CoV-2 is a direct causative agent in acute kidney injury (AKI) or whether it has a cytokine storm effect is limited. During our prospective assessment of 333 patients with COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) it was found that frequency of AKI of 9.6% (32 cases). Despite previous data suggestive of the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in urine, we were unable to identify any traces of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in our group. Both COVID-19 severity (odds ratio, OR = 23.09, confidence interval, CI 7.89C67.57, P < 0.001) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) history (OR = 7.17, CI 2.09C24.47, P = 0.002) were associated with the AKI rate. SUMMARY: AKI is a relatively frequent condition for patients with COVID-19 and is normally correlated with the severity of the disease and the patient's history of CKD. The available data fail to address whether SARS-CoV-2 mRNA is present in urine, whereas our prospective trial data suggest that mRNA is undetectable in urine irrespective of the severity of the disease.","output":"Acute kidney injury in COVID-19: are kidneys the target or just collateral damage?

Disconnect and lack of alignment seem to be self-perpetuating, as judges do not perceive the state of independence as problematic. Indications are that even a disconnect does not reduce the use of the civil courts, but that it leads citizens to avoid administrative law procedures.

Where the other state powers see an increasing influence of the judiciary, the judiciary sees its own independence endangered. These perspectives clash.

Inducing host translation shutoff is a strategy used by many viruses to optimize their replication and spread. Here, we demonstrate that PRRSV infection causes host translation suppression, which is strongly dependent on viral replication. By screening PRRSV-encoded nonstructural proteins (nsps), we found that nsp2 participates in the induction of host translation shutoff and that its transmembrane (TM) domain is required for this process. nsp2-induced translation suppression is independent of protein degradation pathways and the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2). However, the overexpression of nsp2 or its TM domain significantly attenuated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, an alternative pathway for modulating host gene expression. PRRSV infection also attenuated the mTOR signaling pathway, and PRRSV-induced host translation shutoff could be partly reversed when the attenuated mTOR phosphorylation was reactivated by an activator of the mTOR pathway. PRRSV infection still negatively regulated the host translation when the effects of eIF2 phosphorylation were completely reversed. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PRRSV infection induces host translation shutoff and that nsp2 is associated with this process. Both eIF2 phosphorylation and the attenuation of the mTOR signaling pathway contribute to PRRSV-induced host translation arrest.IMPORTANCE Viruses are obligate parasites, and the production of progeny viruses relies strictly on the host translation machinery. Therefore, the efficient modulation of host mRNA translation benefits viral replication, spread, and evolution. In this study, we provide evidence that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection induces host translation shutoff and that the viral nonstructural protein nsp2 is associated with this process. Many viruses induce host translation shutoff by phosphorylating eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2). However, PRRSV nsp2 does not induce eIF2 phosphorylation but attenuates the mTOR signaling pathway, another pathway regulating the host cell translational machinery. We also found that PRRSV-induced host translation shutoff was partly reversed by eliminating the effects of eIF2 phosphorylation or reactivating the mTOR pathway, indicating that PRRSV infection induces both eIF2 phosphorylation-dependent and -independent host translation shutoff.","output":"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus Infection Induces both eIF2 Phosphorylation-Dependent and -Independent Host Translation Shutoff."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a recently emerged pneumonia disease with threatening complications that can be avoided by early diagnosis.

The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)'s respirator filtration efficiency (FE) test has been used to confirm that decontamination procedures maintain minimum FE above 95% for N95s and similar respirators. However, it was hypothesized that the limited range of test particle sizes may not include the most penetrating particle size (MPPS) for all respirators, especially after decontamination by moist heat incubation (MHI). Materials and Methods: A custom-designed apparatus was used to measure size-specific FE for respirators across particle size bins between aerodynamic diameter of 0.07 and 1.97 m using an electrical low-pressure impactor. FEs were measured for two N95 respirator models before and after 10 cycles of MHI. In addition, pressure drop through the respirator materials and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of respirator layers were obtained before and after MHI. Results: For Kimtech? brand N95 respirators, FE was not reduced at any size after MHI. For Safe Life brand N95s, FE was below 95% before MHI and decreased significantly after MHI. The MPPS for this respirator was outside the range defined in NIOSH test protocol, and increased after MHI. There was no appreciable change to the pressure drop through the two respirator models after MHI, nor was any deterioration in fiber integrity visible in SEM images. Conclusions: Based on the results of the present study and other studies in the literature, MHI can be used to decontaminate respirators without significant decrease in FE. However, potential effects of MHI on FE need to be assessed for each respirator model.

Nurses' impact on patient care can be discerned through assessment and documentation strategies, including structured and unstructured narratives, clinical pathways, flowsheets, and problem-based approaches. To date, there are no published reports regarding nursing assessment and documentation during the COVID-19 pandemic using an assessment framework to capture clinical decision making, nursing diagnoses, and key social determinant of health (SDoH) data. Hence, the purpose of this investigation was to conduct an exploratory nursing documentation audit of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 during the first surge to identify types and frequency of nurse-sensitive indicators, including SDoH. METHOD This pilot study utilized a retrospective chart review design at a single academic medical center, utilizing Gordon's Eleven Functional Health Patterns (FHP) framework to extract clinical, social, and nursing assessment data for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Descriptive statistics were computed for continuous variables and counts/percentages for categorical variables. FINDINGS Data from 94 patient records were analyzed. Most patients were male (59.6%), with a mean age of 58 years. Nearly 15% of patients were Black and 12.8% were Hispanic, most residing in four geographic areas. Nine of the 11 FHPs were reflected in nurse-sensitive indicators documented in the electronic health record. SDoH data were inconsistently documented, including race, education, history of neglect/abuse, and occupation. CONCLUSION The FHP framework captured many nurse-sensitive indicators during the first COVID-19 surge, although screening for and documenting SDoH data were limited. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE Findings can influence the development of nursing assessment and documentation during crisis care delivery that are inclusive of distinct sociodemographic factors, in addition to clinical factors, to provide comprehensive, culturally sensitive care. Such documentation will enhance the use of nursing knowledge guided by a nursing framework to make visible the essential contributions of nurses to healthcare delivery.","output":"Nurse-sensitive indicators during COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When the COVID-19 pandemic made it impossible to do in-person, on campus testing, we were forced to create a new system to screen International Teaching Assistants (ITA) for Temple university We used this opportunity to address many of the concerns and problems that we had identified with the previous test, and created a new test that could be administered virtually The new test (the TU ITA Test) makes it possible to test potential ITAs at any time, allowing departments to make instructor placement decisions far in advance The TU ITA Test also seems to better assess ITAs interactional competence than the previous test, suggesting it might be a more valid ITA screening measure","output":"Temple Universitys ITA Placement Test in Times of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 health crisis, the Spanish Government launched a series of urgent measures to protect the population from its economic effects.

METHODS We conducted an open-label, cluster-randomized trial involving persons from 600 villages in rural China. The participants had a history of stroke or were 60 years of age or older and had high blood pressure. The villages were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention group, in which the participants used a salt substitute (75% sodium chloride and 25% potassium chloride by mass), or to the control group, in which the participants continued to use regular salt (100% sodium chloride). The primary outcome was stroke, the secondary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events and death from any cause, and the safety outcome was clinical hyperkalemia. RESULTS A total of 20,995 persons were enrolled in the trial. The mean age of the participants was 65.4 years, and 49.5% were female, 72.6% had a history of stroke, and 88.4% a history of hypertension. The mean duration of follow-up was 4.74 years. The rate of stroke was lower with the salt substitute than with regular salt (29.14 events vs. 33.65 events per 1000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 to 0.96; P = 0.006), as were the rates of major cardiovascular events (49.09 events vs. 56.29 events per 1000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.94; P<0.001) and death (39.28 events vs. 44.61 events per 1000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.95; P<0.001). The rate of serious adverse events attributed to hyperkalemia was not significantly higher with the salt substitute than with regular salt (3.35 events vs. 3.30 events per 1000 person-years; rate ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.37; P = 0.76).

Although licensed vaccines are generally extremely safe, both experimental and licensed vaccines are sometimes associated with rare serious adverse events. Vaccine-enhanced disease (VED) is a type of adverse event in which disease severity is increased when a person who has received the vaccine is later infected with the relevant pathogen. VED can occur during research with experimental vaccines and/or after vaccine licensure, sometimes months or years after a person receives a vaccine. Both research ethics and public health policy should therefore address the potential for disease enhancement. Significant VED has occurred in humans with vaccines for four pathogens: measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Staphylococcus aureus, and dengue virus; it has also occurred in veterinary research and in animal studies of human coronavirus vaccines. Some of the immunological mechanisms involved are now well-described, but VED overall remains difficult to predict with certainty, including during public health implementation of novel vaccines. This paper summarises the four known cases in humans and explores key ethical implications. Although rare, VED has important ethical implications because it can cause serious harm, including death, and such harms can undermine vaccine confidence more generally C leading to larger public health problems. The possibility of VED remains an important challenge for current and future vaccine development and deployment. We conclude this paper by summarising approaches to the reduction of risks and uncertainties related to VED, and the promotion of public trust in vaccines.","output":"Vaccine-enhanced disease: case studies and ethical implications for research and public health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Two most common variations of flexor pollicis longus include its accessory head and its connection with the flexor digitorum profundus of the index (LinburgCComstock variation). In addition, while three-dimensional (3D) screening has widely been used in anatomical education, its use as reporting tool in anatomical research is still limited. The objective of this study is to report a previously unrecognized form of the accessory head of flexor pollicis longus, discuss the potential etiology of LinburgCComstock variation, and pilot the 3D scanning of a large-scale anatomical structure. METHODS: An unusual tendon slip was discovered during a routine dissection in the anterior compartment of the right forearm of a 54-year-old male cadaver. A 3D scanner was used to capture the surface topography of the specimen and an interactive portable document format (PDF) was created. RESULTS: An anomalous tendon was found originating from the lateral aspect of the flexor digitorum profundus muscle. This variant tendon then inserted onto the medial surface of the flexor pollicis longus tendon before entering the carpal tunnel. The variation resembles a reverse form of LinburgCComstock variation, because pulling this variant tendon resulted in simultaneous flexion of the interphalangeal joint of thumb. CONCLUSION: Surgeons should be aware of the reverse LinburgCComstock variation, because it may not be detectable by the conventional provocative testing. LinburgCComstock variation may be classified as an anatomical variant or a secondarily acquired condition depending on its type.

Against this backdrop, the authors of this study investigate which offerings industrial customers are most likely to purchase as the pandemic progresses. Drawing on positive decision theory and empirically investigating 31,353 sales opportunities across 57 countries, the authors show that the coronavirus pandemic significantly decreases industrial customers' purchase probability, especially for high-priced offerings. In countries with low uncertainty avoidance and strong long-term orientation (e.g., China, India, Singapore), purchase probability is less affected by the pandemic. The coronavirus pandemic even increases purchase probability for offerings with low prices in countries where cultures are simultaneously uncertainty-avoidant and short-term oriented (e.g., Argentina, Brazil, Mexico). This is presumably because customers safeguard their operations in the face of impending supply shortages. Consequently, this helps suppliers focus on the right sales opportunities to secure their business during exogenous global shocks such as the coronavirus pandemic.","output":"Industrial buying during the coronavirus pandemic: A cross-cultural study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a commonly experienced and often debilitating side effect of cancer treatment that can persist for years after treatment completion. The benefits of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for CRF are well established; however, these interventions are typically not included in standard clinical care. Traditional CBT is resource-intensive, limiting implementation in hospital settings. Stepped-care approaches can offer benefits to more people, using the same personnel as traditional models. METHOD/DESIGN: This is a single-arm feasibility study. Fifty people with a cancer diagnosis, at least 12 weeks post-treatment or on long-term maintenance treatment, with persistent CRF that is affecting daily activities, will enrol in a stepped-care CBT program. Intervention: The stepped-care program involves two steps. Step 1: All participants begin with a 5-week supported self-management CBT progam targeting fatigue. Step 2: If fatigue remains severe or has changed less than the minimal clinically important difference on the fatigue measure after step 1, participants will be offered four sessions of therapist-directed group CBT. Measures: Participants will complete questionnaires at baseline and 6 and 10 weeks. The primary outcome is feasibility of the REFRESH program. The implementation evaluation comprises acceptability, satisfaction, appropriateness, and feasibility of the study intervention, along with administrative data including cost, processes, procedures and implementation. Secondary outcomes are changes in fatigue, quality of life and self-efficacy. CONCLUSION: The REFRESH program will be the first stepped-care CBT intervention for persistent CRF in Australia.

Phylogenetic analyses reveal ongoing evolution of the predominant circulating genotype 2.VII, and the relevance of potential antigenic drift is under discussion. To investigate variation within neutralization-sensitive epitopes within the protein responsible for receptor binding, i.e. the Hemagglutinin-Neuraminidase (HN) spike protein, we were interested in establishing genotype-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). METHODS: An HN-enriched fraction of a gradient-purified NDV genotype 2.VII was prepared and successfully employed to induce antibodies in BalbC mice that recognize conformationally intact sites reactive by haemagglutination inhibition (HI). For subsequent screening of mouse hybridoma cultures, an NDV-ELISA was established that utilizes Concanavalin A (ConA-ELISA) coupled glycoproteins proven to present conformation-dependent epitopes. RESULTS: Six out of nine selected MAbs were able to block receptor binding as demonstrated by HI activity. One MAb recognized an epitope only present in the homologue virus, while four other MAbs showed weak reactivity to selected other genotypes. On the other hand, one broadly cross-reacting MAb reacted with all genotypes tested and resembled the reactivity profile of genotype-specific polyclonal antibody preparations that point to minor antigenic differences between tested NDV genotpyes. CONCLUSIONS: These results point to the concurrent presence of variable and conserved epitopes within the HN molecule of NDV. The described protocol should help to generate MAbs against a variety of NDV strains and to enable in depth analysis of the antigenic profiles of different genotypes.

Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) is the fifth-most important cereal crop in the world. It has relatively high resilience to drought and high temperature stresses during vegetative growing stages comparing to other major cereal crops. However, like other cereal crops, the sensitivity of male organ to heat and drought can severely depress sorghum yield due to reduced fertility and pollination efficiency if the stress occurs at the reproductive stage. Identification of the most vulnerable stages and the genes and genetic networks that differentially regulate the abiotic stress responses during anther development are two critical prerequisites for targeted molecular trait selection and for enhanced environmentally resilient sorghum in breeding using a variety of genetic modification strategies. However, in sorghum, anther developmental stages have not been determined. The distinctive cellular characteristics associated with anther development have not been well examined. Lack of such critical information is a major obstacle in the studies of anther and pollen development in sorghum. In this study, we examined the morphological changes of sorghum anthers at cellular level during entire male organ development processes using a modified high-throughput imaging variable pressure scanning electron microscopy and traditional light microscopy methods. We divided sorghum anther development into 18 distinctive stages and provided detailed description of the morphological changes in sorghum anthers for each stage.

Data on the frequency, transfusion practice and outcome of severe trauma haemorrhage in paediatric patients are inconsistent. METHODS: Datasets from paediatric trauma patients were retrieved from the registry of the German trauma society (TR-DGU(?)) between 2009 and 2016. Coagulopathy was defined by a Quicks value < 70% (INR (international normalized ratio) > 1.4) and/or thrombocytes  100 k upon emergency room admission. Children were grouped according to age in 4 different groups (A: 1C5, B: 6C10, C: 11C15 and D: 16C17 years). Prevalence of coagulopathy was assessed. Demographics, injury severity, haemostatic management including transfusions and mortality were described. RESULTS: 5351 primary admitted children  17 years with an abbreviated injury scale (AIS)  3 and complete datasets were included. The prevalence of coagulopathy was 13.7% (733/5351). The majority of the children sustained blunt trauma (more than 90% independent of age group) and a combination of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and any other trauma in more than 60% (A, C, D) and in 53.8% in group B. Coagulopathy occurred the most among the youngest (A: 18.2%), followed by all other age groups with approximately 13%. Overall mortality was the highest in the youngest (A: 40.9%) and among the youngest patients with traumatic brain injury (A: 71.4% and B: 47.1%).

COVID-19 epidemic spread far more quickly than before all over the world. Therefore, massive preventive measures are needed to reduce the spread of COVID-19. This study aimed to analyze sociodemographic factors that influence prevention behavior of COVID-19 transmission. This was a quantitative study with cross-sectional design. This study located in NTT West Kalimantan and East Java. The time of study was in June 2020. The sample of 96 subjects were selected by stratified random sampling technique. The dependent variable is the prevention behavior of COVID-19 transmission. Independent variables are sociodemographic include age sex education and employment status. The data were collected by using an online questionnaire. The data were analyzed by using multivariate analysis. The prevention behavior of COVID-19 transmission were influenced by age (b = 0.31 95% CI = 0.02 to 0.59 p = 0.036) education (b = 2.16 95% CI = 0.15 to 4.17 p = 0.036) and employment status (b = 2.24 95% CI = 0.59 to 3.90 p = 0.008). Gender (b = -0.45 CI 95% = -3.64 to 2.74 p = 0.781) had no effect on the prevention behavior of COVID-19 transmission. From the results of this study, it was found that research subjects with a more mature age high level of education and higher employment status could take COVID-19 prevention measures well. However in this study the results also showed that the gender of men and women did not influence COVID-19 prevention behavior. It is interesting to study the effect of each independent variable (age, education, occupation, and sex) on the dependent variable (COVID-19 transmission prevention behavior).

All patients had at least 3 months of follow-up and those who underwent combined surgeries were excluded. Ulcers were assessed at baseline and then at 1 and 3 months. Population demographics, follow-up time, ulcer etiologies, ulcer size, and complications were also recorded. Results : Baseline characteristics and clinical features of both groups were comparable. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of overlay amniotic membrane transplantations (p= 0.52) or early fall (p=0.57). At 3 months, the corneal healing rate was almost the same in both groups (89% and 91% for FD-AM and C-AM, respectively;p=0.85). Complications were evenly unusual (11% and 9% respectively;p=0.92). In logistic regression, the nature of the membrane did not influence corneal healing at 1 month (p=0.42) and 3 months (p=0.99) regardless of the depth of the ulcer. However, whatever the type of AM used, the deeper the ulcer was, the less likely it was to heal at 3 months (p=0.02).

Its etiology remains yet to be identified; the only consistently reported findings in patients with TGA are small hyperintense lesions in the hippocampus on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI). The aim of this study was to define whether these lesions are subfield specific, as suggested previously. METHODS High-resolution multiplanar reformation T1 and DWI of the hippocampus were acquired in 25 patients after TGA with a total of 43 hippocampal lesions. Hippocampal subfields were determined using the FreeSurfer software and the location of the DWI lesions was transformed to the T1 images after data co-registration. Additionally, hippocampal subfield volumes in each patient were calculated and compared with that of 20 healthy controls. RESULTS Hippocampal lesions were most frequently detected in the cornu ammonis area 1 (CA1) subfield (30.2%), the hippocampal tail (28.0%), and the subiculum (21.0%); however, lesions were also found in other subfields. There was no significant difference between patients and controls concerning the volumes of the hippocampal subfields. CONCLUSIONS Contrasting previous assumptions, we found DWI hyperintense lesions not to be restricted to the CA1 subfield. The visualization of focal hippocampal lesions on diffusion imaging located to several different hippocampal subfields suggests a potential pathophysiology of TGA independent of microstructural hippocampal anatomy and subfield-specific vulnerability.","output":"Hippocampal subfield involvement in patients with transient global amnesia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 continues to take an enormous toll on global health, the effort to find effective preventive and treatment strategies has been unparalleled in recent history [...].","output":"Nutritional Interventions for COVID-19: A Role for Carnosine?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"De novo lipogenesis (DNL) is an essential metabolic process that converts excess cellular glucose to fatty acids.

We provide here evidence that binding of hepadnavirus core particles from the cytosol to their target membranes is a distinct step in morphogenesis, discriminating among different populations of intracellular capsids. Using the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) and a flotation assay, we found about half of the intracellular capsids to be membrane associated due to an intrinsic membrane-binding affinity. In contrast to free cytosolic capsids, this subpopulation contained largely mature, double-stranded DNA genomes and lacked core protein hyperphosphorylation, both features characteristic for secreted virions. Against expectation, however, the selective membrane attachment observed did not require the presence of the large DHBV envelope protein, which has been considered to be crucial for nucleocapsid-membrane interaction. Furthermore, removal of surface-exposed phosphate residues from nonfloating capsids by itself did not suffice to confer membrane affinity and, finally, hyperphosphorylation was absent from nonenveloped nucleocapsids that were released from DHBV-transfected cells. Collectively, these observations argue for a model in which nucleocapsid maturation, involving the viral genome, capsid structure, and capsid dephosphorylation, leads to the exposure of a membrane-binding signal as a step crucial for selecting the matured nucleocapsid to be incorporated into the capsid-independent budding of virus particles.","output":"Intracellular hepadnavirus nucleocapsids are selected for secretion by envelope protein-independent membrane binding."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anesthesiologists are innovative and adaptable problem solvers.

The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a quasi-global vaccine race that not only compressed vaccine research and development (R&D) timelines, but also paved the way for the administration of a new type of vaccine technology C mRNA vaccines, which work in substantially different ways from the vaccines in use before the pandemic. While the process of bringing emerging COVID-19 vaccines to market has taken place in an unusually short timeframe, it was largely predicated on the same scientific and regulatory processes that govern the development, approval and deployment of new vaccines. For decades, these processes have encompassed several phases of vaccine testing C first without and subsequently with the involvement of human subjects C followed by an analysis of the emerging data. This Essay reflects on the evolution and status quo of the ways in which these data are gathered and disseminated within the context of the development of new vaccines. It treats information stemming from clinical trials as the initial building blocks of our vaccine data infrastructure, and surveys problems related to data collection and disclosure that have long been pervasive in the vaccine R&D ecosystem.Part I of the Essay situates the discussion of vaccine clinical trial data within historical boundaries. Part I.A travels back in time to the polio vaccine trials of the 1950s in the United States, which were one of the main catalysts of the adoption of the clinical trial structure now in place throughout the world. Part I.B then charts the formalization of the modern vaccine clinical trial model through legislation adopted between the polio and the COVID-19 vaccine races.Even though this formalization has resulted in a seemingly robust legal framework, there remain multiple problems that affect both the ways in which vaccine clinical trial data is actually generated and then utilized. Using examples from both past vaccine clinical trials and the COVID-19 vaccine race, Part II.A focuses on data collection issues, with an emphasis on the under-representation of minority populations in vaccine clinical trials. Part II.B then considers how imperfectly generated data meet further roadblocks in the form of delayed reporting or lack of reporting of clinical trial results, as well as restrictions to data sharing often attributable to agency interpretations of trade secrecy provisions that have long been disputed by several legal scholars. These problems affect both the transparency and accountability of vaccine innovation processes, and pose significant hurdles to follow-on R&D. Moreover, and relatedly, they can impair public trust on vaccine innovation processes at a time in which vaccine misinformation is quickly eroding overall levels of trust in vaccination as a public health tool. Part III concludes the Essay by pointing towards emerging ways to enrich the existing vaccine clinical trial data infrastructure. Specifically, it provides a short case study on the COVID-19 data sharing policy implemented in the European Union by its counterpart to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency. This ad hoc policy quickly expanded the disclosure of information about emerging COVID-19 drugs and vaccines in response to mounting pressure for more transparency about the drug and vaccine approval process. As such, it may be used as a blueprint by regulators elsewhere, as well as by proponents of a more robust system for the disclosure and sharing of clinical trial data.","output":"Vaccine Clinical Trials and Data Infrastructure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aims We aim to assess the safety and immunogenicity of inactivated whole-virion SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with chronic liver diseases (CLD) in this study. Methods This was a prospective, multi-center, open-label study. Participants aged over 18 years with confirmed CLD and healthy volunteers were enrolled. All participants received 2 doses of inactivated whole-virion SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Adverse reactions were recorded within 14 days after any dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, laboratory testing results were collected after the second dose, and serum samples of enrolled subjects were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies at least 14 days after the second dose. Results A total of 581 participants (437 patients with CLD and 144 healthy volunteers) were enrolled from 15 sites in China. Most adverse reactions were mild and transient, and injection site pain (36 [8.2%]) was the most frequently reported adverse event. Three participants had Grade 3 aminopherase elevation (defined as alanine aminopherase>5 upper limits of normal) after the second dose of inactivated whole-virion SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and only one of them was judged as severe adverse event potentially related to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. The positive rates of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were 76.8% in non-cirrhotic CLD group, 78.9% in compensated cirrhotic group, 76.7% in decompensated cirrhotic group (P=0.894 among CLD subgroups) and 90.3% in healthy controls (P=0.008 versus CLD group). Conclusion Inactivated whole-virion SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are safe in patients with CLD. Patients with CLD had lower immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines than healthy population.

Based on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to understand whether patients are able to mount a sufficient response to COVID-19 vaccines. Methods Patients were vaccinated with BNT162b2 mRNA (Pfizer/BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), or JNJ-78436735 (Johnson & Johnson). SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) antibodies were detected with the Elecsys assay (Roche Diagnostics). Primary endpoint is S antibody detection 28 days after final vaccination. Secondary endpoints include functional serologic assessments and T-cell responses at 28 days, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months. Results 141 patients have been enrolled to date, 136 (91 MM and 45 WM) of whom had initial S antibody assessment. Median antibody titer was 178.0 (IQR, 16.10-1166.0) for MM and 3.96 (IQR, 0-282.8) for WM. S antibody response rate was 91% (83/91) in MM and 60% (27/45) in WM. However, response rates for achieving S antibody >100 U/mL were 56% (51/91) in MM and 33% (15/45) in WM. Vaccine-specific S antibody responses following mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, and JNJ-78436735 were 74% (25/34; p<0.05), 51% (24/47; p=NS), and 20% (2/10; p<0.05) in MM and 67% (10/15; p<0.005), 19% (5/27; p<0.05), and 0% (0/3; p=NS) in WM. Among MM patients with progressive disease, S antibody response >100 u/mL occurred in 45% (9/20) as opposed to 65% (35/54) for VGPR+ (p100 U/mL occurred in 53% (19/36) and 56% (31/55), respectively (p=NS). Among WM patients, S antibody responses >100 U/mL occurred in 73% (8/11) (p<0.05) previously untreated; 0% (0/8) (p<0.05) received rituximab within 12 months; 15% (3/20) (p<0.05) on an active Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor; and 29% (4/14) (p=NS) received other therapies. Conclusions These preliminary data suggest impaired serologic responses following COVID-19 vaccines in patients with both MM and WM. Overall, WM patients showed more severe impairment of COVID-19 S antibody responses. Most previously untreated WM patients achieved S antibody responses, however suboptimal antibody responses were seen in WM patients who received rituximab within 12 months or on active BTK inhibitors. In MM patients, being in disease remission associated with improved S antibody response. Vaccination among MM and WM patients with MRNA-1273 elicited significantly higher S antibody response rates comparison to other vaccines.

Hippocrates, the wise man of Kos, knew over two millennia ago. Our objective is to comment on the types of studies aimed at understanding and optimizing drug usage and to draw attention to the need to seek approval before using or citing the Morisky adherence scale. COMMENT The study of prescribing and how patients use their medicines is important. As part of this effort, the results of investigations of how patients adhere to drug prescriptions can be informative. However, the results are meaningful only if the methods used for doing the measurements are valid and made explicit.

Emerging studies indicate possible associations between viral infections and neurodegenerative and neurobehavioural conditions including autism. Viral infection during critical periods of early in utero neurodevelopment may lead to increased risk of autism in the offspring. This review is aimed at highlighting the association between viral infections, including viruses similar to COVID-19, and the aetiology of autism. A literature search was conducted using Pubmed, Ovid/Medline, and Google Scholar database. Relevant search terms included rubella and autism, cytomegalovirus and autism, influenza virus and autism, Zika virus and autism, COVID-19 and autism. Based on the search terms, a total of 141 articles were obtained and studies on infants or children with congenital or perinatal viral infection and autistic behaviour were evaluated. The possible mechanisms by which viral infections could lead to autism include direct teratogenic effects and indirect effects of inflammation or maternal immune activation on the developing brain. Brain imaging studies have shown that the ensuing immune response from these viral infections could lead to disruption of the development of brain regions and structures. Hence, long-term follow up is necessary for infants whose mothers report an inflammatory event due to viral infection at any time during pregnancy to monitor for signs of autism. Research into the role of viral infection in the development of ASD may be one avenue of improving ASD outcomes in the future.

Efficient disease prevention is challenged by factors, such as population growth, insufficient documentation of clinical effects, dissemination mechanism, and lack of a reliable vaccine. Italy was heavily affected by COVID-19, causing it to have one of the highest COVID-19 deaths in the world. Current statistics show that Italy is on its own way to recover from the second wave of the virus. Therefore, this paper presents a susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered-dead (SEIQRD) model to model and predict the spread of the disease in Italy in the near future. The prediction is based on formulating the SEIQRD model using 365-day statistics of the disease. The parameters of the model are estimated using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The modeling results agree well with the reported data, with normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) values ranging from 0.058 to 0.214 (average NMAE = 0.115), and normalized root mean absolute error (NRMSE) values ranging from 0.104 to 0.305 (average NRMSE = 0.190). The estimated PSO-based model is then used to predict the future of the disease in Italy in the coming 35 days. The forecasted results indicate that the number of infections will keep reducing, ending the second wave of COVID-19.

Objective: To examine the implications of US state CSC guidelines for patients with cancer, including allocation methods, cancer-related categorical exclusions and deprioritizations, and provisions for blood products and palliative care. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional population-based analysis examined state-endorsed CSC guidelines published before May 20, 2020, that included health care resource allocation recommendations. Main Outcomes and Measures: Guideline publication before or within 120 days after the first documented US case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), inclusion of cancer-related categorical exclusions and/or deprioritizations, provisions for blood products and/or palliative care, and associations between these outcomes and state-based cancer demographics. Results: Thirty-one states had health care resource allocation guidelines that met inclusion criteria, of which 17 had been published or updated since the first US case of COVID-19. States whose available hospital bed capacity was predicted to exceed 100% at 6 months (&#967;2 = 3.82; P = .05) or that had a National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC; &#967;2 = 6.21; P = .01) were more likely to have publicly available guidelines. The most frequent primary methods of prioritization were the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (27 states [87%]) and deprioritizing persons with worse long-term prognoses (22 states [71%]). Seventeen states' (55%) allocation methods included cancer-related deprioritizations, and 8 states (26%) included cancer-related categorical exclusions. The presence of an in-state CCC was associated with lower likelihood of cancer-related categorical exclusions (multivariable odds ratio, 0.06 [95% CI, 0.004-0.87]). Guidelines with disability rights statements were associated with specific provisions to allocate blood products (multivariable odds ratio, 7.44 [95% CI, 1.28-43.24). Both the presence of an in-state CCC and having an oncologist and/or palliative care specialist on the state CSC task force were associated with the inclusion of palliative care provisions. Conclusions and Relevance: Among states with CSC guidelines, most deprioritized some patients with cancer during resource allocation, and one-fourth categorically excluded them. The presence of an in-state CCC was associated with guideline availability, palliative care provisions, and lower odds of cancer-related exclusions.

Bad hygiene and stress is often related to pulmonary diseases in camels. This study investigated whether camels slaughtered in Cairo carried pulmonary infections. METHODOLOGY Five hundred lung tissues of slaughtered camels were examined and 100 samples suspected for pulmonary infection were subjected to microbial identification and histopathology. RESULTS A total of 70 lung tissues revealed 97 bacterial isolates of 8 species, including Staphylococcus aureus (37.14%), Escherichia coli (27.14%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (26.71%), Bacillus spp. (25.72%), Streptococcus pyogenes (10%), Corynebacterium spp. (8.85 %), Pasteurella spp. (2.85%), and Arcanobacterium pyogenes (1.4%). Some of these species were earlier reported to be associated with pulmonary infection. Histopathology revealed different types of pneumonia in 50% of the investigated lungs. CONCLUSIONS A considerable number of apparently healthy camels carry pathogenic agents in their lower respiratory tracts. Immunosuppression and stressful conditions might influence these pathogens to induce respiratory diseases in camels. Thus, the infected camels might act as reservoir of these infections agents. If adequate care is not taken, this might be a threat to abattoir workers and may spread infections to humans.","output":"Subclinical pulmonary pathogenic infection in camels slaughtered in Cairo, Egypt."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Un nouveau coronavirus responsable de pneumonies a t identifi fin dcembre 2019 dans la rgion de Hubei, en Chine : le SARS-CoV-2.

Indeed, the modeling of the epidemic, at the level of a country, needs considering each of the different sources of contamination as well as the public health authorities' strategy, in a specific way. With this in mind, in the present paper, we develop a mathematical model of the CoVid-19 epidemic in Senegal. In the model, the population is subdivided into five compartments: susceptible, infected but asymptomatic, symptomatic, quarantined, and recovered immune people. In addition, due to its important impact on the propagation of the disease, we add one more variable: the number of infected objects. %\\\\vspace{1mm} Therefore, the model corresponds to a system of six non-linear ordinary differential equations we submit to an analytical study to prove the relevancy of the model, simulate the evolution of the epidemic, and retrieve epidemiological parameters, namely the infection rate and the basic reproduction number, \${\\\\cal R}_0$. Based on the senegalese territory CoVid-19 data, we simulate various scenarios as for the evolution of the epidemic in the country, in order to predict the peak and its magnitude with regard to the application of barrier measures. We also explore the option of collective immunity with special protection for vulnerable people.

This may be due to pre-existing transcriptional programmes in the cell of origin. Here we define anatomic position as a major determinant of why cells respond to specific oncogenes. Cutaneous melanoma arises throughout the body, whereas the acral subtype arises on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet or under the nails3. We sequenced the DNA of cutaneous and acral melanomas from a large cohort of human patients and found a specific enrichment for BRAF mutations in cutaneous melanoma and enrichment for CRKL amplifications in acral melanoma. We modelled these changes in transgenic zebrafish models and found that CRKL-driven tumours formed predominantly in the fins of the fish. The fins are the evolutionary precursors to tetrapod limbs, indicating that melanocytes in these acral locations may be uniquely susceptible to CRKL. RNA profiling of these fin and limb melanocytes, when compared with body melanocytes, revealed a positional identity gene programme typified by posterior HOX13 genes. This positional gene programme synergized with CRKL to amplify insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling and drive tumours at acral sites. Abrogation of this CRKL-driven programme eliminated the anatomic specificity of acral melanoma. These data suggest that the anatomic position of the cell of origin endows it with a unique transcriptional state that makes it susceptible to only certain oncogenic insults.","output":"Anatomic position determines oncogenic specificity in melanoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present an antiviral-immunomodulatory therapeutic strategy involving the chemokine receptor antagonist Met-RANTES, which yields significant survival in the setting of an otherwise fatal respiratory virus infection. In previous work, we demonstrated that infection with the natural rodent pathogen pneumonia virus of mice involves robust virus replication accompanied by cellular inflammation modulated by the CC chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha). We found that the antiviral agent ribavirin limited virus replication in vivo but had no impact on morbidity and mortality associated with this disease in the absence of immunomodulatory control. We show here that ribavirin reduces mortality, from 100% to 10 and 30%, respectively, in gene-deleted CCR1(-/-) mice and in wild-type mice treated with the small-molecule chemokine receptor antagonist, Met-RANTES. As MIP-1alpha-mediated inflammation is a common response to several distantly related respiratory virus pathogens, specific antiviral therapy in conjunction with blockade of the MIP-1alpha/CCR1 inflammatory cascade may ultimately prove to be a useful, generalized approach to severe respiratory virus infection and its pathological sequelae in human subjects.","output":"Functional antagonism of chemokine receptor CCR1 reduces mortality in acute pneumovirus infection in vivo."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is one of the fastest growing procedures in terms of volume performed in hospitals in the United States. In 2020, elective surgery was suspended nationwide as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the utilization trends in the wake of the pandemic have yet to be evaluated substantially. Nationwide case volume reduction for TSA is unknown, therefore the aim of this study is to compare patient demographics, complications, and temporal trends in case volume of elective total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) in the calendar year 2019 (pre-pandemic) to 2020 in the United States. Methods Utilizing a multicenter, nationwide representative sample from 2019 to 2020, a retrospective query was conducted for all patients undergoing elective TSA. Patients undergoing surgery Pre-COVID (2019 and 2020 Q1) were compared to those during COVID (2020 Q2-Q4). Temporal trends in case volumes were compared between timeframes. TSA utilization, patient demographics, complications, and length of stay (LOS) were compared between years. Linear regression was used to evaluate for changes in the case volume over the study period. A statistical significance threshold of p<0.05 was used. Results In total, 9667 patients underwent elective TSA in 2019 (N=5342) and 2020 (N=4325). The proportion of patients who underwent outpatient TSA in 2020 was significantly greater than the year prior (20.6% vs 13.9%; p<0.001). Overall, elective TSA case volume declined by 19.0% from 2019 to 2020. There was no significant difference in the volume of cases in 2019Q1 (N=1401) through 2020Q1 (N=1296) (p = .216). However, elective TSA volumes declined by 54.6% in 2020Q2. Elective TSA case volumes recovered to pre-pandemic baseline in 2020Q3 and 2020Q4. The average length of stay was comparable in 2020 vs 2019 (1.29 vs 1.32 days; p= .371), with the proportion of same day discharge increasing per quarter from 2019 to 2020 (from 11.8% to 26.8% of annual cases). There was no significant difference in the total complication rates in 2019 (4.6%) vs 2020 (4.9%); p = .441. Conclusion Using a nationwide sample, elective TSA precipitously declined during the second quarter of 2020. Patient demographics of those undergoing elective TSA in 2020 were similar in comorbidity burden. A large proportion of surgeries were transitioned to the outpatient setting with rates of same day discharge doubling over the study period, despite no change in overall complication rates.","output":"The Resiliency of Elective Total Shoulder Arthroplasty Case Volumes in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Nationwide Temporal Trends Analysis"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(O,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/68.md","filePath":"drive/68.md"}'),R={name:"drive/68.md"},M=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{z as __pageData,M as default};
