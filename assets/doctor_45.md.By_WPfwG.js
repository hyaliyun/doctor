Primary outcome was treatment strategy for appendicitis. Secondary outcomes were duration of symptoms, ultrasound findings, rate of simple vs perforated appendicitis and complications. RESULTS: Overall, only a minority (2/24 [8%]) were initially treated non-operatively, with both proceeding to appendicectomy due to pain. Remaining children (24/26 [92%]) were primarily treated with appendicectomy. All were performed laparoscopically with no conversions to open. Ultrasound was performed for most children (23/26 [88%]) which accurately identified appendicitis (22/23 [95%]) and negative appendicectomy rate of zero. Rates of complex appendicitis were not higher than expected (10/26 [38%]) but had a longer duration of symptoms (median 66.0h [IQR21.5] vs 30.0h [27.2], p = 0.008) and more complications (4 vs 1). Post-operative length of stay was significantly shorter for simple appendicitis than complicated (median 1.0d [IQR0.0] vs 4.0 [IQR2.8], p = 0.001).

OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Leadership training is of growing importance and prevalence in medical education. The COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique insight into the qualities students value in leaders. Our qualitative study examined these leadership themes and provides a grounding for future development of leadership programs. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: A conventional qualitative approach was used in order to allow open expression of ideas related to leadership in a pandemic. The authors developed a 5 free-text question survey instrument aimed to uncover student perceptions of leadership both during the current pandemic and in crises in general. A participant pilot was performed in order to ensure readability and ease of understanding. We used thematic analysis to examine the content of the survey responses, and inductive coding of the responses allowed identification of emerging themes. Medical students at the University of Michigan were surveyed. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: In total, 162 students completed the survey. The demographic characteristics of participants are shown in Table 1. Median age was 25 years old (range, 22-39). There was good representation from the 4 classes in the medical school with 20-30% from each medical school class and 5% of dual degree students. Thematic analysis demonstrated that students value personal characteristics of excellence in their leaders with an orientation towards helping other people. Students believe that leaders must know how to interpret and use information and then that these leaders must be able to communicate expertly to guide organizations. The final theme that emerged is that effective leaders must commit to decisive action. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: This study took place at a time of unprecedented crises and response examples were grounded in this real-world practice of leadership. These results and themes that emerged fill a critical gap and may facilitate future curriculum development for medical students and trainees.","output":"78696 A Qualitative Cross-Sectional Study of Leadership in a Pandemic: What do Students Value?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 is a human pathogenic coronavirus that causes a respiratory tract infection, which may lead to systemic hyper-inflammation that is associated with a hypercoagulable state. Anticoagulation as an adjunct may decrease thrombi formation. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of enoxaparin for the prevention of thrombotic events in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients with elevated D-dimer. METHODS: A single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate three enoxaparin dosing regimens: full treatment (1 mg/kg SC Q12H or 1.5 mg/kg SC Q24H), intermediate (.5 mg/kg SC Q12H or 1 mg/kg SC Q24H), and prophylaxis (40 mg SC Q24H). The primary endpoint evaluated the percentage of patients who developed a venous thromboembolism (VTE). The secondary endpoints evaluated the development of a major bleed, mechanical ventilation need, and death. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were included with 27, 8, and 10 participants in the full treatment, intermediate, and prophylaxis arms, respectively. Six patients developed a VTE: 3, 1, and 2 in the listed above groups, respectively (P = .83). Twenty patients died: 11, 3, and 6, respectively (P = .64). Four patients developed a major bleed: 1, 1, and 2, respectively (P = .17). Six patients required intubation: 1, 2, and 3 in the arms, respectively (P = .043). CONCLUSION: The study did not find a difference in respect to the development of a VTE between the three investigated doses of anticoagulation.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Prospective, observational, diagnostic accuracy study whereby hospitalized patients with ARI were consecutively enrolled in a single tertiary care center in Italy from August 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. RESULTS: COVID-19 was diagnosed in 136/200 (68.0%) patients and Non-COVID-19 was diagnosed in64/200 (32.0%) patients. COVID-19 patients were younger and had a lower Charlson comorbidity index compared to non-COVID-19 patients (p < 0.001).

OBJECTIVES The purpose of the study was to compare viability of PLTs collected in whole blood into 2 different anticoagulants. METHODS Whole blood from 6 healthy adult Thoroughbred horses was collected into citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine (CPDA) or acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD). Platelet count, pH, and concentrations of glucose, lactate, carbon dioxide, oxygen, bicarbonate, sodium, potassium, and chloride were measured within 10 minutes of collection and then again one hour later at which time PLT aggregometry was performed to assess PLT function. RESULTS Aggregometry mean amplitudes were significantly higher in CPDA compared to ACD. Blood glucose, pH, bicarbonate, sodium, and lactate concentrations were significantly higher in CPDA compared to ACD. Lactate concentration was higher following one hour in either anticoagulant. Potassium, oxygen, and carbon dioxide concentrations were significantly higher in ACD compared to CPDA at collection. CONCLUSIONS Platelet aggregometry results suggest that CPDA is superior to ACD for maintaining PLT viability following whole blood collection. This may be associated with the higher, more neutral pH as well as an increase in glucose available for metabolism. Although lactate was increased in the CPDA samples it was not high enough to decrease pH and therefore may not have been high enough to cause morphologic lesions and loss of PLT viability.","output":"Comparison of equine platelet function and survival in whole blood collected in acid-citrate-dextrose solution or citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine solution."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We comprehensively study the variability of Miras in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) by simultaneous analysing light curves in 14 bands in the range of 0.5$-$24 microns.

We show that the variability amplitude ratio declines with the increasing wavelength for both oxygen-rich (O-rich) and carbon-rich (C-rich) Miras, while the variability phase-lag increases slightly with the increasing wavelength. In a significant number of Miras, mostly the C-rich ones, the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) require a presence of a cool component (dust) in order to match the mid-IR data.

In settings of large numbers of patients, a risk assessment tool may guide resource allocation not only for patient care but also for maximum health care and public health benefit. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine whether a COVID-19 telemedicine risk assessment tool accurately predicts hospitalizations. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of a COVID-19 telemedicine home monitoring program serving health care workers and the community in Atlanta, Georgia, with enrollment from March 24 to May 26, 2020; the final call range was from March 27 to June 19, 2020. All patients were assessed by medical providers using an institutional COVID-19 risk assessment tool designating patients as Tier 1 (low risk for hospitalization), Tier 2 (intermediate risk for hospitalization), or Tier 3 (high risk for hospitalization). Patients were followed with regular telephone calls to an endpoint of improvement or hospitalization. Using survival analysis by Cox regression with days to hospitalization as the metric, we analyzed the performance of the risk tiers and explored individual patient factors associated with risk of hospitalization. RESULTS: Providers using the risk assessment rubric assigned 496 outpatients to tiers: Tier 1, 237 out of 496 (47.8%); Tier 2, 185 out of 496 (37.3%); and Tier 3, 74 out of 496 (14.9%). Subsequent hospitalizations numbered 3 out of 237 (1.3%) for Tier 1, 15 out of 185 (8.1%) for Tier 2, and 17 out of 74 (23%) for Tier 3. From a Cox regression model with age of 60 years or older, gender, and reported obesity as covariates, the adjusted hazard ratios for hospitalization using Tier 1 as reference were 3.74 (95% CI 1.06-13.27; P=.04) for Tier 2 and 10.87 (95% CI 3.09-38.27; P<.001) for Tier 3.

In an endeavor to improve accuracy of depression forecasting, machine learning (ML) approaches have been recommended, in addition to the application of more traditional regression approaches. METHODS: A prospective study was employed in home-based elderly Chinese, using baseline (2011) and follow-up (2013) data of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), a nationally representative cohort study. We compared four algorithms, including the regression-based models (logistic regression, lasso, ridge) and ML method (random forest). Model performance was assessed using repeated nested 10-fold cross-validation. As the main measure of predictive performance, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: The mean AUCs of the four predictive models, logistic regression, lasso, ridge, and random forest, were 0.795, 0.794, 0.794, and 0.769, respectively. The main determinants were life satisfaction, self-reported memory, cognitive ability, ADL (activities of daily living) impairment, CESD-10 score. Life satisfaction increased the odds ratio of a future depression by 128.6% (logistic), 13.8% (lasso), and 13.2% (ridge), and cognitive ability was the most important predictor in random forest. CONCLUSIONS: The three regression-based models and one ML algorithm performed equally well in differentiating between a future depression case and a non-depression case in home-based elderly.

Canada during the pandemic, have significantly impeded the use of TFWs in Canada's food-production system That has revealed the vulnerabilities of the Canadian food supply chain to globally disruptive

Canada had seen a record number of TFWs employed in the agriculture sector, as the number of Canadian citizens and permanent residents employed in the industry has remained relatively stagnant and even declined However, travel restrictions imposed by Canadian governments due to the COVID-19 pandemic have coincided with a significant reduction in TFWs working in Canada in 2020 In total, there

had been experiencing the fastest growth in the use of TFWs until now, and have seen the greatest relative reduction in TFW arrivals in comparison to 2019 Farms, which are primary producers, have experienced the largest reduction in TFW arrivals in absolute terms Although the economic effects of the pandemic-related lockdown have put many Canadians out of work, replacing TFWs with Canadian workers may not be practicable Producers may not be able to hire Canadians willing to work on farms, ranches or in food-processing plants in sufficient numbers to make up for the shortfall in TFWs When the government of New Brunswick completely banned the entry of TFWs due to the pandemic, it did not result in a significant increase in local hiring In addition, TFWs often come with experience gained from previous years working in Canada's food sector;training Canadians to replace them requires time and resources that can jeopardize the precious time that producers have to complete seasonal seeding, harvesting, and fishing activities Policy-makers will need to consider ways to ensure that TFWs, which have become critical to Canada's food supply chain, are able to come to Canada safely and work in safe environments, in the face of the pandemic health risk This year will already be a more difficult one for producers, and future years could face similar challenges Canadians have come

Our results revealed high serum SP-D levels in severe pandemic influenza but not COVID-19 patients. This finding was validated in a separate cohort of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients who also showed low plasma SP-D levels. However, plasma SP-D levels did not distinguish seasonal influenza from COVID-19 in mild-to-moderate disease. Finally, we found that high serum SP-D levels were associated with mortality and renal failure among severe pandemic influenza cases. Thus, our studies have identified SP-D as a unique biomarker expressed during severe pandemic influenza but not COVID-19.","output":"Expression of Surfactant protein D (SP-D) distinguishes severe pandemic influenza A(H1N1) from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact worldwide and has brought clinical assays both for acute diagnosis and prior exposure determination to the forefront. Serological testing intended for point-of-care or laboratory use can be used to determine more accurate individual and population assessments of prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2; improve our understanding of the degree to which immunity is conveyed to subsequent exposures; and quantify immune response to future vaccines. In response to this pandemic, initially more than 90 companies deployed serology assays to the U.S. market, many of which made overstated claims for their accuracy, regulatory approval status, and utility for intended purpose. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration subsequently instituted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) procedure requiring that manufacturers submit validation data, but allowing newly developed serological tests to be marketed without the usual approval process during this crisis. Although this rapid deployment was intended to benefit public health, the incomplete understanding of immune response to the virus and lack of assay vetting resulted in quality issues with some of these tests, and thus many were withdrawn after submission. Common assay platforms include lateral flow assays which can serve an important niche of low cost, rapid turnaround, and increased accessibility whereas established laboratory-based platforms based on ELISAs and chemiluminescence expand existing technologies to SARS-CoV-2 and can provide throughput and quantification capabilities. While most of the currently EUA assays rely on these well-established platforms, despite their apparent technical simplicity, there are numerous practical challenges both for manufacturers in developing and for end-users in running and interpreting such assays. Within are discussed technical challenges to serology development for SARS-CoV-2, with an emphasis on lateral flow assay technology.","output":"Technical considerations to development of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted care systems around the world.

Invitations were sent to 6631 contacts of all patients diagnosed with epilepsy within the last 5 years at the BambinoGes Childrens Hospital in Rome. Of the 3321 responses received, 55.6% of patients were seizure-free for at least 1 year before the COVID-19-related lockdown, 74.4% used anti-seizure medications (ASMs), and 59.7% had intellectual disability. Only 10 patients (0.4%) became infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Seizure frequency remained stable for most patients during the lockdown period (increased in 13.2%; decreased in 20.3%), and seizure duration, use of rescue medications, and adherence to treatment were unchanged. Comorbidities were more affected (behavioral problems worsened in 35.8%; sleep disorder worsened in 17.0%).

All elective and semi-elective procedures, as well as select urgent cases, were postponed in order to preserve resources and protect patients and staff from SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Structured decision making for breast cancer treatment resulted in deferment of surgery with initiation of endocrine therapy. Moreover, the waitlist for elective breast cancer procedures after mitigation is a challenge for prioritization. OBJECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANCE: We aim to summarize the current body of evidence, comparatively evaluate oncological outcomes of surgery versus primary endocrine therapy (PET), and determine whether PET is a viable long-term alternative to surgery in the context of crisis management strategy for early, operable hormone receptor positive (HRP) breast cancer. PET could potentially be an acceptable bridging or maintenance therapy in select patients during pandemic crisis or for those choosing to forgo surgery in the treatment of breast cancer. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The database search includes PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE (via Ovid). This systematic review includes women 18 years or older undergoing one of two interventions for HRP breast cancer: surgery (with or without endocrine therapy post-surgery) or solely PET. Studies comparing one of the two interventions of interest to a non-relevant intervention and studies reporting only descriptive data will not be included in the quantitative synthesis of data. After selection of eligible studies based on title and abstract, these studies will be further screened through full text articles by two independent reviewers, with a third as an arbitrator.

Canadian adolescents (N = 809) aged 12-18 were recruited on social media and completed an online survey. COVID-19-related stress was associated with recent DSH. Nonacceptance of emotional responses and limited access to ER strategies fully mediated this association. The indirect effect through nonacceptance of emotional responses was stronger among more socially distanced youth, whereas the indirect effect through limited access to ER strategies was stronger among older and more socially distanced youth. COVID-19-related stress and ER difficulties did not interact to predict DSH, nor did age or social distancing moderate these interactions. These results align with etiological models proposing central roles for stress and ER difficulties in DSH. Furthermore, this study underscores a need to support adolescents, particularly older teens with reduced in-person interactions, in adaptively coping with pandemic-related stress.","output":"Deliberate Self-Harm in Adolescents During COVID-19: The Roles of Pandemic-Related Stress, Emotion Regulation Difficulties, and Social Distancing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic triggered an economic shock just ten years after the shock of the 2008 global financial crisis. Economic shocks are a challenge for health systems because they reduce government revenue at the same time as they increase the need for publicly financed health care. This article explores the resilience of health financing policy to economic shocks by reviewing policy responses to the financial crisis and COVID-19 in Europe. It finds that some health systems were weakened by responses to the 2008 crisis. Responses to the pandemic show evidence of lessons learnt from the earlier crisis but also reveal weaknesses in health financing policy that limit national preparedness to face economic shocks, particularly in countries with social health insurance schemes. These weaknesses highlight where permanent changes are needed to strengthen resilience in future: countries will have to find ways to reduce cyclicality in coverage policy and revenue-raising; increase the priority given to health in allocating public spending; and ensure that resources are used to meet equity and efficiency goals. Although many health systems are likely to face budgetary pressure in the years ahead, the experience of the 2008 crisis shows that austerity is not an option because it undermines resilience and progress towards universal health coverage.","output":"How resilient is health financing policy in Europe to economic shocks?

Traditional approaches for the prevention and control of infectious diseases include vaccination programmes, hygiene measures and drugs that suppress the pathogen, treat the disease symptoms or attenuate aggressive reactions of the host immune system. The provision of vaccines and biologic drugs such as antibodies is hampered by the high cost and limited scalability of traditional manufacturing platforms based on microbial and animal cells, particularly in developing countries where infectious diseases are prevalent and poorly controlled. Molecular farming, which uses plants for protein expression, is a promising strategy to address the drawbacks of current manufacturing platforms.

The study assesses impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on the stock-precious metals nexus and further examine this relationship by supplementing the Twitters Daily Happiness Sentiment index to the methodological framework for the period from 01 January 2020 to 03 May 2021. We find that precious metals positively influence stock markets before the Covid-19 outbreak and firmly play a valuable role due to their hedge and safe haven characteristics. In contrast, the bivariate GARCH framework does not provide statistically significant evidence on the stock-precious metals nexus during the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the tri-variate GARCH approach with stock markets, precious metals, and happiness sentiment indexes reveals sufficiently complicated interactions between these return series. Prominently, past change in the happiness index negatively affects the stock returns but positively drives the performance of precious metals. These findings indirectly demonstrate the stock-precious metals nexus under impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and reflect the demand of precious metals during crisis periods.

The study objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of administration of Russian complex with unique composition BESTFertil in case of decreased fertility and asthenic syndrome in males after new coronavirus infection. Materials and methods. We performed a non-blinded randomized prospective controlled trial which included 60 male patients with a history of COVID-19 not earlier than 6 months prior to enrollment from couples planning to have children. Patients were included if they had pre-disease semen analysis results available. They were divided into two equal groups. Group 1 (main group) received BESTFertil complex for 12 weeks, while Group 2 (comparison group) received no additional treatment. At baseline and 12-week follow-up all patients underwent semen analysis, MAR test, sperm DNA fragmentation test, serum sex hormone profiling and completed the Asthenic condition scale questionnaire. Student's t-test, Wilcoxon test, Mann-Whitney U-test and McNemar test were used for statistical analysis. Results. When comparing retrospective and baseline values we found no critical influence of COVID-19 on semen param- eters, though a moderate decrease of percentage of sperm with progressive motility could be observed (40.5 % vs 30 %, p = 0.008). Group 1 had a stronger tendency toward recovery of semen parameters. Patients receiving BESTFertil had median total motile sperm count increased from 48.5 million to 76.8 million (p = 0.032), while in comparison group it increased from 39.8 million to 49.2 million (p = 0.317). BESTFertil antioxidant complex had no negative influence on endocrine profile. Moreover, there was a statistically significant decrease of sperm DNA fragmentation index from 21.2 to 13.9 % (p = 0.007) in Group 1. Lower rate of asthenic symptoms was observed in Group 1 which received BESTFertil. Conclusion. Men with a recent history of COVID-19 had a moderate decrease of surrogate fertility markers, most prob- ably due to non-specific mechanisms.

In severe case, skin contraction takes place at such a large extent that joint mobility of a patient is significantly inhibited. In these cases, one refers to a contracture. In order to predict the evolution of post-wounding skin, several mathematical model frameworks have been set up. These frameworks are based on complicated systems of partial differential equations that need finite element-like discretizations for the approximation of the solution. Since these computational frameworks can be expensive in terms of computation time and resources, we study the applicability of neural networks to reproduce the finite element results. Our neural network is able to simulate the evolution of skin in terms of contraction for over one year. The simulations are based on 25 input parameters that are characteristic for the patient and the injury. One of such input parameters is the stiffness of the skin. The neural network results have yielded an average goodness of fit ([Formula: see text] ) of 0.9928 ( 0.0013). Further, a tremendous speed-up of 19354X was obtained with the neural network.

Most of these photographs additionally showed orangutans performing abnormal positional behaviours such as being low to or on the ground rather than their natural high position in the canopy; being near the ground and in close proximity to humans increases the risk of anthropozoonotic disease transmission. As expected, we found a significant decrease in number of photographs that were posted following the closure, and a decrease in the proportion of photographs that showed orangutans or tourists feeding orangutans. Tourists do not seem to perceive that they pose risks to the orangutans and therefore increased awareness, education and enforcement of rules by all stakeholders, tourism bodies and government officials need to be actioned in order to safeguard this important population, which is crucial to the future survival of the Sumatran orangutan.","output":"Primate selfies and anthropozoonotic diseases: lack of rule compliance and poor risk perception threatens orangutans."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic, placing significant burdens on the healthcare systems. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a machine learning approach incorporating hidden nonlinear interactions can improve prediction for Intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Methods: Consecutive patients admitted to public hospitals between 1st January and 24th May 2020 in Hong Kong with COVID-19 diagnosed by RT-PCR were included. The primary endpoint was ICU admission. Results: This study included 1043 patients (median age 35 (IQR: 32-37; 54% male). Nineteen patients were admitted to ICU (median hospital length of stay (LOS): 30 days, median ICU LOS: 16 days). ICU patients were more likely to be prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, anti-retroviral drugs lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir, ribavirin, steroids, interferon-beta and hydroxychloroquine. Significant predictors of ICU admission were older age, male sex, prior coronary artery disease, respiratory diseases, diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease, and activated partial thromboplastin time, red cell count, white cell count, albumin and serum sodium. A tree-based machine learning model identified most informative characteristics and hidden interactions that can predict ICU admission. These were: low red cells with 1) male, 2) older age, 3) low albumin, 4) low sodium or 5) prolonged APTT. A five-fold cross validation confirms superior performance of this model over baseline models including XGBoost, LightGBM, random forests, and multivariate logistic regression. Conclusions: A machine learning model including baseline risk factors and their hidden interactions can accurately predict ICU admission in COVID-19.","output":"Identifying main and interaction effects of risk factors to predict intensive care admission in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study in Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Adolescents aged from 19 to 22 are the main high-risk population of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). This study aimed to understand the current status of knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) about TB among freshmen from Jiangsu colleges and universities. Analyze its influencing factors and explore the interrelationships of KAP. This provides a basis for building a reversing mechanism for health education on tuberculosis prevention and treatment in middle and high schools. METHODS: A multistage randomly was used to select freshmen to conduct this online survey. The (2) test was used to compare the rates. Construct linear regression model, logistic regression model, decision tree model and random forest model, use grid search to adjust the parameters of the model, and use multiple models to explore the influencing factors of the overall awareness rate of students core knowledge of tuberculosis. RESULTS: A total of 6980 freshmen in colleges and universities were investigated. The total awareness rate was 89.02%, and the awareness rate of all core knowledge about TB was 58.94%. It is characterized by general demographic data, and all core knowledge is known as a label to establish a model, based on the f1- of the four models The score believes that the random forest model has the best fitting effect, and the ranking of the influencing factors included in the model is school type (0.72) >fathers education (0.15) >family monthly income (0.03) >mothers education, gender, region (0.02); a structural equation model is established, and the modified knowledge and attitude path coefficient is 0.29 (P<0.05); the attitude and behavior path coefficient is 0.64 (P<0.05).

Although estimates have been quoted, the modeling methods used have either been simplistic or opaque, making it difficult for policy makers to have confidence in these estimates. Providing central estimates of health impacts, without any quantification of their uncertainty, is deficient because such an approach does not acknowledge the inherent uncertainty in extreme environmental exposures associated with spiraling climate change and related health impacts. Furthermore, presenting only the uncertainty bounds around central estimates, without information on how the uncertainty in each of the model parameters and assumptions contribute to the total uncertainty, is insufficient because this approach hides those parameters and assumptions which contribute most to the total uncertainty. We propose a framework for calculating the catastrophic human health impacts of spiraling climate change and the associated uncertainties. Our framework comprises three building blocks: (A) a climate model to simulate the environmental exposure extremes of spiraling climate change; (B) a health impact model which estimates the health burdens of the extremes of environmental exposures; and (C) an analytical mathematical method which characterizes the uncertainty in (A) and (B), propagates the uncertainty in-between and through these models, and attributes the proportion of uncertainty in the health outcomes to model assumptions and parameter values. Once applied, our framework can be of significant value to policy makers because it handles uncertainty transparently while taking into account the complex interactions between climate and human health.","output":"Catastrophic Health Impacts of Spiraling Climate Change: How Certain Can We Be About Their Magnitudes?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Predicting water contamination by statistical models is a useful tool to manage health risk in recreational beaches. Extreme contamination events, i.e. those exceeding normative are generally rare with respect to bathing conditions and thus the data is said to be imbalanced. Modeling and predicting those rare events present unique challenges. Here we introduce and evaluate several machine learning techniques and metrics to model imbalanced data and evaluate model performance. We do so by using a) simulated data-sets and b) a real data base with records of faecal coliform abundance monitored for 10 years in 21 recreational beaches in Uruguay (N &#8776; 19000) using in situ and meteorological variables. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of the methods and provide a simple guide to perform models for a general audience. We also provide R codes to reproduce model fitting and testing. We found that most Machine Learning techniques are sensitive to imbalance and require specific data pre-treatment (e.g. upsampling) to improve performance. Accuracy (i.e. correctly classified cases over total cases) is not adequate to evaluate model performance on imbalanced data set. Instead, true positive rates (TPR) and false positive rates (FPR) are recommended. Among the 52 possible candidate algorithms tested, the stratified Random forest presented the better performance improving TPR in 50% with respect to baseline (0.4) and outperformed baseline in the evaluated metrics. Support vector machines combined with upsampling method or synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) performed well, similar to Adaboost with SMOTE.

Similar activities have also been instituted worldwide, as the global threat of a radiological or nuclear incident continues to be a concern. Much of the USG's efforts to plan for the unthinkable has centered on establishing clear lines of communication between agencies with responsibility for triage and medical response, and external stakeholders. There have also been strong connections made between those parts of the government that establish policies, fund research, oversee regulatory approval, and purchase and stockpile necessary medical supplies. Progress made in advancing preparedness has involved a number of subject matter meetings and tabletop exercises, publication of guidance documents, assessment of available resources, clear establishment of anticipated concepts of operation for multiple radiation and nuclear scenarios, and identification/mobilization of resources. From a scientific perspective, there were clear research gaps that needed to be addressed, which included the need to identify accurate biomarkers and design biodosimetry devices to triage large numbers of civilians, develop decorporation agents that are more amenable for mass casualty use, and advance candidate products to address injuries caused by radiation exposure and thereby improve survival. Central to all these activities was the development of several different animal constructs, since efficacy testing of these approaches requires extensive work in research models that accurately simulate what would be expected in humans.

Multi-site data detailing clinical characteristics of patient deaths from large populations, managed by specialist and generalist palliative care providers is lacking. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a large multicenter study examining characteristics of COVID-19 hospital deaths and implications for care. METHODS: A multi-center retrospective evaluation examined 434 COVID-19 deaths in 5 hospital trusts over the period 23/03/20-10/05/20. RESULTS: Eighty three percent of patients were over 70 and 32% were admitted from care homes. Diagnostic timing indicated over 90% of those who died contracted the virus in the community. Dying was recognized in over 90% of patients, with the possibility of dying being identified less than 48 hours from admission for a third. In over a quarter, death occurred less than 24 hours later. Patients who were recognized to be dying more than 72 hours prior to death are most likely to have access to medication for symptom control. CONCLUSION: This large multicenter study comprehensively describes COVID-19 deaths throughout the hospital setting. Clinicians are alert to and diagnose dying appropriately in most patients. Outcomes could be improved by advance care planning to establish preferences, including whether hospital admission is desirable, and alongside this, support the prompt use of anticipatory subcutaneous medications and syringe drivers if needed.

Cigarette smoke (CS) exposure worsens influenza infection in terms of frequency and severity in both human and animal models. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice with or without CS exposure for 6 weeks were inoculated intranasally with a single, non-lethal dose of the influenza A virus (IAV) A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) strain. At 7 and 10 days after infection, lung and mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) cells were collected to determine the numbers of total CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, and IAV-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, using flow cytometry. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was also collected to determine IFN- levels and total protein concentration. RESULTS: Although long-term CS exposure suppressed early pulmonary IAV-antigen specific CD8 + and CD4 + T cell numbers and IFN- production in response to IAV infection on day 7 post-infection, CS enhanced numbers of these cells and IFN- production on day 10. The changes of total protein concentration in BALF are consistent with the changes in the IFN- amounts between day 7 and 10, which suggested that excessive IFN- impaired barrier function and caused lung injury at the later stage of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that prior CS exposure caused a biphasic T cell and IFN- response to subsequent infection with influenza in the lung. Specifically, the number of IAV antigen-specific T cells on day 10 was greatly increased by CS exposure even though CS decreased the number of the same group of cells on day 7. The result suggested that CS affected the kinetics of the T cell response to IAV, which was suppressed at an early stage and exaggerated at a later stage. This study is the first to describe the different effect of long-term CS on T cell responses to IAV at early and late stages of infection in vivo.

The PROMIS-29 assessment tool is utilized as a component of assessing multidimensional pain scales. It includes patient-reported measures of pain, mood, sleep, social participation, and function. Currently, there are no data on whether a patients immediate environment (remote versus in person) influences the reported patient outcomes measurement of a multidimensional tool represented as PROMIS-29 data. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was performed. Subjects were identified and consecutively enrolled upon entry into a chronic pain or spine center in the United States. The PROMIS-29 v2.1 was recorded. Statistical differences were assessed among age groups and across the seven domains of the assessment. RESULTS: A total of 25,187 distinct patients were enrolled in the study from August 2018 to December 2020 with a presenting baseline measurement of PROMIS-29. The PROMIS-29 v2.1 was evaluated across the seven domains, and subgroup age analysis was performed for patients completing surveys in the clinical setting (non-remote group) and those completing the survey in the remote setting (remote group) during entry into spine and pain practices across the United States. For mental health scores, those less than 40 years of age and those over 80 years of age showed significant differences in ratings of anxiety and depression in the remote versus non-remote setting. Regarding physical health scores, those aged 60C79 showed a significant difference in the remote versus non-remote ratings for pain interference (p = 0.005; 63.9 vs. 64.4), physical function (p = 0.000; 36.4 vs. 35.7), and fatigue (p = 0.020; 57.2 vs. 57.7), while subjects over 80 years of age showed a statistical difference between the remote versus non-remote setting only in rating physical function (p = 0.025; 33.0 vs. 34). Notably, the rating of sleep disturbance in the remote versus non-remote setting was the only significant variable in the 40C59 age category (p = 0.000; 60.0 vs. 59.1).

METHOD We present NBP from a novel systems approach that incorporates social system informatics and engineering, both necessary when utilizing feedback loops, ubiquitous in implementation research and practice. Examples of two methodological challenges are presented: how to monitor implementation, and how to provide feedback by evaluating system-level changes due to implementation.

Here, we experimentally tested the vulnerability of a demersal temperate fish (Sparus aurata) to long-lasting heatwaves, on larval, juvenile and adult life-stages. Fish were exposed to simulated coastal (18 C), estuarine (24 C) summer temperatures, and heatwave conditions (30 C) and their physiological responses were assessed based on cellular stress response biomarkers (heat shock protein 70 kDa, ubiquitin, antioxidant enzymes, lipid peroxidation) and phenotypic measures (histopathology, condition and mortality). Life-stage vulnerability can be ranked as larvae > adults > juveniles, based on mortality, tissue pathology and the capacity to employ cellular stress responses, reflecting the different environmental niches of each life stage. While larvae lacked acclimation capacity, which resulted in damage to tissues and elevated mortality, juveniles coped well with elevated temperature. The rapid induction of cytoprotective proteins maintained the integrity of vital organs in juveniles, suggesting adaptive phenotypic plasticity in coastal and estuarine waters. Adults displayed lower plasticity to heatwaves as they transition to deeper habitats for maturation, showing tissue damage in brain, liver and muscle. Life cycle closure of sea breams in coastal habitats will therefore be determined by larval and adult stages.","output":"Different sensitivity to heatwaves across the life cycle of fish reflects phenotypic adaptation to environmental niche"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a pilot study that attempted to infect human volunteers with Cyclospora cayetanensis.

MSU crystals induce inflammation by activating the complement system and various immune cell types, and by inducing necrotic cell death. We previously found that the soluble pattern recognition molecule C-reactive protein (CRP) recognizes MSU crystals, while enhancing complement activation. In the absence of CRP, MSU crystals still induced complement activation, suggesting additional CRP-independent mechanisms of complement activation. In the present study, we searched for additional MSU crystal-binding complement activators. We found that all healthy individuals, even unborn children, have MSU crystal-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) in their blood. This indicates that innate IgM, also known as natural IgM, recognizes these crystals. In serum lacking IgM and CRP, MSU crystals showed negligible complement activation as assessed by the production of the anaphylatoxins C4a, C3a, and C5a (listed in order of production via the classical complement pathway). We show that IgM and CRP both activate the classical complement pathway on MSU crystals. CRP was more efficient at fixating active C1 on the crystals and inducing release of the most inflammatory anaphylatoxin C5a, indicating non-redundant functions of CRP. Notably, while CRP recognizes MSU crystals but not the related calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals, natural IgM bound to both, suggesting common and distinct mechanisms of recognition of individual crystal types by complement activators.","output":"Natural antibodies and CRP drive anaphylatoxin production by urate crystals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic has laid bare the need to invest in nursing for global health and economic security.

When one or both values are elevated, additional analysis is important to establish the etiology of the disorder. Methemoglobinemia occurs from acquired or hereditary causes with diverse treatment considerations, while true sulfhemoglobinemia is only acquired and treatment is restricted to toxin removal. Some toxic exposures can result in a dual increase in MetHb and SHb. Hereditary conditions, such as M-Hemoglobin variants (M-Hbs), can result in increased MetHb and/or SHb values but are clinically compensated and do not require treatment if they are cyanotic but otherwise clinically well. METHODS Herein, we report 53 hemoglobin variant cases that have associated MetHb and SHb levels measured by an adapted Evelyn-Malloy laboratory assay method. RESULTS Our data indicate M-Hbs cause variable patterns of MetHb and SHb elevation in a fairly reproducible pattern for the particular variant. In particular,  globin chain M-Hbs can mimic acquired sulfhemoglobinemia due to an isolated increased SHb value. CONCLUSION If the patient appears clinically well other than cyanosis, M-Hbs should be considered early in the evaluation process to differentiate from acquired conditions to avoid unnecessary testing and treatment regimens and prompt genetic counseling.","output":"Interpreting sulfhemoglobin and methemoglobin in patients with cyanosis: An overview of patients with M-hemoglobin variants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the modeled estimations of the burden of asymptomatic spread, the duration of viral positivity and infectiousness of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains understudied.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyse the results of the laparoscopic treatment of incisional hernia at our institution and to identify potential risk factors for recurrence. METHODS The medical data (pre-operative, peri-operative, and postoperative) of patients who received a laparoscopic repair of their incisional hernia between January 2003 and February 2007 were recorded. The follow-up was based on a retrospective analysis of the information found in the patients' medical records. RESULTS Seventy-four laparoscopic interventions were performed on 71 patients. Polyester implants with an average size of 412.16 cm2 were used to cover the hernia. The mean operative time was 76.8 +/- 55.6 min (range, 20 to 295 min) and the mean duration of post-operative hospitalisation was 3.75 +/- 2.3 days (range, 2 to 12 days). One breach in the small intestine (1.4%) (sutured with 3/0 silk thread) and 1 conversion to laparotomy (1.4%) for a voluminous incisional hernia occurred during surgery. The post-operative morbidity was 8.2%, the rate of long-term complications was 27%, and 13 recurrences (including 3 with complications) were noted (17.6%) during a mean follow-up of 13 months. There was no postoperative mortality. Recurrences were linked to the use of large meshes corresponding to large incisional hernia diameter (p < 0.05).

Currently there is worldwide alert for H5N1 avian influenza becoming as transmissible in humans as seasonal influenza, and potentially causing a pandemic of unprecedented proportions. Here we show how epidemiological surveillance data for emerging infectious diseases can be interpreted in real time to assess changes in transmissibility with quantified uncertainty, and to perform running time predictions of new cases and guide logistics allocations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We develop an extension of standard epidemiological models, appropriate for emerging infectious diseases, that describes the probabilistic progression of case numbers due to the concurrent effects of (incipient) human transmission and multiple introductions from a reservoir. The model is cast in terms of surveillance observables and immediately suggests a simple graphical estimation procedure for the effective reproductive number R (mean number of cases generated by an infectious individual) of standard epidemics. For emerging infectious diseases, which typically show large relative case number fluctuations over time, we develop a Bayesian scheme for real time estimation of the probability distribution of the effective reproduction number and show how to use such inferences to formulate significance tests on future epidemiological observations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Violations of these significance tests define statistical anomalies that may signal changes in the epidemiology of emerging diseases and should trigger further field investigation.

We expand one of these Cas13a-based methods to detect small molecules in a one-batch assay. Using SHERLOCK-based profiling of in vitrotranscription (SPRINT), in vitro transcribed RNA sequence-specifically triggers the RNase activity of Cas13a. This event activates its non-specific RNase activity, which enables cleavage of an RNA oligonucleotide labeled with a quencher/fluorophore pair and thereby de-quenches the fluorophore. This fluorogenic output can be measured to assess transcriptional output. The use of riboswitches or proteins to regulate transcription via specific effector molecules is leveraged as a coupled assay that transforms effector concentration into fluorescence intensity. In this way, we quantified eight different compounds, including cofactors, nucleotides, metabolites of amino acids, tetracycline and monatomic ions in samples. In this manner, hundreds of reactions can be easily quantified in a few hours. This increased throughput also enables detailed characterization of transcriptional regulators, synthetic compounds that inhibit transcription, or other coupled enzymatic reactions. These SPRINT reactions are easily adaptable to portable formats and could therefore be used for the detection of analytes in the field or at point-of-care situations.","output":"SPRINT: a Cas13a-based platform for detection of small molecules"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the Covid-19 pandemic in the fall 2020 semester, a traditional in-person class was redesigned into an online remote flipped classroom.

This study aims to account for associations between knowledge and practices in Kenya and report the food consumption of children from birth to 18 months. In 2015 mother-child pairs were recruited from Mother-and-Child Health Centers; 415 in an urban slum in Nairobi and 364 in rural Machakos. Knowledge and practice scores were calculated from questionnaire variables and 24-h food frequency questionnaire. The associations of knowledge and practices were studied with regression analysis. Breastfeeding knowledge (Nairobi 6.3/9, Machakos 5.9/9) and practices (Nairobi 7.5/8, Machakos 7.2/8) were good in both areas. Complementary feeding knowledge was not as good (Nairobi 7.5/14, Machakos 7.1/14). Minimum meal frequency was reached by almost 80% of the children but dietary diversity was low (Nairobi 2.7 [SD 1.4], Machakos 2.4. [SD 1.3]). Only 27% of children in Nairobi and 13% in Machakos were fed a minimum acceptable diet. The complementary feeding knowledge score was associated only with minimum dietary diversity in Nairobi (OR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.105-1.514).

This is despite such settings accounting for a high burden of disease. Many factors intersect to influence the performance of CHVs working in urban informal settlements in LMICs. This review was conducted to identify both the programme level and contextual factors influencing performance of CHVs working in urban informal settlements in LMICs. METHODS Four databases were searched for qualitative and mixed method studies focusing on CHVs working in urban and peri-urban informal settlements in LMICs. We focused on CHV programme outcome measures at CHV individual level. A total of 13 studies met the inclusion criteria and were double read to extract relevant data. Thematic coding was conducted, and data synthesized across ten categories of both programme and contextual factors influencing CHV performance. Quality was assessed using both the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) and the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool (MMAST); and certainty of evidence evaluated using the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (CERQual) approach. RESULTS Key programme-level factors reported to enhance CHV performance in urban informal settlements in LMICs included both financial and non-financial incentives, training, the availability of supplies and resources, health system linkage, family support, and supportive supervision. At the broad contextual level, factors found to negatively influence the performance of CHVs included insecurity in terms of personal safety and the demand for financial and material support by households within the community. These factors interacted to shape CHV performance and impacted on implementation of CHV programmes in urban informal settlements. CONCLUSION This review identified the influence of both programme-level and contextual factors on CHVs working in both urban and peri-urban informal settlements in LMICs. The findings suggest that programmes working in such settings should consider adequate remuneration for CHVs, integrated and holistic training, adequate supplies and resources, adequate health system linkages, family support and supportive supervision. In addition, programmes should also consider CHV personal safety issues and the community expectations.","output":"Factors influencing the performance of community health volunteers working within urban informal settlements in low- and middle-income countries: a qualitative meta-synthesis review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: ASIA syndrome is an entity that incorporates diverse autoimmune conditions after exposure to various adjuvants in vaccines.

However, response to therapy is variable, and biomarkers that can guide treatment selection and response evaluation are lacking. Circulating RNAs are a promising source of biomarkers. We explored messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as potential biomarkers in liquid biopsies of patients with mCRPC treated with enzalutamide. METHODS: Forty patients were included in this prospective multicenter observational study. Whole blood was drawn at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months after start of therapy. Four mRNAs, 6 miRNAs, and 5 lncRNAs were analyzed by quantitative PCR. RNA levels in 30 healthy individuals were used as controls. RNA expression data were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses, and the primary end point was progression-free survival. Clinical factors were included in the multivariable Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Levels of 2 miRNAs, miR-375 and miR-3687, and 1 lncRNA, N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase like 2 antisense RNA 2 (NAALADL2-AS2), were more than 2-fold higher in patients with mCRPC compared with healthy volunteers. Patients with higher levels of miR-375 or miR-3687 showed a shorter time to progression. Patients with higher levels of NAALADL2-AS2 showed a longer time to progression. In the multivariable Cox regression analysis, higher miR-375, miR-3687 and serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations were shown to be independent predictors for shorter time to progression.

This study aims to understand barriers and motivators behind older adults decision on influenza vaccination. METHODS: Face to face interviews with participants aged 65 and above were conducted and audio recorded in Geylang polyclinic in Singapore. Thematic content analysis was used to organise the data. RESULTS: 15 older adults were interviewed, aged between 66 and 85 years old. 6 were vaccine refusers, 3 defaulters and 6 acceptors. A perceived lack of vulnerability, fear of side effects, and trivialisation of influenza were common reasons for not taking the vaccine. Encouragement from family and friends, travel and previous positive vaccination experiences were motivators for getting vaccinated. Healthcare workers played a role in influencing many of the participants decision-making. Common misconceptions included vaccines considered as necessary only before travel and as a cure rather than prevention. Most participants exhibited ambivalence, giving reasons both for and against vaccine uptake. DISCUSSION: Most older adults do not perceive influenza as a potentially serious disease nor trust in influenza vaccines efficacy. Misconceptions played a significant role in vaccine decline. Novel findings include the importance of the family unit in decision making, prioritization of chronic health problems over vaccination and misconception that vaccines are only needed when travelling out of country.

It is unknown whether this is due to a generalized humoral prothrombotic state or endothelial factors such as inflammation and dysfunction. The aim was to further characterize thrombin generation using a novel analyser (ST Genesia, Diagnostica Stago, Asnires, France) and a panel of haematological analytes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS Platelet poor plasma of 34 patients with noncritical COVID-19 was compared with 75 patients with critical COVID-19 (as defined by WHO criteria) in a retrospective study by calibrated automated thrombography and ELISA. Patients were matched for baseline characteristics of age and gender. RESULTS Critical patients had significantly increased fibrinogen, CRP, interleukin-6 and D-dimer compared to noncritical patients. Thrombin generation, in critical patients, was right shifted without significant differences in peak, velocity index or endogenous thrombin potential. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were significantly increased in the critical versus noncritical patients. Critically ill patients were on haemodiafiltration (31%; heparin used in the circuit) or often received escalated prophylactic low-molecular weight heparin. CONCLUSION These results confirm increased fibrinogen and D-dimer in critical COVID-19-infected patients. Importantly, disease severity did not increase thrombin generation (including thrombin-antithrombin complexes and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2) when comparing both cohorts; counter-intuitively critical patients were hypocoaguable. tPA, TFPI and VEGF were increased in critical patients, which are hypothesized to reflect endothelial dysfunction and/or contribution of heparin (which may cause endothelial TFPI/tPA release).","output":"Evaluation of COVID-19 coagulopathy; laboratory characterization using thrombin generation and nonconventional haemostasis assays."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Gaps in current evidence and guidance leave clinicians with unanswered questions on the use of cladribine tablets for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular relating to COVID-19 vaccination.

Results There were 365080 in the cohort with at least one detected SARS-CoV-2 infection during follow-up and 1074 who developed T1DM. The rate ratio for incident T1DM associated with first positive test for SARS-CoV-2 (with no previous infection as reference category) was 0.88 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.23) for infection more than 30 days earlier and 2.62 (95% CI 1.81 to 3.79) for infection in the previous 30 days.

As most of the countries relying on different preventive actions to control the outcomes of COVID-19, it is necessary to boost the knowledge about the effectiveness of such actions so that the policymakers take their country-based appropriate actions. This study generates evidence of taking the most impactful actions to combat COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: In order to generate community-based scientific evidence, this study analyzed the outcome of COVID-19 in response to different control measures, healthcare facilities, life expectancy, and prevalent diseases. METHODS: It used more than a hundred countries' data collected from different databases. We performed a comparative graphical analysis with non-linear correlation estimation using R. RESULTS: The reduction of COVID-19 cases is strongly correlated with the earliness of preventive initiation. The apathy of taking nationwide immediate precaution measures has been identified as one of the critical reasons to make the circumstances worse. There is significant non-linear relationship between COVID-19 case fatality and number of physicians (NCC = 0.22; p-value &#8804; 0.001), nurses and midwives (NCC = 0.17; p-value &#8804; 0.001), hospital beds (NCC = 0.20; p-value &#8804; 0.001), life expectancy of both sexes (NCC = 0.22; p-value &#8804; 0.001), life expectancy of female (NCC = 0.27; p-value &#8804; 0.001), and life expectancy of male (NCC = 0.19; p-value &#8804; 0.001). COVID-19 deaths were found to be reduced with increased medical personnel and hospital beds. Interestingly, no association between the comorbidities and severity of COVID-19 was found excluding asthma, cancer, Alzheimer's, and smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing healthcare facilities and early imposing the control measures could be valuable to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic. No association between COVID-19 and other comorbidities warranted further investigation at the pathobiological level.","output":"A Non-Linear Biostatistical Graphical Modeling of Preventive Actions and Healthcare Factors in Controlling COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is challenging health care systems worldwide, raising the question of reducing the transplant program due to the shortage of intensive care unit beds and to the risk of infection in donors and recipients.

Based on this study, various public service messages can be disseminated, and necessary steps can be taken to manage the scourge. There has already been a lot of work conducted in several languages, but little has been conducted on Arabic tweets. The primary goal of this study is to analyze Arabic tweets about COVID-19 and extract people's impressions of different locations. This analysis will provide some insights into understanding public mood variation on Twitter, which could be useful for governments to identify the effect of COVID-19 over space and make decisions based on that understanding. To achieve that, two strategies are used to analyze people's impressions from Twitter: machine learning approach and the deep learning approach. To conduct this study, we scraped Arabic tweets up with 12,000 tweets that were manually labeled and classify them as positive, neutral or negative feelings. Specialising in Saudi Arabia, the collected dataset consists of 2174 positive tweets and 2879 negative tweets. First, TF-IDF feature vectors are used for feature representation. Then, several models are implemented to identify people's impression over time using Twitter Geo-tag information.

The results show that firms with less net fixed assets hire more workers, particularly for firms with tighter financial constraints, higher labor intensity and those located in cities with stricter law enforcement, greater fiscal pressure and lower bank density. Further analysis shows that liquid assets help firms obtain more debt, save less cash, decrease the cash flow sensitivity of cash and investment and invest more in fixed assets, consistent with the collateral channel. In addition, a significant convergence of labor productivity across firms illustrates that the Property Law also has a labor reallocation effect.

To better understand this climate change and sustainable development goals (SDGs) funding dilemma, there needs to be greater clarity around four climate change investment and finance-related questions that are frequently absent or inadequately addressed in the academic and policy literature. Firstly, what are or should be the boundaries of climate change investment and finance when the problem of climate change becomes impossible to separate from biodiversity, land use management, and other dilemmas related to the broader SDGs? Secondly, how we should define and what constitutes adequate financial resources to address the climate change and SDGs dilemmas on the global level? Thirdly, why is it important to close the gap between climate change adaptation and mitigation funding levels? Finally, what role should the private sector and business actors play in terms of climate change investment and finance issues? In addition to achieving greater clarity around these four issue areas, I argue in this article that three questions are likely to shape the future success (or failure) of the global climate change investment and finance architecture.

Anxiety, depression, QOL and PA were compared between PLY and DNP using least squares means from linear models adjusted for age, gender, and instruction type. Mediation analysis assessed whether the relationship between sport status and anxiety, depression, and QOL was mediated by PA. 171 athletes had returned to play, while 388 had not. PLY athletes had significantly lower anxiety (3.60.4 v 8.20.6, p<0.001) and depression (4.20.4 v 7.30.6, p<0.001), and significantly higher QOL (88.11.0 v 80.21.4, p<0.001) and PA (24.00.5 v 16.30.7, p<0.001).

To provide evidence-informed and practical guidance to maintain QCs at local and policy levels. DESIGN: A theory-driven mixed method. SETTING: Primary healthcare. METHOD: We collected data in four stages to develop and refine the programme theory of QCs: (1) coinquiry with Swiss and European expert stakeholders to develop a preliminary programme theory; (2) realist review with systematic searches in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINHAL (1980C2020) to inform the preliminary programme theory; (3) programme refinement through interviews with participants, facilitators, tutors and managers of QCs and (4) consolidation of theory through interviews with QC experts across Europe and examining existing theories. SOURCES OF DATA: The coinquiry comprised 4 interviews and 3 focus groups with 50 European experts. From the literature search, we included 108 papers to develop the literature-based programme theory. In stage 3, we used data from 40 participants gathered in 6 interviews and 2 focus groups to refine the programme theory.

DESIGN Health impact assessment (excess annual mortality and financial costs) based upon atmospheric PM2.5 measurements. SETTING Armidale, a regional Australian city (population, 24 504) with high levels of air pollution in winter caused by domestic wood heaters, 1 May 2018 - 30 April 2019. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Estimated population exposure to PM2.5 from wood heaters; estimated numbers of premature deaths and years of life lost. RESULTS Fourteen premature deaths (95% CI, 12-17 deaths) per year, corresponding to 210 (95% CI, 172-249) years of life lost, are attributable to long term exposure to wood heater PM2.5 pollution in Armidale. The estimated financial cost is $32.8 million (95% CI, $27.0-38.5 million), or $10 930 (95% CI, $9004-12 822) per wood heater per year. CONCLUSIONS The substantial mortality and financial cost attributable to wood heating in Armidale indicates that effective policies are needed to reduce wood heater pollution, including public education about the effects of wood smoke on health, subsidies that encourage residents to switch to less polluting home heating (perhaps as part of an economic recovery package), assistance for those affected by wood smoke from other people, and regulations that reduce wood heater use (eg, by not permitting new wood heaters and requiring existing units to be removed when houses are sold).","output":"The effects on mortality and the associated financial costs of wood heater pollution in a regional Australian city."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which has affected over 100 countries in a short while, progresses more mortally in elderly patients with comorbidities. In this study, we examined the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of the patients aged 60 and over who had been infected with COVID-19. METHODS: The data of the patients admitted to the hospital within 1 month from May 8, 2020 onwards and hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia were obtained from the hospital medical records, and the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory parameters of the patients during the admission to the emergency department were examined. Patients were divided into 2 groups regarding the criteria of having in-hospital mortality (mortality group) and being discharged with full recovery (survivor group). The factors, which could have an impact on the mortality, were investigated using a univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: This retrospective study included 113 patients aged 60 years and older, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The mean age of the patients was 70.7  7.9, and 64.6% (n = 73) of them were male. The mortality rate was 19.4% (n = 22). Among the comorbid illnesses, only renal failure was significant in the mortality group (p = 0.04). A CURB-65score &#8805;3 or pneumonia severity index (PSI) class &#8805;4 manifested a remarkable discrimination ability to predict 30-day mortality (p < 0.001). When the laboratory parameters were considered, the value of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was significant in predicting mortality in univariate and multivariate analysis (odds ratio [OR] = 1.11; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.03-1.21; p = 0.006, and OR = 1.51; 95% CI, 1.11-2.39; p = 0.044, respectively). CONCLUSION: In our study, NLR was determined to be an independent marker to predict in-hospital mortality among patients with COVID-19. PSI and CURB-65 revealed a considerably precise prognostic accuracy for the patients with COVID-19 in our study as well. Moreover, thanks to that NLR results in a very short time, it can enable the clinician to predict mortality before the scoring systems are calculated and hasten the management of the patients in the chaotic environment of the emergency room.","output":"Clinical Features of the 60 Years and Older Patients Infected with 2019 Novel Coronavirus: Can We Predict Mortality Earlier?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aim: The COVID-19 pandemic is capable of severely affecting the mental health of health care workers, who are at the forefront of this crisis;while the official staff of health organizations is facing the same danger.

Similarities and differences across the types of studies were examined. RESULTS: Research priorities informed by consumers were primarily concerned with producing better interventions and outcomes. A large degree of overlap with researcher-led priorities was present. The former studies had a greater focus on early intervention, bridging the research-practice gap, and recovery, while the latter were more likely to address diagnosis, genetic factors, brain circuitry, and pharmacotherapy.

Governments are racing to contain and stop the Coronavirus from reaching an epidemic/pandemic status. This research presents a way in tracking such a virus or any contagious germ capable of transferring through air specifically where such a transfer can be assisted by a mechanical room ventilation system. Tracking the spread of such a virus is a complicated process, as they can exist in a variety of forms, shapes, sizes, and can change with time. However, a beginning has to be made at some point. Assumptions had to be made based on published scientific data, and standards. The tracking of airborne viruses was carried out on the following assumption (for illustrative purposes); one person with one sneeze in a period of 600 s. The presence of viruses was tracked with curves plotted indicating how long it could take to remove the sneezed viruses from the mechanically ventilated room space. Results gave an indication of what time span is required to remove airborne viruses. Thus, we propose the following: (a) utilizing CFD software as a possible tool in optimizing a mechanical ventilation system in removing contagious viruses. This will track the dispersion of viruses and their removal. The numerical solution revealed that with one typical adult human sneeze, it can take approximately 640 s to reduce an average sneeze of 20,000 droplets to a fifth; (b) upscaling the status of human comfort to a \\"must have\\"with regards to the 50% relative humidity, and the use of Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) air disinfection in an epidemic/pandemic condition. A recommendation can be presented to the local authorities of jurisdiction in enforcing the above proposals partially/fully as seen fit as \\"prevention is better than cure\\". This will preclude the spread of highly infectious viruses in mechanically ventilated buildings.","output":"Tracking the Flu Virus in a Room Mechanical Ventilation Using CFD Tools and Effective Disinfection of an HVAC System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the role of rapid serological tests in the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 16 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and 58 COVID-19 negative patients at a medical center in Taiwan over a 3-month period. Serial serum samples were collected and tested for antibody response using four point-of-care (POC) lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA) (ALLTEST 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test, Dynamiker 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test, ASK COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test, and Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test). Time-dependent detection sensitivity and timeliness of seroconversion were determined and compared between the four POC rapid tests. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity and specificity of the four tests for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after 3 weeks of symptom onset were 100% and 100%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the rapid tests used for detection of IgM and IgG separately and those used for detection of combined total antibody (mainly IgM/IgG). There was no significant difference between the four POC rapid tests in terms of time required for determining seroconversion of COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 with pneumonia demonstrated shorter seroconversion time than those without pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Though the POC antibody rapid tests based on LFIA showed reliable performance in the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, the results of these tests should be interpreted and applied appropriately in the context of antibody dynamic of COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 patients complicated with pneumonia exhibited earlier anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response than COVID-19 patients without pneumonia.","output":"Four point-of-care lateral flow immunoassays for diagnosis of COVID-19 and for assessing dynamics of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The purpose of this study was to evaluate the technical feasibility and other advantages of closing the appendicular stump with a polymeric clip in laparoscopic appendectomy (LA).

METHODOLOGY: Distributions of incubation period and serial interval of Jiangxi epidemic data were fitted by \\"fitdistrplus\\" package of R software, and the meta-analysis was conducted by \\"meta\\" package of R software. RESULTS: Based on the epidemic data of Jiangxi, we found the median days of incubation period and serial interval were 5.9 days [IQR: 3.8 - 8.6] and 5.7 days [IQR: 3.6 - 8.3], respectively. The median days of the infectivity period at pre-symptomatic was 1.7 days [IQR: 1.1 - 2.4]. The meta-analysis based on 64 papers showed the pooled means of the incubation period and serial interval were 6.25 days (95% CrI: 5.75 - 6.75) and 5.15 days (95% CrI: 4.73 - 5.57), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results contribute to a better understanding of COVID-19 and provide useful parameters for modelling the dynamics of disease transmission.

In this study, we explored whether tensional homeostasis emerges from the behavior of the individual focal adhesion (FA), which is the subcellular structure that transmits cell stress to the surrounding extracellular matrix. Past studies have suggested that cell contractility builds up until a certain displacement is achieved, and we thus hypothesized that tensional homeostasis may require a threshold level of substrate displacement. Micropattern traction microscopy was used to study a wide range of FA traction forces generated by bovine vascular smooth muscle cells and bovine aortic endothelial cells cultured on substrates of stiffness of 3.6, 6.7, 13.6, and 30 kPa. The most striking feature of FA dynamics observed here is that the substrate displacement resulting from FA traction forces is a unifying feature that determines FA tensional stability. Beyond approximately 1 m of substrate displacement, FAs, regardless of cell type or substrate stiffness, exhibit a precipitous drop in temporal fluctuations of traction forces. These findings lead us to the conclusion that traction force dynamics collectively determine whether cells or cell ensembles develop tensional homeostasis, and this insight is necessary to fully understand how matrix stiffness impacts cellular behavior in healthy conditions and, more important, in pathological conditions such as cancer or vascular aging, where environmental stiffness is altered.","output":"Focal adhesion displacement magnitude is a unifying feature of tensional homeostasis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous studies have revealed medical, democratic, and political factors altering responses to unexpected infectious diseases. However, few studies have attempted to explore the factors affecting disease infection from a social perspective. Here, we argue that trust, which plays an important role in shaping people' s risk perception toward hazards, can also affect risk perception toward infections from a social perspective. Drawing on the indication that risk perception of diseases helps prevent people from being infected by promoting responsible behaviors, it can be further asserted that trust may alter the infection rate of diseases as a result of risk perception toward infectious diseases. This is an essential point for preventing the spread of infectious diseases and should be demonstrated. To empirically test this prediction, this study uses the COVID-19 outbreak in China as an example and applies an original dataset combining real-time big data, official data, and social survey data from 317 cities in 31 Chinese provinces to demonstrate whether trust influences the infection rate of diseases. Multilevel regression analyses reveal three main results: (1) trust in local government and media helps to reduce the infection rate of diseases; (2) generalized trust promotes a higher rather than lower infection rate; and (3) the effects of different types of trust are either completely or partly mediated by risk perception toward diseases. The theoretical and practical implications of this study provide suggestions for improving the public health system in response to possible infectious diseases.","output":"Trust, risk perception, and COVID-19 infections: Evidence from multilevel analyses of combined original dataset in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVES: This study has analyzed 150 consecutive cases of treatment of hydrocephalus by ventriculoperitoneal shunt in the Faculty of Medicine of Ribeir?o Preto's Hospital between May 1997 and July 2000, in order to stablish the main characteristics of the patients and proceedings , in particular the etiologies, diagnosis, complications, final outcome and associated factors.

This was the basis for the GERIATRICS and e-Technology (GER-e-TEC) study, which was an experiment involving the use of the smart MyPredi? e-platform to automatically detect the exacerbation of geriatric syndromes. Methods: The MyPredi? platform is connected to a medical analysis system that receives physiological data from medical sensors in real time and analyzes this data to generate (when necessary) alerts. These alerts are issued in the event that the health of a patient deteriorates due to an exacerbation of their chronic diseases. An experiment was conducted between 24 September 2019 and 24 November 2019 to test this alert system. During this time, the platform was used on patients being monitored in an internal medicine unit at the University Hospital of Strasbourg. The alerts were compiled and analyzed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values with respect to clinical data. The results of the experiment are provided below. Results: A total of 36 patients were monitored remotely, 21 of whom were male. The mean age of the patients was 81.4 years. The patients used the telemedicine solution for an average of 22.1 days. The telemedicine solution took a total of 147,703 measurements while monitoring the geriatric risks of the entire patient group. An average of 226 measurements were taken per patient per day. The telemedicine solution generated a total of 1611 alerts while assessing the geriatric risks of the entire patient group. For each geriatric risk, an average of 45 alerts were emitted per patient, with 16 of these alerts classified as low, 12 classified as medium, and 20 classified as critical. In terms of sensitivity, the results were 100% for all geriatric risks and extremely satisfactory in terms of positive and negative predictive values. In terms of survival analysis, the number of alerts had an impact on the duration of hospitalization due to decompensated heart failure, a deterioration in the general condition, and other reasons. Conclusion: The MyPredi? telemedicine system allows the generation of automatic, non-intrusive alerts when the health of a patient deteriorates due to risks associated with geriatric syndromes.","output":"Results of the GER-e-TEC Experiment Involving the Use of an Automated Platform to Detect the Exacerbation of Geriatric Syndromes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted every corner of earth, disrupting governments and leading to socioeconomic instability.

The Sarah Cannon Blood Cancer Network (SCBCN) comprises six Healthcare Corporation of America hospitals that have been certified based upon defined metrics of infrastructure, staffing, processes and volume. The SCBCN actively coordinated a response by integrating information from the framework of federal, state, network, hospital and individual transplant programs. Dynamic standards were developed taking into account operational aspects (such as PPE conservation, staffing, isolation policy, etc.), external regulations, and input from professional societies in order to balance the needs for life-saving therapy while reducing the likelihood of adverse consequences. In this study, we describe the impact of the Covid-19 across our network on transplant and cell therapy activity as well as the outcomes of the patients who were treated. Methods Data was integrated from electronic health records and a center survey questionnaire. The period of observation (defined as Covid era) was from March 15, 2020 to June 15th, 2020 to allow sufficient time for analysis of early outcomes. Transplant and cell therapy data from the prior 12 months was used as a comparator. Results: Within the SCBCN there was a decrease in overall transplant and cell therapy activity in the Covid era. Autologous transplantation was mainly diminished, particularly in the first 2 months. There was no significant impact on allogeneic or CAR-T therapy volumes. For allogeneic transplantation, there was a modest reduction in marrow grafts (11% to 8%) and a significant increase in cryopreservation (16% to 79%, P<0.001). The time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment in the Covid era were similar to those in the prior year. Day +30 survival in the Covid era for allogeneic, autologous, and CAR-T therapy were 95%, 99% and 100%, respectively. Including historically transplanted patients, centers reported a total of 22 patients who contracted proven Covid19, at a median duration of 4 years (range 3-2634 days) post infusion. There were 9-auto, 12-allo, and 1-CAR-T recipients, and two died. Of the two deaths, one 70-year old recipient died from Covid19 after first testing positive at day+3 after autologous transplantation, and another 68-year old recipient tested positive at day+464 after autologous transplantation but died with refractory lymphoma. Conclusions: We describe a deliberate and coordinated reduction in transplant and cell therapy activity across our network compared to the prior year. For those patients who were selectively transplanted during the Covid19 pandemic, outcomes were not impaired. Our analysis will be updated at the time of presentation with data covering the Covid era from July-Oct '20.

Especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, high vaccination coverage should be attained. This review analyzed strategies to increase influenza vaccination coverage in healthcare workers. METHODS: A literature search using PubMed was conducted and 32 publications on influenza vaccination campaigns for healthcare workers were reviewed for key interventions and resulting vaccination coverage. RESULTS: Among key interventions analyzed, mandatory vaccination policies or multifaceted campaigns including a vaccinate-or-wear-a-mask policy as well as mandatory declination reached vaccination coverage in healthcare workers of over 90%. Although campaigns solely based on education and promotion or on-site-vaccination did not regularly exceed an absolute vaccination coverage of 40%, a substantial relative increase in vaccination coverage was reached by implementation of these strategies. CONCLUSION: Mandatory vaccination policies are effective measures to achieve high overall vaccination coverage. In clinics where policies are infeasible, multifaceted campaigns comprising on-site vaccination, vaccination stands and educational and promotional campaigns as well as incentives should be implemented. Lessons learned from influenza campaigns could be implemented in future SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns.","output":"Increasing influenza vaccination coverage in healthcare workers: a review on campaign strategies and their effect"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has emerged as one of the most disquieting worldwide public health emergencies of the 21st century and has thrown into sharp relief, among other factors, the dire need for robust forecasting techniques for disease detection, alleviation as well as prevention. Forecasting has been one of the most powerful statistical methods employed the world over in various disciplines for detecting and analyzing trends and predicting future outcomes based on which timely and mitigating actions can be undertaken. To that end, several statistical methods and machine learning techniques have been harnessed depending upon the analysis desired and the availability of data. Historically speaking, most predictions thus arrived at have been short term and country-specific in nature. In this work, multimodel machine learning technique is called EAMA for forecasting Covid-19 related parameters in the long-term both within India and on a global scale have been proposed. This proposed EAMA hybrid model is well-suited to predictions based on past and present data. For this study, two datasets from the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare of India and Worldometers, respectively, have been exploited.

Companies need to make further efforts and investments to improve their supply chain resilience (SCR) in becoming more prepared to minimise disruption risks. Sourcing is one of the main, strategic, key factors towards SC resilience. Also, organisations require resiliency in demand fulfilment to handle volatile marketplaces. This paper presents a methodology towards SCR to both supply and demand variations motivated by a real case study of a manufacturing company that works to improve its SC resilience. To this end, a hybrid integrated multi-attribute decision making-possibilistic bi-objective programming model (MADM-PBOPM) was developed. First, a new framework presenting pillars to assess suppliers resilience was developed based on a thorough literature review and decision makers input. Then, a DEMATEL-TOPSIS approach was proposed to quantify existing suppliers resilience and assess its performance. It also helped in categorising resilience pillars (RPs) as causes and effects. Thereafter, the obtained weights of suppliers and pillars were integrated into the developed PBOPM. The latter helps the purchasing team to (1) order materials from suppliers based on their resilience and performance efficiency;and (2) elevate the companys resiliency to uncertain demands fulfilment. Therefore, the developed methodology can potentially be used by the purchasing teams to build up SCs that are resilient to supply disruption and demand uncertainty. This MADM-PBOPM model was validated as part of the case study investigation. Furthermore, the suppliers assessment output was validated by using two sensitivity analysis approaches including criteria weight variation and other MADM approaches.","output":"Conceptualising a supply and demand resilience methodology: A hybrid DEMATEL-TOPSIS-possibilistic multi-objective optimization approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 is a public health emergency of international concern whose detection in recovered asymptomatic patients is dependent on accurate diagnosis as it enables the estimation of the susceptibility of the population to the infection. This demand has resulted in the development of several commercial assays employing recombinant proteins, but the results of these assays are not reliable as they do not involve comparison with natural viral antigens. We independently used the SARS-CoV-2 whole viral antigen (WVA) and recombinant nucleocapsid protein (rNP) to develop in-house ELISAs for IgG detection; the results of these ELISAs were then compared to obtain reliable results. METHODS: WVA and rNP ELISAs were performed on COVID-19 negative sera from patients before the pandemic in Brazil, and on RT-qPCR-positive or SARS-CoV-2-IgG against rNP and IgG against WVA-positive samples from recently infected patients in Sao Paulo, Brazil. RESULTS: Both ELISAs detected a large fraction of infected patients but exhibited certain drawbacks. Higher signals and lower numbers of false-negatives were observed in rNP ELISA; however, a higher fraction of false-positives was observed in control groups. A high number of false-negatives was observed with WVA ELISA. Correlating the results of rNP and WVA ELISAs resulted in improved performance for COVID-19 diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The choice of antigen is an important aspect in optimizing the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19. The use of rNP ELISA for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies seems promising, but comparison of the results with those of WVA ELISA is crucial for accurate test development prior to commercialization. IgG serology using several assays, and with the spectral patterns of SARS-CoV-2, resulted in confusing information that must be clarified before the establishment of diagnostic serology criteria.","output":"Natural versus Recombinant Viral Antigens in SARS-CoV-2 Serology: Challenges in Optimizing Laboratory Diagnosis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An efficient algorithm that can properly identify the targets to immunize or quarantine for preventing an epidemic in a population without knowing the global structural information is of obvious importance.

Applying the algorithm to simulated networks and empirical networks constructed from social network data of five US universities, we show that the algorithm is more effective than other existing local algorithms for a given immunization coverage, with a reduced final epidemic ratio, lower peak prevalence and fewer nodes that need to be visited before identifying the target nodes. The effectiveness stems from the breaking up of community networks by successful searches on target nodes with more weak ties.

METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, adaptive platform trial involving symptomatic SARS-CoV-2Cpositive adults recruited from 12 public health clinics in Brazil. Patients who had had symptoms of Covid-19 for up to 7 days and had at least one risk factor for disease progression were randomly assigned to receive ivermectin (400 g per kilogram of body weight) once daily for 3 days or placebo. (The trial also involved other interventions that are not reported here.) The primary composite outcome was hospitalization due to Covid-19 within 28 days after randomization or an emergency department visit due to clinical worsening of Covid-19 (defined as the participant remaining under observation for >6 hours) within 28 days after randomization. RESULTS: A total of 3515 patients were randomly assigned to receive ivermectin (679 patients), placebo (679), or another intervention (2157). Overall, 100 patients (14.7%) in the ivermectin group had a primary-outcome event, as compared with 111 (16.3%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.90; 95% Bayesian credible interval, 0.70 to 1.16). Of the 211 primary-outcome events, 171 (81.0%) were hospital admissions. Findings were similar to the primary analysis in a modified intention-to-treat analysis that included only patients who received at least one dose of ivermectin or placebo (relative risk, 0.89; 95% Bayesian credible interval, 0.69 to 1.15) and in a per-protocol analysis that included only patients who reported 100% adherence to the assigned regimen (relative risk, 0.94; 95% Bayesian credible interval, 0.67 to 1.35). There were no significant effects of ivermectin use on secondary outcomes or adverse events.

Various membrane proteins are present in Plasmodium falciparum, the principal malaria pathogen. Among them, P. falciparum reticulocyte-binding protein homolog 5 (PfRh5) is indispensable for erythrocyte invasion, and has become a promising vaccine target. Basigin (CD147, EMMPRIN) has been identified as the erythrocyte receptor of PfRh5, and shown to be essential for the invasion of multiple strains of the pathogen. AREAS COVERED Fundamental information on basigin is fully described, including structure as a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and function based on its interactions with external molecules and with proteins within the same membrane. The involvement of basigin in many diseases such as cancer and inflammatory diseases is also described, the implication being that anti-basigin therapy might be helpful to treat certain illnesses. Finally, PfRh5 as a vaccine candidate is covered, and its interaction with basigin is evaluated.

METHODS: This study is a retrospective, population-based cohort study using national statistics throughout Italy. Survival analysis was applied to data aggregated by day of death, age groups, sex, and Italian administrative units (107 provinces). We applied Cox models to estimate the relative hazards (RH) of excess mortality, comparing all-cause deaths in 2020 with the expected deaths from all causes in the same time period. The RH of excess deaths was estimated in areas with a high, moderate, and low spread of COVID-19. We reported the estimate also restricting the analysis to the period of March-April 2020 (first peak of the epidemic). RESULTS: The study population consisted of 57,204,501 individuals living in Italy as of January 1, 2020. The number of excess deaths was 36,445, which accounts for 13.4% of excess mortalities from all causes during January-May 2020 (i.e., RH = 1.134; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.129-1.140). In the macro-area with a relatively higher spread of COVID-19 (i.e., incidence rate, IR): 450-1,610 cases per 100,000 residents), the RH of excess deaths was 1.375 (95% CI: 1.364-1.386). In the area with a relatively moderate spread of COVID-19 (i.e., IR: 150-449 cases) it was 1.049 (95% CI: 1.038-1.060). In the area with a relatively lower spread of COVID-19 (i.e., IR: 30-149 cases), it was 0.967 (95% CI: 0.959-0.976). Between March and April (peak months of the first wave of the epidemic in Italy), we estimated an excess mortality from all causes of 43.5%. The RH of all-cause mortality for increments of 500 cases per 100,000 residents was 1.352 (95% CI: 1.346-1.359), corresponding to an increase of about 35%.

Finally, we showed that plasma acetate levels were positively correlated with intrarenal angiotensin II protein expression (r = 0.969, P < 0.001). In conclusion, excessive acetate produced by disturbed gut microbiota might be involved in the kidney injuries of early DN through activating intrarenal RAS.","output":"Gut microbiota dysbiosis-induced activation of the intrarenal reninCangiotensin system is involved in kidney injuries in rat diabetic nephropathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, is now causing a tremendous global health concern. Since its first appearance in December 2019, the outbreak has already caused over 5.8 million infections worldwide (till 29 May 2020), with more than 0.35 million deaths. Early virus-mediated immune suppression is believed to be one of the unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and contributes at least partially to the viral pathogenesis. In this study, we identified the key viral interferon antagonists of SARS-CoV-2 and compared them with two well-characterized SARS-CoV interferon antagonists, PLpro and orf6. Here we demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 nsp13, nsp14, nsp15 and orf6, but not the unique orf8, could potently suppress primary interferon production and interferon signalling. Although SARS-CoV PLpro has been well-characterized for its potent interferon-antagonizing, deubiquitinase and protease activities, SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, despite sharing high amino acid sequence similarity with SARS-CoV, loses both interferon-antagonising and deubiquitinase activities. Among the 27 viral proteins, SARS-CoV-2 orf6 demonstrated the strongest suppression on both primary interferon production and interferon signalling. Orf6-deleted SARS-CoV-2 may be considered for the development of intranasal live-but-attenuated vaccine against COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 nsp13, nsp14, nsp15 and orf6 function as potent interferon antagonists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Metabolic health of urban Ugandans, mostly women, has increasingly become sub-optimal. As women are strategic for family behavioral change and do not meet WHO recommendations regarding dietary and physical activity (PA), there is an urgent need for science-based interventions to tackle unhealthy dietary and PA behaviors. OBJECTIVE: To develop a food literacy and PA promotion intervention to optimise metabolic health among women of reproductive age in urban Uganda. METHODOLOGY: Steps 1- 6 of the Intervention Mapping protocol were used to design the intervention. RESULTS: Notable determinants from Step 1 were health/beauty paradox, nonfactual nutrition information, socio-cultural misconceptions around moderate PA, fruits, and vegetables. Others included gaps in food/PA knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy. We hypothesised that changing the overall existing behaviours in one intervention may meet strong resistance. Thus, we decided to go for gradual stepwise changes. Hence in step 2, three behavioural intervention objectives were formulated; (1) women evaluate the accuracy of nutrition and PA information., (2) engage in moderate intensity PA for at least 150 min a week, and (3) consume at least one portion of vegetables and one portion of fruit every day. Based on the food literacy model, intervention objectives were formulated into performance objectives and matrices of change objectives. In step 3 a combination of eleven behavioural change techniques were selected and translated into practical strategies to effect changes in determinants. In step 4, intervention components and materials were developed. The intervention consists of five interactive group sessions, 150 min each. Infographics on benefits/recommendations, vegetable recipes, and practical tips to eat more fruits, vegetables, and to engage more in PA are included. Personalised goals and action plans tailored to personal metabolic health and lifestyle needs, and environmental opportunities form the basis of the intervention. A randomized controlled trial is being conducted to evaluate the intervention (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04635332). CONCLUSIONS: The intervention is novel, based on a holistic food literacy model. The intervention is built on determinants specific to urban Uganda, evidence based behavioural change theoretical models and techniques, detailing the hypothesised behavioural change mechanism. If effective, an evidence-based intervention will become available for reference in urban Uganda.

With a sample of 30,383 students from 62 countries, the study reveals that amid the worldwide lockdown and transition to online learning students were most satisfied with the support provided by teaching staff and their universities public relations. Still, deficient computer skills and the perception of a higher workload prevented them from perceiving their own improved performance in the new teaching environment. Students were mainly concerned about issues to do with their future professional career and studies, and experienced boredom, anxiety, and frustration. The pandemic has led to the adoption of particular hygienic behaviours (e.g., wearing masks, washing hands) and discouraged certain daily practices (e.g., leaving home, shaking hands). Students were also more satisfied with the role played by hospitals and universities during the epidemic compared to the governments and banks. The findings also show that students with certain socio-demographic characteristics (male, part-time, first-level, applied sciences, a lower living standard, from Africa or Asia) were significantly less satisfied with their academic work/life during the crisis, whereas female, full-time, first-level students and students faced with financial problems were generally affected more by the pandemic in terms of their emotional life and personal circumstances. Key factors influencing students satisfaction with the role of their university are also identified.

The Special Report discusses the challenges of providing equitable health care for people with dementia in the United States. An estimated 6.2 million Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's dementia today. This number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060 barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent, slow or cure AD. Official death certificates recorded 121,499 deaths from AD in 2019, the latest year for which data are available, making Alzheimer's the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth-leading cause of death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2019, deaths from stroke, heart disease and HIV decreased, whereas reported deaths from AD increased more than 145%. This trajectory of deaths from AD was likely exacerbated in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 11 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 15.3 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2020. These figures reflect a decline in the number of caregivers compared with a decade earlier, as well as an increase in the amount of care provided by each remaining caregiver. Unpaid dementia caregiving was valued at $256.7 billion in 2020. Its costs, however, extend to family caregivers' increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes - costs that have been aggravated by COVID-19. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are more than three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 23 times as great. Total payments in 2021 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be $355 billion. Despite years of efforts to make health care more equitable in the United States, racial and ethnic disparities remain - both in terms of health disparities, which involve differences in the burden of illness, and health care disparities, which involve differences in the ability to use health care services. Blacks, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Native Americans continue to have a higher burden of illness and lower access to health care compared with Whites. Such disparities, which have become more apparent during COVID-19, extend to dementia care. Surveys commissioned by the Alzheimer's Association recently shed new light on the role of discrimination in dementia care, the varying levels of trust between racial and ethnic groups in medical research, and the differences between groups in their levels of concern about and awareness of Alzheimer's disease. These findings emphasize the need to increase racial and ethnic diversity in both the dementia care workforce and in Alzheimer's clinical trials.","output":"2021 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant of concern (VOC) almost completely replaced other variants in South Africa during November 2021, and was associated with a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases. We aimed to assess clinical severity of individuals infected with Omicron, using S Gene Target Failure (SGTF) on the Thermo Fisher Scientific TaqPath COVID-19 PCR test as a proxy. Methods We performed data linkages for (i) SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests, (ii) COVID-19 case data, (iii) genome data, and (iv) the DATCOV national hospital surveillance system for the whole of South Africa. For cases identified using Thermo Fisher TaqPath COVID-19 PCR, infections were designated as SGTF or non-SGTF. Disease severity was assessed using multivariable logistic regression models comparing SGTF-infected individuals diagnosed between 1 October to 30 November to (i) non-SGTF in the same period, and (ii) Delta infections diagnosed between April and November 2021. Results From 1 October through 6 December 2021, 161,328 COVID-19 cases were reported nationally; 38,282 were tested using TaqPath PCR and 29,721 SGTF infections were identified. The proportion of SGTF infections increased from 3% in early October (week 39) to 98% in early December (week 48). On multivariable analysis, after controlling for factors associated with hospitalisation, individuals with SGTF infection had lower odds of being admitted to hospital compared to non-SGTF infections (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1-0.3). Among hospitalised individuals, after controlling for factors associated with severe disease, the odds of severe disease did not differ between SGTF-infected individuals compared to non-SGTF individuals diagnosed during the same time period (aOR 0.7, 95% CI 0.3-1.4). Compared to earlier Delta infections, after controlling for factors associated with severe disease, SGTF-infected individuals had a lower odds of severe disease (aOR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.6). Conclusion Early analyses suggest a reduced risk of hospitalisation among SGTF-infected individuals when compared to non-SGTF infected individuals in the same time period, and a reduced risk of severe disease when compared to earlier Delta-infected individuals.

The aim of this study is to generate an exploratory review of healthcare policies published during COVID-19 by health-care institutions in Mexico. Analyzing policies within different health sub-systems becomes imperative in the Mexican case due to the longstanding fragmentation of the health-care system and health inequalities. DATA AND METHODS: Policies purposely included in the analysis were published by four public health institutions (IMSS, ISSSTE, SSA and PEMEX) during the COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico (from February 29th to June 15th, 2020) on official institutional websites. Researchers reviewed each document and classified them into seven policy categories set by the Rapid Research Evaluation and Appraisal Lab (RREAL): public health response, health-care delivery, human resources, health-system infrastructure and supplies, clinical response, health-care management, and epidemiological surveillance. RESULTS: Policy types varied by health institution. The largest number of policies were aimed at public health responses followed by health-care delivery and human resources. Policies were mainly published during the community transmission phase.

Methods: The Box-Jenkins methodology was used to develop predictive models and GeoDa software was used to perform spatial autocorrelation. Results: Between 1982 and 2019, the notification rate per 100,000 population of smear-positive pulmonary TB (SPPTB) has dropped 62.2%, while that of extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) has risen 91.3%. For the last decade, the mean detection rate of PTB was 82.6%. At around, 2% of PTB cases were yearly reported in children under 15 years old, a peak in notification rate was observed in the elderly aged 65 and over, and the sex ratio was in favor of men. Between 52% and 59% of EPTB cases were lymphadenitis TB and between 15% and 23% were pleural TB. About two-third of EPTB cases were females and around 10% were children under the age of 15.

However, it has only been tested among Taiwanese, mainland Chinese, and Ghanaian populations (Chen et al, 2021;Fan et al, 2021;Yeh et al, 2021). Therefore, the present study examined the construct validity and measurement invariance of the MoVac-COVID19S among individuals from five countries (ie, Taiwan, mainland China, India, Ghana, and Afghanistan). Participants and Methods A cross-sectional survey study recruited 6053 participants across five countries who completed the survey between January and March 2021. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) fit indices were used to examine factor structure and measurement invariance across the five countries. Results The fit indices of the CFA were relatively good across the countries except for the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). Moreover, the four-factor structure (either nine or 12 items) had a better fit than the one-factor structure. However, the four-factor model using nine MoVac-COVID19S items was the only model that had measurement invariance support for both factor loadings and item intercepts across the five countries.

The aim of this paper is to evaluate the performances of a rapid immunochromatography test for IgG and IgM antibodies, comparing them with an immunochemiluminescence method. Methods: we analyzed 357 sera for the presence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins S1/S2 with an automated immunochemiluminescent test (DiaSorin?) and the presence of IgG and IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapside protein with an immunochromatography method (LEPU?) based on lateral flow technology. Results: with Diasorin? method, 248 subjects resulted to be negative and 109 positives, whereas LEPU? test was positive (IgM+ and/or IgG+) in 98 subjects. The overall concordance between LEPU? and DiaSorin?, was 94.1% (95% CI 91.0-96.2). Cohen's kappa was 0.86 (95% CI 0.80-0.92), indicating good agreement. 21 out of 357 (5.9%) samples had a discordant result and were re-analyzed with a third method (Roche Diagnostics Electrochemiluminescence?): 4 out of 5 DiaSorin? negative/LEPU? positive samples were confirmed as negative by Roche?;conversely, among the 16 DiaSorin? positive/LEPU? negative samples, 5 were confirmed as positive by Roche?, 6 as negative and 5 were not retested due to insufficient sample volume. Conclusions: Despite the methods were designed to detect different antibodies an overall high agreement between techniques was found. Discrepant results were found and were likely due to different antigen targets recognized by methods. The observation that only 6 out of 11 DiaSorin? positive samples were not confirmed by ROCHE?, supports the antigen-dependent hypothesis.","output":"Antibody identification in COVID-19 pandemic: A comparison between immunochemiluminescence and immunochromatography methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Available vaccines fail to induce lasting and protective immunity to equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) associated diseases.

Objectives: To assess outcomes in patients with ILD hospitalized for COVID-19 versus those without ILD in a contemporaneous age-, sex-, and comorbidity-matched population. Methods: An international multicenter audit of patients with a prior diagnosis of ILD admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 between March 1 and May 1, 2020, was undertaken and compared with patients without ILD, obtained from the ISARIC4C (International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium) cohort, admitted with COVID-19 over the same period. The primary outcome was survival. Secondary analysis distinguished idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis from nonCidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ILD and used lung function to determine the greatest risks of death. Measurements and Main Results: Data from 349 patients with ILD across Europe were included, of whom 161 were admitted to the hospital with laboratory or clinical evidence of COVID-19 and eligible for propensity score matching. Overall mortality was 49% (79/161) in patients with ILD with COVID-19. After matching, patients with ILD with COVID-19 had significantly poorer survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.60; confidence interval, 1.17C2.18; P = 0.003) than age-, sex-, and comorbidity-matched controls without ILD. Patients with an FVC of <80% had an increased risk of death versus patients with FVC 80% (HR, 1.72; 1.05C2.83). Furthermore, obese patients with ILD had an elevated risk of death (HR, 2.27; 1.39?3.71).

We define persistence within a framework of fluxes of matter-energy and information and signal processing in response to internal and external challenges. A 'triangle of persistence' describing reuse, innovation and stasis defines a useful polytope in a phase space of trade-offs between economy, flexibility and robustness. We illustrate how the concept of temporal parts embraced by the perdurantist school provides a processual 4-dimensional 'worm' view of biology that is historical and atemporal. This view is made explicit with chronologies and evolving networks inferred with phylogenomic methodologies. Exploring the origin and evolution of the ribosome reveals recruitment of helical segments and/or large fragments of interacting rRNA molecules in a unification process of accretion that is counteracted by diversification.

However, little is known about the psychological impact of the quarantine during this pandemic. The aim of this study is to assess the emotional impact of the lockdown measures imposed by the Argentinian government to fight the virus. For this, a survey was distributed on social network. We surveyed the Argentinian general population twice: 2 days after the mandatory quarantine started (time 1), and 2 weeks later (time 2). Anxiety levels were assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-II; and affect was assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Scale. A total of 6057 people answered both surveys. In addition, different socio-demographic factors were considered, such as risk factors for COVID-19, age, gender, educational level, variation in family income due to quarantine, number of children, whether they have older adults in charge or not and the number of hours viewing information about COVID-19. Statistically significant variations were observed between the two time points. The effect size, however, was very small. Depression tends to increase slightly, while levels of anxiety and affect (positive and negative) tend to decrease. Also, some slight differences related to the socio-demographic factors were found. Findings suggests that sustaining the lockdown measures could have a larger effect on mental health in the long term.

METHODS: An anonymized survey was conducted among German private practice urologists during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The &#967;2 test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: 257 urologists were included in the final analysis. Thirty-five (14.0%) of urologists had used telemedicine as part of their consultation, and 221 (86.0%) had not used telemedicine. There was no difference between telemedicine adoption rates between rural and urban settings. Telemedicine users were significantly more satisfied with the information they had received regarding telemedicine issues. Users saw the greatest barrier to telemedicine that patients do not take up the offer of telemedicine. Nonusers were most concerned with unclear indications for telemedicine followed by lesser reimbursements during telemedicine than in-person visitations. Users were significantly more likely to use telemedicine beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Urologists, who wanted to use the service in the future, wanted an active support by the German society of urology and guidelines for telemedicine. Last, users and nonusers preferred telemedicine for non-acute chronic diseases and follow-up visitations. CONCLUSION: Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine remains a rarely used service among German private practice urologists.

With an increasing number of COVID-19 cases worldwide, it is imperative to better understand the impact of RAAS inhibitors in hypertensive COVID patients. PubMed, Embase and the pre-print database Medrxiv were searched, and studies with data on patients on ACEi/ARB with COVID-19 were included. Random effects models were used to estimate the pooled mean difference with 95% confidence interval using Open Meta[Analyst] software. RECENT FINDINGS: A total of 28,872 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The use of any RAAS inhibition for any conditions showed a trend to lower risk of death/critical events (OR 0.671, CI 0.435 to 1.034, p = 0.071). Within the hypertensive cohort, however, there was a significant lower association with deaths (OR 0.664, CI 0.458 to 0.964, p = 0.031) or the combination of death/critical outcomes (OR 0.670, CI 0.495 to 0.908, p = 0.010).

Although online-delivered PMPs enhance access, none have been codesigned with patients or compared with group-based, in-person PMPs. This non-inferiority trial aims to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a cocreated, culturally appropriate, online-delivered PMP (iSelf-help) compared with in-person PMP in reducing pain-related disability. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Mixed-methods, using a modified participatory action research (PAR) framework, involving three phases. Phase I involved cocreation and cultural appropriateness of iSelf-help by PAR team members. Phase II: The proposed iSelf-help trial is a pragmatic, multicentred, assessor-blinded, two-arm, parallel group, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial. Adults (n=180, age 18 years) with persistent non-cancer pain eligible for a PMP will be recruited and block randomised (with equal probabilities) to intervention (iSelf-help) and control groups (in-person PMP). The iSelf-help participants will participate in two 60-minute video-conferencing sessions weekly for 12 weeks with access to cocreated resources via smartphone application and a password-protected website. The control participants will receive group-based, in-person delivered PMP.

In this chapter, we present a near real-time sentiment analysis service of public health-related tweets. Traditionally, it is impossible for humans to effectively measure the degree of public health concerns due to limited resources and significant time delays. To solve this problem, we have developed a computational intelligence approach for Epidemic Sentiment Monitoring System (ESMOS) to automatically analyze the disease sentiments and gauge the Measure of Concern (MOC) expressed by Twitter users. More specifically, we present a knowledge-based approach that employs a disease ontology to detect the outbreak of diseases and to analyze the linguistic expressions that convey subjective expressions and sentiment polarity of emotions, feelings, opinions, personal attitudes, etc. with a sentiment classifier. The two-step sentiment classification method utilizes the subjective vocabulary corpus (MPQA), sentiment strength corpus (AFINN), as well as emoticons and profanity words that are often used in social media postings. It first automatically classifies the tweets into personal and non-personal classes, eliminating many tweets such as non-personal retweets of news articles from further consideration. In the second stage, the personal tweets are classified into Negative and non-Negative sentiments. In addition, we present a model to quantify the publics Measure of Concern (MOC) about a disease, based on sentiment classification results. The trends of the public MOC are visualized on a timeline. Correlation analyses between MOC timeline and disease-related sentiment category timelines show that the peaks of the MOC are weakly correlated with the peaks of the News timeline without any appreciable time delay or lead. Our sentiment analysis method and the MOC trend analyses can be generalized to other topical domains, such as mental health monitoring and crisis management.

Our findings suggest that perceptions and knowledge of the virus, especially believing that the virus poses a serious threat to one's individual health, are important determinants of behavior, but also that perceptions and knowledge are strongly driven by social and cultural factors above and beyond political affiliation.","output":"Beyond political affiliation: an examination of the relationships between social factors and perceptions of and responses to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article compares changes in tendencies of value-added flows and the places held by the Central and Eastern European economies (11 countries: Visegrad countries, Baltic States, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania; CEE) in global value chains (GVCs) in manufacturing, services, and their subgroupinformation and telecommunication (ICT) services, by relying on the trade in value-added data retrieved from the OECDs Inter-Country InputCOutput Database, available over the period 2005C2015.

Therefore, the study discusses the role of CEE economies in global economy in terms of forms of participation of services, especially ICT services, in GVCs, including the process of servicification of manufacturing. This study led to the verification of two hypotheses: (1) the position of manufacturing in GVCs has been steadily weakening and (2) services, especially ICT services, can have a positive effect on participation of CEE economies in GVCs. The first hypothesis was confirmed by most of analysed countries.

The role of IL-6 in the pathogenesis of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently received much more attention due to the spread of the virus and its pandemic potential. Cytokine storm is among the most critical pathological events in patients affected with coronaviruses (CoVs), i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and COVID-19, causing inflammation-induced lung injury and also occurring as a result of dysregulation of immune responses to the mentioned viruses. IL-6, along with some other inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1 beta (?), IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;), as well as inflammatory chemokines, can significantly contribute to, fever, lymphopenia, coagulation, lung injury, and multi-organ failure (MOF). Therefore, researchers are to explore novel approaches to treat the disease through targeting of IL-6 and its receptors based on prior experience of other disorders.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and affecting factors in healthcare professionals. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional online survey conducted in 1574 healthcare professionals consisting of physicians, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, and healthcare personnel in Turkey in December 2020. Demographic, attitudinal, and Fear of COVID-19 Scale scores of healthcare professionals were investigated in this survey. RESULTS: About 84.6% of healthcare professionals declared willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine whenever possible. Most physicians (90.4%) stated to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, while 66.5% of nurses, 73.9% of healthcare personnel, also preferred to have it as soon as the vaccine was available. Factors affecting the willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine were found to be advanced age, male gender, working in a primary health care center, living with family, having a child, having a chronic disease, having high Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FC-19S) scores. While the group with the highest vaccine rejection rate was nurses with 33.5%, FC-19S scores were significantly higher in nurses who wanted to be vaccinated. In multivariate regression analyses, factors related to the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine were identified as advanced age, routine adult vaccination, no history of COVID-19, and recommendation of the COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of healthcare professionals declared their willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine, and hence, this will play a leading role in optimizing the vaccination rate of the entire population while combating the pandemic.","output":"The willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine and affecting factors among healthcare professionals: A cross-sectional study in Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the theoretical starting point of the transactional stress model of Lazarus and its further elaboration and operationalization by Levenstein et al. we investigate the following research question: Which factors are associated with the chefs' perception of stress at the beginning of COVID-19 lockdown?

It is the strongest predictor of actual turnover expected to increase as the intention increases. Emergency Department (ED) nurses are especially vulnerable to high turnover because of their increased risk of developing burnout and compassion fatigue associated with the work environment. This study is aimed to assess nurses intention to leave emergency departments and associated factors at selected governmental hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted on 102 nurses in three selected governmental hospitals, Addis Ababa from February 19 to March 31, 2018, using a structured pre-tested self-administered questionnaire. The logistic regression model was used and an adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was calculated to identify associated factors. RESULT: A total of 102 respondents were involved with a response rate of 91.1%. Among them, 79 (77.5%) respondents had the intention to leave the current working unit of the emergency department or hospital. Significant predictive factors of nurses intention to leave their institutions are educational status (adjusted odds ratio (OR) =4.700, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.033C50.772; p < 0.048), monthly income of less than 3145 Birr (adjusted OR = 6.05, 95% CI = 1.056C34.641; p < 0.043) and professional autonomy (adjusted OR = 0.191, 95% CI = 0.040C0.908; p < 0.037).

The polarized human airway epithelium (HAE) cultured at an airway-liquid interface (HAE-ALI) is an in vitro model mimicking the in vivo human mucociliary airway epithelium and supports the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Prior studies characterized only short-period SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE. In this study, continuously monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE-ALI cultures for a long period of up to 51 days revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection was long lasting with recurrent replication peaks appearing between an interval of approximately 7 to 10 days, which was consistent in all the tested HAE-ALI cultures derived from 4 lung bronchi of independent donors. We also identified that SARS-CoV-2 does not infect HAE from the basolateral side, and the dominant SARS-CoV-2 permissive epithelial cells are ciliated cells and goblet cells, whereas virus replication in basal cells and club cells was not detected. Notably, virus infection immediately damaged the HAE, which is demonstrated by dispersed zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression without clear tight junctions and partial loss of cilia. Importantly, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 productive infection of HAE requires a high viral load of >2.5  105 virions per cm2 of epithelium. Thus, our studies highlight the importance of a high viral load and that epithelial renewal initiates and maintains a recurrent infection of HAE with SARS-CoV-2.IMPORTANCE The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to >35 million confirmed cases and >1 million fatalities worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 mainly replicates in human airway epithelia in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we used in vitro cultures of polarized human bronchial airway epithelium to model SARS-CoV-2 replication for a period of 21 to 51 days. We discovered that in vitro airway epithelial cultures endure a long-lasting SARS-CoV-2 propagation with recurrent peaks of progeny virus release at an interval of approximately 7 to 10 days. Our study also revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes airway epithelia damage with disruption of tight junction function and loss of cilia. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a polarity of infection in airway epithelium only from the apical membrane; it infects ciliated and goblet cells but not basal and club cells. Furthermore, the productive infection of SARS-CoV-2 requires a high viral load of over 2.5  105 virions per cm2 of epithelium. Our study highlights that the proliferation of airway basal cells and regeneration of airway epithelium may contribute to the recurrent infections.","output":"Long-Term Modeling of SARS-CoV-2 Infection of In Vitro Cultured Polarized Human Airway Epithelium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present the grounding approach, deployment and preliminary validation of the elementary devised model of physical well-being in urban environments, summarizing the heterogeneous personal Big Data (on physical activity/exercise, walking, cardio-respiratory fitness, quality of sleep and related lifestyle and health habits and status, continuously collected for over a year mainly through wearable IoT devices and survey instruments in 7 global testbed cities) into 5 composite domain indicators/indexes convenient for interpretation and use in predictive public health and preventive interventions.

Primary outcome: Repeated measures of self-reported app usage. Participants: N = 2,500 adults living in England, representative of England's population in terms of regional distribution, age, and gender (2011 census). Results: We observe initial app uptake at 41%, 95% CI [0.39,0.43], in November 2020 with a 12% dropout rate by March 2021, 95% CI [0.10,0.14]. We also found that 7% of nonusers as of wave 2 became new adopters by wave 3, 95% CI [0.05,0.08]. Initial uptake (or failure to use) of the app associated with social norms, privacy concerns, and misinformation about third-party data access, with those living in postal districts with restrictions on mobility less likely to use the app. Perceived lack of transparent evidence of effectiveness was associated with drop out of use. In addition, those who trusted the government were more likely to adopt in wave 3 as new adopters. Conclusions: Successful uptake of the contact tracing app should be evaluated within the wider context of the UK Government's response to the crisis. Trust in government is key to adoption of the app in wave 3 while continued use is linked to perceptions of transparent evidence.

Molecular characterization of the viruses was done through amplification of genes 3 and 5 and showed evidence of genetic similarity between them, although they differed from sequences of other TCoVs described in the literature. In relation to gene 3, samples showed a greater relationship with chicken infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), while gene 5 showed greater identity with pheasant coronavirus (PhCoV).

To date, the etiology is not well understood and individual susceptibility still remains unknown. Amiodarone, chlorpromazine, amitriptyline, and trimipramine are classified lysosomotropic as well as photosensitizing, however, they fail to trigger rash and pruritic papules in all individuals. Lysosomotropism is a common charcteristic of various drugs, but independent of individuals. There is evidence that the individual ability to respond to external oxidative stress is crosslinked with the elongation of long-chain fatty acids to very long-chain fatty acids by ELOVLs. ELOVL6 and ELOVL7 are sensitive to ROS induced depletion of cellular NADPH and insufficient regeneration via the pentose phosphate pathway and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Deficiency of NADPH in presence of lysosomotropic drugs promotes the synthesis of C(16)-ceramide in lysosomes and may contribute to emerging pruritic papules of AGEP. However, independently from a lysosomomotropic drug, severe depletion of ATP and NAD(P)H, e.g., by UV radiation or a potent photosensitizer can trigger likewise the collapse of the lysosomal transmembrane proton gradient resulting in lysosomal C(16)-ceramide synthesis and pruritic papules. This kind of papules are equally present in polymorphous light eruption (PMLE/PLE) and acne aestivalis (Mallorca acne). The suggested model of a compartmentalized ceramide metabolism provides a more sophisticated explanation of cutaneous drug adverse effects and the individual sensitivity to UV radiation.

METHODS: We identified close contacts of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in northeast Chongqing, China, who were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-positive (RT-PCR+). We stratified this cohort by normal vs abnormal findings on chest computed tomography (CT) and compared the strata regarding comorbidities, demographics, laboratory findings, viral transmission and other factors. RESULTS: Between January 2020 and March 2020, we identified and hospitalized 279 RT-PCR+ contacts of COVID-19 patients. 63 (23%) remained asymptomatic until discharge; 29 had abnormal and 34 had normal chest CT findings. The mean cohort age was 39.3 years, and 87.3% had no comorbidities. Mean time to diagnosis after close contact with a COVID-19 index patient was 16.0 days, and it was 13.4 days and 18.7 days for those with abnormal and normal CT findings, respectively (P < .05). Nine patients (14.3%) transmitted the virus to others; 4 and 5 were in the abnormal and normal CT strata, respectively. The median length of time for nucleic acid to turn negative was 13 days compared with 10.4 days in those with normal chest CT scans (P < .05).

Of considerable importance during lead optimization are the alchemical free energy methods that furnish an estimation of relative binding free energies (RBFE) of similar molecules. Recent advances in these methods have increased their speed, accuracy, and precision. This is evident from the increasing number of retrospective as well as prospective studies employing them. However, such methods still have limited applicability in real-world scenarios due to a number of important yet unresolved issues. Here, we report the findings from a large data set comprising over 500 ligand transformations spanning over 300 ligands binding to a diverse set of 14 different protein targets which furnish statistically robust results on the accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of RBFE calculations. We use ensemble-based methods which are the only way to provide reliable uncertainty quantification given that the underlying molecular dynamics is chaotic. These are implemented using TIES (Thermodynamic Integration with Enhanced Sampling). Results achieve chemical accuracy in all cases. Ensemble simulations also furnish information on the statistical distributions of the free energy calculations which exhibit non-normal behavior. We find that the enhanced sampling method known as replica exchange with solute tempering degrades RBFE predictions. We also report definitively on numerous associated alchemical factors including the choice of ligand charge method, flexibility in ligand structure, and the size of the alchemical region including the number of atoms involved in transforming one ligand into another.

The limitation of ICU beds has been one of the major burdens in the management around the world; therefore, clinical strategies to avoid ICU admission are needed. We aimed to describe the influence of tocilizumab on the need of transfer to ICU or death in non-critically ill patients. METHODS: A retrospective study of 171 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection that did not qualify as requiring transfer to ICU during the first 24h after admission to a conventional ward, were included. The criteria to receive tocilizumab was radiological impairment, oxygen demand or an increasing of inflammatory parameters, however, the ultimate decision was left to the attending physician judgement. The primary outcome was the need of ICU admission or death whichever came first. RESULTS: A total of 77 patients received tocilizumab and 94 did not. The tocilizumab group had less ICU admissions (10.3% vs. 27.6%, P=0.005) and need of invasive ventilation (0 vs 13.8%, P=0.001). In the multivariable analysis, tocilizumab remained as a protective variable (OR: 0.03, CI 95%: 0.007-0.1, P=0.0001) of ICU admission or death. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab in early stages of the inflammatory flare could reduce an important number of ICU admissions and mechanical ventilation.

Caco-2 cells were used as a model of RV infection to evaluate chloride secretion, epithelial integrity, oxidative stress and viral infectivity in Ussing chambers. RESULTS: Diosmectite reduced the expression of NSP4 and oxidative stress, resulting in a strong inhibition of chloride secretion. Preincubating RV with DS reduced the cytotoxic effect. Finally, the viral load was reduced by DS but not by control clay. This result suggests that DS specifically affects the early events of RV infection protecting the enterocyte, whereas it does not restore already-established cell damage. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that DS exerts an anti-diarrhoeal effect by inhibiting viral replication and the expression of NSP4.

Aiming at this problem, this paper incorporates psychological capital and social panic into the model from the perspective of the organizational safety climate and constructs a theoretical model of the mechanism of the effect on nursing staff's willingness to stay in the context of the outbreak. Through a questionnaire survey in an aged care agency in Anhui Province, a total of 321 valid questionnaires were collected for empirical analysis. The results show that: (1) the safety climate of the organization has a significant positive impact on the transactional psychological capital and interpersonal psychological capital of nursing staff in the aged care industry and their willingness to stay;(2) transactional psychological capital and social panic have a significant positive impact on the willingness to stay of nursing staff, while interpersonal psychological capital has no significant impact on the willingness to stay;(3) the mediating role of transactional psychological capital and interpersonal psychological capital between the safety climate and the willingness to stay is established, and the moderating role of social panic between psychological capital and willingness to stay is also established. Finally, based on the research conclusions, corresponding countermeasures and suggestions are put forward to deal with the problems that occur in special periods.","output":"How Safety Climate Influences the Willingness to Stay of Nursing Staff during the COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tiger frog virus (TFV) belongs to the genus Ranavirus (family Iridoviridae) and causes significant harm in cultured frogs, resulting in substantial losses in ecological and economic field in Southern China. Attachment is the first step in viral life cycle, which is dependent on the interactions of virions with extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Studying this process will help in understanding virus infection and controlling viral diseases. In this study, the roles of primary ECM components in TFV attachment were investigated. The results on the kinetics of virus attachment showed successful TFV attachment to the cell surface as a relatively rapid process after the TFV was used to inoculate cells for 10 min at 4 C. Western blot and quantitative PCR analysis results showed that soluble fibronectin, collagen IV, laminin, or hyaluronic acid treatment with TFV caused no significant effect on virus attachment. Soluble heparin, heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate A/B could inhibit TFV attachment in a dose-dependent manner. Enzymic digestion by cell surface heparin/heparan sulfate using heparinase I, II, and III could significantly prevent TFV attachment, suggesting that heparan sulfate plays an important role in TFV attachment. Furthermore, the binding assays of heparin-agarose beads and virion showed that TFV virions specifically bound with heparin in a dose-dependent manner. Given that heparin is a structural analogue of heparan sulfate, the above results suggest that heparan sulfate might serve as an attachment factor of TFV infection. Our work would be beneficial to understand the mechanisms of TFV attachment and the interactions of TFV with cellular receptors.","output":"Roles of extracellular matrix components in tiger frog virus attachment to fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND While minimal invasive surgery is becoming popular in liver resection, right posterior sectionectomy (RPS) is still considered as a difficult procedure. We summarize the clinical data and investigate the feasibility of laparoscopic right posterior sectionectomy (LRPS) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by comparing its outcomes with those of open right posterior sectionectomy (ORPS). METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 191 patients who underwent RPS for HCC during January 2009 to August 2016 at Samsung Medical Center. After 1:2 propensity score matching, 53 patients in LRPS group were matched to 97 patients in ORPS group. RESULTS There was no statistical difference in preoperative data. While operation time was significantly longer in LRPS group (381.1  118.7 vs. 234.4  63.7 min, P < 0.001), transfusion rate (13.2 vs. 2.1%, P = 0.061) and complication rate (9.4 vs. 8.3%, P = 0.709) were not statistically different between groups. Clustered Cox proportional hazards regression analysis for matched paired data showed no difference in both disease-free survival (P = 0.607) and overall survival (P = 0.858).

In this study, we reported the safety and immunogenicity of a heterologous boost with a recombinant COVID-19 vaccine (CHO cells), named NVSI-06-07, as a third dose in participants who have previously received two doses of the inactivated vaccine (BBIBP-CorV) at pre-specified time intervals. Using homologous boost with BBIBP-CorV as control, the safety and immunogenicity of the heterologous boost with NVSI-06-07 against various SARS-CoV-2 strains, including Omicron, were characterized. Methods: This study is a single-center, randomised, double-blinded, controlled phase 2 trial for heterologous boost of NVSI-06-07 in BBIBP-CorV recipients from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Healthy adults (aged []18 years) were enrolled and grouped by the specified prior vaccination interval of BBIBP-CorV, i.e., 1-3 months, 4-6 months or []6 months, respectively, with 600 individuals per group. For each group, participants were randomly assigned at 1:1 ratio to receive either a heterologous boost of NVSI-06-07 or a homologous booster dose of BBIBP-CorV. The primary outcome was to comparatively assess the immunogenicity between heterologous and homologous boosts at 14 and 28 days post-boosting immunization, by evaluation of the geometric mean titers (GMTs) of IgG and neutralizing antibodies as well as the corresponding seroconversion rate ([]4-fold rise in antibody titers). The secondary outcomes were the safety profile of the boosting strategies within 30 days post vaccination. The exploratory outcome was the immune efficacy against Omicron and other variants of concern (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05033847. Findings: A total of 1800 individuals who have received two doses of BBIBP-CorV were enrolled, of which 899 participants received a heterologous boost of NVSI-06-07 and 901 received a homologous boost for comparison. No vaccine-related serious adverse event (SAE) and no adverse events of special interest (AESI) were reported. 184 (20.47%) participants in the heterologous boost groups and 177 (19.64%) in the homologous boost groups reported at least one adverse reaction within 30 days. Most of the local and systemic adverse reactions reported were grades 1 (mild) or 2 (moderate), and there was no significant difference in the overall safety between heterologous and homologous boosts. Immunogenicity assays showed that the seroconversion rates in neutralizing antibodies against prototype SARS-CoV-2 elicited by heterologous boost were 89.96% - 97.52% on day 28 post-boosting vaccination, which was much higher than what was induced by homologous boost (36.80% - 81.75%). Similarly, in heterologous NVSI-06-07 booster groups, the neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs) against the prototype strain increased by 21.01 - 63.85 folds from baseline to 28 days post-boosting vaccination, whereas only 4.20 - 16.78 folds of increases were observed in homologous BBIBP-CorV booster group. For Omicron variant, the neutralizing antibody GMT elicited by the homologous boost of BBIBP-CorV was 37.91 (95%CI, 30.35-47.35), however, a significantly higher level of neutralizing antibodies with GMT 292.53 (95%CI, 222.81-384.07) was induced by the heterologous boost of NVSI-06-07, suggesting that it may serve as an effective boosting strategy combating the pandemic of Omicron. The similar results were obtained for other VOCs, including Alpha, Beta and Delta, in which the neutralizing response elicited by the heterologous boost was also significantly greater than that of the homologous boost. In the participants primed with BBIBP-CorV over 6 months, the largest increase in the neutralizing GMTs was obtained both in the heterologous and homologous boost groups, and thus the booster vaccination with over 6 months intervals was optimal. Interpretation: Our findings indicated that the heterologous boost with NVSI-06-07 was safe, well-tolerated and immunogenic in adults primed with a full regimen of BBIBP-CorV. Compared to homologous boost with a third dose of BBIBP-CorV, incremental increases in immune responses were achieved by the heterologous boost with NVSI-06-07 against SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain, Omicron variant, and other VOCs. The heterologous BBIBP-CorV/NVSI-06-07 prime-boosting vaccination may be valuable in preventing the pandemic of Omicron. The optimal booster strategy was the heterologous boost with NVSI-06-07 over 6 months after a priming with two doses of BBIBP-CorV.","output":"Safety and immunogenicity of a heterologous boost with a recombinant vaccine, NVSI-06-07, in the inactivated vaccine recipients from UAE: a phase 2 randomised, double-blinded, controlled clinical trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated mitigation strategies such as lockdown are having widespread adverse psychological effects, including increased levels of anxiety and depression. Most research using self-reported data highlights the pandemics impact on the psychological well-being of females, whereas data for mental health emergency presentations may reflect the impact on male mental health more accurately. We analyzed records of male mental health emergencies occurring in the East Midlands of the United Kingdom during the first national lockdown. We computed two binary logistic regression models to (a) compare male mental health emergencies occurring during lockdown, 2020 (5,779) with those occurring in the same period in 2019 (N = 4,744) and (b) compare male (N = 5,779) and female (N = 7,695) mental health emergencies occurring during lockdown. Comparisons considered the characteristics of mental health emergencies recorded by ambulance clinicians (Primary Impressions), and the socioeconomic characteristics of communities where emergencies use the Index of Multiple Deprivation. We found that during lockdown, male emergencies were more likely to involve acute anxiety (odds ratio [OR]: 1.42) and less likely to involve intentional drug overdose (OR: 0.86) or attempted suicide (OR: 0.71) compared with 2019. Compared with females, male emergencies were more likely to involve acute behavioral disturbance (OR: 1.99) and less likely to involve anxiety (OR: 0.67), attempted suicide (OR: 0.83), or intentional drug overdose (OR: 0.76).

The heavy workload imposed on hospital services might have negatively affected patients' outcomes and exacerbated mortality rates. Here, we assessed excess in-hospital mortality across the Israeli healthcare system, using a model developed for predicting patient mortality based on data of day-by-day patient disease course. Mortality predictions were made using Monte-Carlo methods based on a multistate survival analysis and a set of Cox regression models, first constructed and validated on a nationwide cohort during the first stages of the pandemic in Israel. We show that during a peak of hospitalizations in September and October 2020, patient deaths significantly exceeded the model's mortality predictions, while reverting to match the predictions as patient load subsided in October, and showing signs of renewed excess mortality as hospital load is increasing again since late December 2020. Our work emphasizes that even in countries in which the healthcare system did not reach a specific point defined as insufficiency, the increase in hospital workload was associated with higher patient mortality, while ruling out factors related to changes in the hospitalized population. In addition, our study highlights the importance of quantifying excess mortality in order to assess quality of care, and define an appropriate carrying capacity of severe patients in order to guide timely healthcare policies and allocate appropriate resources.

Viruses use sophisticated transmission strategies to overcome the spatial barrier separating plants and the impediment imposed by the plant cell wall. Interactions among insect vectors, viruses, and host plants mediate transmission by integrating all organizational levels, from molecules to populations. Best-examined on the molecular scale are two basic transmission modes wherein virus-vector interactions have been well characterized. Whereas association of virus particles with specific sites in the vector's mouthparts or in alimentary tract regions immediately posterior to them is required for noncirculative transmission, the cycle of particles through the vector body is necessary for circulative transmission. Virus transmission is also determined by interactions that are associated with changes in vector feeding behaviors and with alterations in plant host's morphology and/or metabolism that favor the attraction or deterrence of vectors. A recent concept in virus-host-vector interactions proposes that when vectors land on infected plants, vector elicitors and effectors \\"inform\\" the plants of the confluence of interacting entities and trigger signaling pathways and plant defenses. Simultaneously, the plant responses may also influence virus acquisition and inoculation by vectors. Overall, a picture is emerging where transmission depends on multilayered virus-vector-host interactions that define the route of a virus through the vector, and on the manipulation of the host and the vector. These interactions guarantee virus propagation until one or more of the interactants undergo changes through evolution or are halted by environmental interventions.","output":"Insect transmission of plant viruses: Multilayered interactions optimize viral propagation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background:As the knowledge about the risk factors and treatment options of COVID 19 is still evolving, we attempted to study the clinical characteristics, comorbidities and laboratory markers in 98 COVID nonsurvivors from a tertiary care centre in Tamilnadu.

Here, we aimed to integrate structural, biochemical, and virological data to assess the importance of conserved N7-MTase residues for nsp14s enzymatic activities and virus viability. We revisited the crystal structure of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)CCoV nsp14 to perform an in silico comparative analysis between betacoronaviruses. We identified several residues likely involved in the formation of the N7-MTase catalytic pocket, which presents a fold distinct from the Rossmann fold observed in most known MTases. Next, for SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV, site-directed mutagenesis of selected residues was used to assess their importance for in vitro enzymatic activity. Most of the engineered mutations abolished N7-MTase activity, while not affecting nsp14-ExoN activity.

Socioeconomic deprivation was measured using trial participants' residential zip codes linked to the Area Deprivation Index (ADI). Five-year overall survival, progression-free survival, and cancer-specific survival were examined using Cox regression frailty models, adjusting for age, sex, and race, and separately for insurance status, prognostic risk, and rural or urban residency. RESULTS: We examined 41,109 patients from 55 trials comprising 24 cancer histology and stage-specific cohorts. Compared with trial participants in the most affluent areas (ADI, 0%-20%), trial participants from areas with the highest socioeconomic deprivation (ADI, 80%-100%) had worse overall (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.28, 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.37, P < .001), progression-free (HR = 1.20, 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.28, P < .001), and cancer-specific survival (HR = 1.27, 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.37, P < .001).

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness that has strong biological underpinnings and no definite etiology. Diagnostic criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have helped classify CFS as an overlap of mood, behavioral, and biological components. These include the presence of fatigue for more than 6 months associated with a diminution of functional activity and somatic symptoms, and pain not attributable to a specific diagnosis or disease. Four of the following criteria need to be present: sore throat, impaired memory or cognition, unrefreshing sleep, postexertional fatigue, tender glands, aching stiff muscles, joint pain, and headaches. Many researchers have observed that CFS shares features in common with other somatic syndromes, including irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Correlations between inflammation and infection, augmented sensory processing, abnormalities of neurotransmitters, nerve growth factors, low levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, abnormalities of homeostasis of the stress system, and autonomic dysfunction may be hallmarks of CFS. The relative contributions of each of these abnormalities to the profound fatigue associated with CFS need to be explored further to better evaluate and treat the syndrome.","output":"Perspectives on Fatigue from the Study of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Related Conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To present a reproducible methodology for building an anatomy mimicking phantom with targeted T1 and T2 contrast for use in quantitative magnetic resonance imaging.

We describe a calibration method for accurately targeting anatomically realistic relaxation pairs. In addition, we developed a method of fabricating slice phantoms by extruding 3D printed walls on acrylic sheets. These procedures are combined to create a physical analog of the Brainweb digital phantom. RESULTS With our method, we are able to target specific T1 /T2 values with less than 10% error. Additionally, our slice phantoms look realistic since their geometries are derived from anatomical data.

RESULTS: There was a significant and positive correlation between the scores on the PES-NWI and the JPS (r: 0.65, p < .05). Regression analysis showed that nurses' job performance was affected by five variables (R2 : 59%, p < .05, Durbin-Watson: 2.06). CONCLUSION: The results of the study show that three sub-dimensions of the PES-NWI (nursing foundations for quality of care; staffing and resource adequacy; nurse manager abilities, leadership and support for nurses), colleague solidarity and education level were important factors affecting job performance.

Research institutions have reduced onsite activities, data is often collected remotely, and during the height of the crisis, clinical researchers were partially forced to abandon their projects in favour of front-line care and crisis response. Participants: 120 investigators of health research projects across Germany, performed between 15 and 25 May 2020. Results: The response rate (78%) showed that the survey generated significant interest among investigators. 85 responses were included for analysis, and the majority of investigators (93%) reported that their projects were affected by the pandemic, with many (80%) stating that data collection was not possible as planned, and they could not carry out interventions as planned (67%). Other impacts were caused by staff being unavailable, for example through child or elder care commitments or because of COVID-19 quarantine or illness. Investigators also reported that publications were delayed or not feasible at all (56%), and some experienced problems with PhD or Masters theses (18%). The majority of investigators had mitigation strategies in place such as adjustment of data collection methods using digital tools (46%) or of project implementation in general (46%), others made changes in research design or research questions (27%).

The viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been quantitatively investigated. In this paper, we use mathematical models to study the pathogenic features of SARS-CoV-2 infection by examining the interaction between the virus, cells and immune responses. Models are fit to the data of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and non-human primates. Data fitting and numerical simulation show that viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection have a few distinct stages. In the initial stage, viral load increases rapidly and reaches the peak, followed by a plateau phase possibly generated by lymphocytes as a secondary target of infection. In the last stage, viral load declines due to the emergence of adaptive immune responses. When the initiation of seroconversion is late or slow, the model predicts viral rebound and prolonged viral persistence, consistent with the observation in non-human primates. Using the model we also evaluate the effect of several potential therapeutic interventions for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Model simulation shows that anti-inflammatory treatments or antiviral drugs combined with interferon are effective in reducing the duration of the viral plateau phase and diminishing the time to recovery.

However, whether TNF family genes can be used as prognostic biomarkers of CC and the molecular mechanisms of TNF family genes remain unclear. Methods: A total of 306 CC and 13 normal samples were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases. We identified differentially expressed TNF family genes between CC and normal samples and subjected them to univariate Cox regression analysis for selecting prognostic TNF family genes. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to screen genes to establish a TNF family gene signature. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to investigate the biological functions of the TNF family gene signature. Finally, methylation and copy number variation data of CC were used to analyse the potential molecular mechanisms of TNF family genes. Results: A total of 26 differentially expressed TNF family genes were identified between the CC and normal samples. Next, a TNF family gene signature, including CD27, EDA, TNF, TNFRSF12A, TNFRSF13C, and TNFRSF9 was constructed based on univariate Cox, LASSO, and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The TNF family gene signature was related to age, pathological stages M and N, and could predict patient survival independently of clinical factors. Moreover, KEGG enrichment analysis suggested that the TNF family gene signature was mainly involved in the TGF-? signaling pathway, and the TNF family gene signature could affect the immunotherapy response. Finally, we confirmed that the mRNA expressions of CD27, TNF, TNFRSF12A, TNFRSF13C, and TNFRSF9 were upregulated in CC, while that of EDA was downregulated.

The filtering mechanisms of these events and their strength on communities, however, can be different among regions. While time-for-adaptation theory defines whether or not water scarcity can be considered as disturbance, the stress-dominance theory predicts an increase in importance of environmental filtering and a decrease in the role of biotic interactions in communities with increasing environmental stress. Here, we tested whether environmental filtering (leading to trait convergence) or limiting similarity (leading to trait divergence) is the main assembly rule shaping the structure and trait composition of benthic diatom assemblages in Mediterranean (Portuguese) and continental (Hungarian) temporary and perennial streams. We assumed that the trait composition of diatom assemblages in the two stream types would be less different in the Mediterranean than in the continental region (addressed to time-for-adaptation theory). We also hypothesized that trait composition would be shaped by environmental filtering in the Hungarian streams while by biotic interactions in Portuguese streams (addressed to stress-dominance theory). Our results supported our first hypothesis since traits, which associated primarily to temporary streams were found only in the continental region. Our findings, however, only partially proved the stress-dominance hypothesis. In the continental region, where drying up of streams were induced by unpredictable droughts, biotic interactions were the main assembly rules shaping community structure. In contrast, environmental filtering was nearly as important as limiting similarity in structuring trait composition in the Mediterranean region during the predictable dry phase with no superficial flow. These analyses also highlighted that drought events (both predictable and unpredictable ones) have a complex and strong influence on benthic diatom assemblages resulting even in irreversible changes in trait composition and thereby in ecosystem functioning.","output":"Environmental filtering and limiting similarity as main forces driving diatom community structure in Mediterranean and continental temporary and perennial streams"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The book The Precarious Lives of Syrians: Migration, Citizenship, and Temporary Protection in Turkey came out in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic when travel restrictions made it all but impossible for people forced to abandon their homes for reasons such as wars, protracted conflicts, political or sexuality-based persecutions, or gender violence, to seek in other countries access to social justice, that is, safety, security, inclusion, and physical and mental well-being.

Moreover, 32% (n=95) considered universal A/H1N1 vaccination unnecessary. Overall, 39% (n=117) of participants believed that A/H1N1 vaccination would prevent the virus being contracted; 63% (n=189) erroneously believed that efficacy of the vaccine had been confirmed by clinical trials, and 16% (n=49) believed that it is necessary for everyone in Hong Kong to take up vaccination against influenza A/H1N1. Conclusions The uptake of vaccination against influenza A/H1N1 by the general population of Hong Kong is unlikely to be high and would be sensitive to personal cost. Evidence about safety and efficacy is critical in determining the prevalence of uptake of vaccination.","output":"Acceptability of A/H1N1 vaccination during pandemic phase of influenza A/H1N1 in Hong Kong: population based cross sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reliable forecasts of influenza can aid in the control of both seasonal and pandemic outbreaks. We introduce a simulation optimization (SIMOP) approach for forecasting the influenza epidemic curve. This study represents the final step of a project aimed at using a combination of simulation, classification, statistical and optimization techniques to forecast the epidemic curve and infer underlying model parameters during an influenza outbreak. The SIMOP procedure combines an individual-based model and the Nelder-Mead simplex optimization method. The method is used to forecast epidemics simulated over synthetic social networks representing Montgomery County in Virginia, Miami, Seattle and surrounding metropolitan regions. The results are presented for the first four weeks. Depending on the synthetic network, the peak time could be predicted within a 95% CI as early as seven weeks before the actual peak. The peak infected and total infected were also accurately forecasted for Montgomery County in Virginia within the forecasting period. Forecasting of the epidemic curve for both seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks is a complex problem, however this is a preliminary step and the results suggest that more can be achieved in this area.","output":"A Simulation Optimization Approach to Epidemic Forecasting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review highlights the advantages and current status of plant-derived vaccine development with special reference to the dengue virus. There are numerous problems involved in dengue vaccine development, and there is no vaccine against all four dengue serotypes.

Recently, these issues were addressed by showing a very good response to inducing neutralizing antibodies by plant-derived dengue vaccine antigens. This indicates the feasibility of using plant-derived vaccine antigens as a low-cost method to combat dengue and other infectious diseases. The application of new methods and strategies such as dendritic cell targeting in cancer therapy, severe acute respiratory syndrome, tuberculosis, human immune deficiency virus, and malaria might play an important role. These new methods are more efficient than traditional protocols.

The risk of ischemic stroke may be higher in patients with COVID-19 infection similar to those with other respiratory tract infections. We present a comprehensive set of practice implications in a single document for clinicians caring for adult patients with acute ischemic stroke with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. METHODS: The practice implications were prepared after review of data to reach the consensus among stroke experts from 18 countries. The writers used systematic literature reviews, reference to previously published stroke guidelines, personal files, and expert opinion to summarize existing evidence, indicate gaps in current knowledge, and when appropriate, formulate practice implications. All members of the writing group had opportunities to comment in writing on the practice implications and approved the final version of this document. RESULTS: This document with consensus is divided into 18 sections. A total of 41 conclusions and practice implications have been developed. The document includes practice implications for evaluation of stroke patients with caution for stroke team members to avoid COVID-19 exposure, during clinical evaluation and performance of imaging and laboratory procedures with special considerations of intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy in stroke patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: These practice implications with consensus based on the currently available evidence aim to guide clinicians caring for adult patients with acute ischemic stroke who are suspected of, or confirmed, with COVID-19 infection. Under certain circumstances, however, only limited evidence is available to support these practice implications, suggesting an urgent need for establishing procedures for the management of stroke patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.","output":"Management of acute ischemic stroke in patients with COVID-19 infection: Report of an international panel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a great deal of interest in characterizing the complex microbial communities in the poultry gut, and in understanding the effects of these dynamic communities on poultry performance, disease status, animal welfare, and microbes with human health significance. Investigations characterizing the poultry enteric virome have identified novel poultry viruses, but the roles these viruses play in disease and performance problems have yet to be fully characterized. The complex bacterial community present in the poultry gut influences gut development, immune status, and animal health, each of which can be an indicator of overall performance. The present metagenomic investigation was undertaken to provide insight into the colonization of specific pathogen free chickens by enteric microorganisms under field conditions and to compare the pre-contact intestinal microbiome with the altered microbiome following contact with poultry raised in the field. Analysis of the intestinal virome from contact birds (sentinels) placed on farms revealed colonization by members of the Picornaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Reoviridae, and Astroviridae that were not present in pre-contact birds or present in proportionally lower numbers. Analysis of the sentinel gut bacterial community revealed an altered community in the post-contact birds, notably by members of the Lachnospiracea/Clostridium and Lactobacillus families and genera. Members of the avian enteric Reoviridae and Astroviridae have been well-characterized and have historically been implicated in poultry enteric disease; members of the Picobirnaviridae and Picornaviridae have only relatively recently been described in the poultry and avian gut, and their roles in the recognized disease syndromes and in poultry performance in general have not been determined. This metagenomic analysis has provided insight into the colonization of the poultry gut by enteric microbes circulating in commercial broiler flocks, and has identified enteric viruses and virus communities that warrant further study in order to understand their role(s) in avian gut health and disease.","output":"Comparative Analysis of the Intestinal Bacterial and RNA Viral Communities from Sentinel Birds Placed on Selected Broiler Chicken Farms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Human-to-animal transmission of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) is reported in South Africa but there is a paucity of epidemiological data. The aim of this One Health manuscript is to describe zooanthroponotic exposure of domestic animals to TB patients, virtually all of whom had laboratory confirmed pulmonary Mtb disease. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was nested within two TB contact tracing studies and collected data from 2017 to 2019. TB index patients and their households in three provinces of South Africa were recruited. A questionnaire was administered to households, assessing type and number of animals owned, degree of exposure of animals to humans, and veterinary consultations. For this analysis, we compared descriptive variables by animal-keeping status (animal-keeping vs non-animal keeping households), calculated the chi square and respective p-values. RESULTS: We visited 1766 households with at least one confirmed case of TB, 33% (587/1766) had livestock or companion animals. Of non-animal-owning households, 2% (27/1161) cared for other community members' livestock. Few (16%, 92/587) households kept animals in their dwelling overnight, while 45% (266/587) kept animals outside the home, but within 10 m of where people slept and ate. Most (81%, 478/587) of people in animal-owning households were willing for their animal/s to have a TB skin test, but <1% (5/587) of animals had been skin-tested; 4% (24/587) of animal-owning households had a veterinary consultation in the past six months, and 5% (31/587) reported one of their animals dying from natural causes in the prior six months. CONCLUSION: Our survey suggests that a high proportion of patients with TB live in settings facilitating close contact with domestic animal species with known susceptibility to Mtb. There is a substantial exposure of household animals to patients with TB and therefore risk of both transmission to, and spillback from animals to humans.","output":"Tuberculosis patients at the human-animal interface: Potential zooanthroponotic and zoonotic transmission()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Disaster lowers adherence to both treatment and drug of people with chronic diseases including lung cancer patients, which affects health outcome directly COVID-19 detected in Wuhan, China on December 18, 2019 has spread throughout Japan On February 26, 2020 Japanese government recommended closing schools and requested refraining from commuting and gathering Whereas lung cancer patients are COVID-19 high-risk group, they need cancer treatment The purpose of this study is to investigate actual condition of lung cancer patients in terms of adherence decrease and concerns about their treatment Methods: Survey was conducted through website from March 6 to 11, 2020 354 lung cancer patients and families answered questionnaires regarding not only adherence to treatment and drug, but also concerns about cancer treatment and daily life Results: Out of 267 patients and families under treatment, 55 1 percent have trouble or concern about cancer treatment, 96 0 percent not experienced treatment or doctor consultation postponement for hospital convenience, 95 1 percent not experienced treatment or doctor consultation postponement for patients convenience, and 99 9 percent continue drug compliance Regarding daily life concerns, 75 7 percent of under treatment and 74 7 percent of not-under treatment have concerns whether going outside causes infection 55 1 percent of patients and families under treatment have concerns for using train or bus, 48 7 percent of patients and families under treatment have concerns of virus brought into home by families For above concerns, higher percentage are shown in under treatment than in not-under treatment 54 0 percent of not-under treatment feel they have to go out despite their worries about infection 40 2 percent of not-under treatment wonder what to do because of lack of information for lung cancer patients For above concerns, higher percentage are shown in not-under treatment than in under treatment Conclusion: While treatment was provided smoothly even at the period of social life limitation, half of lung cancer patients felt anxious for treatment This survey also reveals patients not- under treatment feel more anxious The author concludes patient support group will lead to provide information valuable for patients Keywords: COVID-19","output":"MA07.09 Lung Cancer Patients Survey Under COVID-19 Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We correct common assumptions about COVID burden and disease characteristics in high-income (HIC) versus low- and middle-income (LMIC) countries by augmenting widely-used surveillance data with auxiliary data sources.

From those reporting rates, we estimated relative COVID burden, finding results that contrast with estimates based on case counts and modeling. To investigate COVID mortality by age in an LMIC context, we utilized a unique morgue study of COVID in Lusaka alongside the population attributable fraction method to account for HIV comorbidity. We calculated the comorbidity-corrected age-adjusted mortality curve in Lusaka and found it significantly skewed toward younger age groups as compared to HICs. This unexpected result recommends against the unexamined use of HIC-derived parameterizations of COVID characteristics in LMIC settings, and challenges the hypothesis of an age-structure protective factor for COVID burden in Africa. Indeed, we found overall COVID burden to be higher in Lusaka than in HICs. Concurrent with high COVID burden, many LMICs have high prevalence of other public health issues such as HIV, which compete for limited health investment resources. Given differences in age-structure, comorbidities, and healthcare delivery costs, we provide a case study comparing the cost efficacy of investment in COVID versus HIV and found that even in a high HIV prevalence setting, investment in COVID remains cost-effective.

CPS are the backbone of enterprise, industrial, and critical infrastructure. Thus, their vital importance makes them prominent targets for malicious attacks aiming to disrupt their operations. Attacks targeting cyber-physical energy systems (CPES), given their mission-critical nature, can have disastrous consequences. The security of CPES can be enhanced leveraging testbed capabilities to replicate power system operations, discover vulnerabilities, develop security countermeasures, and evaluate grid operation under fault-induced or maliciously constructed scenarios. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the CPS security landscape with emphasis on CPES. Specifically, we demonstrate a threat modeling methodology to accurately represent the CPS elements, their interdependencies, as well as the possible attack entry points and system vulnerabilities. Leveraging the threat model formulation, we present a CPS framework designed to delineate the hardware, software, and modeling resources required to simulate the CPS and construct high-fidelity models which can be used to evaluate the system's performance under adverse scenarios. The system performance is assessed using scenario-specific metrics, while risk assessment enables system vulnerability prioritization factoring the impact on the system operation. The overarching framework for modeling, simulating, assessing, and mitigating attacks in a CPS is illustrated using four representative attack scenarios targeting CPES.

Exposure to wildfire smoke has been linked to an increased risk of cancer and cardiorespiratory morbidity. Evidence-driven interventions can alleviate the adverse health impact of wildfire smoke. Public health guidance during wildfires is based on regional air quality data with limited spatiotemporal resolution. We demonstrate the use of a network of low-cost particulate matter (PM) sensors to gather indoor, outdoor, and personal PM2.5 exposure data from seven locations in the urban Seattle area, along with a personal exposure monitor worn by a resident living in one of these locations during the 2020 Washington wildfire event. The data were used to determine PM concentration indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios, PM reduction, and personal exposure levels. The result shows that locations equipped with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and HVAC filtration systems had significantly lower I/O ratios (median I/O = 0.43) than those without air filtration (median I/O = 0.82). The median PM2.5 reduction for the locations with HEPA is 58 % compared to 20% for the locations without HEPA. The outdoor PM sensors showed a high correlation to the nearby regional air quality monitoring stations (R2 = 0.93). The personal monitor showed high variance in PM measurements as the user moved through different microenvironments and could not be fully characterized by the network of indoor or outdoor monitors.

The attempted production of TAGs in Escherichia coli has revealed barriers to the broad applications of this technology, including low TAG productivity and slow cell growth.

We then showed the synergistic effect on TAG accumulation via the acyl-CoA-independent pathway mediated by PDAT and the acyl-CoA-dependent pathway mediated by wax ester synthase/acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (WS/DGAT). Furthermore, CrPDAT led to synchronous TAG accumulation during cell growth and this could be enhanced by supplementation of arbutin. We also showed that rationally mutated CrPDAT was capable of decreasing TAG lipase activity without impairing PDAT activity. Finally, ScPDAT from Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibited similar activities as those of CrPDAT in E. coli Our results suggest that the improvement in accumulation of TAGs and their derivatives can be achieved by fine tuning of phospholipid metabolism in E. coli Understanding the roles of PDAT in the conversion of phospholipids into TAGs during the logarithmic growth phase may enable novel strategies for the production of microbial oils.Importance Although phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT) activity is presumed to exist in prokaryotic oleaginous bacteria, the corresponding gene has not been identified yet.

In addition, the acyl-CoA-independent pathway and the acyl-CoA-dependent pathway had the synergistic effect on TAG accumulation. Overexpression of CrPDAT led to synchronous TAG accumulation during cell growth. In particular, CrPDAT possessed multiple catalytic activities and the rational mutation of CrPDAT led to the decrease of TAG lipase activity without impairing acyltransferase activity.

Peoples positive and negative attitudes towards the past, present and future were a dispositional preCCOVID-19 reality. Faced with a pandemic, people have reported disruptions in the speed of passing time. People can shift their attention more towards the past, present or future when major changes in society occur. These aspects of psychological time would be key to understanding the quality of psychosocial adjustment to the pandemic. We hypothesized that dispositional time attitudes impact psychosocial distress because they would trigger situational changes in our time perception and temporal focus. METHODS: One hundred and forty-four university students in Uruguay responded to self-report questionnaires online while in-person classes were cancelled. Students reported on shifts in temporal focus, changes in time awareness and dispositional time attitudes. Reactive psychological, social and learning environment distress were reported. RESULTS: Students reported substantial changes in time perception and temporal focus. A correlation matrix showed significant relationships between time attitudes, focus and awareness. For example, psychological distress was correlated with negative time attitudes, slower passage of time, boredom, blurred sense of time and shifting focus to the past. Mediation models were derived. The indirect effect of time attitudes on psychological distress was significant through past focus. DISCUSSION: Dispositional time attitudes would impact students capacity to cope with the pandemic. Situational shifts in temporal focus and perception were prevalent and can be viewed as temporal coping mechanisms in the wake of powerful societal change. Our mediation models showed that those with negative time attitudes experienced more psychological distress because they shifted their attention to the past. Future directions for research and practical implications are discussed.","output":"Disrupting times in the wake of the pandemic: Dispositional time attitudes, time perception and temporal focus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, reports in social media and the lay press indicate that a subset of patients are presenting with severe hypoxemia in the absence of dyspnea, a problem unofficially referred to as \\"silent hypoxemia.\\" To decrease the risk of complications in such patients, one proposed solution has been to have those diagnosed with COVID-19 but not sick enough to warrant admission monitor their arterial oxygenation by pulse oximetry at home and present for care when they show evidence of hypoxemia. While the ease of use and low cost of pulse oximetry makes this an attractive option for identifying problems at an early stage, there are important considerations with pulse oximetry about which patients and providers may not be aware that can interfere with successful implementation of such monitoring programs. Only a few independent studies have examined the performance of pocket oximeters and smart phone-based systems but the limited available data raise questions about their accuracy, particularly as saturation falls below 90%. There are also multiple sources of error in pulse oximetry that must be accounted for including rapid fluctuations in measurements when the PaO2 falls on the steep portion of the dissociation curve, data acquisition problems when pulsatile blood flow is diminished, accuracy in the setting of severe hypoxemia, dyshemoglobinemias and other problems.

In this article, Fano resonance-based refractive index sensor using plasmonic nanomatryoshka is proposed for blood plasma sensing. The interaction between hybridized modes (bright and dark modes) in optimized nanomatryoshka leads to Fano resonance, which by virtue of steeper dispersion can confine the light more efficiently compared with Lorentzian resonance. We propose the excitation of Fano resonances in sub 100-nm size nanomatryoshka based on newly emerging plasmonic materials ZrN and HfN, and one of the most widely used conventional plasmonic material, Au. Fano resonance-based plasmonic sensors leads to sensitivity = 188.5 nm/RIU, 242.5 nm/RIU, and 244.9 nm/RIU for Au, ZrN, and HfN, respectively.

Using the 2016 National Ambulatory Medical Survey (NAMCS), we estimated what proportion of visits were amenable to telehealth before COVID-19 as a guide. We divided services into those that needed in-person care and those that could be done via telehealth. Any visit that included at least 1 service where in-person care was needed was counted as an in-person only visit. We then calculated what proportion of reported visits and services in 2016 could have been provided via telehealth, as well as what proportion of in-person only services were done by primary care. We found that 66% of all primary care visits reported in NAMCS in 2016 required an in-person service. 90% of all wellness visits and immunizations were done in primary care offices, as were a quarter of all Papanicolaou smears.

MATSIM simulates daily activities and mobility dynamics of the population. EPISIM simulates the spread of the virus in the population using contact networks computed by MATSIM. A synthetic population of Montreal is defined to replicate the main observed sociodemographic characteristics of Montrealers as well as their activity and mobility patterns. The definition of the synthetic population relies on various data sources: household travel survey, census, real estate, car ownership, and housing data. In the business-as-usual scenario, findings underline the significant role of home, work, and school activities in community transmission of COVID-19. Secondary activities, including leisure and shopping, also help spread the virus, but to a lesser degree in comparison with primary activities. The risk of infection in the workplace depends on the economic sector. Healthcare workers are, by far, the most exposed workers to the virus. Workplace infections mirror the gender-biased job market of Montreal. Most infections in the healthcare and educational services are among women. Most infections in the manufacturing, construction, transportation, and warehousing industries are among men. In the business-as-usual scenario where community transmission is high, primary and secondary school-aged children are found to be a major transmission vector of the virus. Finally, simulation results suggest that the risk of infection in the public transportation system is low. ?

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the association between biomarkers of myocardial injury, coagulation, and severe COVID-19 and death in hospitalized patients. METHODS: Studies were identified through a systematic search of indexed articles in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus, published between December 2019 to August 2021. Effect estimates from individual studies for association between markers of myocardial injury (Troponin), myocardial stretch (N-terminal-pro hormone BNP, NT-proBNP), and coagulopathy (D-Dimer) and death or severe/critical COVID-19 were pooled using inverse variance weighted random-effects model. Odds Ratios (OR), Hazard Ratios (HR), and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were pooled separately and reported by outcomes of critical/severe COVID-19 and death. A meta-analysis of proportions was also performed to summarize the pooled prevalence of co-morbidities in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. RESULTS: We included 62 articles, with a total of 41,013 patients. The pooled proportion of patients with history of hypertension was 39% (95% CI: 34-44%); diabetes, 21% (95% CI: 18%-24%); coronary artery disease, 13% (95% CI: 10-16%); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 7% (95% CI: 5-8%), and history of cancer, 5% (95% CI: 4-7%). Elevated troponin was associated with higher pooled odds of critical/severe COVID-19 and death [Odds Ratio (OR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.42-2.16)]; and also separately for death (OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.32-2.25), and critical/severe COVID-1919 (OR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.45-2.40).

This paper proposes functional data analysis (FDA) to improve the prediction of temporal patterns of influenza. METHODS: We illustrate FDA methods using the weekly Influenza-like Illness (ILI) activity level data from the U.S. We propose to use the Fourier basis function for transforming discrete weekly data to the smoothed functional ILI activities. Functional analysis of variance (FANOVA) is used to examine the regional differences in temporal patterns and the impact of state's political orientation. RESULTS: The ILI activity has a very distinct peak at the beginning and end of the year. There are significant differences in average level of ILI activities among geographic regions. However, the temporal patterns in terms of the peak and flat time are quite consistent across regions. The geographic and temporal patterns of ILI activities also depend on the political make-up of states. The states affiliated with Republicans had higher ILI activities than those affiliated with Democrats across the whole year. The influence of political party affiliation on temporal pattern is quite different among geographic regions. CONCLUSIONS: Functional data analysis can help us to reveal the temporal variability in average ILI levels, rate of change in ILI levels, and the effect of geographical regions.

Heavy metals are metabolized and incorporated into bee products, including honey and honey bee venom (apitoxin). Their composition reflects contamination of bee environment, providing information about heavy metal contamination in the neighborhood of human dwellings. Moreover, assessment of bee products contamination is relevant for medicine, as they are a tool for promising therapeutic and chemoprophylactic strategies against COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). Owing to the complicated matrix, the developed method consists of wet mineralization with sulfuric acid, nitric acid, under increased temperature, and pressure and subsequent repeated boiling with concentrated nitric acid. Determination of the selected metals was carried out by anodic or cathodic stripping voltammetry on two types of electrodes: pen-type hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE) and PLA filament with carbon conductive admixture (PLA-C) for 3D printer. Contents of lead and cadmium in all analyzed bee venom samples were on the level of mg kg(?1), of nickel and copper about ten times higher, and of zinc on the level of g kg(?1).

There are multiple resources available to train providers in ultrasound, but they are all associated with significant cost. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) mandates anesthesiology residents to be competent in diagnostic and therapeutic uses of ultrasound. In this paper, we describe how an academic anesthesiology department implemented a POCUS curriculum for resident training. Methods: An anesthesiologist intensivist directed program was created to train residents in POCUS. We started by training a group of seven critical care trained anesthesiologists with the guidance of cardiologists. These anesthesiologists participated in the training of our anesthesiology residents. A hybrid curriculum consisting of a simulator as well as hands-on scanning of patients was created. We recorded the time that personnel spent in the training program as well as the money spent in acquiring equipment. Results: Seven faculty utilized a total of 270 hours of scanning and teaching time to train 48 residents who rotated through the ICU between July 2017 and June 2018. Simulation technicians used 48 hours to guide residents through simulation scenarios. The education administrator used 24 hours to coordinate sessions for residents. The technician and coordinator were both employees of the department with no additional cost for their responsibilities. The cost of equipment, including the ultrasound machine and simulator, was $45,000. An additional charge of $3500 was incurred for technician training time. Conclusion: Implementing a robust, sustainable POCUS curriculum requires a significant investment of time and money. Simulators and e-learning can allow efficiency in resource allocation and control cost in orienting new students to ultrasound. Having residents go through the simulator decreased the time that faculty would otherwise have spent going over basics with the students while allowing students to master these skills at their own pace. Advances in ultrasound technology have created newer, more affordable machines which can decrease cost considerably. It would serve departments well to consider alternatives and plan for resources when deciding to implement POCUS curriculum for resident training.","output":"Resource Utilization in Implementation of a Point of Care Ultrasound Curriculum for Resident Training in Anesthesiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The health crisis linked to the COVID-19 epidemic has required lockdown measures in France and changes in practices in dialysis centers. The objective was to assess the depressive and anxiety symptoms during lockdown in hemodialysis patients and their caregivers. METHODS: We sent, during lockdown period, between April and May 2020, self-questionnaires to voluntary subjects (patients and caregivers), treated by hemodialysis or who worked in hemodialysis in one of the 14 participating centers in France. We analyzed their perception of dialysis sessions (beneficial or worrying), their stress level (VAS rated from 0 to 10), their anxiety and depressive symptoms (Hospital anxiety and depression scale). Factors associated with stress, anxiety and depression were analyzed with multiple linear regression models. RESULTS: 669 patients and 325 caregivers agreed to participate. 70 % of participants found it beneficial to come to dialysis during confinement. The proportions of subjects with a stress level  6 linked to the epidemic, confinement, fear of contracting COVID-19 and fear of infecting a loved one were respectively 23.9%, 26.2%, 33.4% and 42%. 39.2% presented with certain (13.7%) or doubtful (19.2%) anxious symptoms. 21.2% presented a certain (7.9%) or doubtful (13.3%) depressive symptomatology. Age, gender, history of psychological disorders and perception of dialysis sessions were associated with levels of stress, anxiety and depression.

This new life-threatening disease has put healthcare systems under pressure, with increased need of palliative care provided to many patients by clinicians with limited prior experience in this field. Therefore, we aimed to make consensus recommendations for palliative care for patients with COVID-19 using the Convergence of Opinion on Recommendations and Evidence (CORE) process. METHODS: We invited 90 international experts to complete an online survey including stating their agreement, or not, with 14 potential recommendations. At least 70% agreement on directionality was needed to provide consensus recommendations. If consensus was not achieved on the first round, a second round was conducted. RESULTS: 68 experts (75.6%) responded in the first round. Most participants were experts in palliative care, respiratory medicine or critical care medicine. In the first round, consensus was achieved on 13 recommendations based upon indirect evidence and clinical experience. In the second round, 58/68 (85.3%) of the first round experts responded, resulting in consensus also for the 14th recommendation. CONCLUSIONS: This multi-national task force provides consensus recommendations for palliative care for patients with COVID-19 concerning: advance care planning; (pharmacological) palliative treatment of breathlessness; clinician-patient communication; remote clinician-family communication; palliative care involvement in patients with serious COVID-19; spiritual care; psychosocial care; and bereavement care.

For ease of use and universal applicability, surrogate virus neutralization tests (sVNTs) based on antibody-mediated blockage of molecular interactions have been proposed. A surrogate virus neutralization test was established on a label-free immunoassay platform (LF-sVNT). The LF-sVNT analyzes the binding ability of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to ACE2 after neutralizing RBD with antibodies in serum. The LF-sVNT neutralizing antibody titers (IC50) were determined from serum samples (n=246) from COVID-19 patients (n=113), as well as the IgG concentrations and the IgG avidity indices. Although there was variability in the kinetics of the IgG concentrations and neutralizing antibody titers between individuals, there was an initial rise, plateau and then in some cases a gradual decline at later timepoints after 40 days post-symptom onset. The IgG avidity indices, in the same cases, plateaued after an initial rise and did not show a decline. The LF-sVNT can be a valuable tool in research and clinical laboratories for the assessment of the presence of neutralizing antibodies to COVID-19. This study is the first to provide longitudinal neutralizing antibody titers beyond 200 days post-symptom onset. Despite the decline of IgG concentration and neutralizing antibody titer, IgG avidity index increases, reaches a plateau and then remains constant up to 8 months post-infection. The decline of antibody neutralization activity can be attributed to the reduction in antibody quantity rather than the deterioration of antibody quality, as measured by antibody avidity.","output":"A SARS-CoV-2 Label-Free Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test and a Longitudinal Study of Antibody Characteristics in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: COVID pandemic created unprecedented challenges for actual health care systems with hundreds of surgeries suspended with impact in Abdominal Wall Surgery (AWS) and other benign diseases.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted using data since January 2018 to May 2021. Our Hospital and Surgical Department suffered great organizational changes, namely creation of: dedicated medical and staff teams for COVID + (C+) and COVID- (C-) patients; dedicated pathways in our operating rooms for C+ cases; and, ultimately, designed and implemented protocols and agreements to maintain our Department fully operational, with a secure shift from elective to outpatient surgeries. RESULTS: During the study, a global number of 2541 AWS were performed. In the era pre-COVID (2018 - February 2020), we performed 968 surgeries with an average number of 37,2 AWS/month. Despite COVID pandemic (march 2020 - may 2021), our department performed a total of 1573 AWS, with an average number of 112,4 AWS/month.

While traditional short-course fractionation regimens are suitable for most patients, a minority may derive gains from higher doses of PRT. Compared to older regimens such as 13 fractions of 3 Gy, more hypofractionated, non-ablative concepts with reduced overall treatment time are not well studied. Methods Retrospective analysis (2017-2020) of 107 patients treated to metastatic lesions (one or two target volumes per patient) with traditional >2 weeks regimens or newer 2 weeks regimens, e.g. seven fractions of 5 Gy or five fractions of 6 Gy. Results Failure to complete radiotherapy was registered in 8% of patients (traditional fractionation) and 1%, respectively (p=0.12). Moderate rates of PRT30 were observed (11% and 6%, respectively, p=0.44). PRT30 was more likely in patients irradiated for brain or lymph node metastases. Utilization of newer 2 weeks regimens was highest in 2020, presumably as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Conclusion The implementation of newer fractionation regimens for selected patients has resulted in acceptable rates of non-completion and PRT30. Optimal selection criteria remain to be determined.

Although this expansion process of progenitors is highly important, its regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. NANOS3 is an RNA-binding protein expressed in the progenitor population. We demonstrated that the conditional deletion of Nanos3 at a later embryonic stage results in the reduction of spermatogonial progenitors in the postnatal testis. This reduction was associated with the premature differentiation of progenitors. Furthermore, this premature differentiation caused seminiferous stage disagreement between adjacent spermatogenic cells, which influenced spermatogenic epithelial cycles, leading to disruption of the later differentiation pathway. Our study suggests that NANOS3 plays an important role in timing progenitor expansion to adjust to the proper differentiation timing by blocking the retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway.","output":"NANOS3 suppresses premature spermatogonial differentiation to expand progenitors and fine-tunes spermatogenesis in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the arts and cultural sector due to the closure of galleries, museums, arts venues, and other cultural assets represents a significant health risk, new opportunities for arts and cultural engagement have arisen.

Maintaining a knowledgeable, adaptable and compassionate paediatric workforce will help healthcare systems adapt to an expected longer-term impact on child health, including widening of inequalities and increased mental health problems. With disruption to paediatric services and cancellation of face-to-face teaching, we needed to make radical changes to our regional training.ObjectivesWe share our experience in designing a multi-faceted online learning programme (OLP) and discuss the opportunities and challenges encountered.MethodsA structured, centralised and curriculum-mapped OLP with supplementary workplace-based learning packs (LP) was instigated for paediatric trainees of all levels in our region since March 2020. Data was collected from online surveys, YouTube channel hits, GoToMeet platform and virtual focus groups.ResultsOpportunities: This was a trainee-led and centred programme adapted in response to trainee feedback. The generated synchronous and asynchronous materials were popular: as of January 2021, 231 sessions were streamed lasting 19,418 minutes and attended by 14,470 users. Furthermore, when surveyed, 552 respondents rated the live sessions 4.7/5 for educational value. Our priority was to offer online learning to preserve trainees continued ability to meet curriculum competencies. The LPs were specifically designed with matched Progress Domain competencies. We surveyed learners covering 80% of training sites;62% accessing the LPs attested to their value in supplementing teaching and enhancing self-directed learning and 54% used them to facilitate local small group teaching and simulation. The centralisation of learning on the virtual platform enabled involvement of healthcare workers (HCW) from across the region, widening access to high-quality teaching and engagement in discussions on advancement in research and consensus of best practice. From March-September 2020, sessions were run by a multi-disciplinary and inter-speciality group of educators from 13 different NHS trusts.Barriers: Facilitating a psychologically safe learning environment is a major challenge as explicit strategies previously available are poorly translated to the online environment. Educators technical capability and the availability of technical support, although may seem trivial, can positively impact on an educators capacity to be virtually present, channelling their cognitive load towards high-quality facilitation of learning. Having open and honest discussions on sensitive and confidential matters such as safeguarding necessitates a non-judgemental, protected space. In these scenarios, limitation of the virtual environment is evident. Although some courses have thrived when converted to the digital platform, an online forum is not appropriate for all contents (eg Child Bereavement Course). Lastly, a notable barrier is the blurring of home and work environments. The added pressure to connect to online events and remain visible during a period trainees are overstretched physically, mentally and emotionally may increase HCW stress and risk burn out.ConclusionsA well-designed and inclusive virtual specialty training proved vital during the pandemic. Appropriate recognition and addressing of barriers to online learning would allow positive aspects to be continued into blended teaching programmes in the future.","output":"Regional online learning programme: experience on its opportunities and barriers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We estimate that 208,000 deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices have implanted to address neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders worldwide DBS Think Tank presenters pooled data and determined that DBS expanded in its scope and has been applied to multiple brain disorders in an effort to modulate neural circuitry The DBS Think Tank was founded in 2012 providing a space where clinicians, engineers, researchers from industry and academia discuss current and emerging DBS technologies and logistical and ethical issues facing the field The emphasis is on cutting edge research and collaboration aimed to advance the DBS field The Eighth Annual DBS Think Tank was held virtually on September 1 & 2nd, 2020 (Zoom Video Communications) due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic The meeting focused on advances in: (1) optogenetics as a tool for comprehending neurobiology of diseases and on optogenetically-inspired DBS, (2) cutting edge of emerging DBS technologies, (3) ethical issues affecting DBS research and access to care, (4) neuromodulatory approaches for depression, (5) advancing novel hardware, software and imaging methodologies, (6) use of neurophysiological signals in adaptive neurostimulation, and (7) use of more advanced technologies to improve DBS clinical outcomes There were 178 attendees who participated in a DBS Think Tank survey, which revealed the expansion of DBS into several indications such as obesity, post-traumatic stress disorder, addiction and Alzheimers disease This proceedings summarizes the advances discussed at the Eighth Annual DBS Think Tank","output":"Proceedings of the Eighth Annual Deep Brain Stimulation Think Tank: Advances in Optogenetics, Ethical Issues Affecting DBS Research, Neuromodulatory Approaches for Depression, Adaptive Neurostimulation, and Emerging DBS Technologies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several point-of-care (POC) molecular tests have received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

International migrants may not receive adequate and timely disease information during epidemics, increasing vulnerability to disease transmission. This is one of very limited studies focusing on international migrants' COVID-19 prevention knowledge and attitudes during the epidemic. Methods: A national cross-sectional online survey was conducted across 100 cities and 26 regions in China from February 17 and March 1, 2020. The sample included 1,426 international migrants representing 77 countries and 6 continents. Knowledge was defined as the number of correct responses to questions about COVID-19. Attitudes included worries, expectations, and general preparedness. Multivariable ordinal logistic regressions evaluated correlates of knowledge and attitudes including information channels and preferences, and trust in Chinese institutions and groups. Results: Just half of the sample, 730/1426 (51.2%) had a good level of knowledge and 656/1426 (46.0%) had a positive attitude towards the COVID-19 epidemic. Knowledge was associated with receiving information through social media (aOR: 2.0, 95%CI: 1.2-3.2), the Internet (aOR: 1.4, 95%CI: 1.2-1.8), the community (aOR: 1.5, 95%CI: 1.2-1.8), and encountering language barriers when receiving medical services (aOR: 0.8, 95%CI: 0.7-1.0). Positive attitude was associated with the level of trust in various Chinese institutions and groups. Conclusions: Roughly half of the sample reported inadequate knowledge and poor attitudes toward prevention and control of COVID-19. Tailored public health campaigns are needed to ensure that international migrants possess adequate knowledge to protect their health during future epidemics and disasters.","output":"Disease knowledge and attitudes during the COVID-19 epidemic among international migrants in China: a national cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction and Objectives In many studies, varying degrees of liver damage have been reported in more than half of the COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of liver biochemical parameters abnormality on mortality in critical COVID-19 patients who have been followed in the ICU since the beginning of the pandemic process. Materials and Methods In this study 533 critical patients who admitted to the ICU due to COVID-19 were included. The patients were divided into three groups according to their ALT, AST, and total bilirubin levels at their admission to the ICU. Group 1 was formed of patients with normal liver biochemical parameters values;Group 2 was formed of patients with liver biochemical parameters abnormality;Group 3 was formed of patients with liver injury. Results 353 (66.2%) of all patients died. Neutrophil, aPTT, CRP, LDH, CK, ALT, AST, bilirubin, procalcitonin and ferritin values in Group 2 and Group 3 were found to be statistically significantly higher than Group 1. It was detected that the days of stay in ICU of the patients in Group 1 was statistically significantly longer than others group. It was found that the patients in Groups 2 and 3 had higher total, 7-day, and 28-day mortality rates than expected.

One such pandemic strain of coronavirus was recently identified in December 2019 and lead to a devastating outbreak in Wuhan city of China. It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is highly contagious which causes symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to highlight the current understanding, research and therapeutic updates of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A thorough literature search was conducted for research papers and patents in context to COVID-19. All articles with respect to this subject was taken from various public repositories such as Google Scholar, Pubmed, ScienceDirect (Elsevier), Springer, Web of Science, etc. Results: The present analysis showed that key areas of the inventions were the vaccines and diagnostic kits apart from the composition for the treatment of CoV. It was also observed that no specific vaccine treatments are available for the treatment of 2019-nCov; however, developing novel chemical or biological drugs and kits for early diagnosis, prevention, and disease management is the primary governing topic among the patented inventions. The present study also indicates potential research opportunities for the future, particularly to combat 2019-nCoV. The current focus of the researches has turned towards developing four potential treatments including development of candidate vaccine, development of novel potential drugs, repurposing of existing drugs and development of convalescent plasma therapy. The PCR based diagnosis is the gold standard for the COVID-19 testing but it require resource time, expertise and high associated cost hence the researchers are also developing different diagnosis methods for the COVID-19. Although vaccines are being developed by various companies and have passed the pre-clinical stages but still there exists no guarantee for these to become the effective vaccine. The current treatments which are being used for COVID-19 patients are not well established and have limited success. CONCLUSION: The pandemic has challenged the medical, economic and public health infrastructure across globe. There is urgent need to explore all available and possible methods/approaches to study this disease for drug and vaccine development at the earliest.","output":"The insights of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Current understanding, research and therapeutic updates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The resection strategy for rectal neuroendocrine tumors (NET) < 10 mm is not uniform. We compared the utility of underwater endoscopic mucosal resection (UEMR) to endoscopic submucosal resection with a ligation device (ESMR-L) to resect rectal NETs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with rectal NET < 10 mm treated with UEMR or ESMR-L were included. Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were divided into a UEMR group (n = 7) and an ESMR-L group (n = 25). Histopathological diagnosis of NET by biopsy was known before resection in 43% (3/7) in the UEMR group and 68% (17/25) in the ESMR-L group, (p = 0.379). UEMR was performed on an outpatient basis for all patients, and 92% of ESMR-L (23/25) were performed as inpatient procedures (p < 0.001). The procedure time was significantly shorter in the UEMR group than in the ESMR-L group [median (IQR), min, 6 (5C8) vs. 12 (9C14), p = 0.002]. En bloc resection and R0 resection rates were 100% in both groups. Pathological evaluations were predominantly NET G1 in both groups (UEMR: 7/7, 100% and ESMR-L: 23/25, 92%). Two patients in the ESMR-L group developed delayed bleeding, controlled by endoscopic hemostasis. Device costs were significantly higher in the ESMR-L group than the UEMR group by approximately US$180 [median (IQR), $90.45 (83.64C108.41) vs. $274.73 (265.86C292.45), P < 0.001]. CONCLUSION: UEMR results in similar resection quality with shorter procedure time and lower costs compared to ESMR-L.

The right to healthcare during armed conflict and its lack of enforcement despite a range of United Nations mandated requirements regarding health and healthcare provisions is likely to be a significant feature in future conflicts, as zoonotic induced pandemics become a more common global public health challenge. The issue of enforcement of health rights assurance and its implications for the public health management of global pandemics such as COVID-19 in and between countries and regions in conflict is the objective of this Review. Study Design Narrative Review. Methods Referenced to the framework of International humanitarian law (IHL) and International human rights law (IHRL) in order to explore and discuss the deficits in health rights assurances in conflict settings and illustrate how gaps in protection and lack of enforcement compounds the disease response. Both international humanitarian law, and international human rights law can be leveraged to ensure human and health rights are assured in conflict settings. There is a distinct lack of international criteria with regard to standards of health care coverage, infrastructure and service preservation to the civilian population during times of armed conflict. This has far reaching consequences when confounded by a pandemic or even localised disease outbreak. Results We illustrate how in a pandemic disease emergency, such as COVID-19, all life is threatened; and how leaving the citizen population exposed to this contagion is a human rights breach and an indirect method of warfare. The consequences of failure to effectively address such pandemic infections, (i.e. COVID-19), in a conflict setting are potentially catastrophic as prevention and containment responses are severely constrained by state insecurity, political instability, terrorism, repression, rights abuses and displacement of citizens. Neglect by State actors potentially constitutes a breach of the universal right to life. States cannot justify their failures to mitigate disease based on claims of lack of resources, even when available resources are minimal. Where discrimination of people with a disease, such as COVID-19, or minority groups at the point of access to health facilities occurs, this further breaches the principle of medical neutrality. Conclusions The example of the COVID-19 response may offer a viable route to leverage greater access and coverage of health care in conflict and humanitarian settings. A radicalised partnership approach during these times of emergency is warranted, based on an ethical humanitarian intervention approach to provide care to all affected by contagious disease in conflict settings..","output":"The right to health, public health and COVID-19: A discourse on the importance of the enforcement of humanitarian and human rights law in conflict settings for the future management of zoonotic pandemic diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The beauty device market, which enables simple skincare for those with busy lives, is growing steadily as an increasing number of people are trying to take care of their skin at home to save time and money. As opposed to dermatologists and esthetics centers, which require regular visits, the fact that their skin can be easily managed in leisure hours at home attracts consumers who value convenience. Thus, various beauty-care devices that use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been launched. However, in the case of skincare devices using LEDs, pressure is expected to be applied to ones face. Therefore, there is a need to develop a design based on ergonomic measurements that can distribute the pressure evenly on the skin. This study analyzed data to create a design for certain skincare devices that can be worn as glasses, using a three-dimensional human-measurement database of South Korean women between 30 and 49 y, as they are the major consumers of such devices.

The central event in the pathogenesis of toxoplasmosis is the conversion of tachyzoites into encysted bradyzoites.

The objective of this study was to quantify the geometrical complexity of T. gondii cysts by morphological, particle, and fractal analysis, as well as to determine if and how it is impacted by parasite strain, cyst age, and host factors. Analyses were performed on 31 images of T. gondii brain cysts of four type-2 strains (the reference Me49 strain and three local isolates, named BGD1, BGD14, and BGD26) using ImageJ software package. The parameters of interest included diameter, circularity, relative particle count (RPC), fractal dimension (FD), lacunarity, and packing density (PD). Although cyst diameter varied widely, its negative correlation with RPC was observed. Circularity was remarkably close to 1, indicating that the shape of the brain cysts was a perfect circle. RPC, FD, and PD did not vary among cysts of different strains, age, and derived from mice of different genetic background. Conversely, lacunarity, which is a measure of heterogeneity, was significantly lower for BGD1 strain vs. all other strains, and higher for Me49 vs. BGD14 and BGD26, but did not differ among Me49 cysts of different age, and derived from genetically different mice. This study is the first application of fractal analysis in describing the structural complexity of T. gondii cysts. Despite all the differences among the analyzed cysts, most parameters remained conserved. Fractal analysis is a novel and widely accessible approach, which along with particle analysis may be applied to gain further insight into T. gondii cyst morphology.","output":"Computational image analysis reveals the structural complexity of Toxoplasma gondii tissue cysts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: When it comes to scheduling interviews, medical students may wonder if they need a strategy to increase their likelihood of matching. Previous studies examined the temporal effects of the residency interview on overall match rate; however, there are additional factors that affect the match process, including board examination scores and letters of recommendation. Only few studies have examined the effect interview time of day has on match success.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this review we identified 136 published studies in PubMed's curated literature database LitCovid on SARS-CoV-2 detection methods in tissues and evaluated them regarding sources of error, specificity, and sensitivity of the methods, taking into account our own experience. RESULTS: Currently, no sufficiently specific histomorphological alterations or diagnostic features for COVID-19 are known. Therefore, three approaches for SARS-CoV-2 detection are used: RNA, proteins/antigens, or morphological detection by electron microscopy. In the preanalytical phase, the dominant source of error is tissue quality, especially the different intervals between sample collection and processing or fixation (and its duration) and specifically the interval between death and sample collection in autopsies. However, this information is found in less than half of the studies (e.g., in only 42% of autopsy studies). Our own experience and first studies prove the significantly higher sensitivity and specificity of RNA-based detection methods compared to antigen or protein detection by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. Detection by electron microscopy is time consuming and difficult to interpret. CONCLUSIONS: Different methods are available for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in tissue.

Additionally, these viruses have been serially passaged in cell culture, which may result in adaptations that affect virusChost interactions. We have isolated RSV from mucosal secretions of 12 patients in the winters 2016C2017 and 2017C2018, of which eight RSV-A subtypes and four RSV-B subtypes.

We observed that viruses isolated in one RSV season show differences on the tested assays. Furthermore, comparison with RSV A2 and RSV B1 reveals for some RSV isolates differences in viral replication kinetics, thermal stability and fusion capacity. Major differences are, however, not observed and differences between the recent isolates and reference strains is, overall, similar to the observed variation in between the recent isolates.

It is still unclear how fast the virus evolved and how the virus interacts with other microorganisms in the lung. METHODS: We have conducted metatranscriptome sequencing for the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of eight SARS-CoV-2 patients, 25 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients, and 20 healthy controls. RESULTS: The median number of intra-host variants was 1-4 in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, which ranged between 0 and 51 in different samples. The distribution of variants on genes was similar to those observed in the population data (110 sequences). However, very few intra-host variants were observed in the population as polymorphism, implying either a bottleneck or purifying selection involved in the transmission of the virus, or a consequence of the limited diversity represented in the current polymorphism data. Although current evidence did not support the transmission of intra-host variants in a person-to-person spread, the risk should not be overlooked. The microbiota in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was similar to those in CAP, either dominated by the pathogens or with elevated levels of oral and upper respiratory commensal bacteria. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 evolves in vivo after infection, which may affect its virulence, infectivity, and transmissibility. Although how the intra-host variant spreads in the population is still elusive, it is necessary to strengthen the surveillance of the viral evolution in the population and associated clinical changes.","output":"Genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in Coronavirus Disease 2019 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is vast demand in Africa for technological development including modernization of higher education.

A virtual private network is the extension of a private network that encompasses links through shared or public networks, such as the Internet. A VPN is a transmission network service for businesses with two or more remote locations. It offers a range of access speeds and options depending on the needs of each site. This service supports voice, data and video and is fully managed by the service provider, including routing equipment installed at the customers premises. According to its characteristics, VPN has widely deployed on COVID-19 offering extensive services to connect roaming employees to their corporate networks and have access to all the company information and applications. Hence, VPN focuses on two important issues such as security and Quality-of-Service. This latter has a direct relationship with network performance such as delay, bandwidth, throughput, and jitter. Traditionally, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) accommodate static point-to-point resource demand, named, Layer 1 VPN (L1VPN). The primary disadvantage of L1VPN is that the data plane connectivity does not guarantee control plane connectivity. Layer 2 VPN is designed to provide end-to-end layer 2 connection by transporting layer 2 frames between distributed sites. An L2VPN is suitable for supporting heterogeneous higher-level protocols. In this paper we propose an enhanced routing protocol based on Traffic Split Routing (TSR) and Shortest Path Routing (SPR) algorithms. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the Shortest Path Routing (SPR) in term of network resources.

The cells from immunized mice which proliferated most actively in response to MHV were positive for the CD4 antigen and secreted interferon-. In addition, the most responsive subset of cells did not express gpg0MEL-14, the lymph node-specific homing receptor. The results identify a subpopulation of CD4+ T cells that may be an important component of the cell-mediated immune response to this virus. The data also suggest that response to the M protein is important in preventing disease progression in C57BL/6 mice since cells which recognize this protein are absent from persistently infected mice.","output":"Immune response to a murine coronavirus: Identification of a homing receptor-negative CD4+ T cell subset that responds to viral glycoproteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) represents thousands of years in treatment protocols for health, healing, and longevity and has evolved into a complex healthcare system. The following chapter is designed to give a basic concise overview of TCM principles and practices, in relation to clinical pharmacology, and focuses on mutually relevant areas of interest. Much as society learned to harness electrical currents to empower machinery, TCM theories of energetic patterns help to empower the functionality of the human body. The major theories include the vital life force, known as Qi, Yin and Yang, Five Elements, herbal medicine, multivariate diagnostics, syndrome differentiation, and acupuncture, among others. In TCM, there is a direct relationship to the energy of nature and the energetic patterns within the human body and the human consciousness. This comprehensive approach is gaining momentum in clinical and network pharmacology, as new technologies emerge regarding TCM collaborative compounds versus singular chemical constituents in treatment modalities. Of major importance to clinical pharmacology are recent TCM evidenced-based empirical studies, correlations, and interactions between herbs and pharmaceuticals, updated data on toxicity, adverse reactions, quality assurance, and herbal medicine standardization. Global concerns over antimicrobial resistance to drugs have put a spotlight on TCM herbal medicines as alternatives with greatly reduced resistance factors. From ancient archives to the Nobel Prize to a formal endorsement by the World Health Organization as a global healthcare system, TCM has widened the lens of modern science.

METHODS: We develop a dynamic disease model to assess the effectiveness of face masks in reducing the spread of COVID-19, during an initial outbreak and a later resurgence, as a function of mask effectiveness, coverage, intervention timing, and time horizon. We instantiate the model for the COVID-19 outbreak in New York, with sensitivity analyses on key natural history parameters. RESULTS: During the initial epidemic outbreak, with no social distancing, only 100% coverage of masks with high effectiveness can reduce the effective reproductive number Re below 1. During a resurgence, with lowered transmission rates due to social distancing measures, masks with medium effectiveness at 80% coverage can reduce Re below 1 but cannot do so if individuals relax social distancing efforts. Full mask coverage could significantly improve outcomes during a resurgence: with social distancing, masks with at least medium effectiveness could reduce Re below 1 and avert almost all infections, even with intervention fatigue. For coverage levels below 100%, prioritizing masks that reduce the risk of an infected individual from spreading the infection rather than the risk of a susceptible individual from getting infected yields the greatest benefit. LIMITATIONS: Data regarding COVID-19 transmission are uncertain, and empirical evidence on mask effectiveness is limited. Our analyses assume homogeneous mixing, providing an upper bound on mask effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Even moderately effective face masks can play a role in reducing the spread of COVID-19, particularly with full coverage, but should be combined with social distancing measures to reduce Re below 1.[Box: see text].","output":"Effectiveness of Face Masks in Reducing the Spread of COVID-19: A Model-Based Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Increased serum levels of IL-6 and TNF- have been proposed as biomarkers for COVID-19 progression. However, the role and the implication of these cytokines in SARS-CoV-2 infection remain controversial. The aim of this study was to measure levels of IL-6 and TNF- in swab samples from individuals with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and analyze their association with SARS-CoV-2 presence. Methods SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed using the CDC (USA) real-time RT-PCR primers, probes and protocols. Cytokine concentrations were measured using commercial reagents based on enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results TNF- median levels were greater in COVID19 (+) symptomatic group (5.88 (1.36 - 172.1) pg/ml) compared to COVID19 (?) symptomatic individuals (2.87 (1.45 C 69.9) pg/ml) (p=0.0003). No significant differences were shown in IL-6 median values between COVID-19 (+) and (?) symptomatic patients (5.40 (1.7 - 467) pg/ml and 6.07 (1.57 C 466.6) pg/ml respectively). In addition, increased TNF- levels (greater than 10 pg/ml), but not IL-6, were associated with SARS-CoV-2 presence (OR= 5.7; p=0.006; 95% CI= 1,551 to 19,11). Conclusions IL-6 concentration showed high levels in swabs from some symptomatic patients, suggesting the presence of immune response at viral entry site. However, IL-6 levels were independent from SARS-CoV-2 presence and viral load, individuals age and gender. On the contrary, TNF- evaluation confirmed the presence of inflammatory response but mostly related to COVID-19.

Herein, we report three highly conserved G-quadruplex motifs (SE-PGQ-1, 2, and3) in genome of all the 412 strains of Salmonella enterica. Bioinformatics analysis inferred the presence of SE-PGQ-1 in the regulatory region of mgtA, presence of SE-PGQ-2 in the open reading frame of entA and presence of SE-PGQ-3 in the promoter region of malE and malK genes. The products of mgtA and entA are involved in transport and homeostasis of Mg2+ and Fe3+ ion and thereby required for bacterial survival in the presence of reactive nitrogen/oxygen species produced by the host macrophages, whereas, malK and malE genes are involved in transport of maltose sugar, that is one of the major carbon source in the gastrointestinal tract of human. The formation of stable intramolecular G-quadruplex structures by SE-PGQs was confirmed by employing CD, EMSA and NMR spectroscopy. Cellular studies revealed the inhibitory effect of 9-amino acridine on Salmonella enterica growth. Next, CD melting analysis demonstrated the stabilizing effect of 9-amino acridine on SE-PGQs. Further, polymerase inhibition and RT-qPCR assays emphasize the biological relevance of predicted G-quadruplex in the expression of PGQ possessing genes and demonstrate the G-quadruplexes as a potential drug target for the devolping novel therapeutics for combating Salmonella enterica infection. Author Summary Since last several decades scientific community has witnessed a rapid increase in number of such human pathogenic bacterial species that acquired resistant to multiple antibacterial agents. Currently, emergence of multidrug-resistant strains remain a major public health concern for clinical investigators that rings a global alarm to search for novel and highly conserved drug targets. Recently, G-quadruplex structure forming nucleic acid sequences were endorsed as highly conserved Drug target for preventing infection of several human pathogens including viral and protozoan species. Therefore, here we explored the presence G-quadruplex forming motif in genome of Salmonella enterica bacteria that causes food poisoning, and enteric fever in human. The formation of intra molecular G-quadruplex structure in four genes (mgtA, entA, malE and malK) was confirmed by NMR, CD and EMSA. The 9-amino acridine, a known G-quadruplex binder has been shown to stabilize the predicted G-quadruplex motif and decreases the expressioin of G-quadruplex hourbouring genes using RT-PCR and cellular toxicity assay. This study concludes the presence of G-quadruplex motifs in essential genes of Salmonella enterica genome as a novel and conserved drug target and 9-amino acridine as candidate small molecule for preventing the infection of Salmonella enterica using a G4 mediated inhibition mechanism.","output":"G-quadruplex stabilization in the ions and maltose transporters inhibit Salmonella enterica growth and virulence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patient: Female, 29-year-old Final Diagnosis: COVID-19 Symptoms: Pregnancy Medication:  Clinical Procedure: Cesarian section ? spinal anesthesia Specialty: Anesthesiology OBJECTIVE: Unusual setting of medical care BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of the mindful use of financial and human resources.

This study assessed risk perception of COVID-19 and acceptability of its vaccine in Nigeria. It also assessed prediction of vaccine acceptance from risk perception. Methods: : A cross-sectional web-based study was conducted among 410 participants in the six geo-political regions of Nigeria using a three-part questionnaire developed using Google forms. The questionnaire link was distributed via snowball method to consenting participants through online platforms. Descriptive and inferential statistics (Chi-square and binomial regression) using Microsoft Excel and SPSS version 24 were used to analyze data, and p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

This study aimed to describe the psychiatric morbidity of patients with COVID-19 referred to liaison psychiatry services in Qatar. Method This study was a retrospective review of patient records of the first 100 consecutive SARS-Cov-2 positive patients referred to liaison psychiatry services. The study was approved by the Hamad Medical Corporation Institutional Review Board (IRB) (MRC-05C072). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Result The majority (n = 92) of 100 included patients were male and median age was 43 years. Patients were of diverse background with majority of South Asian (Indian, Pakistani, Bengali, Nepalese, and Afghan) (n = 60), followed by Qatari (n = 18) background. Mean length of hospital stay was 26.51 days. 35 patients had severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia, and 67 had at least one underlying physical comorbidity. Significant psychosocial stressors other than positive SARS-Cov-2 status, including lockdown, quarantine, finances and relationships issues were identified in 48 patients. A total of 35 patients had a positive past psychiatric history, out of which 17 were on maintenance psychotropic medications. Insomnia was the commonest psychiatric symptom (n = 65), followed by anxiety (n = 52), agitation (n = 42), depression (n = 39), changes in appetite (n = 32) and irritability (n = 30). The principal psychiatric diagnoses made were delirium (n = 29), acute stress reaction or adjustment disorder (n = 25), depression (n = 16), mania (n = 15), anxiety (n = 14), non-affective psychosis (n = 13), and dementia (n = 6). Approximately half of the patients with mania or non-affective psychosis had it as their first-onset disorder. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2, in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, is associated with a wide range of psychiatric morbidity which emphasizes clinicians vigilance for psychiatric symptoms. Insomnia was the commonest neuropsychiatric symptom which may have clinical practice and potential preventive strategies implications. Delirium, the commonest diagnosis in the study carries high morbidity and mortality and may reflect SARS-Cov-2 propensity to affect the brain directly and indirectly through a cytokine storm, organ failure, and prothrombotic state.

We hypothesized that aldose reductase inhibition with AT-001 (caficrestat) might represent a novel therapeutic approach to reduce viral inflammation and risk of adverse outcomes in diabetic patients with COVID-19. Methods We conducted an open-label prospective phase 2 clinical trial to assess safety, tolerability and efficacy of AT-001 (caficrestat) in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, history of diabetes mellitus and chronic heart disease. Eligible participants were prospectively enrolled and treated with AT-001 1500 mg twice daily for up to 14 days. Safety, tolerability, survival and length of hospital stay were collected from the electronic medical record and compared with data from two matched control groups selected from a deidentified contemporaneous registry of COVID-19 patients at the same institution. Results AT-001 (caficrestat) was safe and well tolerated in the 10 participants who received the study drug. The in-hospital mortality observed in the AT-001 (caficrestat) group was 20% vs. 31% in matched control-1 and 27% in matched control-2.

The extension of the Minimum Wages Act to domestic workers, the draft National Policy on Domestic Work, and the Domestic Workers Sector Skill Council (DWSSC) set up under the National Skill Development Council of the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship of Government of India, are examined in the paper in detail. The paper highlights how various state interventions have outlined the sector, the work, the workers and their everyday experiences and negotiations in terms of extending or framing these interventions. Examining the assumptions and objectives that have defined the formation of Domestic Workers Sector Skill Development council and its functioning, the paper argues that the attempt to corporatize the sector is a classic case of how the state tends to ignore the specificities that feature the sector leading to its poor impact.","output":"Misconstrued Notions and Misplaced Interventions: An Assessment of State Policy on Domestic Work in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Effective management of the spread of a novel infectious disease, such as the COVID-19 virus can be achieved through influencing peoples behavior to adopt preventive measures. The publics perceptions and attitudes towards the virus, governmental guidance and preventive measures were unknown in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVES: 1) investigate the public perception of COVID-19, anxiety level, the COVID-19 information sources sought, adoption of preventive measures, and ability and willingness to self-isolate during and post-lockdown periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia; 2) investigate socio-demographic factors associated with adoption of preventive measures against COVID-19 and self-isolation practices. METHOD: Between April 22nd and June 21st 2020, Saudi adults aged 18 years voluntarily completed a self-administered web-based cross-sectional survey, distributed through social media (WhatsApp) and emails to representatives in education, health, business, and social sectors across all Saudi Arabian regions. The survey included questions on anxiety level, COVID-19 risk perceptions and adoption of preventive measures. Weighted percentages, Pearsons chi-square tests, and multiple logistic regression were applied to evaluate associations between these factors and socio-demographic variables. RESULTS: A total of 2393 respondents completed the survey. A majority (74%) were worried about the COVID-19 outbreak and of those, 27% reported that it was likely that they would be infected with COVID-19; 16% believed it would be life-threatening or severe. However, only 11% of respondents reported high anxiety level. Adoption of hygiene practices and social distancing were lower among older (> 65 years) compared to younger (18C24 years) respondents (OR: 0.06; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.28 and OR 0.06; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.27 respectively). High percentages of respondents reported being able to (88%) and were willing to (82%) self-isolate. Those with the lowest gross household income and those with at least one flu symptom were less able and willing to self-isolate. A significant increase in levels of anxiety, perceived effectiveness of social distancing and hygiene practices was reported in the post-lockdown compared to during the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The study reported high levels of adoption of preventive measures, willingness and perceived ability to self-isolate during the early phase of the pandemic. Vulnerable groups such as the elderly, and those with low socio-economic status reported lower adoption of preventive measures or ability and willingness to self-isolate. Tailored public health messages and interventions are needed to achieve high adherence to these preventive measures in these groups.

More than 200 countries are impacted due to this pandemic. To light the COVID-19 virus we need a powerful monitoring system to identify the patients and isolate them. The current detection tests are either done by measuring the body temperature or spotting the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2. These techniques are time-consuming and have a poor detection rate. Radiological images like chest X-rays are also highlighted and help in the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Initial studies suggest that COVID-19 patients have abnormalities in their chest X-rays and can be used in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Based on this literature research, various solutions have been proposed utilizing chest X-rays to detect the SARS-CoV-2. Most of these solutions use non-public datasets and complicated structures with fewer accurate results. In our study, we propose a self-learning, interpretable model for real-time detection of COVID-19. This model utilizes a Differential evolution algorithm for feature selection and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier. The aim is to obtain higher accuracy in detecting COVID-19 infected patients using X-ray images. We have also used the LIME explanation algorithm to explain the predictability of our model and this makes our design very robust and sustainable.

Methods and Materials We developed an institutional protocol to define procedures for COVID testing and protection of patients, caregivers, and staff, hypothesizing that this protocol would allow patients requiring GA to be safely treated, minimizing COVID transmission risk to both patients and staff, at the same time maintaining pre-COVID patient volumes. All patients underwent COVID testing prior to their first treatment and thrice weekly during treatment. For COVID+ patients, RT was delivered in the last end-of-day treatment appointment. A negative pressure room was used for GA induction and recovery, and separate physician/nurse teams were designated for in-room vs. out-of-room patient management. Results Seventy-eight pediatric patients received RT under GA, vs. 69 over the same prior year timeframe, and 2 patients received 2 courses of RT under GA, for a total of 80 courses. The mean age was 4.9 y (range 0.5-19.0 y) and 41/78 (52.6%) were male. Two patients (2.6%) received two courses of radiotherapy under GA, establishing a total of 80 courses.

It is defined by a number of universal components, including oxidative stress, cellular response to DNA damage, unfolded protein response to mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress, changes in autophagy, inflammasome formation, non-coding RNA response, formation of an inducible network of signaling pathways, and epigenetic changes. The presence of an inducible receptor and secretory phenotype in many cells is the cause of tissue pro-inflammatory stress. The key phenomenon determining the occurrence of a classical inflammatory focus is the microvascular inflammatory response (exudation, leukocyte migration to the alteration zone). This same reaction at the systemic level leads to the development of life-critical systemic inflammation. From this standpoint, we can characterize the common mechanisms of pathologies that differ in their clinical appearance. The division of inflammation into alternative variants has deep evolutionary roots. Evolutionary aspects of inflammation are also described in the review. The aim of the review is to provide theoretical arguments for the need for an up-to-date theory of the relationship between key human pathological processes based on the integrative role of the molecular mechanisms of cellular and tissue pro-inflammatory stress.","output":"Inflammation: A New Look at an Old Problem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Apical periodontitis often manifests as a chronic and asymptomatic disease. The formation of chronic apical periodontitis lesion (CAPL) occurs due an imbalance between microorganisms in a root canal system and a hosts immune response. The pro-inflammatory characteristic of periapical granulomas has been established; increased IL-1, IL-6 and TNF- has been documented. In humans over 65 years of age, the immune system becomes more fragile, including a persistent inflammatory response, making them more susceptible to reactivation of latent viruses, bacterial and viral pathogens, autoimmune diseases, opportunistic infections and neoplasms. The question of this study is as follows: in aging adults, do chronic apical periodontitis lesions as biomarkers have a risk effect on the immunoexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-) compared to adults? The results demonstrated that the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and TNF showed higher expression in the CAPL of the elderly than in the adult control group, thus suggesting that aging could be considered a modifier of periradicular disease. However, although aging is not the main cause for the development of CAPL, it seems to be able to influence its evolution. However, further elaborate research studies/analyses to elucidate the reasons and consequences of inflammation in the elderly are recommended. ABSTRACT: Persistent inflammatory responses in the elderly may act as modifiers on the progression and repair of chronic apical periodontitis lesions (CAPLs). While the involvement of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF- in inflammatory responses and, particularly, in CAPL has been documented, their expression in elderly patients needs to be further characterized. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines in CAPL from elderly individuals with young/middle-aged individuals. Thirty CAPL (15 cysts and 15 granulomas) from elderly patients (>60 years) and 30 CAPL (15 cysts and 15 granuloma) from young/middle-aged individuals (20C56 years) were selected. Immunohistochemical reactions were performed against IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-. The slides were subdivided into five high-magnification fields and analyzed. The number of positive stains was evaluated for each antibody. There was no significant difference between the cytokines when the cysts and granuloma were compared in the two groups. In the young/middle-aged, only IL-1 showed a difference and was significantly higher in granulomas (p = 0.019). CAPL pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the elderly were significantly higher than in young/middle-aged individuals (p < 0.05). The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and TNF- were significantly higher in CAPL in the elderly compared with the young/middle-aged group. Further elaborate research studies/analyses to elucidate the reasons for and consequences of inflammation in the elderly are recommended.","output":"Aging as a Risk Factor on the Immunoexpression of Pro-Inflammatory IL-1, IL-6 and TNF- Cytokines in Chronic Apical Periodontitis Lesions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has seen a move away from face\\\\to\\\\face interactions and core psychiatry training has not been immune to this.

Histologic studies showed that this soft tissue breakdown is related to the innate immune system. We hypothesized 1) that a neutrophil biomarker could predict the outcome of direct pulp capping and 2) that using sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) as a lavage solution to remove necrotized infected pulp tissue could improve it. In this randomized trial in mature posterior teeth causing no or mild discomfort with carious pulpal exposures, pulpal fluid was collected to assess neutrophil gelatinase (matrix metalloproteinase 9 [MMP-9]) per total protein (TP) levels as a predictive local biomarker. Subsequently, the dentin-pulp wound was randomly washed with a 2.5% NaOCl or a physiologic saline solution (1:1 allocation), capped with mineral trioxide aggregate, and the tooth was immediately restored with a resin-based composite restoration. Ninety-six patients were included, and 84 individuals could be followed up to treatment failure or clinically confirmed pulp survival after a minimum of 1 y. The entire data were fitted to a Cox proportional hazards model to assess the influence of the observational variables MMP-9/TP and discomfort with the randomized lavage treatment on pulp survival. The Kaplan-Meier pulp survival rates after 1 y were 55% for saline and 89% for NaOCl lavage. The inflammatory state of the pulp tissue as reflected by MMP-9/TP levels and NaOCl lavage had a highly significant (P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively) impact on pulp survival, while mild preoperative discomfort did not.

Amongst this criticism, Short Food Supply Chains (SFSCs) have emerged as a promising sustainable alternative to the industrialized agri-food supply systems. In recent years there have been some attempts to explore the relationship between SFSCs and sustainability, but these are mostly theoretical discussions and lacks empirical validation. This study, therefore, attempts to provide empirical validation of the SFSCs and sustainability linkages. Additionally, from the theoretical perspective, our work extends the traditional triple bottom line constructs and explores two extra dimensions of sustainability in the food supply chain system, namely, governance and culture, thus exploring five dimensions of sustainability. Furthermore, while SFSCs have proven to improve farmers livelihoods and reconnect producers with consumers, little or no attention has been given to understand the consumers' attitudes towards the SFSC practices. Therefore, this study aims to explore the customers attitudes towards participating in SFSCs through the concept of a moral economy and personal relationship. Based on the 532 valid responses from Chinese consumers, our study shows that all five pillars of sustainability, moral economy and Chinese relationship have a positive influence on consumers participation in SFSCs. With its intuitive benefits, the economic pillar emerged as the most approved factor by the participants.

METHODS: 126 adults aged 18-84 completed online questionnaires including a 10-day daily diary module, during which they self-reported alone time, everyday creativity, and loneliness. Data were analyzed using multilevel models, controlling for study day, participation date, gender, and relationship status. RESULTS: Greater average amounts of alone time were associated with greater loneliness, an association that was stronger in old age. In a daily context, individuals reported feeling lonelier on days when they had more time to themselves than usual. This within-person association was weaker with older age. Everyday creativity did not moderate alone time-loneliness associations. However, holding time to oneself constant, participants felt less lonely and less bothered by alone time on days when they were more creative than usual.

Elective surgeries have been canceled or delayed in order to reallocate resources to the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Currently, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on bariatric and metabolic surgical practice remains unclear. METHODS: An internet-based online survey was performed among bariatric surgeons worldwide. The survey was sent to bariatric surgeons via the International Bariatric Club Facebook group and by electronic mail via the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and metabolic disorders (IFSO) secretariat to members of the associated national IFSO societies. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-nine (n = 169) bariatric surgeons participated in the survey. The majority of the respondents postponed preoperative upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopies, appointments in the outpatient clinic and bariatric operations. Most surgeons performed video calls for follow-up appointments instead of meeting the patients in the outpatient clinics. Laparoscopy was still the preferred treatment for surgical emergencies, but a trend towards conservative treatment of acute appendicitis and acute cholecystitis was shown. Rapid preoperative COVID-19 testing availability was poor; therefore, routine screening of emergency bariatric cases was not widely provided. A wide variance occurred regarding precautions and personal protection equipment among the participants. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic showed a strong impact on bariatric surgical practice regarding surgical and outpatient planning as well as personnel management. Coordinated effort from the national bariatric societies should focus on strict implementation of the current recommendations regarding precaution measures and personal protection equipment.

We sought to analyze 24-month adverse event (AE) rates, including a temporal analysis of the risk profile, associated with the thoracotomy approach for the HVAD system. METHODS: AEs from the LATERAL trial were evaluated over 2 years postimplant. Data was obtained from the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support database for 144 enrolled United States and Canadian patients. Temporal AE profiles were expressed as events per patient year. RESULTS: During 162.5 patient years of support, there were 25 driveline infections (0.15 events per patient year), 50 gastrointestinal bleeds (0.31 events per patient year), and 21 strokes (0.13 events per patient year). Longitudinal AE analysis at follow-up intervals of <30 and 30 to 180 days, and 6 to 12 and 12 to 24 months revealed the highest AE rate at <30 days, with a decrease in total AEs within the first 6 months.

Crystallography gives the impression that proteins adopt a fixed shape, yet enzymes are functionally dynamic. Molecular dynamics offers the possibility of probing protein movement while predicting ligand binding. Accordingly, we choose the bacterial F1Fo ATP synthase ? subunit to unravel why ATP affinity by ? subunits from Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus PS3 differs ~500-fold, despite sharing identical sequences at the ATP-binding site. METHODS: We first used the Bacillus PS3 ? subunit structure to model the B. subtilis ? subunit structure and used this to explore the utility of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the influence of residues outside the ATP binding site. To verify the MD predictions, point mutants were made and ATP binding studies were employed. RESULTS: MD simulations predicted that E102 in the B. subtilis ? subunit, outside of the ATP binding site, influences ATP binding affinity. Engineering E102 to alanine or arginine revealed a ~10 or ~54 fold increase in ATP binding, respectively, confirming the MD prediction that E102 drastically influences ATP binding affinity.

This study aims at identifying these complications and discussing their management. METHODS Data of 228 patients who underwent a LRYGB between October 2008 and December 2011 were reviewed retrospectively to evaluate the frequency and treatment of complications such as stenoses, marginal ulcers, perforated marginal ulcers, or anastomotic leaks related to the operation. RESULTS Follow-up information was available for 209 patients (91.7%) with a median follow-up of 38 months (range 24-62 months). Of these patients 16 patients (7.7%) experienced complications at the gastrojejunostomy. Four patients (1.9%) had stenoses and 12 patients (5.7%) marginal ulcers, one of them with perforation (0.5%). No anastomotic leaks were reported. One case with perforated ulcer and one with recurrent ulcers required surgical revision. CONCLUSION Gastrojejunal anastomotic complications are frequent and occur within the first few days or up to several years after surgery. Stenoses or marginal ulcers are usually successfully treated nonoperatively. Laparoscopic repair, meanwhile, is an appropriate therapeutic option for perforated ulcers.","output":"Gastrojejunal Anastomosis Complications and Their Management after Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A vilgmret?

No COVID-19 vaccines are yet under investigation for use in infants or young children. As such, the passive immunity of the antibodies (Abs) provided through milk from a vaccinated person may be one of the only ways to protect this population until pediatric COVID-19 vaccines are licensed. Our early work (as well as an expanded study being published concurrently with this report) examining the milk Ab response after SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrated that Spike-specific IgA in milk after infection is dominant and highly correlated with a secretory Ab response [2]. Determining if secretory Abs are elicited in milk is critical, as this Ab class is highly stable and resistant to enzymatic degradation in all mucosae - not only in the infant oral/nasal cavity and gut, but in the airways and GI tract as well [3, 4]. Presently, we describe our analysis of the milk Ab response 14 days after completion of an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine regimen among 10 individuals. It was evident that unlike the post-infection milk Ab profile, IgG dominates after COVID-19 vaccination. One hundred percent of post-vaccine milk contained significant levels of Spike-specific IgG, with 8/10 samples exhibiting high IgG endpoint titers. Conversely, 6/10 (60%) of post-vaccine samples were positive for Spike specific IgA, with only 1 (10%) exhibiting high IgA endpoint titer. Furthermore, 5/10 (50%) post-vaccine milk samples contained Spike-specific secretory Ab, none of which were found to be high-titer. As our analyses of the immune response in milk to COVID-19 vaccination continues, it will provide a critical opportunity to address huge knowledge gaps, inform the field as to which COVID-19 vaccine, if any, is likely to provide the best milk Ab response, and highlight the need to design improved vaccines with protection of the breastfeeding infant in mind.","output":"The vaccine-elicited immunoglobulin profile in milk after COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccination is IgG-dominant and lacks secretory antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid and accurate diagnosis of large vessel occlusions (LVOs) in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients using automated software could improve clinical workflow in determining thrombectomy in eligible patients.

We aimed to assess the ability of Canon's AUTOStroke Solution LVO application in properly detecting and locating LVOs in AIS patients. Data from 202 LVO and 101 non-LVO AIS patients who presented with stroke-like symptoms between March 2019 and February 2020 were collected retrospectively. LVO patients had either an internal carotid artery (ICA) (n = 59), M1 middle cerebral artery (MCA) (n = 82) or M2 MCA (n = 61) occlusion. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans from each patient were pushed to the automation platform and analyzed. The algorithm's ability to detect LVOs was assessed using accuracy, sensitivity and Matthews correlation coefficients (MCCs) for each occlusion type. The following results were calculated for each occlusion type in the study (accuracy, sensitivity, MCC): ICA = (0.95, 0.90, 0.89), M1 MCA = (0.89, 0.77, 0.78) and M2 MCA = (0.80, 0.51, 0.59).

Management of high-risk patients with early intervention is a key to lower the fatality rate of COVID-19 pneumonia, as a majority of patients recover naturally. Therefore, an accurate prediction of disease progression with baseline imaging at the time of the initial presentation can help in patient management. In lieu of only size and volume information of pulmonary abnormalities and features through deep learning based image segmentation, here we combine radiomics of lung opacities and non-imaging features from demographic data, vital signs, and laboratory findings to predict need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses holistic information of a patient including both imaging and non-imaging data for outcome prediction. The proposed methods were thoroughly evaluated on datasets separately collected from three hospitals, one in the United States, one in Iran, and another in Italy, with a total 295 patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay positive COVID-19 pneumonia. Our experimental results demonstrate that adding non-imaging features can significantly improve the performance of prediction to achieve AUC up to 0.884 and sensitivity as high as 96.1%, which can be valuable to provide clinical decision support in managing COVID-19 patients.

Severe exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B is closely related to continuous HBV replication. Therefore, inhibiting HBV replication to reduce viral load may block disease progression and improve the quality of life of these patients. ETV or TDF has been recommend first-line drug for the treatment of AECHB. 2. A hyperactive immune response due to continuous HBV replication is the main mechanism for development of severe hepatitis B. In addition to comprehensive treatment, early administration of potent nucleoside analogs can rapidly reduce HBV DNA concentration, relieve immune injury induced by HBV, and reduce liver inflammation and patient mortality. Antiviral agents have become important in the treatment of severe exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B. 3. Long-term antiviral treatment with nucleoside analogs can delay or reverse the progress of liver cirrhosis. Virologic response, viral resistance and adverse drug reactions should be closely monitored during treatment. The treatment should be optimized for maximum effect based on each patients responses. 4. Effective antiviral therapy can suppress HBV replication and reduce the incidence of HBV-related HCC. Patients with HBV-related HCC should receive individualized and optimal multidisciplinary comprehensive treatment. Anti-viral drugs with high efficacy, low resistance and low adverse drug reactions should be selected to improve the patients quality of life and prolong survival time. 5. Methods to prevent HBV reinfection after liver transplantation include passive immunization (HBIG), antiviral treatment (nucleoside analogs) and active immunization (hepatitis B vaccine). 6. Clinical trials involving sequential combination therapy with NUC and Peg-IFN have shown statistically significant decline in HBsAg levels on treatment and high rates of sustained post-treatment serologic response.

Amid this public health emergency, the urgent need for palliative care integration throughout critical care settings has never been more crucial. OBJECTIVE To promote palliative care engagement in critical care; share palliative care resources to support critical care nurses in alleviating suffering during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic; and make recommendations to strengthen nursing capacity to deliver high-quality, person-centered critical care. Methods Palliative and critical care literature and practice guidelines were reviewed, synthesized, and translated into recommendations for critical care nursing practice. RESULTS Nurses are ideally positioned to drive full integration of palliative care into the critical care delivery for all patients, including those with coronavirus disease 2019, given their relationship-based approach to care, as well as their leadership and advocacy roles. Recommendations include the promotion of healthy work environments and prioritizing nurse self-care in alignment with critical care nursing standards. CONCLUSIONS Nurses should focus on a strategic integration of palliative care, critical care, and ethically based care during times of normalcy and of crisis. Primary palliative care should be provided for each patient and family, and specialist services sought, as appropriate. Nurse educators are encouraged to use these recommendations and resources in their curricula and training. Palliative care is critical care.

To measure the attention of Chinese netizens to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pre-established nationally representative cohort of Weibo users was searched for COVID-19-related key words in their posts. METHODS: COVID-19-related posts (N = 1101) were retrieved from a longitudinal cohort of 52 268 randomly sampled Weibo accounts (December 31, 2019CFebruary 12, 2020). RESULTS: Attention to COVID-19 was limited prior to China openly acknowledging human-to-human transmission on January 20. Following this date, attention quickly increased and has remained high over time. Particularly high levels of social media traffic appeared around when Wuhan was first placed in quarantine (January 23C24, 8C9% of the overall posts), when a scandal associated with the Red Cross Society of China occurred (February 1, 8%), and, following the death of Dr Li Wenliang (February 6C7, 11%), one of the whistleblowers who was reprimanded by the Chinese police in early January for discussing this outbreak online.

In the current pandemic situation, rapid and accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis on a large scale is critical for early-stage diagnosis. Early detection and monitoring of viral infections can aid in controlling and preventing infection in large groups of people. Accordingly, we developed a sensitive and high-throughput sandwich electrochemiluminescence immunosensor based on antigen detection for COVID-19 diagnosis (the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2). For the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the ECL biosensor had a linear range of 10 ng mL(-1) to 10 g mL(-1) with a limit of detection of 1.93 ng mL(-1). The sandwich ECL immunosensor could be used in early clinical diagnosis due to its excellent recovery in detecting SARS-CoV-2, rapid analysis (90 min), and ease of use.","output":"Development of sandwich electrochemiluminescence immunosensor for COVID-19 diagnosis by SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein detection based on Au@BSA-Luminol nanocomposites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To mitigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, health care systems worldwide have implemented telemedicine technologies to respond to the growing need for health care services during these unprecedented times. In the United Arab Emirates, video and audio consultations have been implemented to deliver health services during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether differences exist in physicians' attitudes and perceptions of video and audio consultations when delivering telemedicine services during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This survey was conducted on a cohort of 880 physicians from outpatient facilities in Abu Dhabi, which delivered telemedicine services during the COVID-19 pandemic between November and December 2020. In total, 623 physicians responded (response rate=70.8%). The survey included a 5-point Likert scale to measure physician's attitudes and perceptions of video and audio consultations with reference to the quality of the clinical consultation and the professional productivity. Descriptive statistics were used to describe physicians' sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, designation, clinical specialty, duration of practice, and previous experience with telemedicine) and telemedicine modality (video vs audio consultations). Regression models were used to assess the association between telemedicine modality and physicians' characteristics with the perceived outcomes of the web-based consultation. RESULTS: Compared to audio consultations, video consultations were significantly associated with physicians' confidence toward managing acute consultations (odds ratio [OR] 1.62, 95% CI 1.2-2.21; P=.002) and an increased ability to provide patient education during the web-based consultation (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.04-4.33; P=.04). There was no significant difference in physicians' confidence toward managing long-term and follow-up consultations through video or audio consultations (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.88-2.08; P=.17). Video consultations were less likely to be associated with a reduced overall consultation time (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51-0.93; P=.02) and reduced time for patient note-taking compared to face-to-face visits (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36-0.65; P<.001). Previous experience with telemedicine was significantly associated with a lower perceived risk of misdiagnosis (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.3-0.71; P<.001) and an enhanced physician-patient rapport (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.26-4.9; P=.008). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that video consultations should be adopted frequently in the new remote clinical consultations. Previous experience with telemedicine was associated with a 2-fold confidence in treating acute conditions, less than a half of the perceived risk of misdiagnosis, and an increased ability to provide patients with health education and enhance the physician-patient rapport. Additionally, these results show that audio consultations are equivalent to video consultations in providing remote follow-up care to patients with chronic conditions. These findings may be beneficial to policymakers of e-health programs in low- and middle-income countries, where audio consultations may significantly increase access to geographically remote health services.","output":"Physicians' Attitudes Toward Telemedicine Consultations During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Georgia Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social Affairs is working to strengthen its Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) Program, but until recently has lacked an assessment of performance gaps and implementation challenges faced by hospital staff. METHODS: In 2018, health care hospitals were assessed using a World Health Organization (WHO) adapted tool aimed at implementing the WHOs IPC Core Components. The study included site assessments at 41 of Georgias 273 hospitals, followed by structured interviews with 109 hospital staff, validation observations of IPC practices, and follow up document reviews. RESULTS: IPC programs for all hospitals were not comprehensive, with many lacking defined objectives, workplans, targets, and budget. All hospitals had at least one dedicated IPC staff member, 66% of hospitals had IPC staff with some formal IPC training; 78% of hospitals had IPC guidelines; and 55% had facility-specific standard operating procedures. None of the hospitals conducted structured monitoring of IPC compliance and only 44% of hospitals used IPC monitoring results to make unit/facility-specific IPC improvement plans. 54% of hospitals had clearly defined priority healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), standard case definitions and data collection methods in their HAI surveillance systems. 85% hospitals had access to a microbiology laboratory. All reported having posters or other tools to promote hand hygiene, 29% had them for injection safety. 68% of hospitals had functioning hand-hygiene stations available at all points of care. 88% had single patient isolation rooms; 15% also had rooms for cohorting patients. 71% reported having appropriate waste management system. CONCLUSIONS: Among the recommended WHO IPC core components, existing programs, infrastructure, IPC staffing, workload and supplies present within Georgian healthcare hospitals should allow for implementation of effective IPC. Development and dissemination of IPC Guidelines, implementation of an effective IPC training system and systematic monitoring of IPC practices will be an important first step towards implementing targeted IPC improvement plans in hospitals.","output":"Core components of infection prevention and control programs at the facility level in Georgia: key challenges and opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of Ashwagandha plant extracts may be helpful due to its defensive antibody against virus like corona virus.

However, obstacles such as data security, inadequate funding and limited technological resources have hindered its seamless incorporation into the health care system. The recent pandemic has induced a widespread adoption of virtual care practices to remove the need for physical meetings between patients and health care practitioners. Purpose: This literature review aims to examine the current state of virtual medicine amid the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluate the benefits, limitations and implications of continuing technological advancements in the future. Findings: Most of the available literature suggests that the recent adoption of virtual medicine has allowed practitioners to cut down on costs and secondary expenses while maintaining the quality of medical care services. Due to the growing consumer demand, researchers predict that virtual medicine may be a viable modality for patient care post-pandemic. However, concerns surrounding patient security and digital infrastructure threaten the ability of virtual medicine to provide quality and effective health care. Additionally, rural virtual medicine programs face challenges in expanding services due to the scarcity of information and communication technology specialists and inadequate funding. Comprehensive legislation and governance standards must be implemented to ensure proper data security and privacy.

Chronic lower urinary tract signs manifest subsequent to the infection-induced cystitis and plaque-induced decreased bladder wall distensibility. Because of the organism's multidrug resistance and plaque forming capability, infection eradication can be difficult. While systemic antimicrobial therapy is the mainstay of treatment, adjunctive surgical debridement of plaques has been used with relative paucity in such cases, thereby limiting our understanding of this modality's indications and success rate. Consequently, this report describes the successful eradication of Corynebacterium urealyticum encrusting cystitis utilizing a unique timeline of medical and surgical treatments. Additionally, this represents the first reported veterinary case of a vasovagal reaction due to bladder overdistension. CASE PRESENTATION A 6-year-old female spayed Miniature Schnauzer was evaluated for lower urinary tract clinical signs and diagnosed with Corynebacterium urealyticum encrusting cystitis. The infection was persistent despite prolonged courses of numerous oral antimicrobials and urinary acidification. A unique treatment timeline of intravenous vancomycin, intravesical gentamicin, and mid-course surgical debridement ultimately resulted in infection resolution. During surgery, while the urinary bladder was copiously flushed and distended with saline, the dog experienced an acute vasovagal reaction from which it fully recovered. CONCLUSIONS Surgical debridement of bladder wall plaques should be considered a viable adjunctive therapy for Corynebacterium urealyticum encrusting cystitis cases failing to respond to systemic antibiotic therapy. The timing in which surgery was employed in this case, relative to concurrent treatment modalities, may be applicable in future cases of this disease as dictated on a case-by-case basis. If surgery is ultimately pursued, overdistension of the urinary bladder should be avoided, or at least minimized as much as possible, so as to prevent the possibility of a vasovagal reaction.","output":"Vasovagal reaction secondary to bladder overdistension in a dog undergoing a unique timeline of medical and surgical treatment for Corynebacterium urealyticum encrusting cystitis: a case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to capture perspectives of healthcare workers (HCWs) on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and infection prevention and control (IPAC) measures implemented during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey of HCWs. PARTICIPANTS: HCWs from the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. INTERVENTION: A self-administered survey was distributed to HCWs. We analyzed factors influencing HCW knowledge and self-reported use of personal protective equipment (PPE), concerns about contracting COVID-19 and acceptance of the recommended IPAC precautions for COVID-19. RESULTS: In total, 175 HCWs completed the survey between March 6 and March 10: 35 staff physicians (20%), 24 residents or fellows (14%), 72 nurses (41%), 14 respiratory therapists (8%), 14 administration staff (8%), and 14 other employees (8%). Most of the respondents were from the emergency department (n = 58, 33%) and the intensive care unit (n = 58, 33%). Only 86 respondents (50%) identified the correct donning order; only 60 (35%) identified the correct doffing order; but the majority (n = 113, 70%) indicated the need to wash their hands immediately prior to removal of their mask and eye protection. Also, 91 (54%) respondents felt comfortable with recommendations for droplet and/or contact precautions for routine care of patients with COVID-19. HCW occupation and concerns about contracting COVID-19 outside work were associated with nonacceptance of the recommendations (P = .016 and P = .036 respectively).

Methods All first-year medical students at Florida Atlantic University went through three sessions on telemedicine that began with a lecture, followed by a standardized patient interaction, then a small group meeting with clinical faculty. We assessed the sessions using survey questions on a 5-point Likert scale and additional narrative feedback. We also assessed students on a telemedicine objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) at the end of the semester and compared results to the previous year's same case done in person. Results Students overall found the sessions helpful for refining their history-taking skills and that the knowledge gained would be helpful in their future practices. They felt the online platform was a useful way to interact with patients, but had frustrations with technical difficulties. They also expressed a greater appreciation for the ability to perform an in-person physical examination. Students performed similarly on the OSCE station in person compared to virtual visits (mean score 93% vs 93.75%). Conclusion Introducing telemedicine during a first-year medical school clinical skills course provides students with opportunities to refine their clinical skills while introducing a skill that will be commonplace in the postpandemic environment.

Six AGMs were infected with SARS-CoV-2; three animals were euthanized near the peak stage of virus replication (day 5) and three animals were euthanized during the early convalescence period (day 34). All six AGMs supported robust SARS-CoV-2 replication and developed respiratory disease. Evidence of coagulation dysfunction as noted by a transient increases in aPTT and circulating levels of fibrinogen was observed in all AGMs. The level of SARS-CoV-2 replication and lung pathology was not quite as pronounced as previously reported with AGMs exposed by the combined i.n. and i.t. routes; however, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in nasal swabs of some animals as late as day 15 and rectal swabs as late as day 28 after virus challenge. Of particular importance to this study, all three AGMs that were followed until the early convalescence stage of COVID-19 showed substantial lung pathology at necropsy as evidenced by multifocal chronic interstitial pneumonia and increased collagen deposition in alveolar walls despite the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 in any of the lungs of these animals.

After mapping the linear B-cell epitopes and MHC1-binding T-cell epitopes six epitopes were sorted from each of the proteins on the basis of extent of residue-conservancy among three types of coronaviruses namely SARS-CoV2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Each of the selected epitopes were profiled for their pro-inflammatory potential through molecular docking analysis with surface bound Toll-like receptors, namely TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5. Based on a custom scoring function, the epitopes were ranked for highest and least pro-inflammatory potential. Segments of Spike and RdRp harboring such epitopes were combined using linkers to design immunogenic recombinant polypeptide. Antigenicity and allergenicity of each of the combination was scored;and the best fitting one was docked against TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5 for assessing pro-inflammatory potential.

We investigated the prevalence of smell and/or taste loss and the clinical characteristics and recovery in a comprehensive cohort of consecutive patients treated by two COVID-19 reference hospitals and evaluated late persistence of hyposmia. METHODS A retrospective observational questionnaire study was conducted. All consecutive RT-PCR diagnosed patients who had been hospitalized in March-April 2020 in the COVID-19 care wards were contacted, excluding patients with cognitive disorders and severe deconditioning. The patients responded to a survey about the loss of smell and taste, nasal blockage, and rhinorrhea, rated the symptoms' severity from 0 to 4, and reported the recovery of smell and taste with time. Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded. RESULTS We contacted 117 patients. Ninety responded to the questionnaire; 38.9 % of them reported olfactory and 36.66 % gustatory disorders during their disease. Smell loss prior to other symptoms was reported by 42.86 %, and severe hyposmia/anosmia by 74.28 % of the hyposmic. Among the non-ICU treated patients, 43.75 % reported hyposmia. Only 8.89 % had nasal blockage, and 6.66 % rhinorrhea. Most of the patients (85.71 %) recovered their sense of smell in 3-61 days (median: 17; IQR: 24), but 8.57 % had persistent hyposmia. For one out of four, the olfactory loss lasted longer than a month. CONCLUSION Smell and taste loss are highly prevalent and early symptoms in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

The umbrella term for technologies with these characteristics is extended reality. The ability of extended reality to create environments that are otherwise impossible in the real world has practical implications in the medical discipline. In ophthalmology, virtual reality simulators have become increasingly popular as tools for surgical education. Recent developments have also explored diagnostic and therapeutic uses in ophthalmology. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to identify and investigate the utility of extended reality in ophthalmic education, diagnostics, and therapeutics. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials. Publications from January 1, 1956 to April 15, 2020 were included. Inclusion criteria were studies evaluating the use of extended reality in ophthalmic education, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Eligible studies were evaluated using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine levels of evidence. Relevant studies were also evaluated using a validity framework. Findings and relevant data from the studies were extracted, evaluated, and compared to determine the utility of extended reality in ophthalmology. RESULTS: We identified 12,490 unique records in our literature search; 87 met final eligibility criteria, comprising studies that evaluated the use of extended reality in education (n=54), diagnostics (n=5), and therapeutics (n=28). Of these, 79 studies (91%) achieved evidence levels in the range 2b to 4, indicating poor quality. Only 2 (9%) out of 22 relevant studies addressed all 5 sources of validity evidence. In education, we found that ophthalmic surgical simulators demonstrated efficacy and validity in improving surgical performance and reducing complication rates. Ophthalmoscopy simulators demonstrated efficacy and validity evidence in improving ophthalmoscopy skills in the clinical setting. In diagnostics, studies demonstrated proof-of-concept in presenting ocular imaging data on extended reality platforms and validity in assessing the function of patients with ophthalmic diseases. In therapeutics, heads-up surgical systems had similar complication rates, procedural success rates, and outcomes in comparison with conventional ophthalmic surgery.

Instead, individual differences in compliance were mainly predicted by cognitive and socio-structural variables. These results were confirmed in an independent data set. This study shows that individuals scoring high on negative affect during the pandemic are not necessarily more likely to comply with safety regulations.

Using data on local transmissions until the 23rd of March 2020, we develop an ensemble of 200 ecological niche models to project monthly variation in climate suitability for spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout a typical climatological year. Although cases of COVID-19 are reported all over the world, most outbreaks display a pattern of clustering in relatively cool and dry areas. The predecessor SARS-CoV-1 was linked to similar climate conditions. Should the spread of SARS CoV-2 continue to follow current trends, asynchronous seasonal global outbreaks could be expected. According to the models, temperate warm and cold climates are more favorable to spread of the virus, whereas arid and tropical climates are less favorable. However, model uncertainties are still high across much of sub- Saharan Africa, Latin America and South East Asia. While models of epidemic spread utilize human demography and mobility as predictors, climate can also help constrain the virus. This is because the environment can mediate human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and unsuitable climates can cause the virus to destabilize quickly, hence reducing its capacity to become epidemic.","output":"Spread of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus likely to be constrained by climate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the most important etiological agents for handCfootCmouth disease.

After transduction into mammalian cells, typical cytopathic effects (CPEs) and VP1 signals were detected in cells transfected with recombinant baculovirus. Additionally, viral particles located in the cytoplasm of human rhabdomyosarcoma cells (Rd) and Vero cells were observed by electron microscope, indicating that EV71 was recovered using a Bac-to-Bac expression system in vitro. After four passages, the rescued virus had a growth curve and plaque morphology similar to those of the parental virus. Furthermore, the Vp1 gene and the protein from the mouse brain were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry after intracerebral injection of purified recombinant baculovirus. Typical CPEs were observed after inoculation of the supernatant from mouse brain to Rd cells, revealing a reconstruction of EV71 in vivo. Thus, we established a new approach to rescue EV71 based on a baculovirus expression system in vitro and in vivo, which may provide a safe and convenient platform for fundamental research and a strategy to rescue viruses that currently lack suitable cell culture and animal models.","output":"Recovery Infectious Enterovirus 71 by Bac-to-Bac Expression System in vitro and in vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a pandemic disease that began to rapidly spread in the US with the first case detected on January 19, 2020, in Washington State.

The Dutch obstetric telephone triage system is comparable to physical triage systems. It consists of five urgency levels: resuscitation and life threatening (U1), emergency (U2), urgent (U3), non-urgent (U4) and self-care advice (U5). The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic and external validity of the Dutch obstetric telephone triage system in obstetric emergency care. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The validity of the Dutch obstetric telephone triage system was studied in a prospective observational study in four hospitals. Diagnostic validity of usual care was determined by comparing the assigned urgency level of the Dutch obstetric telephone triage system with a reference standard. This reference standard was obtained by face-to-face clinical assessment in hospital following telephone triage. Clinical follow-up after assessment was also recorded. For statistical analyses, urgency levels were dichotomized into high urgency (U1, U2) and intermediate urgency (U3, U4). Self-care advice (U5) could not be studied because these patients were not referred to hospital. RESULTS: In total, 983 cases (U1-U4) across the four hospitals were included, 625 (64%) cases were categorized as high urgency and 358 (36%) as intermediate urgency. The Dutch obstetric telephone triage systems urgency level agreed with the reference standard in 53% (n=525; 95% CI 50C57%). According to the reference standard the Dutch obstetric telephone triage system had undertriage in 16% (n=160) and overtriage in 30% (n=298) of the cases. Sensitivity for high urgency was 76% (95% CI 72C80), specificity 49% (95% CI 44C53). Positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 60% (95% CI 56C63) and 67% (95% CI 62C72), respectively. After clinical assessment, urgent care was needed in 8.7% (n=31) of the intermediate-urgency cases, none of these cases were life threatening situations.

The global propagation of the viral disease, denoted COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), has unified the scientific community in searching for possible inhibitory small molecules or polypeptides. A holistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 vs. human inter-species interactome promises to identify putative protein-protein interactions (PPI) that may be considered targets for the development of inhibitory therapeutics. METHODS: We leverage two state-of-the-art, sequence-based PPI predictors (PIPE4 & SPRINT) capable of generating the comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 vs. human interactome, comprising approximately 285,000 pairwise predictions. Three prediction schemas (all, proximal, RP-PPI) are leveraged to obtain our highest-confidence subset of PPIs and human proteins predicted to interact with each of the 14 SARS-CoV-2 proteins considered in this study. Notably, the use of the Reciprocal Perspective (RP) framework demonstrates improved predictive performance in multiple cross-validation experiments. RESULTS: The all schema identified 279 high-confidence putative interactions involving 225 human proteins, the proximal schema identified 129 high-confidence putative interactions involving 126 human proteins, and the RP-PPI schema identified 539 high-confidence putative interactions involving 494 human proteins. The intersection of the three sets of predictions comprise the seven highest-confidence PPIs. Notably, the Spike-ACE2 interaction was the highest ranked for both the PIPE4 and SPRINT predictors with the all and proximal schemas, corroborating existing evidence for this PPI. Several other predicted PPIs are biologically relevant within the context of the original SARS-CoV virus. Furthermore, the PIPE-Sites algorithm was used to identify the putative subsequence that might mediate each interaction and thereby inform the design of inhibitory polypeptides intended to disrupt the corresponding host-pathogen interactions. CONCLUSION: We publicly released the comprehensive sets of PPI predictions and their corresponding PIPE-Sites landscapes in the following DataVerse repository: https://www.doi.org/10.5683/SP2/JZ77XA.

The trajectory of the global spread is worrisome, particularly in heavily populated countries such as Nigeria. The study objective was to assess and compare the pattern of COVID-19 spread in Nigeria and seven other countries during the first 120 days of the outbreak. METHODS: Data was extracted from the World Bank's website. A descriptive analysis was conducted as well as modelling of COVID-19 spread from day one through day 120 in Nigeria and seven other countries. Model fitting was conducted using linear, quadratic, cubic and exponential regression methods (&#945;=0.05). RESULTS: The COVID-19 spread pattern in Nigeria was similar to the patterns in Egypt, Ghana and Cameroun. The daily death distribution in Nigeria was similar to those of six out of the seven countries considered. There was an increasing trend in the daily COVID-19 confirmed cases in Nigeria. During the lockdown, the growth rate in Nigeria was 5.85 (R2=0.728, p< 0.001); however, it was 8.42 (R2=0.625, p< 0.001) after the lockdown was relaxed. The cubic polynomial model (CPM) provided the best fit for predicting COVID-19 cumulative cases across all the countries investigated and there was a clear deviation from the exponential growth model. Using the CPM, the predicted number of cases in Nigeria at 3-month (30 September 2020) was 155,467 (95% CI:151,111-159,824, p< 0.001), all things being equal.

Increasing evidence has suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) work as a crucial regulator in the development of plentiful diseases, including intrauterine adhesions (IUA). Herein, we investigated the specific impacts of UCMSCs overexpressing miR-455-5p in IUA. UCMSCs were cocultured with endometrial stromal cells (ESCs). Thirty-two female mice were divided into four different treated groups: sham, model, model + UCMSC-miR-NC and model + UCMSC-miR-455-5p. Mice in model groups were induced by uterine curettage. MiR-455-5p overexpressed UCMSCs facilitated the proliferation and cell cycle progression of ESCs according to 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine assay and flow cytometry analysis. Hematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining revealed that miR-455-5p upregulation in UCMSCs increased the number of endometrial glands and suppressed endometrial fibrosis in murine uterine tissues. Western blotting displayed that miR-455-5p overexpressed UCMSCs promoted the activation of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK/STAT3) signaling in ESCs and murine uterine tissues. Mechanistically, miR-455-5p targeted 3 untranslated region of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), which was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-455-5p was lowly expressed and SOCS3 was highly expressed in murine uterine tissues of IUA model. Moreover, Pearson correlation analysis showed that their expression was inversely correlated. Rescue assays suggested that inhibiting JAK/STAT3 signaling reversed effects of miR-455-5p on the behaviors of ESCs. The results indicated that miR-455-5p overexpression in UCMSCs helps to attenuate endometrial injury and repair damaged endometrium by activating SOCS3-mediated JAK/STAT3 signaling.","output":"MiR-455-5p upregulation in umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells attenuates endometrial injury and promotes repair of damaged endometrium via Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel corona virus (SARS- CoV2) pandemic has created an unprecedented public health problem and a mental health crisis looms ahead.

The Portuguese public complied quickly, reducing their overall mobility by 80%. The aim of this study was to estimate the initial impact of the lockdown in Portugal in terms of the reduction of the burden on the healthcare system. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We forecasted epidemic curves for: Cases, hospital inpatients (overall and in intensive care), and deaths without lockdown, assuming that the impact of containment measures would start 14 days after initial lockdown was implemented. We used exponential smoothing models for deaths, intensive care and hospitalizations and an ARIMA model for number of cases. Models were selected considering fitness to the observed data up to the 31st March 2020. We then compared observed (with intervention) and forecasted curves (without intervention). RESULTS: Between April 1st and April 15th, there were 146 fewer deaths (-25%), 5568 fewer cases (-23%) and, as of April 15th, there were 519 fewer intensive care inpatients (-69%) than forecasted without the lockdown. On April 15th, the number of intensive care inpatients could have reached 748, three times higher than the observed value (229) if the intervention had been delayed. DISCUSSION: If the lockdown had not been implemented in mid-March, Portugal intensive care capacity (528 beds) would have likely been breached during the first half of April. The lockdown seems to have been effective in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, serious COVID-19 disease, and associated mortality, thus decreasing demand on health services. CONCLUSION: An early lockdown allowed time for the National Health Service to mobilize resources and acquire personal protective equipment, increase testing, contact tracing and hospital and intensive care capacity and to promote broad prevention and control measures. When lifting more stringent measures, strong surveillance and communication strategies that mobilize individual prevention efforts are necessary.","output":"Initial Assessment of the Impact of the Emergency State Lockdown Measures on the 1st Wave of the COVID-19 Epidemic in Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic resulted in a temporary interruption of learning activities across the world. In Saudi Arabia, there was a sudden and quick shift from face-to-face learning mode to online learning in efforts to save the educational process from non-continuity in many universities. As a result, the use of various e-learning platforms such as Blackboard applications was key to facilitating the learning of different academic courses including the English language. However, the widespread uptake and implementation of Blackboard learning are still in nascent phases in terms of facilitating English language learning. The objective of this study was to investigate the challenges and difficulties encountered in online learning of English language courses via Blackboard at Saudi universities in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Desktop research was used in this study where secondary resources were collected from various academic databases including Google Scholar, Science Direct, EBSCOhost, and Semantic Scholar. Results showed that the use of Blackboard application in online learning of English courses had some potential advantages including improved interactivity, communication, enhanced language proficiency, discussion forums, improved writing quality, learning flexibility, and enhanced grammar and vocabulary acquisition. However, there were potential challenges including students' negative attitude, lack of tutor training, poor technical support, difficulty accessing curriculum content or tests, concerns about safety or privacy, slow internet connection, students' lack of computers, and reliable internet.

At the host level, COVID-19, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), affects the respiratory system, with the clinical symptoms ranging from mild to severe or critical illness that often requires hospitalization and oxygen support. There is no specific therapy for COVID-19, as is the case for any common viral disease except drugs to reduce the viral load and alleviate the inflammatory symptoms. Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), also primarily affects the lungs and has clinical signs similar to pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Active TB is a leading killer among infectious diseases and adds to the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. In immunocompetent individuals, primary Mtb infection can also lead to a non-progressive, asymptomatic latency. However, latent Mtb infection (LTBI) can reactivate symptomatic TB disease upon host immune-suppressing conditions. Importantly, the diagnosis and treatment of TB are hampered and admixed with COVID-19 control measures. The US-Center for Disease Control (US-CDC) recommends using antiviral drugs, Remdesivir or corticosteroid (CST), such as dexamethasone either alone or in-combination with specific recommendations for COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization or oxygen support. However, CSTs can cause immunosuppression, besides their anti-inflammatory properties. The altered host immunity during COVID-19, combined with CST therapy, poses a significant risk for new secondary infections and/or reactivation of existing quiescent infections, such as LTBI. This review highlights CST therapy recommendations for COVID-19, various types and mechanisms of action of CSTs, the deadly combination of two respiratory infectious diseases COVID-19 and TB. It also discusses the importance of screening for LTBI to prevent TB reactivation during corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19.","output":"Corticosteroids for COVID-19 Therapy: Potential Implications on Tuberculosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 provides significant protection against the infection in the general population.

METHODS: This study is a retrospective review of the patients operated between 11.03.2020 and 31.05.2020 in a center with a high incidence of COVID-19 infection during the pandemic. The numbers of emergency, elective and oncological surgeries as well as the increasing or decreasing trends of these interventions between March 11 and May 31 of previous years were compared with the corresponding period of 2020 or in other words the pandemic period. RESULTS: From March 11 to May 31, 2020 there was a progressive reduction in surgical activity, with only 195 operations: 61(31,28%) on a scheduled basis for tumor pathology, 59(30,25%) for benign pathology and 75(38,46%) for emergency indications. When the surgical trends of previous years are considered, all types of oncological surgeries decreased significantly in pandemic period March 11 to May 31, 2020.

An in-person presurgical consultation was preferred by 62.1%, and a postsurgical in-person visit was preferred by 67.7%. The most commonly cited reason was desire for physical interaction with their surgeon. For each 10-year increase in age, there was a 1.26-fold and 1.12-fold increase in preference for in-person consultation and follow-up, respectively. Eighty-seven percent felt safe during office visit, and 41% reported no anxiety regarding fear of contracting COVID-19. The proportion of patients preferring in-person pre- or postsurgical visits was similar regardless of sex, presence of an immunocompromising condition, prior dermatologic surgery, anxiety level for contracting COVID-19, and perceived level of office safety.

METHODS: We undertook this retrospective cohort study among COVID-19 patients reporting to Hindu Mission Hospital, India. Multivariable logistic regression using the LASSO procedure was used to select variables for the model building, and the nomogram scoring system was developed with the final selected model. Model discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed. RESULTS: In total, 35.1% of the patients in the training set developed severe COVID-19 during their follow-up period. In the basic model, nine variables (age group, sex, education, chronic kidney disease, tobacco, cough, dyspnea, olfactory-gustatory dysfunction [OGD], and gastrointestinal symptoms) were selected and a nomogram was built using these variables. In the advanced model, in addition to these variables (except OGD), C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, d-dimer, and CT severity score were selected. The discriminatory power (c-index) for basic model was 0.78 (95%CI: 0.74C0.82) and advanced model was 0.83 (95%CI: 0.79C0.87).

The WHO Immunisation Agenda 2030 highlights coverage and equity as one of the strategic priority goals to reach high equitable immunisation coverage at national levels and in all districts. We analysed full immunisation coverage among children aged 12-23 months in Kenya and estimated the inequities in full immunisation coverage associated with socioeconomic, geographic, maternal, child, and place of birth characteristics using data from the 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey. Methods: We analysed full immunisation coverage (1-dose BCG, 3-dose DTP-HepB-Hib, 3-dose polio, 1-dose measles, and 3-dose pneumococcal vaccines) of 3,943 children aged 12-23 months. We disaggregated mean coverage by socioeconomic (household wealth, religion, ethnicity), geographic (place of residence, province), maternal (maternal age at birth, maternal education, maternal marital status, maternal household head status), child (sex of child, birth order), and place of birth characteristics. We conducted bivariate and multivariate logistic regression to assess associations between full immunisation coverage and socioeconomic, geographic, maternal, child, and place of birth characteristics. Results: Immunisation coverage ranged from 82% [81-84] for the third dose of polio to 97.4% [96.7-98.2] for the first dose of DTP-HepB-Hib, while full immunisation coverage was 68% [66-71] in 2014. After controlling for other background characteristics, children of mothers with primary school education or higher have at least 54% higher odds of being fully immunised compared to children of mothers with no education. Children born in clinical settings have 41% higher odds of being fully immunised compared to children born in home settings. Children in the Coast, Western, Central, and Eastern regions had at least 74% higher odds of being fully immunised compared to children in the North Eastern region, while children in urban areas had 26% lower odds of full immunisation compared to children in rural areas. Children in the middle and richer wealth quintile households were 43-57% more likely to have full immunisation coverage compared to children in the poorest wealth quintile households. Children who were sixth born or higher had 37% lower odds of full immunisation compared to first-born children. Conclusions: The inequities in full immunisation adversely affect children of mothers with no education, born in home settings, in regions with limited health infrastructure, living in poorer households, and of higher birth order. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted routine and campaign immunisation services in 2020 and enhances the risk of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks, but it also presents an opportunity to tackle the identified inequities in vaccine uptake as immunisation services are restored to capacity.","output":"Childhood immunisation coverage in Kenya by socioeconomic, geographic, maternal, child, and place of birth characteristics: equity impact analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to find probabilities of extreme values of the air temperature for the Cerrado, Pantanal and Atlantic Forest biomes in Mato Grosso do Sul in Brazil.

While remotely delivering and assessing technology is not new, there are few methods available in the literature that are proven to be effective with diverse populations, and none for older adults specifically. Older adults comprise a diverse population, including in terms of their experience with and access to technology, making this a challenging endeavor. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to remotely deliver and conduct usability testing for a mobile health (mHealth) technology intervention for older adult participants enrolled in a clinical trial of the technology. This paper describes the methodology used, its successes, and its limitations. METHODS: We developed a conceptual model for remote operations, called the Framework for Agile and Remote Operations (FAR Ops), that combined the general requirements for spaceflight operations with Agile project management processes to quickly respond to this challenge. Using this framework, we iteratively created care packages that differed in their contents based on participant needs and were sent to study participants to deliver the study interventiona medication management appand assess its usability. Usability data were collected using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and a novel usability questionnaire developed to collect more in-depth data. RESULTS: In the first 6 months of the project, we successfully delivered 21 care packages. We successfully designed and deployed a minimum viable product in less than 6 weeks, generally maintained a 2-week sprint cycle, and achieved a 40% to 50% return rate for both usability assessment instruments. We hypothesize that lack of engagement due to the pandemic and our use of asynchronous communication channels contributed to the return rate of usability assessments being lower than desired. We also provide general recommendations for performing remote usability testing with diverse populations based on the results of our work, including implementing screen sharing capabilities when possible, and determining participant preference for phone or email communications. CONCLUSIONS: The FAR Ops model allowed our team to adopt remote operations for our mHealth trial in response to interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. This approach can be useful for other research or practice-based projects under similar circumstances or to improve efficiency, cost, effectiveness, and participant diversity in general. In addition to offering a replicable approach, this paper tells the often-untold story of practical challenges faced by mHealth projects and practical strategies used to address them.

Pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (proBNP) is a biomarker of myocardial stress associated with outcomes in various respiratory and cardiac diseases. We hypothesized that proBNP level would be associated with mortality and clinical outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n=1232) using adjusted logistic and linear regression to assess the association of admission proBNP (analyzed by both categorical cutoff >125 pg/mL and continuous log transformed proBNP) with clinical outcomes. Covariates included age, sex, race, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes, smoking history, and chronic kidney disease stage (Model 1), with Troponin I added in Model 2. We performed survival analysis by a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, incorporating log transformed proBNP. We additionally treated BMI, a strong potential confounder of both proBNP levels and COVID-19 outcomes, as an ordinal variable ordered across tertiles. Results Patients were mean age 62.917.6, 53.8% male, and 35.9% Black. Preadmission comorbidities were hypertension (57.1%), diabetes (31.6%), CAD (9.0%) and heart failure (HF, 10.6%). In Model 1 and 2, higher proBNP level was significantly associated with death, new HF, length of stay, ICU duration and need for ventilation among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This significance persisted after ordinal compression of BMI across tertiles. The adjusted hazard ratio of death for log[proBNP] was 1.56 (95% CI: 1.23-1.97; P<0.0001).

The swift, severe, and global nature of COVID-19 offers an opportunity to systematically obtain a national view of how larger institutions of higher education adopted NPI guidance at the onset of the pandemic. METHOD: An original database of COVID-19-related university NPI policy changes was compiled. Survey team members manually combed university websites and official statements capturing implementation decisions and dates for five NPI variables from 575 U.S. universities, across 50 states and the District of Columbia, during March of 2020. The universities included in this study were selected from the Department of Education Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), which provides a set of university explanatory variables. Using IPEDS as the basis for the organizational data allows consistent mapping to event-time and institutional characteristic variables including public health announcements, geospatial, census, and political affiliation. RESULTS: The dataset enables event-time analysis and offers a variety of variables to support institutional level study and identification of underlying biases like educational attainment. A descriptive analysis of the dataset reveals that there was substantial heterogeneity in the decisions that were made and the timing of these decisions as they temporally related to key state, national, and global emergency announcements. The WHO pandemic declaration coincided with the largest number of university decisions to implement NPIs. CONCLUSION: This study provides descriptive observations and produced an original dataset that will be useful for future research focused on drivers and trends of COVID-19 NPIs for U.S. Universities.

This study aims to explore the association between risk perception (perceived severity and perceived probability), perceived efficacy (individual's efficacy and government's efficacy), trust in authorities, and intention to implement influenza protective behaviors. METHODS: The data (Na?=a?1,372) used in this paper comes from the 2013 Taiwan Social Change Survey dataset. Six intentions of protective behaviors (getting vaccinated, wearing a mask, washing hands, avoiding going to public settings, sanitizing home, and eating nutritional supplements) were investigated. Tobit and ordered logistic regressions were used to conduct data analysis. RESULTS: Respondents were most inclined to washing hands, followed by wearing a mask, avoiding going to public settings, getting vaccine, sanitizing their homes, and eating nutritional supplements. Perceived severity and individual's efficacy were positively correlated with all 6 behavioral intentions. Trust in authorities has positive effect on all the protective behaviors except sanitizing home. Moreover, perceived probability has positive relationships with overall intention, intention to wear mask, and intention to wash hands. Government's efficacy was only positively correlated with eating nutritional supplements. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived severity and perceived response efficacy towards flu, as well as trust in authorities were relatively important factors in motivating people's intention to adopt influenza protective behaviors.","output":"What makes people intend to take protective measures against influenza?

Abstract Adenoviruses most commonly cause respiratory illness; however, depending on the infecting serotype, they may also cause various other diseases. Diagnosis may be difficult to achieve. The clinical findings for 116 children hospitalised with adenoviral infection were studied retrospectively. In 71 children, the diagnosis was based on detection of adenovirus antigen in the nasopharyngeal specimens and in 71 children on viral culture. The clinical picture of adenoviral infection was characterised by high-grade (mean 391C) and prolonged fever (mean duration 4,3 days). Upper respiratory and lower respiratory symptoms were the most common infections. Twelve had been admitted to the hospital due to febrile convulsions, 6 had meningitis. Laboratory findings varied from normal values to values seen in bacterial infections. Thus it was difficult to distinguish adenoviral disease from a bacterial disease. Fifty-nine children were referred to the hospital due to infection unresponsive to antimicrobial therapy. Symptoms of respiratory infection caused by adenovirus may range from the common cold syndrome to pneumonia, croup and bronchiolitis. Adenoviruses can be responsible for severe consequences, even in previously healthy children. Studies of the molecular mechanisms of viral infections of the airways could provide important insights into the nature of the inflammatory process involved in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Most infections are mild and require no therapy or only symptomatic treatment. There are at present time no recognised antiviral agents that are effective in treating serious adenovirus disease. The rapid detection of adenovirus antigen in nasopharygeal specimens proved to have a great clinical value in the diagnosis.","output":"Prise en charge des pathologies respiratoires  adnovirus chez lenfant immunocomptent  propos dune tude rtrospective de 116 enfants hospitaliss"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"School bullying and cyberbullying represent the most common forms of victimization during childhood and adolescence in many countries across the globe. Although they can be studied as distinct phenomena with their own defining characteristics, there is evidence to suggest that they are related and often co-occur. The present research aimed to estimate the rates of school bullying and cyberbullying, studied their evolution by age, and analyzed any possible overlap between the two. An empirical study was carried out with a large sample of children and adolescents in Galicia, Spain (N = 2083), where 10C17 year olds were presented with The European Bullying Intervention Project Questionnaire and European Cyberbullying Intervention Project Questionnaire. School bullying was found to be more prevalent than cyberbullying, with 25.1% involved as victims and 14.3% as bully-victims, while the cyberbullying rates were 9.4% for victims and 5.8% for bully-victims. Perpetration rates were similar for school and cyberbullying (4.4% and 4.3% respectively). The overlap between both phenomena adds to the evidence for a whole-community approach to tackling all types of bullying and victimization experiences, as opposed to each in silo.

Propofol and sevoflurane act differently on cerebral blood vessels. Consequently, cerebral blood flow during hyperventilation with propofol and sevoflurane anaesthesia may differ. OBJECTIVES The first aim of this study was to compare the changes in rSO2 between propofol and sevoflurane anaesthesia during hyperventilation. The second aim was to assess changes in rSO2 with ventilation changes. DESIGN A randomised, open-label study. SETTING University of Yamanashi Hospital, Yamanashi, Japan from January 2014 to September 2014. PARTICIPANTS Fifty American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1 or 2 adult patients who were scheduled for elective abdominal surgery were assigned randomly to receive either propofol or sevoflurane anaesthesia. Exclusion criterion was a known history of cerebral disease such as cerebral infarction, cerebral haemorrhage, transient ischaemic attack and subarachnoid haemorrhage. INTERVENTIONS After induction of anaesthesia but before the start of surgery, rSO2, arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2) and arterial oxygen saturation were measured. Measurements were repeated at 5-min intervals during 15 min of hyperventilation with a PaCO2 around 30 mmHg (4 kPa), and again after ventilation was normalised. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the difference of changes in rSO2 between propofol anaesthesia and sevoflurane anaesthesia during and after hyperventilation. The second outcome was change in rSO2 after the initiation of hyperventilation and after the normalisation of ventilation. RESULTS Changes of rSO2 during hyperventilation were -10  7% (left) and -11  8% (right) in the propofol group, and -10  8% (left) and -9  7% (right) in the sevoflurane group. After normalisation of PaCO2, rSO2 returned to baseline values. Arterial oxygen saturation remained stable throughout the measurement period. The rSO2 values were similar in the propofol and the sevoflurane groups at each time point. CONCLUSION The effects of hyperventilation on estimated rSO2 were similar with propofol and sevoflurane anaesthesia. Changes in rSO2 correlated well with ventilation changes.

The symptoms of this disease vary widely. Depending on the symptoms an infected person is broadly classified into two categories namely, asymptomatic and symptomatic. Asymptomatic individuals display mild or no symptoms but continue to transmit the infection to otherwise healthy individuals. This particular aspect of asymptomatic infection poses a major obstacle in managing and controlling the transmission of the infectious disease. In this paper, we attempt to mathematically model the spread of COVID-19 in India under various intervention strategies. We consider SEIR type epidemiological models, incorporated with India specific social contact matrix representing contact structures among different age groups of the population. Impact of various factors such as presence of asymptotic individuals, lockdown strategies, social distancing practices, quarantine, and hospitalization on the disease transmission is extensively studied. Numerical simulation of our model is matched with the real COVID-19 data of India till May 15, 2020 for the purpose of estimating the model parameters.

This study aims to investigate the effects of COVID-19 outbreaks and control measures on depression risk in community-dwelling older adults in Hong Kong. With rolling cross-sectional design, telephone screenings for depressive risk were conducted among 8163 older people using Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) from February to September 2020. COVID-19 outbreaks across thirty weeks were measured using real-time effective reproductive number (Rt), infected new cases, and change of infected new cases by week. Infection control measures were assessed using four policy indices, including government response, government stringency, containment and health, and economic support. Linear regressions were used to test the associations of depression risk with COVID-19 outbreaks and control measures. We found that being female and higher Rt were associated with higher depression risk in the overall sample. In older adults without pre-existing mental health issues, higher depression risk were related to older age (t=-1.974, 95%CI[-0.006, 0.000], p<0.05), a higher level of government stringency (t=2.954, 95%CI[0.007, 0.033], p<0.01), and less stringent containment and health-related policy (t=-2.599, 95%CI[-0.041, -0.006], p<0.01). In older adults with pre-existing mental health issues, greater changes in newly infected cases were related to higher depression risk (t=2.813, 95%CI[0.002, 0.010], p<0.01). In conclusion, the effects of COVID-19 infection risk and control measures on depression risk differ among older Chinese by pre-existing mental health issues.

Often, there are subtle physiological differences in these cohorts of patients. In particular, in intensive care, patients tend to be younger and have increased disease severity. Data, to date, has combined outcomes from medical and intensive care cohorts, or looked exclusively at intensive care. We looked solely at the level 1 (medical) cohort to identify their clinical characteristics and predictors of outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study of adult patients admitted to a central London teaching hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19 from 23rd March to 7th April 2020 identified from the hospital electronic database. Any patients who required level 2 or 3 care were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 229 patients were included for analysis. Increased age and frailty scores were associated with increased 30-day mortality. Reduced renal function and elevated troponin blood levels are also associated with poor outcome. Baseline observations showed that increased oxygen requirement was predictive for mortality. A trend of increased mortality with lower diastolic blood pressure was noted. Lymphopenia was not shown to be related to mortality. CONCLUSION: Urea and creatinine are the best predictors of mortality in the level 1 cohort. Unlike previous intensive care data, lymphopenia is not predictive of mortality.

We evaluated conservation of RBP binding between 6 other human pathogenic coronaviruses and identified sites of conserved and differential binding in the UTRs of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS. We scored the impact of variants from 11 viral strains on protein-RNA interaction, identifying a set of gain-and loss of binding events.

The knowledge is particularly important for the new norm of remote works under the COVID-19 pandemic. We have the privilege of collecting two valuable datasets: a total of 4,300 group chat channels in Slack from an R&D department in a multinational IT company;and a total of 117 groups' performance data. Through qualitative coding of 100 randomly sampled group channels from the 4,300 channels dataset, we identified and reported 9 categories such as Project channels, IT-Support channels, and Event channels. We further defined a feature metric with 21 meta features (and their derived features) without looking at the message content to depict the group communication style for these group chat channels, with which we successfully trained a machine learning model that can automatically classify a given group channel into one of the 9 categories. In addition to the descriptive data analysis, we illustrated how these communication metrics can be used to analyze team performance. We cross-referenced 117 project teams and their team-based Slack channels and identified 57 teams that appeared in both datasets, then we built a regression model to reveal the relationship between these group communication styles and the project team performance.

This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of TissuCol (fibrin glue), Histoacryl Flex (n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate), and Duraseal (polyethylene glycol) on colorectal anastomotic healing during experimental colitis. METHODS We first performed colectomy 7 days after 10 mg trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis to validate a rat TNBS-colitis-colectomy model. Subsequently, this TNBS-colitis-colectomy model was used in 73 Wistar rats that were stratified into a colitis group (CG, no adhesive), a TissuCol group (TG), a Histoacryl group (HG), and a Duraseal group (DG). Anastomotic sealant was applied with one adhesive after constructing an end-to-end hand-sewn anastomosis. Clinical manifestations, anastomotic bursting pressure, and immunohistochemistry of macrophage type-one (M1) and type-two (M2) was performed on postoperative day (POD)3 or POD7. RESULTS TNBS-caused mucosal and submucosal colon damage and compromised anastomotic healing (i.e., abscess formation and low anastomotic bursting pressure). On POD3, higher severity of abscesses was seen in CG. Average anastomotic bursting pressure was 53.2  35.5 mm Hg in CG, which was significantly lower than HG (134.4  27.5 mm Hg) and DG (95.1  54.3 mm Hg) but not TG (83.4  46.7 mm Hg). Furthermore, a significantly higher M2/M1 index was found in HG. On POD7, abscesses were only seen in CG (6/9) but not in other groups; HG had the lowest severity of adhesion. CONCLUSIONS We describe the first surgical IBD model by performing colectomy in rats with TNBS-induced colitis, which causes intra-abdominal abscess formation and compromises anastomotic healing. Anastomotic sealing with Histoacryl Flex prevents these complications in this model. Alternative activation of macrophages seems to be involved in its influence on anastomotic healing.","output":"Reducing colorectal anastomotic leakage with tissue adhesive in experimental inflammatory bowel disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has greatly affected access to elective surgery, largely because of concerns for patients and healthcare workers. A return to normal surgery workflow depends prevalence and transmission of coronavirus in elective surgical patients.

METHODS: Prospective cohort study across 8 hospitals in Victoria during July\\\\August 2020, enrolling adults and children admitted to hospital for elective surgery or interventional procedure requiring general anaesthesia. Study outcomes included a positive PCR test for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 in the preoperative period (primary outcome); and for those with a negative test preoperatively, the incidence of a positive PCR test for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 in the postoperative period. RESULTS: We enrolled 4,965 elective adult and paediatric surgical patients from 15 July to 31 August, 2020. Four patients screened negative on questionnaire but had a positive PCR test for coronavirus, resulting in a Bayesian estimated prevalence of 0.12% (95% probability interval: 0 to 0.26%). There were no reports of healthcare worker infections linked to elective surgery during and up to 2 weeks after the study period. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 in asymptomatic elective surgical patients during a second wave was approximately 1 in 833.

One widely supported model for leader acquisition states that a template switch takes place during the generation of negative-strand antileader-containing templates used subsequently for subgenomic mRNA synthesis. In this process, the switch is largely driven by canonical heptameric donor sequences at intergenic sites on the genome that match an acceptor sequence at the 3' end of the genomic leader. With experimentally placed 22-nt-long donor sequences within a bovine coronavirus defective interfering (DI) RNA we have shown that matching sites occurring anywhere within a 65-nt-wide 5'-proximal genomic acceptor hot spot (nt 33 through 97) can be used for production of templates for subgenomic mRNA synthesis from the DI RNA. Here we report that with the same experimental approach, template switches can be induced in trans from an internal site in the DI RNA to the negative-strand antigenome of the helper virus. For these, a 3'-proximal 89-nt acceptor hot spot on the viral antigenome (nt 35 through 123), largely complementary to that described above, was found. Molecules resulting from these switches were not templates for subgenomic mRNA synthesis but, rather, ambisense chimeras potentially exceeding the viral genome in length. The results suggest the existence of a coronavirus 5'-proximal partially double-stranded template switch-facilitating structure of discrete width that contains both the viral genome and antigenome.","output":"5'-proximal hot spot for an inducible positive-to-negative-strand template switch by coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has coincided with a powerful upsurge in antiracist activism in the United States, linking many forms and consequences of racism to public and environmental health.

The experimental results demonstrate that, firstly, our proposed SwiftFlow outperforms all other state-of-the-art unsupervised optical flow estimation approaches in terms of both speed and accuracy; secondly, IPC candidates can be effectively and efficiently detected by our proposed Flow-RCNN, with a better performance than our baseline network, Faster-RCNN; finally, the actual IPCs can be successfully verified by our investigation module after drone re-localization.","output":"ATG-PVD: Ticketing Parking Violations on A Drone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Shark-related injuries (SRIs) are a dreaded, but rare, source of injury that have not been well described. The present study aims to examine the incidence, injuries, and outcomes of SRIs presenting to US trauma centers. STUDY DESIGN The National Trauma Data Bank was queried from 2015 to 2018 to identify SRIs using ICD-10 e-codes W56.41XA, W56.42XA, and W56.49XA. Descriptive analyses were conducted on patient demographics, injuries, hospital course, procedures, and outcomes. RESULTS Fifty-three patients were identified with a mechanism of injury that was shark-related. The median age was 29 years (range: 3-67) and median injury severity score was 5 (IQR: 3-10). The majority of patients (96%) were admitted to the hospital (median length of stay (LOS): 4.0 days, IQR: 3.0-8.0), 55% went directly to the operating room, and 53% required intensive care unit (ICU) admission (median ICU LOS: 4.5 days, IQR: 1.3-7.0). Extremity injuries were common: 47% suffered lower extremity injuries, 40% had upper extremity injuries, and 13% had both. The majority of patients underwent surgical procedures: 83% had soft tissue injuries requiring debridement, flap coverage, or skin grafting; 28% suffered neurovascular injuries (17% requiring nerve repair and 2% requiring arterial bypass); and 59% required orthopedic intervention. Six patients (11%) required amputation(s). All patients survived to discharge. CONCLUSION Although an exceedingly rare source of trauma, SRIs are frequently associated with devastating injuries. Given the severity of injuries and associated procedures required, these patients warrant referral to a trauma center capable of providing comprehensive care.","output":"Shark-Related Injuries in the United States: A National Trauma Data Bank Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in dramatic changes to healthcare delivery. Endoscopic activity has had frequent disruptions during this pandemic. The objective of the study was to see the influence of pandemic over the endoscopic activity. Methods: This retrospective analysis of endoscopic activity was undertaken at Nishtar Hospital Multan. Procedural analysis was done in the three months immediately after covid lockdown (1st April till 30th June 2020) and was compared to a similar period one year back. Results: Five hundred and fifty-four (68.5%) patients underwent endoscopic procedures during the three months of pre-COVID era, while this number reduced to half (n=255, 31.5%) patients during the covid pandemic. Even though the absolute number of Esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGDs) reduced during the pandemic, patients were more likely to undergo EGDs during the COVID pandemic in contrast to the era before the pandemic (79% versus 66%, p = 0.002). The most common indication for EGD was upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The percentage of EGDs done for UGIB rose from almost 60% to 80% during the covid pandemic (p < 0.001). The most common findings were esophageal varices and portal gastropathy (non-significant difference during and before the pandemic). Percentage of ERCPs done for obstructive jaundice doubled during the COVID pandemic (33% versus 65%, p = 0.002).The most common indication for sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy was lower gastrointestinal bleeding. However, no significant difference was found before and during the covid pandemic (41.7% and 45.8% respectively, p=0.72). Internal hemorrhoids were the most common endoscopic finding. Colon cancer diagnosis reduced from 10% to undetected during the pandemic period. Conclusion: COVID pandemic resulted in a considerable reduction in all types of endoscopic procedures. The majority of procedures were done for emergency indications like gastrointestinal bleeding. Rates of cancer detection were significantly reduced.

AIM: We conducted this study to evaluate research done, prior to COVID-19 pandemic, on various decontamination methods for reprocessing of N95-FFRs. METHODS: We searched 5 electronic databases (Pubmed, Google Scholar, Crossref, Ovid, ScienceDirect) and 1 Grey literature database (OpenGrey). We included original studies, published prior to year 2020, which had evaluated any decontamination method on FFRs. Studies had evaluated a reprocessing method against parameters namely physical changes, user acceptability, respirator fit, filter efficiency, microbicidal efficacy and presence of chemical residues post-reprocessing. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found 7887 records amongst which 17 original research articles were finally included for qualitative analysis. Overall, 21 different types of decontamination or reprocessing methods for N95-FFRs were evaluated. Most commonly evaluated method for reprocessing of FFRs was Ultraviolet (Type-C) irradiation (UVGI) which was evaluated in 13/17 (76%) studies.

An effective response thus requires an agile health system that can adjust, reorganize, transform or modify in response to shocks and stress, and to recover quickly in the aftermath. This study aims to identify the major attributes that health systems needed to be adaptable in early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, as observed in selected primary health care facilities in Ethiopia. MethodsThis study employed a retrospective cross-sectional study design based on the ready, willing and able framework for health system resilience. The assessment used two independent, concurrently administrated instruments. A total of 163 health centers were visited from April to June 2020. ResultsThe overall mean score for COVID-19 preparedness was 73.116.1 standard deviation (SD) and it ranged from 28.9 to 99.9 out of 100. The mean score for the ready dimension of preparedness was 75.119.1 SD, for the willing dimension it was 61.624.6 SD and for the able dimension the score was 82.821.0 SD. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that levels of functionality of governing, and management systems, integration of emergency responses into the routine system, and prior experience of implementing quality improvement efforts were positively associated with COVID-19 preparedness. ConclusionHealth system resilience is a result of investments made prior to any incidents to ensure that the system is prepared for unpredicted shocks.

However, it is still unknown how long antibodies persist following vaccination and whether or not the persistence of antibodies has a protective effect against COVID-19. METHODS: Healthcare workers who had received two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were enrolled, and a single-center study was conducted at the National Hospital Organization Hakodate National Hospital. Serum samples from all participants were collected 13C21 weeks (median: 20 weeks) after the second dose of vaccination. The antibody titers were measured using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Elecsys? Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S). Data on characteristics of the participants were gathered from patient records and interview sheets. RESULTS: A total of 401 participants, among whom 70.1% were women and the median age was 42 years, were evaluated in this study. None of the participants had a definite COVID-19 history, and all participants who received complete vaccination showed positive antibody titers. The antibody titer was observed to be higher in participants with younger age (p < 0.001) and those who were females (p = 0.028). Despite the higher risk of infection than that of the general public, no vaccinated staff developed breakthrough infections.

Consequently, our study was designed to assess the phytochemical composition of the aerial parts of Limonium tubiflorum (family Plumbaginaceae) growing wild in Egypt for the first time. In addition, in silico screening and molecular dynamic simulation of all isolated phytoconstituents were run against the main protease (M(pro)) and spike glycoprotein SARS-CoV-2 targets which displayed a crucial role in the replication of this virus. Our findings showed that the phytochemical investigation of 70% ethanol extract of L. tubiflorum aerial parts afforded six known flavonoids; myricetin 3-O-(2-galloyl)--d-galactopyranoside (1), myricetin 3-O-(2-galloyl)--l-rhamnopyranoside (2), myricetin 3-O-(3-galloyl)--l-rhamnopyranoside (3), myricetin 3-O--d-galactopyranoside (5), apigenin (6), myricetin (7), along with two known phenolic acid derivatives; gallic acid (4) and ethyl gallate (8). Docking studies revealed that compounds (1) & (2) were the most effective compounds with binding energies of ?17.9664 & ?18.6652 kcal mol(?1) against main protease and ?18.9244 & ?18.9272 kcal mol(?1) towards spike glycoprotein receptors, respectively.

For each HLA type, the patients' T cells recognized 3-8 immunodominant epitopes that are broadly shared among patients. Remarkably, 94% of screened patients had T cells that recognized at least one of the three most dominant epitopes for a given HLA, and 53% of patients had T cells that recognized all three. Subsequent validation studies in 18 additional A*02:01 patients confirmed the presence of memory CD8+ T cells specific for the top six identified A*02:01 epitopes, and single-cell sequencing revealed that patients often have >5 different T cell clones targeting each epitope, but that the same T cell receptor Valpha and Vbeta regions are predominantly used to recognize these epitopes, even across patients. In total, we identified 29 shared epitopes across the six HLA types studied.

Hence, the importance of rapid, affordable and reproducible virus testing will serve the need to identify and treat infected subjects in a timely manner. Based on the type of diagnostic assay, the primary targets are viral genome (RNA) and encoded proteins.

The more than 25 established populations in the State of Baden-Wrttemberg, Palatine and Hesse (south-west Germany) have become a major nuisance and public health threat. Aedes albopictus deserves special attention as a vector of arboviruses, including dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses. In Germany, Ae. albopictus control programs are implemented by local communities under the auspices of health departments and regulatory offices. METHODS: The control strategy comprised three pillars: (i) community participation (CP) based on the elimination of breeding sites or improved environmental sanitation, using fizzy tablets based on Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (fizzy Bti tablets; Culinex? Tab plus); (ii) door-to-door (DtD) control by trained staff through the application of high doses of a water-dispersible Bti granular formulation (Vectobac? WG) aimed at achieving a long-lasting killing effect; and (iii) implementation of the sterile insect technique (SIT) to eliminate remaining Ae. albopictus populations. Prior to initiating large-scale city-wide treatments on a routine basis, the efficacy of the three elements was evaluated in laboratory and semi-field trials. Special emphasis was given to the mass release of sterile Ae. albopictus males. RESULTS: More than 60% of the local residents actively participated in the first pillar (CP) of the large-scale control program. The most effective element of the program was found to be the DtD intervention, including the application of Vectobac? WG (3000 ITU/mg) to potential breeding sites (10 g per rainwater container, maximum of 200 l = maximum of approx. 150,000 ITU/l, and 2.5 g per container < 50 l) with a persistence of at least 3 weeks. In Ludwigshafen, larval source management resulted in a Container Index for Ae. albopictus of < 1% in 2020 compared to 10.9% in 2019. The mean number of Aedes eggs per ovitrap per 2 weeks was 4.4 in Ludwigshafen, 18.2 in Metzgergrn (Freiburg) (SIT area) and 22.4 in the control area in Gartenstadt (Freiburg). The strong reduction of the Ae. albopictus population by Bti application was followed by weekly releases of 1013 (Ludwigshafen) and 2320 (Freiburg) sterile Ae. albopictus males per hectare from May until October, resulting in a high percentage of sterile eggs. In the trial areas of Ludwigshafen and Frieburg, egg sterility reached 84.7  12.5% and 62.7  25.8%, respectively; in comparison, the natural sterility in the control area was 14.6  7.3%. The field results were in line with data obtained in cage tests under laboratory conditions where sterility rates were 87.5  9.2% after wild females mated with sterile males; in comparison, the sterility of eggs laid by females mated with unirradiated males was only 3.3  2.8%. The overall egg sterility of about 84% in Ludwigshafen indicates that our goal to almost eradicate the Ae. albopictus population could be achieved.

CONCLUSIONS: It is shown that an integrated control program based on a strict monitoring scheme can be most effective when it comprises three components, namely CP, DtD intervention that includes long-lasting Bti-larviciding to strongly reduce Ae. albopictus populations and SIT to reduce the remaining Ae. albopictus population to a minimum or even to eradicate it. The combined use of Bti and SIT is the most effective and selective tool against Ae. albopictus, one of the most dangerous mosquito vector species.

Findings There were four girls and two boys, aged from 15 months to 16 years. They all presented with fever lasting at least five days, irritability, bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, mucus membrane changes, rash, edema.Neither the patients nor the other members of the patients' households had a positive history of COVID-19 infection. None of the six children had a positive PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 or a positive results for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. All patients received empiric antibiotic therapy. Four patients were diagnosed with KD. Three children received standard treatment. One boy did not respond and received an additional 14-days course of methylprednisolone.In two girls, the diagnosis of KD was not made. All patients survived ConclusionFinding a correlation with the Covid-19 pandemic is difficult regarding the situation in our country. According to ECDC, in May 2020 Poland wass still before the peak of the epidemy. The intention of this article is to report that increased hospitalization of children with the inflammatory syndrome is also observed in countries with low levels of transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 virus. Our observation may broaden the knowledge of new inflammatory syndrome, which is not necessarily caused by SARS-Cov-2 but may be worsened by co-infection.","output":"Kawasaki Disease Outbreak in Children During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While recent literature on Asiatic racial form has drawn attention to the ways that techno-orientalism represents Asian life as mechanically non-human, the COVID-19 pandemic and other developments under the Anthropocene draw renewed attention to the construction of Asian peoples as a source of biological and contagious threat to the West.

Western life posits that this Yellow Life must be resisted and ultimately eliminate for the flourishing of all non-Asian life. Through an attention to biological depictions of Asian life in yellow peril literature, I chart how bio-orientalism imagines Yellow Life as ontologically different from Western life forms and as innately animate through both its macroscopic growth and microscopic threat of contagion. Rather than embracing an Asian Americanist response that would also seek to disavow Yellow Life, in a reading of Bryan Thao Worra's poetry I speculate upon embracing Yellow Life as another mode in which Asian American studies imagines otherwise forms of life that challenge and move beyond contemporary Western-centric and humanist responses to anti-Asian racism.","output":"Bio-orientalism and the Yellow Peril of Yellow Life"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) is an internationally recognised tele-mentoring intervention that has been implemented in over 40 countries. The model connects specialist healthcare providers (hubs) with providers in primary and community practice (spokes), often in rural and isolated areas. OBJECTIVES: Project ECHO aims to improve healthcare provider's skills, confidence and knowledge, and to create a community of practitioners using the hub and spoke model. Analysing interview data from 27 Project ECHO network leads and participants in Northern Ireland, this study sought to assess the impact of Project ECHO on improving provider, patient and health system outcomes. RESULTS: Having access to a specialist, a space to share experiences, and being able to disseminate up-to-date best practice were all cited as improving provider knowledge. Providers described improved outcomes for patients such as receiving a new treatment or an efficient referral. Providers reported being more confident in managing patients and thus were less likely to refer unnecessarily, and links between providers at primary and secondary levels being improved. ECHO was deemed an acceptable methodology in terms of format and in improving access to education and training by removing geographic barriers and reducing time barriers. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies to qualitatively analyse outcomes across a number of different ECHO networks, and involving both health and social care networks. The results indicate the benefit of ECHO in improving provider, patient and healthcare outcomes. This has implications for future resourcing decisions, particularly within the context of COVID-19 in which virtual and online training is necessitated by social distancing requirements. This study has implications for wider international contexts in which ECHO may be piloted to address similar challenges. KEY MESSAGES: Participants across our study described Project ECHO as having a positive impact on provider, patient and health systems outcomes.

Their complex nervous systems, intricate color- and texture-changing body patterns, and problem-solving abilities have attracted the attention of the biological research community, while the high growth rates and short life cycles of some species render them suitable for laboratory culture. Octopus chierchiae is a small octopus native to the central Pacific coast of North America whose predictable reproduction, short time to maturity, small adult size, and ability to lay multiple egg clutches (iteroparity) make this species ideally suited to laboratory culture. Here we describe novel methods for culture of O. chierchiae, with emphasis on enclosure designs, feeding regimes, and breeding management. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of multigenerational culture of O. chierchiae. Specifically, O. chierchiae bred in the laboratory grows from a 3.5-millimeter mantle length at hatching to an adult mantle length of approximately 20-30 millimeters in 250-300 days, with 14-15% survivorship to over 400 days of age in first and second generations. O. chierchiae sexually matures at around an estimated six months of age and, unlike most octopus species, can lay multiple clutches of eggs, approximately every 30-90 days. Eggs are large and hatchlings emerge as direct developing octopuses. Based on these results, we propose that O. chierchiae possesses both the practical and biological features needed for a model octopus that can be cultured repeatedly to address a wide range of fundamental biological questions.","output":"The lesser Pacific striped octopus, Octopus chierchiae: an emerging laboratory model for the study of octopuses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need for cost-effective processes to rapidly manufacture antiviral drugs at scale.

METHODS Forty patients with diagnosed with OAB were recruited from a single site. There were two groups: a treatment group (21 patients, mean age 64), which used an active ZIDA? activation device (ZIDA) and a sham control group (SCG, 19 patients, mean age 72) randomized in a 1:1 ratio. After individual fitting of the sock and face-to-face instruction in the use of the device, patients in both groups self-administered the treatment once weekly for 30 min at home for a duration of 12 weeks. Prior to randomization and in Week 12, patients completed two 3-day bladder diaries and a quality-of-life (QOL) survey. Treatment success was defined as at least a 50% reduction in urgency voids with or without incontinence or at least a 30% reduction in 24-h frequency from baseline to Week 12. The key secondary endpoint was change in QOL from baseline to Week 12. RESULTS The success rate for the primary endpoint in the ZIDA group was 80% (n = 16/20) versus 39% (n = 7/18) in the SCG (p = 0.02). For QOL, the least squares mean difference in change from baseline to Week 12 between the ZIDA and sham control arms total score was - 12.7 (95% CI - 20.2 to - 5.1).

Today, OSNs have become a core part of many peoples daily lifestyles. Therefore, increasing dependency on OSNs encourages privacy requirements to protect users from malicious sources. OSNs contain sensitive information about each end user that intruders may try to leak for commercial or non-commercial purposes. Therefore, ensuring different levels of privacy is a vital requirement for OSNs. Various privacy preservation methods have been introduced recently at the user and network levels, but ensuring k-anonymity and higher privacy model requirements such as l-diversity and t-closeness in OSNs is still a research challenge. This study proposes a novel method that effectively anonymizes OSNs using multiple-graph-properties-based clustering. The clustering method introduces the goal of achieving privacy of edge, node, and user attributes in the OSN graph. This clustering approach proposes to ensure k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness in each cluster of the proposed model. We first design the data normalization algorithm to preprocess and enhance the quality of raw OSN data. Then, we divide the OSN data into different clusters using multiple graph properties to satisfy the k-anonymization. Furthermore, the clusters ensure improved k-anonymization by a novel one-pass anonymization algorithm to address l-diversity and t-closeness privacy requirements. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method with state-of-the-art methods using a Yelp real-world dataset.

Our objective was to investigate the clinical features, management, and outcomes of critically ill patients with VZV-related community-acquired pneumonia (VZV-CAP). METHODS: This was an observational study of patients with VZV-CAP admitted to 29 intensive care units (ICUs) from January 1996 to January 2015. RESULTS: One hundred and two patients with VZV-CAP were included. Patients were young (age 39 years (interquartile range 32C51)) and 53 (52%) were immunocompromised. Time since respiratory symptom onset was 2 (1C3) days. There was a seasonal distribution of the disease, with more cases during spring and winter time. All but four patients presented with typical skin rash on ICU admission. Half the patients received mechanical ventilation within 1 (1C2) day following ICU admission (the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) = 150 (80C284), 80% with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)). Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score on day 1 (odds ratio (OR) 1.90 (1.33C2.70); p < 0.001), oxygen flow at ICU admission (OR 1.25 (1.08C1.45); p = 0.004), and early bacterial co-infection (OR 14.94 (2.00C111.8); p = 0.009) were independently associated with the need for mechanical ventilation. Duration of mechanical ventilation was 14 (7C21) days. ICU and hospital mortality rates were 17% and 24%, respectively. All patients were treated with aciclovir and 10 received adjunctive therapy with steroids. Compared to 60 matched steroid-free controls, patients treated with steroids had a longer mechanical ventilation duration, ICU length of stay, and a similar hospital mortality, but experienced more ICU-acquired infections. CONCLUSIONS: Severe VZV-CAP is responsible for an acute pulmonary involvement associated with a significant morbidity and mortality. Steroid therapy did not influence mortality, but increased the risk of superinfection.

Annotations mandate expert knowledge and are time-intensive to obtain through fully manual segmentation methods. Additionally, lung lesions have large inter-patient variations, with some pathologies having similar visual appearance as healthy lung tissues. This poses a challenge when applying existing semi-automatic interactive segmentation techniques for data labelling. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can be learned online while the annotator provides scribble-based interaction. To accelerate learning from only the samples labelled through user-interactions, a patch-based approach is used for training the network. Moreover, we use weighted cross-entropy loss to address the class imbalance that may result from user-interactions. During online inference, the learned network is applied to the whole input volume using a fully convolutional approach. We compare our proposed method with state-of-the-art and show that it outperforms existing methods on the task of annotating lung lesions associated with COVID-19, achieving 16% higher Dice score while reducing execution time by 3$\\\\times$ and requiring 9000 lesser scribbles-based labelled voxels.

Other viral etiologies of FVH are rarer. FVH is life-threatening, but the patients are typically otherwise healthy, and normally resistant to other microbes. Only a small minority of infected individuals develop FVH, and this is the key issue to be addressed for this disease. In mice, mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) infection is the main model for dissecting FVH pathogenesis. Susceptibility to MHV3 differs between genetic backgrounds, with high and low mortality in C57BL6 and A/J mice, respectively. FVH pathogenesis in mice is related to uncontrolled inflammation and fibrinogen deposition. In humans, FVH is typically sporadic, but rare familial forms also exist, suggesting that there may be causal monogenic inborn errors. A recent study reported a single-gene inborn error of human immunity underlying FVH. A patient with autosomal recessive complete IL-18BP deficiency was shown to have FVH following HAV infection. The mechanism probably involves enhanced IL-18- and IFN--dependent killing of hepatocytes by NK and CD8 T cytotoxic cells. Proof-of-principle that FVH can be genetic is important clinically, for the affected patients and their families, and immunologically, for the study of immunity to viruses in the liver. Moreover, the FVH-causing IL18BP genotype suggests that excessive IL-18 immunity may be a general mechanism underlying FVH, perhaps through the enhancement of IFN- immunity.","output":"Human genetic basis of fulminant viral hepatitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The Open Abdomen technique for difficult conditions such as trauma, necrotizing pancreatitis, severe peritonitis, reoperations and transplantations have become a very useful way to save patients.

Consequently, specific operational guidelines were promptly released and stringent containment measures quickly implemented, including access restriction to essential staff only. During the 2nd epidemic wave prevention strategies were gradually relaxed, visitors were readmitted and people in prison (PiP) activities were repristinated. Here, we describe the spread of COVID-19 in 18 detention facilities in Lombardy region, Italy, during the 1st(Mar-Jul 2020) and 2nd(Oct 2020-Feb 2021) waves and the impact of prevention and control measures implemented in prison. Methods We conducted a descriptive retrospective analysis of cases' distribution. Moreover, a comparison among the epidemic burden affecting POs and PiP and a correlation analysis between the number of cases occurred and prevention measures implemented were carried out. Results Our population consists of a monthly average of 2269 prison officers (POs) and 7604 PiP. POs were at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 during both waves. Occurrence of cases among PiP was temporally associated with cases among POs. There was heterogeneity in the size of outbreaks across different prison facilities. During the second wave, COVID-19 spread more widely in prison both among POs (2ndwave attack rate (AR) per 1000 individuals: 27.2;monthly range (MR): 0.9-64.5 vs 1stwave AR 2.4;MR: 0.0-12.1) and PiP (2ndwave AR: 23.5;MR: 11.6-50.8 vs 1stwave AR 1.6;MR: 0-5.2). Conclusions Prevention and control measures adopted timely during the first wave were effective to limit Sars-CoV-2 spread within prison facilities. According to our findings, POs and PiP are population groups at high risk for acquiring and transmitting COVID-19 and should be prioritized for testing, active case finding and vaccination.

This study was carried out to evaluate the noise-related health status among Bangladeshs adult population. 1386 adult Bangladeshis participated in an online survey. A linear regression model was used to evaluate overall noise-related health status determinants. 91% of the survey population reported noisy environments in their neighborhood, with the majority reporting two types (34%) of noise pollution sources. Road vehicles (38%) and construction activities (24%) were identified as significant source of noise pollution. The Bangladeshis are primarily exposed to noise during school and office hours. Socio-demographic information, perceived noise pollution and individual views towards noise pollution were examined as determinants of noise-related health problems. Females were found to be more impacted than males, and young people also expressed concern about noise pollutions influence. Residents in mixed-unit buildings exhibited a significant level of noise-related health problems such as deafness, insomnia, heart disease, headache, stress, poor concentration, production loss, fatigue, irritability, heartburn, indigestion, ulcers, and high blood pressure. Noise pollution from road vehicles and industry has been shown to have a negative effect on peoples health. Individuals affected by noise were interested in noise reduction efforts.

In some studies RSV has been detected just as frequently in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients as in those suffering disease exacerbations, leading to the suggestion that RSV may persist in COPD. Although some studies have found negligible RSV in stable COPD, others have detected RSV in one-quarter to one-third of stable COPD samples. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are explored within the article. A relationship between RSV detection and increased disease severity, including rate of decline in lung function and systemic/airway inflammation, has been found on both occasions it has been sought. Susceptibility to persistent RSV infection could involve both host and viral factors. Cigarette smoking and COPD are likely to result in impaired antiviral immunity, and RSV is capable of evading immune responses by inducing skewed type 2 T-helper cell responses, antagonizing antiviral cytokines, mimicking chemokines, inhibiting apoptosis, and entering immune-privileged cells such as pulmonary neurons. It can also escape an established immune response through antigenic drift. This article examines current evidence regarding persistence of RSV in COPD and its possible mechanisms. We also discuss various roles for RSV persistence in COPD pathogenesis. Further elucidation of the contribution of persistent RSV to the pathogenesis of COPD requires interventional studies. Persistence of RSV in COPD may have direct relevance to the pathogenesis of childhood diseases such as postbronchiolitic wheeze and asthma.","output":"Respiratory syncytial virus persistence in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with concerning phenotypic mutations is of public health interest. Genomic surveillance is an important tool for pandemic response, but many laboratories do not have the resources to support population-level sequencing. We hypothesized that a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) to genotype mutations in the viral spike protein could facilitate high-throughput variant surveillance. We designed and analytically validated a one-step multiplex allele-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to detect three non-synonymous spike protein mutations (L452R, E484K, N501Y). Assay specificity was validated with next-generation whole-genome sequencing. We then screened a large cohort of SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens from our San Francisco Bay Area population. Between December 1, 2020 and March 1, 2021, we screened 4,049 unique infections by genotyping RT-qPCR, with an assay failure rate of 2.8%. We detected 1,567 L452R mutations (38.7%), 34 N501Y mutations (0.84%), 22 E484K mutations (0.54%), and 3 (0.07%) E484K+N501Y mutations. The assay had perfect (100%) concordance with whole-genome sequencing in a validation subset of 229 specimens, and detected B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.427, B.1.429, B.1.526, and P.2 variants, among others. The assay revealed rapid emergence of L452R in our population, with a prevalence of 24.8% in December 2020 that increased to 62.5% in March 2021.

The rapidly and slowly activating delayed rectifier K+ currents, mediated by channels encoded by the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) and KCNQ1 + KCNE1, respectively, are two main currents responsible for ventricular repolarization. The common cause for drugs to induce LQTS is through impairing the hERG channel. For the recent emergence of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, several drugs have been investigated as potential therapies; however, there are concerns about their QT prolongation risk. Here, we studied the effects of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and remdesivir on hERG channels. Our results showed that although chloroquine acutely blocked hERG current (IhERG), with an IC50 of 3.0 M, hydroxychloroquine acutely blocked IhERG 8-fold less potently, with an IC50 of 23.4 M. Azithromycin and remdesivir did not acutely affect IhERG When these drugs were added at 10 M to the cell culture medium for 24 hours, remdesivir increased IhERG by 2-fold, which was associated with an increased mature hERG channel expression. In addition, these four drugs did not acutely or chronically affect KCNQ1 + KCNE1 channels. Our data provide insight into COVID-19 drug-associated LQTS and cardiac safety concerns. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This work demonstrates that, among off-label potential COVID-19 treatment drugs chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and remdesivir, the former two drugs block hERG potassium channels, whereas the latter two drugs do not. All four drugs do not affect KCNQ1 + KCNE1. As hERG and KCNQ1 + KCNE1 are two main K+ channels responsible for ventricular repolarization, and most drugs that induce long QT syndrome (LQTS) do so by impairing hERG channels, these data provide insight into COVID-19 drug-associated LQTS and cardiac safety concerns.","output":"COVID-19 Drugs Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, but Not Azithromycin and Remdesivir, Block hERG Potassium Channels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 24-year-old active duty soldier was evacuated from Afghanistan to the United States after persistent upper respiratory tract infection.

Newer viruses are still being discovered and those that are already known are being incriminated in the aetiology of clinical conditions with hitherto unknown causes. Apart from frequently causing infections in the general community, many types of viruses are also significant nosocomial pathogens. While it is generally agreed that we underestimate the proportion of nosocomial infections that are viral, due to a lack of routine monitoring, viruses easily account for more than 30% of the cases of hospital-acquired infections in many paediatric settings. Indeed, the relative importance of viruses in this respect is increasing due to a number of societal and demographic changes as well as alterations in healthcare practices. Safe vaccines against many common nosocomial viral agents are currently unavailable while there is also a virtual lack of effective and affordable chemotherapy against them. There is, therefore, renewed emphasis on preventive strategies by better understanding of the relative importance of various vehicles in the nosocomial spread of viruses and by infection control using microbicides. This, in turn, has stimulated considerable interest in the development of formulations that are not only safer but which also have demonstrated activity against major types of nosocomial viral pathogens. Further, much work is now underway to design better methods to assess the virucidal activity of microbicides used to decontaminate hands, reusable medical devices and environmental surfaces in critical areas of healthcare settings. It is anticipated that these approaches will result in reducing the health and economic impact of nosocomial infections due to viruses.","output":"Microbicides and the environmental control of nosocomial viral infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The data on CAPA in the U.S. are limited to date and clinical characteristics unique to this phenomenon have not been widely reported. Methods This retrospective observational study was conducted at multiple VA hospitals across southern California and Arizona. CAPA cases were identified in inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 based on microbiologic or serologic evidence of aspergillosis and pulmonary abnormalities on imaging, and were classified according to ECMM/ISHAM consensus definitions. Characteristics of interest included immunosuppressive/modulatory agents used prior to onset of CAPA, COVID-19 disease course, length of hospitalization, and mortality. Results Seventeen patients with probable (18%) or possible (82%) CAPA were identified from April 2020 to March 2021. Values below reported as medians. All patients were male and 13 (76%) were white, with age 74 years and BMI 26 kg/m2. Baseline comorbidities included diabetes mellitus (47%), cardiovascular disease (65%), and pulmonary disease (71%). Evidence of aspergillosis was mostly based on respiratory culture, with mainly A. fumigatus (75%). Systemic corticosteroids were used in 14 patients, with a total dose of 400 mg prednisone equivalents starting 10 days prior to Aspergillus detection. Patients also received tocilizumab (18%), leflunomide (6%), tacrolimus (6%), mycophenolate (6%), and investigational agent LSALT or placebo (6%);2 patients (12%) did not receive any immunosuppression/modulation. Length of hospitalization for COVID-19 was 22 days. Death occurred in 12 patients (71%), including all patients with probable CAPA, at 34 days after COVID-19 diagnosis and 16 days after CAPA diagnosis. Eight patients (47%) were treated for aspergillosis;mortality did not appear to differ with treatment (75% vs. 67%). Table 1. COVID-19 Inpatient Characteristics Table 2. Incidence of Aspergillus Growth on Respiratory Culture Conclusion This case series reports high mortality among patients with CAPA;the primary contributor to this outcome is unclear. Frequency of lower respiratory tract sampling in patients with COVID-19 may have limited diagnosis of CAPA. Interestingly, inpatient respiratory cultures with Aspergillus spp. increased compared to previous years.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the properties of activated micronized (5 microns) zeolite clinoptilolite (MZC) from Transylvania, Romania, first by testing it in vitro and then in vivo on calves with diarrhea. To assess the toxic potential of the MZC, we performed a cell cytotoxicity assay using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) technique on primary bovine intestinal epithelial cells (BIECs). The antimicrobial activity of MZC was investigated by measuring the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) on Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922). The uncontrolled in vivo study was carried out over 8 days on a fattening farm, with some 650 calves. Selected calves were randomly assigned to four groups of 20 individuals. Several combinations between MZC, chestnut extract, and oxytetracycline were tested.

The course is taught in a traditional manner, with weekly lectures, fortnightly tutorials and three practical sessions. In response to the growing numbers of COVID-19 cases, in mid-March the University leadership moved to cease face-to-face teaching. By this time, 58 of 96 students had completed the first two (of three) face-to-face laboratory practicals. In response to this decision, teaching of all practical based content was moved online for all students. The first question was, how do we teach practical content online? And secondly, how do we teach hands-on skills? The first question was addressed using a suite of online simulations, progressively developed since 2013. Simulations are widely used and shown to be useful as teaching aids in STEM. A total of five simulations were introduced each covering key aspects of laboratory practice, including fundamental mathematical skills, reading, and setting a pipette, basic Biochemistry assays, protein quantification, and enzyme kinetics. The second issue of teaching hands on skills was addressed once restrictions were eased. Students were invited to attend the laboratory to learn the kinesthetic skills with instructor guidance.

For countries with large population mixing, the spread of the epidemic today also fits into a single wave, but with a huge capacity value (for Brazil - 80 million people, for India - 40 million people). We estimated that the epidemic spread in the world today fits into 5 waves. The first two waves are caused by the epidemic spread in China (the first - in Wuhan), the third - by the epidemic spread in European countries, the fourth mainly by the epidemic spread in Russia and the USA, the fifth wave is mainly caused by the epidemic spread in Latin America and South Asia. It was the fifth wave that led to the spread of the coronavirus epidemic COVID-19 entering a new phase, with an increase in the number of infected more than 100 thousand inhabitants. For all the studied countries and the world, for each of the superposition waves, the wave capacities and growth indicators were calculated.

DESIGN: Observational cohort study. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 472 HCWs participated from two distinct acute hospital settings, A and B, in the South-East of Ireland. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures of psychological distressdepression, anxiety, acute and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)as dictated by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). An independent sample t-test and a Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine significance of difference in continuous variables between groups. Categorical variables were assessed for significance with a (2) test for independence. RESULTS: The DASS-21 provided independent measures of depression (mean 4.57, IQR 2C7), anxiety (mean 3.87, IQR 1C6) and stress (mean 7.41, IQR 4C10). Positive scores were reflected in 201 workers (42.6%) for depression and 213 (45.1%) for both anxiety and stress. The IES-R measured subjective distress on three subscales: intrusion (mean 1.085, IQR 0.375C1.72), avoidance (mean 1.008, IQR 0.375C1.5) and hyperarousal (mean 1.084, IQR 0.5C1.667). Overall, 195 cases (41.3%) were concerning for PTSD. Site B scored significantly higher across all parameters of depression (5.24 vs 4.08, p<0.01), anxiety (4.66 vs 3.3, p<0.01), stress (8.91 vs 6.33, p<0.01) and PTSD (0.058 vs 0.043, p<0.01). Worse outcomes were also noted in HCWs with underlying medical ailments.

The objective of our study was to describe the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infections in different pediatric age groups during the first 2 months of the fall back-to-school period, in the context of increasing viral transmission in France. METHODS: Weekly epidemiological data provided by Sant Publique France and the Ministry of National Education were analyzed according to the age groups defined by the different school levels. Weeks (W) 34C42 were considered for analysis. RESULTS: The PCR positivity rate and incidence rate increased in all age groups during the study period, in an age-dependent manner. At W42, with adults being considered as reference, the risk ratio for a positive PCR test was 0.46 [95% CI: 0.44C0.49] and 0.69 [0.68C0.70] for children aged 0C5 years and 6C17 years, respectively. Similarly, the incidence rate ratio was 0.09 [0.08C0.09], 0.31 [0.30C0.32], 0.64 [0.63C0.66], and 1.07 [1.05C1.10] for children aged 0C5 years, 6C10 years, 11C14 years, and 15C17 years, respectively. Children and adolescents accounted for 1.9% of the newly hospitalized patients between W34 and W42, and for 1.3% of new intensive care admissions. No death was observed. Among infected children and adolescents, the percentage of asymptomatic individuals was 57% at W34 and 48% at W42. The number of schools closed remained low, less than 1% throughout the study period. The number of confirmed cases among school staff was consistent with the data measured in the general population. CONCLUSION: In the context of increasing viral transmission in the population, the spread among children and adolescents remained lower than that observed among adults, despite keeping schools open. However, the impact was age-dependent, with data in high schools close to those observed in adults.","output":"Reopening schools in the context of increasing COVID-19 community transmission: The French experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases such as plague, yellow fever, influenza etc have a well-established history of carrying stigma Such stigma is shaped not only by the disea","output":"Social Construction of Stigma and its Implications a Observations from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of high-end targeted drugs and vaccines against modern pandemic infections, such as COVID-19, can take a too long time that lets the epidemic spin up and harms society.

One way to enhance the ability to resist the infection is to activate the nonspecific immunity using a suitable driving-up agent, such as plant polysaccharides, particularly our drug Panavir isolated from the potato shoots. Earlier, we have shown the noticeable anti-viral and anti-bacterial activity of Panavir. Here we demonstrate the pro-inflammation activity of Panavir, which four-to-eight times intensified the ATP and MIF secretion by HL-60 cells. This effect was mediated by the active phagocytosis of the Panavir particles by the cells.

Prior studies have suggested that its larger size might lead to entrapment in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), affect circuit function, and attenuate its efficacy. We present a successful case of a severe COVID-19 patient treated with MSC-derived exosomes while receiving veno-venous (VV) ECMO support. Case Report 41-year-old unvaccinated obese White male with no past medical history presenting with shortness of breath and a +COVID-19 nasopharyngeal test was admitted receiving high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), remdesivir, and dexamethasone (Day 1), followed by intubation (day 5), and a peripheral VV ECMO insertion (day 10) due to worsening RF. We used bivalirudin for post-ECMO anticoagulation. Subsequently, he received the first cycle of MSC-derived exosomes on alternative days (day 1, 3, & 5) between days 13-17, followed by the second cycle between days 34-38. After administration of exosomes, the plasma concentration of inflammatory markers reduced, including a decrease of 77% for ferritin, 74% for CRP, and 62% for procalcitonin in approximately one week, along with consistent improvement of PaO2/FiO2 ratio. ECMO membrane oxygenator was exchanged on day 23 at the time of tracheostomy. After successful weaning, ECMO decannulation was performed on day 47, and the patient was discharged home on day 61. Summary ECMO has emerged as a supportive strategy for patients with severe COVID-19 related RF. The patient's inflammatory response has been implicated in the pathophysiology of lung failure. Multiple pharmacological methods are employed to control the severity of this inflammatory response, thus preventing progression to the fibrotic stage of the disease. In our experience, MSC-derived exosomes neither resulted in any side effects nor impaired the function of ECMO and might have enhanced the recovery of the patient.","output":"Successful Treatment of COVID-19 Patient on ECMO Using Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC)-Derived Exosomes: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background With over 11 million people incarcerated globally, prevention and control of COVID-19 in custodial settings is a critical component of the public health response. Given the risk of rapid transmission in these settings, it is important to know what guidance existed for responding to COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic. We sought to identify, collate, and summarise guidance for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in custodial settings in the first six months of 2020. We conducted a systematic search of peer-reviewed and grey literature, and manually searched relevant websites to identify publications up to 30 June 2020 outlining recommendations to prevent and/or control COVID-19 in custodial settings. We inductively developed a coding framework and assessed recommendations using conventional content analysis. Results We identified 201 eligible publications containing 374 unique recommendations across 19 domains including: preparedness; physical environments; case identification, screening, and management; communication; external access and visitation; psychological and emotional support; recreation, legal, and health service adaptation; decarceration; release and community reintegration; workforce logistics; surveillance and information sharing; independent monitoring; compensatory measures; lifting control measures; evaluation; and key populations/settings. We identified few conflicting recommendations. Conclusions The breadth of recommendations identified in this review reflects the complexity of COVID-19 response in custodial settings. Despite the availability of comprehensive guidance early in the pandemic, important gaps remain in the implementation of recommended prevention and control measures globally, and in the availability of evidence assessing their effectiveness on reducing COVID-19 disease, impact on people in custody and staff, and implementation.

Studies of the brain, lung and immune system reveal that the v8 integrin-TGF axis mediates cell-cell contact and communication within complex multicellular structures. Perturbing components of this axis results in aberrant cell-cell adhesion and signaling leading to the initiation of various pathologies, including neurodegeneration, fibrosis and cancer.

Our changing climate has added urgency to the crisis. Many experts warn that our current agricultural practices are undermining the resource base - soil, water, seeds, climate - on which future food production depends. Now the global COVID-19 pandemic threatens to further exacerbate food insecurity for many of the world's poor. Africa is projected to overtake South Asia by 2030 as the region with the greatest number of hungry people. An alarming 250 million people in Africa now suffer from \\"undernourishment\\", the U.N. term for chronic hunger. If policies do not change, experts project that number to soar to 433 million in 2030. A growing number of farmers, scientists, and development experts now advocate a shift from high-input, chemical-intensive agriculture to low-input ecological farming. They are supported by an impressive array of new research documenting both the risks of continuing to follow our current practices and the potential benefits of a transition to more sustainable farming. The new initiatives have been met with a chorus of derision from an unsurprising group of commentators, many associated with agribusiness interests. They dismiss agroecology as backward, a nostalgic call for a return to traditional peasant production methods which they say have failed to feed growing populations in developing countries. For such critics, the future is innovation and innovation is technology: the kinds of commercial high-yield seeds and inorganic fertilizers associated with the Green Revolution. This paper explores the ways in which this innovation narrative flips reality on its head, presenting Green Revolution practices of the past as if they were new innovations. It does so through the lens of the battle for Africa's food future, examining the disappointing results from the Alliance for a Green Revolution for Africa (AGRA). In contrast, the real innovations in Africa are coming from soil scientists, ecologists, nutritionists, and farmers themselves who actively seek alternatives to approaches that have been failing small-scale farmers for years. A wide range of farmer organizations, scientists, and advocates offer a broad and diverse array of ecologically-based initiatives based on sound science. These are proving far more innovative and effective, raising productivity, crop and nutritional diversity, and incomes while reducing farmers' costs and government outlays.","output":"Old fertilizer in new bottles: selling the past as innovation in Africa's green revolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of studies providing empirical evidence on e\\\\learning in the field of special education is limited.

The participants of the study consist of 809 university students with a single disability (orthopaedic, visual or hearing). Confirmatory factor analysis and two\\\\way ANOVA were used in the analysis of the study. The factor analysis showed that validity and reliability of the measurement tool was established and the model fit was good. The results revealed that for all dependent variables (social influence, self\\\\efficacy, compatibility and facilitating conditions), students with orthopaedic disability and visual impairment had higher scores than students with hearing impairment. On the other hand, contrary to expectations, there was no difference between students with orthopaedic disability and students with visual impairment in any of the factors according to the type of disability. In addition, none of the factors differed by gender.

AIM To identify factors associated with face masking in New Zealand during COVID-19 Alert Level 4 lockdown to inform strategies to socialise and support mass masking. METHODS A quantitative online survey conducted in New Zealand during April 2020 invited residents aged 18 years to complete a questionnaire. Questions about face masking were included in the survey. The sample was drawn from a commissioned research panel survey, with boosted sampling for Mori and Pacific participants. Responses were weighted to reflect the New Zealand population for all analyses. RESULTS A total of 1015 individuals participated. Self-reported beliefs were strongly related to behaviours, with respondents viewing face masking measures as 'somewhat' or 'very' effective in preventing them from contracting COVID-19 more likely to report having worn a face mask than respondents who viewed them as 'not at all' effective. The strongest barriers to face mask use included beliefs that there was a mask shortage and that the needs of others were greater than their own. DISCUSSION Highlighting the efficacy of and dispelling myths about the relative efficacy of mask types and socialising people to the purpose of mass masking will contribute to community protective actions of mask wearing in the New Zealand response to COVID-19.","output":"Wearing one for the team: views and attitudes to face covering in New Zealand/Aotearoa during COVID-19 Alert Level 4 lockdown."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract A f?cal suspension from a patient with gastroenteritis, which contained large numbers of coronavirus particles when examined by electron microscopy, was inoculated into human embryo intestinal-organ cultures and primary human embryo-kidney monolayers.

As this pandemic advances and new potential pandemics are on the horizon, a precise analysis of recent fluctuations of trade becomes necessary for international decisions and controlling the world in a similar crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic made a new pattern of trade in the world and affected how businesses work and trade with each other. It means that every potential pandemic or any unprecedented event in the world can change the market rules. This research develops a novel model to have a proper estimation of the stock market values with respect to the COVID-19 dataset using long short-term memory networks (LSTM). The goal of this study is to establish a model that can predict near future regarding the variable set of features. The nature of the features in each pandemic is completely different; therefore, prediction results for a pandemic by a specific model cannot be applied to other pandemics. Hence, recognizing and extracting the features which affect the pandemic is pivotal. In this study, we develop a framework that provides a better understanding of the features and feature selection process. Although the global impacts of COVID-19 are complicated, we are trying to show how additional features like COVID-19 cases can help to forecast in a real-world scenario, rather than relying solely on the history of tickers, which is used conventionally for prediction. This study is based on a preliminary analysis of features such as COVID-19 cases and other market tickers for enhancing forecasting models performance against fluctuations in the market. Our predictors are based on the market value data and COVID-19 pandemic daily time-series data (i.e. the number of new cases). In this study, we selected Gold price as a base for our forecasting task which can be replaced by any other markets. We have applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) LSTM, vector sequence output LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, and encoderCdecoder LSTM on the dataset. The results of the vector sequence output LSTM achieved an MSE of [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] , and [Formula: see text] on the validation set respectfully for 1 day, 2 days, and 30 days predictions in advance which are outperforming other proposed method in the literature.","output":"A Deep Learning-Based Method for Forecasting Gold Price with Respect to Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Since many different rates have been reported in the literature and the studies conducted are mostly based on the patient anamnesis, it was aimed to analyze the olfactory dysfunction in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) quantitatively and to reveal its progress by time. METHODS: Patients who described new-onset olfactory dysfunction, who were treated in the COVID-19 departments of our hospital and whose PCR tests demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 presence were included in the study and they were investigated prospectively. Clinical information of all the patients was taken and the levels of olfactory function were detected using the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT). Scores equal to or below 8 are considered as olfactory dysfunction. Patients who were followed up for 3 months were reevaluated with the BSIT test at the end of the third month and the progression of the symptom was investigated. RESULTS: The mean BSIT test score of the 42 patients (23 female patients, 19 male patients, mean age: 41.2  14.6) was 5.2  2.2. There was severe olfactory dysfunction in 16.7% of the patients (0-2 points), moderate olfactory dysfunction in 31% (3-5 points), and mild olfactory dysfunction in 52.4% (6-8 points). After a follow-up for 3 months, full recovery was observed in 36 patients (85.7%) and the mean test score rose to 9.9  1.8. Although olfactory dysfunction persisted in 6 patients, an elevation in test scores was noted. Olfactory dysfunction was the first symptom in 17 patients (40%) and the other symptoms occurred after 2 days (1-6) on average. CONCLUSION: We investigated olfactory dysfunction caused by COVID-19 using BSIT, and found a high rate of moderate-mild level symptoms with a high level of recovery in the 3-month follow-up. The finding revealing that olfactory dysfunction was the first symptom in 40% of the patients suggests the importance of inquiry on olfactory functions for the early diagnosis of the disease.","output":"Quantitative evaluation and progress of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The end of the global pandemic caused by COVID-19 and a future without masks and restrictions are promising with the discovery of a vaccine.

We have assessed the performance of serum apolipoprotein-A1, the main transporter of HDL-cholesterol, to identify the early spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in the general population and its diagnostic performance for the Covid-19. Methods We compared the daily mean serum apolipoprotein-A1 during the first 34 weeks of 2020 in a population that is routinely followed for a risk of liver fibrosis risk in the USA (212,297 sera) and in France (20,652 sera) in relation to a local increase in confirmed cases, and in comparison to the same period in 2019 (266,976 and 28,452 sera, respectively). We prospectively assessed the sensitivity of this marker in an observational study of 136 consecutive hospitalized cases and retrospectively evaluated its specificity in 7,481 controls representing the general population. Results The mean serum apolipoprotein-A1 levels in the survey populations began decreasing in January 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was highly correlated with the daily increase in confirmed Covid-19 cases in the following 34 weeks, both in France and USA, including the June and mid-July recovery periods in France. Apolipoprotein-A1 at the 1.25 g/L cutoff had a sensitivity of 90.6% (95%CI84.2-95.1) and a specificity of 96.1% (95.7-96.6%) for the diagnosis of Covid-19. The area under the characteristics curve was 0.978 (0.957-0.988), and outperformed haptoglobin and liver function tests. The adjusted risk ratio of apolipoprotein-A1 for survival without transfer to intensive care unit was 5.61 (95%CI 1.02-31.0;P=0.04).

In this study, the potential of some flavonoids presents in propolis to bind to ACE-II receptors was calculated with in silico. Binding constants of ten flavonoids, caffeic acid, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, chrysin, galangin, myricetin, rutin, hesperetin, pinocembrin, luteolin and quercetin were measured using the AutoDock 4.2 molecular docking program. And also, these binding constants were compared to reference ligand of MLN-4760. The results are shown that rutin has the best inhibition potentials among the studied molecules with high binding energy - 8.04 kcal/mol, and it is followed by myricetin, quercetin, caffeic acid phenethyl ester and hesperetin. However, the reference molecule has binding energy of - 7.24 kcal/mol.

While thermodynamic models have been used to predict the effect of constant-temperature surroundings on virus inactivation rate, the relationship between virus lifetime and DTR has not been explained using first principles. Here, we model the inactivation of viruses based on temperature-dependent chemical kinetics with a time-varying temperature profile to account for the daily mean temperature and DTR simultaneously. The exponential Arrhenius relationship governing the rate of virus inactivation causes fluctuations above the daily mean temperature during daytime to increase the instantaneous rate of inactivation by a much greater magnitude than the corresponding decrease in inactivation rate during nighttime. This asymmetric behavior results in shorter predicted virus lifetimes when considering DTR and consequently reveals a potential physical mechanism for the inverse correlation observed between the number of cases and DTR reported in statistical epidemiological studies. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a case study on the effect of daily mean temperature and DTR on the lifetime of SARS-CoV-2 was performed for the five most populous cities in the United States. In Los Angeles, where mean monthly temperature fluctuations are low (DTR &#8776; 7 C), accounting for DTR decreases predicted SARS-CoV-2 lifetimes by only 10%; conversely, accounting for DTR for a similar mean temperature but larger mean monthly temperature fluctuations in Phoenix (DTR &#8776; 15 C) decreases predicted lifetimes by 50%.

Any observational or controlled study that tested the efficacy of any pharmacological intervention in COVID-19 patients either prospectively or retrospectively was included in the qualitative analysis. We assessed outcomes as dichotomous variables, i.e., a patient having a positive clinical outcome. Relative risks/risk ratios (RR) having a 95% confidence interval (CI) were derived. Studies conforming to inclusion criteria were pooled using the random-effect model. RESULTS: Nine trials on hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), six studies on antiviral, four studies on monoclonal antibodies, two on corticosteroids, two on convalescent plasma (CP), and one on interferon-2b were included in the systematic review. Meta-analysis containing six scientific trials and analyzing 522 patients revealed that the relative risk of positive clinical outcomes with HCQ treatment was 1.042 (95% CI, 0.884 to 1.874) with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 12.6. A meta-analysis of two studies analyzing 285 patients showed that the relative risk of clinical resolution with lopinavir and ritonavir combination was 1.152 (95% CI 0.709 to 1.87). Out of various antiviral used, the only remdesivir showed a positive result in a case series. Monoclonal antibodies showed decreased C-reactive protein, decreased oxygen, and ventilator requirements. A corticosteroid may increase mortality with increased dose. Two small case series on CP showed some promising results. CONCLUSION: The study showed slightly favorable results with HCQ, monoclonal antibodies, remdesivir, and CP in treating COVID-19 patients.

RESULTS: People living with dementia often had a basic understanding of COVID-19 restrictions but could have difficulty translating this into personalised risk-appraisal of their own actions. Managing COVID-19 risks facing people living with dementia at home was largely done by family carers, exemplified by changes to living arrangements, which could strain or sustain caring relationships. Well-established familial caring relationships contributed to the wellbeing of the person living with dementia and their carer, as well as keeping to simple routines that included leaving the home for exercise and stimulation. People living with dementia reported some negative psychological and cognitive effects due to the imposed restrictions, such as increased apathy, irritability, or anxiety, which were fuelled by lack of social engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Structuring routine (remote) social interactions where possible could increase social engagement and improve wellbeing for people living with dementia, especially those with limited familial support in a post-COVID-19 context. As some care relationships had been restructured to manage COVID-19 risks, additional carer strain may emerge as a result of the impact on the independence of the person living with dementia and come to the attention of professionals in health and care services. People living with dementia and their carers highlighted the importance of maintaining or adapting routines which may be useful learning for professionals, although additional support may be necessary for those who are impacted by more severe or worsening symptoms of dementia.","output":"Life under lockdown and social restrictions - the experiences of people living with dementia and their carers during the COVID-19 pandemic in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective mentoring is a key mechanism propelling successful research and academic careers, particularly for early career scholars. Most mentoring programs focus on models pairing senior and early career researchers, with limited focus on peer mentoring.

This special communication highlights the value of peer mentoring by describing a case study of an early career IS peer mentoring group. We delineate our curriculum and structure; support and processes; and products and outcomes. We highlight important group member characteristics to consider during group formation and continuation. The groups long-term (6 years) success was attributed to the balance of similarities and differences among group members. Members were in a similar career phase and used similar methodologies but studied different health topics at different institutions. Group members gave and received instrumental and psychosocial support and shared resources and knowledge.

The aim of our study was to investigate whether virtual trainings (VT) organized during the COVID-19 pandemic at our university were effective in replacing in-person bed-side education in intensive therapy and anaesthesiology among fifth-year medical students, both from students' and instructors' perspectives. Methods: : This was a cross-sectional study consisting of three parts: a 20-item students' questionnaire filled out by students participating in VT, a 22-item instructors' questionnaire filled out by instructors taking part in virtual education and a 20-item knowledge test completed by students participating in VT, as well as by students visiting bed-side trainings (BT) during the same semester, before COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaires focused on effectiveness, content, self-preparedness, technical background and interactivity of VT. Instructors' and students' responses given to the common questions, as well as the knowledge test results were compared. Mann-Whitney U test was used for group comparisons and binary logistic regression was performed to analyse the influence of previous health-care experience on students' feeling of self-preparedness. Results: : 113 students (68% response rate) and 29 instructors (97% response rate) filled out the questionnaires. The majority of students found our VT useful and effective;however, a considerable number of participants felt disadvantaged by taking a virtual course instead of bed-side learning sessions and would recommend to keep virtual distance learning methods combined with BT. Instructors found VT overall effective and deemed the transfer of their knowledge satisfactory;however, they described worse interactivity and contact with students during virtual sessions compared to in-person teaching. Instructors showed a clearer consensus that VT should not replace BT in the future, while students answers were more divided in this regard. Previous health-care experience did not influence students' feeling of self-preparedness. One hundred and twenty-seven students (56 after VT and 71 after BT) completed the end-of-semester knowledge test. Students participating in VT performed better than students visiting BT (median score VT:83.5 vs BT:77.3;p=0.015).

ANN is a mathematical modeling tool used in several sciences and engineering fields. FC has been mainly applied on ANNs with three different objectives, such as systems stabilization, systems synchronization, and parameters training, using optimization algorithms. FC and some control strategies have been satisfactorily employed to attain the synchronization and stabilization of ANNs. To show this fact, in this manuscript are summarized, the architecture of the systems, the control strategies, and the fractional derivatives used in each research work, also, the achieved goals are presented. Regarding the parameters training using optimization algorithms issue, in this manuscript, the systems types, the fractional derivatives involved, and the optimization algorithm employed to train the ANN parameters are also presented. In most of the works found in the literature where ANNs and FC are involved, the authors focused on controlling the systems using synchronization and stabilization. Furthermore, recent applications of ANNs with FC in several fields such as medicine, cryptographic, image processing, robotic are reviewed in detail in this manuscript. Works with applications, such as chaos analysis, functions approximation, heat transfer process, periodicity, and dissipativity, also were included. Almost to the end of the paper, several future research topics arising on ANNs involved with FC are recommended to the researchers community. From the bibliographic review, we concluded that the Caputo derivative is the most utilized derivative for solving problems with ANNs because its initial values take the same form as the differential equations of integer-order.","output":"Artificial neural networks: a practical review of applications involving fractional calculus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY DESIGN: The Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted oral and maxillofacial (OMF) surgeons practice globally. We implemented a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey among the OMF surgeons of India. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the study were (1) gathering data among the maxillofacial surgeons in terms of their occupational exposure and access to adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and (2) to estimate how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the practice of OMF surgeons in India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Complete responses of 178 OMF surgeons were included in the study. Descriptive and analytic statistics were computed. The level of statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Binary logistic regression models were created to assess the predictors of the impact of the COVID-19. RESULTS: Out of the 178 respondents of the study, most (37.1%) were following their hospital's guidelines. Most had access to adequate PPE (89.9%), whereas 93.8% had COVID-19 testing available. One hundred and thirty-three (74.7%) surgeons were involved in teleconsultation. Ninety-two (51.7%) and 166 (93.3%) were involved in elective surgery and emergency surgeries, respectively. Median outpatient department cases and number of surgeries done per week reduced by 73.9% and 66.7% (P < 0.001), respectively. Most surgeons (86%) experienced that cost of treatment had increased during the COVID. Over 75% were afraid to get infected with COVID, whereas 44.9% were anxious to lose the income. More than 56% of the OMF surgeons reported a fall in income and 94% reported decreased productivity in academic research. Most surgeons (93.8%) believed that COVID had a positive impact on human behavior in terms of hand hygiene.

We aimed to assess the risk perceptions of CCS related to COVID-19 (perceived infection risk, perceived risk of experiencing a severe illness in the event of infection), and their forgoing of health care during the year 2020. METHODS: In December 2020, we interviewed through an online self-report questionnaire 580 5-year CCS participating in the French Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (FCCSS) cohort. Combining clinical and patient-reported outcomes, we studied predictors of perceived risks related to COVID-19 and forgoing health care. RESULTS: Overall, 60% of respondents stated that COVID-19 could have severe consequences for their health if infected. Survivors with a cardiovascular disease and those who felt more at risk of being infected were more likely to think that COVID-19 could have severe health consequences for them. Moreover, 30% of respondents seeking care declared they had forgone at least one medical appointment in 2020. Forgoing medical appointments was more common among CCS who reported a deterioration in their financial situation in 2020 and those who felt more at risk of being infected. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a considerable proportion of survivors had forgone medical appointments because of the pandemic; forgoing care was more frequent among the most socioeconomically disadvantaged survivors.

In the present study, we report that ISG15 conjugation is essential for antiviral IFN responses mediated by the viral RNA sensor MDA5. ISGylation of the caspase activation and recruitment domains of MDA5 promotes its oligomerization and thereby triggers activation of innate immunity against a range of viruses, including coronaviruses, flaviviruses and picornaviruses. The ISG15-dependent activation of MDA5 is antagonized through direct de-ISGylation mediated by the papain-like protease of SARS-CoV-2, a recently emerged coronavirus that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched for original studies describing sleep abnormalities in children and adolescents with or without pre-existing neurobehavioral disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pooled estimates for various sleep abnormalities were calculated using a random-effect model. RESULTS: Of 371 articles screened, 16 studies were included. Among these, five studies were in preschool children, two were in children with pre-existing neurobehavioral disorders and the remaining were in school going children and adolescents. The outcome measures used for sleep were markedly heterogeneous across the studies. The pooled prevalence of any sleep disturbance in children during the pandemic was 54%(95%CI:50C57%). Interestingly, the prevalence in pre-school children was lower than pre-pandemic times (RR = 0.87; 95% CI:0.58C1.30) but this was not statistically significant.

Objective: To describe myocarditis presenting after COVID-19 vaccination within the Military Health System. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective case series studied patients within the US Military Health System who experienced myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination between January and April 2021. Patients who sought care for chest pain following COVID-19 vaccination and were subsequently diagnosed with clinical myocarditis were included. Exposure: Receipt of a messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine between January 1 and April 30, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical diagnosis of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination in the absence of other identified causes. Results: A total of 23 male patients (22 currently serving in the military and 1 retiree; median [range] age, 25 [20-51] years) presented with acute onset of marked chest pain within 4 days after receipt of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. All military members were previously healthy with a high level of fitness. Seven received the BNT162b2-mRNA vaccine and 16 received the mRNA-1273 vaccine. A total of 20 patients had symptom onset following the second dose of an appropriately spaced 2-dose series. All patients had significantly elevated cardiac troponin levels. Among 8 patients who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging within the acute phase of illness, all had findings consistent with the clinical diagnosis of myocarditis. Additional testing did not identify other etiologies for myocarditis, including acute COVID-19 and other infections, ischemic injury, or underlying autoimmune conditions. All patients received brief supportive care and were recovered or recovering at the time of this report. The military administered more than 2.8 million doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in this period. While the observed number of myocarditis cases was small, the number was higher than expected among male military members after a second vaccine dose. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series, myocarditis occurred in previously healthy military patients with similar clinical presentations following receipt of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Further surveillance and evaluation of this adverse event following immunization is warranted.

The fight against this epidemic has become the center of our daily clinical practice as well as of our private lives, in which avoiding infection has become one of our most important goals. Even though COVID-19 is a potentially lethal disease, especially for the elderly and people with chronic diseases, it did not cause all the other life-threatening diseases to vanish. On the contrary, many scheduled medical activities and procedures, especially preventive and non-urgent internal and surgical activities, had to be postponed due to COVID-19 crisis. This interruption in the health care system can negatively affect the diagnosis and management of our patients with other health issues, namely malignant skin tumors, of which melanoma is the most aggressive. In this letter, we as dermatovenereologists from the Croatian Referral Centre of The Ministry of Health for Melanoma needed to express our concern regarding the increasing number of patients with delayed diagnosis of skin cancer, with special emphasis on melanoma detection and treatment. In the last few months, a large number of our newly-diagnosed patients with melanoma, as well as those with non-melanoma skin cancers, reported that they had noticed a suspicious skin lesion a few months ago but decided not to seek help from dermatologist due to the worrisome epidemiologic situation. In the current environment, clinical skin examination may be viewed as less important and thus postponed, but neglecting melanoma throughout the virus outbreak may lead to increased rates of morbidity, mortality, and consequently a greater financial burden for the health system (1). There are several reasons for such a relaxed attitude towards skin health in our patients. Unlike cardiac, pulmonary, or digestive difficulties, which patients consider life-threatening and for which they seek emergency care despite the coronavirus pandemic, skin tumors do not cause great subjective or significantly noticeable objective symptoms. Moreover, all of the skin tumors and especially melanoma , mostly present as small changes of just a few millimeters in diameter in the early stage at which they are prognostically most favorable. For the average person with no medical education, such small lesions usually do not cause any concern as they have no awareness of the fact that small and inconspicuous skin lesions may be dangerous and potentially even lethal. According to the recommendations concerning patient management during COVID-19 pandemic, oncological examinations should still be performed regularly (2). In spite of that, the cancelation of appointments, especially by patients who are being monitored for high-risk lesions, is inevitable when COVID-19 is disrupting everyone's lives. With the pandemic evolving and no clear solutions in sight, now is the time to emphasize the importance of self-examination and teledermatology in early melanoma diagnosis. Even though diagnosing and managing pigmented skin lesions usually requires face-to-face examinations and dermoscopy as a crucial tool in early melanoma detection, in these times, and especially for people with a higher risk of SARS-COV2 infection, remote communication could prevent delays resulting in worse prognosis and could also eliminate the risk of infecting healthcare workers. Moreover, teledermatology can also be initiated by doctors asking patients to monitor lesions between clinical visits (3). However, we should not rely solely on this technology but should instead assess every patient individually and insist on a face-to-face examination for those at greater risk, with the aim that, if necessary, surgery be performed in timely manner. The collaboration between general practitioners and dermatologists represents an important aspect of achieving the most rational and effective health care in terms of performing triage of patients who can be assessed by teledermatology as","output":"A Reminder of Skin Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper introduces a Business Cycle Indicator to compile a transparent and reliable chronology of past business cycle turning points for Germany.

Full surface laser ablation is frequently used to prepare the recipient site before cell suspension transplantation, even though the optimal laser settings and ablation depth are unknown. OBJECTIVES To assess the efficacy and safety of less invasive recipient-site preparations. METHODS In a randomized, observer-blinded, controlled trial we compared different recipient-site preparations before cell suspension transplantation in segmental vitiligo and piebaldism. In each patient, we randomly allocated three CO2 laser recipient-site preparations (209 and 144 m full surface, and fractional) and a control (no treatment) to four depigmentations. After 6 months we assessed repigmentation and side-effects. RESULTS We included 10 patients with vitiligo (n = 3) and piebaldism (n = 7). Compared with the control site, we found more repigmentation after full surface ablation at 209 m (median 687%, P = 001) and 144 m (median 583%, P = 0007), but no repigmentation after fractional ablation (median 00%, P = 014). CONCLUSIONS Superficial full surface ablation with a depth of 144 m is an effective recipient-site preparation before cell suspension transplantation, while fractional CO2 laser is not.","output":"Autologous cell suspension grafting in segmental vitiligo and piebaldism: a randomized controlled trial comparing full surface and fractional CO2 laser recipient-site preparations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Everywhere around the globe, the hot topic of discussion today is the ongoing and fast-spreading coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2). Earlier detected in Wuhan, Hubei province, in China in December 2019, the deadly virus engulfed China and some neighboring countries, which claimed thousands of lives in February 2020. The proposed hybrid methodology involves the application of discreet wavelet decomposition to the dataset of deaths due to COVID-19, which splits the input data into component series and then applying an appropriate econometric model to each of the component series for making predictions of death cases in future. ARIMA models are well known econometric forecasting models capable of generating accurate forecasts when applied on wavelet decomposed time series. The input dataset consists of daily death cases from most affected five countries by COVID-19, which is given to the hybrid model for validation and to make one month ahead prediction of death cases. These predictions are compared with that obtained from an ARIMA model to estimate the performance of prediction. The predictions indicate a sharp rise in death cases despite various precautionary measures taken by governments of these countries.","output":"Development of New Hybrid Model of Discrete Wavelet Decomposition and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Models in Application to One Month Forecast the Casualties Cases of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A polymorphism in the LZTFL1 gene located in the chemokine-receptor gene cluster (chromosome 3p) has been associated with the risk of developing COVID-19. The chemokine receptor-5 (CCR5) maps to this region, and the common 32 bp deletion variant ({Delta}32) has been associated with the extent of inflammatory disease and the outcome in several viral diseases. Several studies have also suggested that the pharmacological targeting of CCR5 could reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19. We sought to investigate whether this polymorphism was associated with the risk of moderate-severe COVID-19. We genotyped 294 patients who required hospitalization due to COVID-19 (85 were severe cases) and 460 controls. We found a significantly lower frequency of CCR5-{Delta}32 among the COVID-19 patients (0.10 vs 0.18 in controls; p=0.002, OR=0.48, 95%CI=0.29-0.76). The difference was mainly due to the reduced frequency of CCR5-{Delta}32 carriers in the severe, significantly lower than in the non-severe patients (p=0.036). Of note, we did not find deletion-homozygotes among the patients compared to 1% among controls. We also confirmed the association between a LZTFL1 variant and COVID-19. Our study points to CCR5 as a promising target for treatment of COVID-19, but requires validation in additional large cohorts.

METHODS: This study determined the emission concentrations of Gram-negative bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus bioaerosols from two WWTPs under various aeration modes. Then, a strict quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) was performed on several exposure scenarios associated with occupational health risks of temporary entrants (researchers, visitors, and inspectors) and staffs (field engineer and laboratory technician). RESULTS: Although the bioaerosol concentrations were generally regarded as safe according to existing standards, these bioaerosols' health risks were still unacceptable. The microbial bioaerosols posed considerable infection health risks in WWTPs. These risks were generally above the WHO and US EPA benchmarks. The health risks of females were always smaller than those of male of grown-up age group. Staffs that had been exposed to bioaerosols for a long time were found to have higher health risks compared with temporary entrants. In addition, field engineers equipped with PPE rendered low health risks, thus revealing that wearing PPE could effectively reduce the occupational health risks. CONCLUSION: This study provided novel data and enriched the knowledge of microbial bioaerosol emission's health risks from various aeration modes in WWTPs. Management decisions could be executed by authorities on the basis of the results of QMRA for field engineers equipped with PPE to reduce the related occupational health risks.","output":"Quantitative microbial risk assessment for occupational health of temporary entrants and staffs equipped with various grade PPE and exposed to microbial bioaerosols in two WWTPs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kenneth Gillingham is an Associate Professor of Economics at Yale University, with a primary appointment in the School of Forestry & Environmental Studies.

There is a paucity of evidence on the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of these four HCoV strains worldwide. We collected 11,399 throat swabs from hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection from July 2009 to June 2016 in Guangzhou, China. These were tested for four strains of HCoV infection using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HCoV-positive patients were then tested for 11 other respiratory pathogens. 4.3% (489/11399) of patients were positive for HCoV, of which 3.0% were positive for OC43 (346/11399), 0.6% for 229E (65/11399), 0.5% for NL63 (60/11399), and 0.3% for HKU1 (38/11399). Patients aged 7C12 months had the highest prevalence of HCoV and OC43 when compared with other age groups (p < 0.001). The peak seasons of infection varied depending on the HCoV strain. Patients infected with a single strain of HCoV infection were less likely to present fever ( 38 C) (p = 0.014) and more likely to present pulmonary rales (p = 0.043) than those co-infected with more than one HCoV strain or other respiratory pathogens. There were also significant differences in the prevalence of certain symptoms, including coughing (p = 0.032), pneumonia (p = 0.026), and abnormal pulmonary rales (p = 0.002) according to the strain of HCoV detected.

The key objective of this work was to develop an evidence based, practical toolkit to help researchers maximise recruitment of BAME groups in research. METHODS: Development of the toolkit was an iterative process overseen by an expert steering group. Key steps included a detailed literature review, feedback from focus groups (including researchers and BAME community members) and further workshops and communication with participants to review the draft and final versions. RESULTS: Poor recruitment of BAME populations in research is due to complex reasons, these include factors such as inadequate attention to recruitment strategies and planning, poor engagement with communities and individuals due to issues such as cultural competency of researchers, historical poor experience of participating in research, and lack of links with community networks. Other factors include language issues, relevant expertise in research team and a lack of adequate resources that might be required in recruitment of BAME populations. CONCLUSIONS: A toolkit was developed with key sections providing guidance on planning research and ensuring adequate engagement of communities and individuals. Together with sections suggesting how the research team can address training needs and adopt best practice. Researchers highlighted the issue of funding and how best to address BAME recruitment in grant applications, so a section on preparing a grant application was also included.

Two groups of viruses were selected: (a) the most important viruses contaminating food, based on numbers of publications in the last 5 years and (b) viruses infecting sources of food that might have an impact on human health. RECENT FINDINGS: Important foodborne viruses such as norovirus, hepatitis A and rotavirus are usually only contaminating food and are detected on the surface of foodstuffs. However, they are threats to human public health and make up for the majority of cases. In contrast, the meaning of viruses born from within the food such as natural animal and plant viruses is still in many cases unknown. An exception is Hepatitis E virus that is endemic in pigs, transmitted via pork meat and is recognised as an emerging zoonosis in industrialised countries.

In native habitats, long-term strategies allow to survive severe stress but are of limited use in large bioreactors where micro environmental conditions may change right after said programs are started. Related on/off switching of genes causes additional ATP burden that may reduce the cellular capacity for producing the desired product. Here, we present an agent based data driven model linked to computational fluid dynamics takorsfinally allowing to predict additional ATP needs of E. coli K12 W3110 exposed to realistic large-scale bioreactor conditions. The complex model describes transcriptional up- and downregulation dynamics of about 600 genes starting from subminute range covering 28h. The data-based approach was extracted from comprehensive scale-down experiments. Simulating mixing and mass transfer conditions in a 54 m3 stirred bioreactor, 120,000 E. coli cells were tracked while fluctuating between different zones of glucose availability. It was found that cellular ATP demands rise between 30 - 45% of growth decoupled maintenance needs which may limit the production of ATP-intensive product formation accordingly. Furthermore, spatial analysis of individual cell transcriptional patterns reveal very heterogeneous gene amplifications with hot spots of 50-80% mRNA upregulation in the upper region of the bioreactor.

However, to our knowledge, cohort studies of COVID-19 in clinically vulnerable groups are lacking. Host genetics has also emerged as a major risk factor for COVID-19, and variation in the ACE2 receptor, which facilitates entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the cell, has become a major focus of attention. Thus, we interrogated an ethnically diverse cohort of National Health Service (NHS) patients in the United Kingdom (United Kingdom) to assess the association between variants in the ACE2 locus and COVID-19 risk. We analysed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of 1,837 cases who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 37,207 controls who were not tested, from the UKs 100,000 Genomes Project (100KGP) for the presence of ACE2 coding variants and extract expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We identified a splice site variant (rs2285666) associated with increased ACE2 expression with an overrepresentation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients relative to 100KGP controls (p = 0.015), and in hospitalised European patients relative to outpatients in intra-ethnic comparisons (p = 0.029). We also compared the prevalence of 288 eQTLs, of which 23 were enriched in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. The eQTL rs12006793 had the largest effect size (d = 0.91), which decreases ACE2 expression and is more prevalent in controls, thus potentially reducing the risk of COVID-19. We identified three novel nonsynonymous variants predicted to alter ACE2 function, and showed that three variants (p.K26R, p. H378R, p. Y515N) alter receptor affinity for the viral Spike (S) protein. Variant p. N720D, more prevalent in the European population (p < 0.001), potentially increases viral entry by affecting the ACE2-TMPRSS2 complex.

RESULTS The groups did not differ significantly in terms of preoperative LFT or operative data except that group 3 took significantly longer time for liver suspension than group 1 (p = 0.01) or group 2 (p = 0.03). The VAS score in group 2 was significantly lower on POD 1 than in group 1 (p = 0.04).

Some wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) processes generate aerosols which have the potential to transmit pathogenic microorganisms and present a health risk for exposed individuals. We analyzed the presence of viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewater and air samples of WWTPs. The risk that may arise from exposure to virus-contaminated aerosols of wastewater was estimated by developing a quantitative microbial risk analysis (QMRA) method. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 9 of 24 (37.5%) wastewater samples with a concentration about 104 genomic copies L-1. The viral RNA was also detected in 40% (6/15) of air samples.

Here we address these enigmatic late events of the CoV life cycle in light of recently described properties of the IC. Of particular interest are the emerging spatial and functional connections between IC elements and recycling endosomes (REs), defined by the GTPases Rab1 and Rab11, respectively. The establishment of IC-RE links at the cell periphery, around the centrosome and evidently also at the noncompact zones of the Golgi ribbon indicates thatbesides traditional ER-Golgi communicationthe IC also promotes a secretory process that bypasses the Golgi stacks, but involves its direct connection with the endocytic recycling system. The initial confinement of CoVs to the lumen of IC-derived large transport carriers and their preferential absence from Golgi stacks is consistent with the idea that they exit cells following such an unconventional route. In fact, CoVs may share this pathway with other intracellularly budding viruses, lipoproteins, procollagen, and/or protein aggregates experimentally introduced into the IC lumen.","output":"Assembly and Cellular Exit of Coronaviruses: Hijacking an Unconventional Secretory Pathway from the Pre-Golgi Intermediate Compartment via the Golgi Ribbon to the Extracellular Space"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a population with ongoing vaccination, the trajectory of a pandemic is determined by how the virus spreads in unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals that exhibit distinct transmission dynamics based on different levels of natural and vaccine-induced immunity.

Aspergillus and candida are the most common fungal organisms reported [2];but there have also been a few case reports with co-infection from Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) [1,3]. We present a COVID patient with lymphopenia and diffuse ground glass opacities who was also diagnosed with PJP. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old male with past medical history of emphysema liver cirrhosis presented to the hospital with nausea, vomiting and abdominal distention. On examination he was afebrile, hypotensive with a blood pressure of 88/56, SpO2 was 96% on room air. His lungs were clear on auscultation and abdominal exam was notable for moderate ascites. There was 2+ pedal edema bilaterally. Laboratory work-up showed a WBC count of 12000/L, only 7% of which were lymphocytes. Chest X-ray did not reveal any acute pathology and screening COVID-19 PCR was negative. He was admitted to the medical ward for management of alcohol withdrawal and decompensated liver cirrhosis. He developed hypoxic respiratory failure within 24 hours of presentation. CT chest (Figure 1) showed multifocal ground glass opacities along with bilateral pleural effusions and consolidative airspace disease at bases. A repeat COVID PCR resulted positive. His respiratory failure progressively worsened over the next two weeks despite being treated with remdesivir, dexamethasone and empiric broad spectrum antibiotics. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Repeat imaging (Figure 2) showed worsening diffuse ground glass opacities now with more predominant cystic changes. Bronchoscopy with broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, PCR testing of the BAL sample detected Pneumocystis jirovecii. He was then started on Bactrim in conjunction with steroids for the high A-a gradient. HIV antibody was negative, CD4 lymphocyte count was low at 304/L and CD8 counts were normal at 311/L. The patient slowly started to improve and was successfully extubated after three weeks. However, he later on developed septic shock from candidemia and was placed on hospice care by family due to his poor functional status. DISCUSSION: As with many viral infections, patient's with COVID-19 have demonstrated considerable risk for developing concomitant bacterial and fungal infections. We speculate that lymphopenia with low absolute CD4 count, combined with the use of corticosteroids may play a role in susceptibility to opportunistic infections in otherwise immunocompetent hosts. CONCLUSIONS: When critically ill COVID patient's fail to improve and have persistent lymphopenia, co-infections should be considered and appropriately worked up.

The study followed Kitzinger (1995) as data was analyzed in its entirety as a group and then individually. Groups and individuals were the focus of the analysis. The study applies the Kepner Trego problem analysis technique (KPTA) as the problem-solving technique adopted by the institute and SAP-LAP (situation, actor, process, learning, action, performance) to discuss the findings of the study. Findings: The study found that to engage, encourage and enable students to study on their start-up/business ideas;it is important to facilitate peer interactions, internships in start-ups and meaningful engagement with alumni entrepreneurs. Some proactive interventions are also expected from institutes to energize the student community with positivity. It is also important to nurture the emotional well-being of budding entrepreneurs. Research limitations/implications: The case study narrates the innovative and agile problem-solving approach of the business school during the pandemic. KPTA focuses more on appreciative dialogue and also helps to replicate the best from other situations to the problem areas. SAP-LAP method also helps practitioners to initiate the right new actions with targeted performance. Practical implications: As a greater number of academic institutions impart entrepreneurship education today, the findings of the study would be relevant to the stakeholders, including students, educators and institutes.

BACKGROUND: COVID\\\\19 has been a hot research topic that has attracted many researchers from various disciplines. One of the ways to combat the COVID\\\\19 pandemic is to produce knowledge and present it with a holistic approach. Therefore, it is crucial to make bibliometric and content analyses of scientific publications. Scientific data should be evaluated to keep up with the developments in the nursing profession and practices during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. METHODS: Data were collected from the Web of Science database. The sample consisted of 1280 publications that met the inclusion criteria. The data were analysed using descriptive content and bibliometric analysis. The VOSviewer, a mapping and visualization software program, was used for bibliometric analysis. RESULTS: The United States is one of the countries with the highest number of publications, citations and international cooperation during the pandemic. Of all these publications, 1183 (92.42%) are original articles. The Journal of Nursing Management has the highest number of publications and citations. The publications focus primarily on the topics of COVID\\\\19, pandemic, nursing, coronavirus and nurses. The current topics that the publications address are online education, online learning, practice, nursing student, perceived stress, stress, fear, quality of life and experience to determine the impacts of the pandemic on mental health nursing education.

There is a gap of knowledge conerning the epidemiology of zoonotic diseases at the human-animal interface in different localities in Egypt. Some zoonotic agents are exotic for Egypt (e.g., MERS-CoV and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus), others are endemic (e.g., Brucellosis, Schistosomiasis and Avian influenza). Transboundary transmission of emerging pathogens from and to Egypt occurred via different routes, mainly importation/exportation of apparently healthy animals or migratory birds. Control of the infectious agents and multidrug resistant bacteria in the veterinary sector is on the frontline for infection control in humans. The implementation of control programs significantly decreased the prevalence of some zoonoses, such as schistosomiasis and fascioliasis, in some localities within the country. Sustainable awareness, education and training targeting groups at high risk (veterinarians, farmers, abattoir workers, nurses, etc.) are important to lessen the burden of zoonotic diseases among Egyptians.

Data regarding long COVID in children and adolescents post-SARS-CoV-2 infection were extracted to understand epidemiologic trends, preventive measures, and treatment options.Results: Studies during the initial phase of the pandemic reported a mixed range of symptoms from case reports or case series. However, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) was widely reported. During the subsequent phases, the emergence of new variants led to a surge of SARS-CoV-2 infections in pediatric populations. There were highly variable, mixed symptom clusters within 60 days post-infection, which resolved in many patients within 6 months. There were prolonged illnesses and impairments in some children and adolescents with long COVID, and many had similar symptoms even though they tested negative for COVID-19.Conclusions: Long COVID symptoms are both physical and mental in nature among children and adolescents. The impairments have the potential to affect long-term functioning and increase the overall burden on health care delivery.

In the course of the pandemic, a large number of new fundamental and medical issues have been revealed regarding the relationship between viral infection and many common chronic non-infectious diseases, among which immune-mediated rheumatic diseases (IMRD) occupy an important position. It is now well known that SARS-CoV-2 infection is accompanied by a wide range of extrapulmonary clinical and laboratory disorders, some of which are characteristic of IMRD and other autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases in humans. The most severe consequence of alterations in regulation of the immunity in COVID-19 and IMRD is the so-called cytokine storm syndrome, which is defined as COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory syndrome in COVID-19, and as macrophage activation syndrome in IMRD. The COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory syndrome was used as a reason for drug repurposing and off-label use of a wide range of anti-inflammatory drugs, which have been specially developed for the treatment of IMRD over the past 20 years.

METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Clinicaltrials.gov from the inception of databases up until April 9, 2021. The intervention group was ivermectin and the control group was standard of care or placebo. The primary outcome was mortality reported as risk ratio (RR). RESULTS: There were 9 RCTs comprising of 1788 patients included in this meta-analysis. Ivermectin was associated with decreased mortality (RR 0.39 [95% 0.20-0.74], p = 0.004; I2: 58.2%, p = 0.051).

Old age and underlying illnesses are associated with poor prognosis among COVID-19 patients. However, whether frailty, a common geriatric syndrome of reduced reserve to stressors, is associated with poor prognosis among older COVID-19 patients is unknown. The aim of our study is to investigate the association between frailty and severe disease among COVID-19 patients aged &#8805; 60 years. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 114 hospitalized older patients (&#8805; 60 years) with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia was conducted between 7 February 2020 and 6 April 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data on admission were extracted from electronic medical records. All patients were assessed for frailty on admission using the FRAIL scale, in which five components are included: fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight. The outcome was the development of the severe disease within 60 days. We used the Cox proportional hazards models to identify the unadjusted and adjusted associations between frailty and severe illness. The significant variables in univariable analysis were included in the adjusted model. RESULTS: Of 114 patients, (median age, 67 years; interquartile range = 64-75 years; 57 [50%] men), 39 (34.2%), 39 (34.2%), and 36 (31.6%) were non-frail, pre-frail, and frail, respectively. During the 60 days of follow-up, 43 severe diseases occurred including eight deaths. Four of 39 (10.3%) non-frail patients, 15 of 39 (38.5%) pre-frail patients, and 24 of 36 (66.7%) frail patients progressed to severe disease. After adjustment of age, sex, body mass index, haemoglobin, white blood count, lymphocyte count, albumin, CD8+ count, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein, frailty (HR = 7.47, 95% CI 1.73-32.34, P = 0.007) and pre-frailty (HR = 5.01, 95% CI 1.16-21.61, P = 0.03) were associated with a higher hazard of severe disease than the non-frail. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, assessed by the FRAIL scale, was associated with a higher risk of developing severe disease among older COVID-19 patients. Our findings suggested that the use of a clinician friendly assessment of frailty could help in early warning of older patients at high-risk with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"The association between frailty and severe disease among COVID-19 patients aged over 60 years in China: a prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The median propofol dose upon suspicion of possible PRIS was 20 mcg/kg/min (range, 20-50 mcg/kg/min) and providers decreased the dose in six (75%) patients at that time.

DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: A single ward of a tertiary-care public hospital in Melbourne, Australia. INTERVENTION: Glycerin-based aerosol was used as a surrogate for respiratory aerosols. The transmission of aerosols from a single patient room into corridors and a nurses' station in the ward was measured. The rate of clearance of aerosols was measured over time from the patient room, nurses' station and ward corridors with and without air cleaners [ie, portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters]. RESULTS: Aerosols rapidly travelled from the patient room into other parts of the ward. Air cleaners were effective in increasing the clearance of aerosols from the air in clinical spaces and reducing their spread to other areas. With 2 small domestic air cleaners in a single patient room of a hospital ward, 99% of aerosols could be cleared within 5.5 minutes.

This report shows that thiol groups are essential to the infectivity of hantaviruses. Alkylation of the thiol functional groups using the membrane-permeable compound N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and membrane-impermeable compound 5,5'-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) showed NEM to be a highly effective inactivator of Puumala and Tula hantaviruses. The NEM-inactivated hantavirus maintained the buoyant density of the wild-type virus. Furthermore, the antigenicity of glycoproteins and the cell attachment capacity of virions were retained at NEM concentrations that totally abolished virus infectivity. These results signified preservation of virion integrity following inactivation with NEM, making chemically inactivated virions valuable research antigens. It was demonstrated with biotin-conjugated maleimide, a mechanistic analogue of NEM, that all the structural proteins of hantavirus were sensitive towards thiol alkylation. In contrast to hantaviruses, NEM did not abolish Uukuniemi phlebovirus infectivity to the same extent.

These arms are dexterous and high-dimensional; however, the interfaces people must use to control their robots are low-dimensional. Consider teleoperating a 7-DoF robot arm with a 2-DoF joystick. The robot is helping you eat dinner, and currently you want to cut a piece of tofu. Today's robots assume a pre-defined mapping between joystick inputs and robot actions: in one mode the joystick controls the robot's motion in the x-y plane, in another mode the joystick controls the robot's z-yaw motion, and so on. But this mapping misses out on the task you are trying to perform! Ideally, one joystick axis should control how the robot stabs the tofu and the other axis should control different cutting motions. Our insight is that we can achieve intuitive, user-friendly control of assistive robots by embedding the robot's high-dimensional actions into low-dimensional and human-controllable latent actions. We divide this process into three parts. First, we explore models for learning latent actions from offline task demonstrations, and formalize the properties that latent actions should satisfy. Next, we combine learned latent actions with autonomous robot assistance to help the user reach and maintain their high-level goals. Finally, we learn a personalized alignment model between joystick inputs and latent actions. We evaluate our resulting approach in four user studies where non-disabled participants reach marshmallows, cook apple pie, cut tofu, and assemble dessert. We then test our approach with two disabled adults who leverage assistive devices on a daily basis.","output":"Learning Latent Actions to Control Assistive Robots"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In radiomic studies, several models are often trained with different combinations of feature selection methods and classifiers. The features of the best model are usually considered relevant to the problem, and they represent potential biomarkers. Features selected from statistically similarly performing models are generally not studied. To understand the degree to which the selected features of these statistically similar models differ, 14 publicly available datasets, 8 feature selection methods, and 8 classifiers were used in this retrospective study. For each combination of feature selection and classifier, a model was trained, and its performance was measured with AUC-ROC. The best-performing model was compared to other models using a DeLong test. Models that were statistically similar were compared in terms of their selected features. RESULTS: Approximately 57% of all models analyzed were statistically similar to the best-performing model. Feature selection methods were, in general, relatively unstable (0.58; range 0.35C0.84). The features selected by different models varied largely (0.19; range 0.02C0.42), although the selected features themselves were highly correlated (0.71; range 0.4C0.92).

Our aim was to describe the evolution of the pandemic in the different Spanish regions and to examine the effect of the non-pharmaceutical public health interventions during the first epidemic wave on these trends. Methods: Daily incidence rates of cases were calculated at national and regional level between 31th of January and 10th of May 2020. Epidemic curves, important dates of interventions and effective reproduction number (Rt) were plotted and transmissibility parameters were calculated. To summarize the geographical heterogeneity in the evolution, regional epidemic curves have been classified into homogeneous groups using a clustering procedure. Findings: The incidence rate reached 5 cases per 100,000 on March 1 and peaked at March 20. The Rt gradually decreased after the national lockdown falling below 1 on March 24. Two homogeneous groups of epidemic curves were identified among regions, mainly differentiated by the magnitude of the daily incidence rate and the evolution of the Rt in the period prior to lockdown. However, irrespectively of the previous trend, the lockdown was followed by a steep decrease in the number of cases starting 6 days after its implementation.

The majority of these variants are in non-coding regions and their target genes remain largely unclear. OBJECTIVE: We sought to understand the effects of these non-coding variants on the development of AD and psoriasis by linking them to the genes they regulate. METHODS: We constructed genomic 3D maps of human keratinocytes during differentiation using capture Hi-C targeting more >20, 000 promoters and 214 GWAS variants and combined this with transcriptome and epigenomic datasets. We validated our results with reporter assays, CRISPR activation and examination of patient gene expression from previous studies. RESULTS: We identified 118 target genes of 82 AD and psoriasis GWAS-variants.

Neutron counts from Moscow Neutron Monitor show that the flux of cosmic rays reaching Earth in 2019 was indeed at a maximum over a timespan of half a century since 1962. It is of interest to note that immediately prior to the first recorded cases of the novel Corona virus in China a peak of cosmic rays was measured as is indicated by the Huon neutron monitor data. Recent research revealed that estimates of the timing of the most recent common ancestor of COVID-19 made with current sequence data point to emergence of the virus in late November 2019 to early December 2019, compatible with the earliest retrospectively confirmed cases and the cosmic ray spike in late November 2019. In our view, this strong cosmic ray spike was in some way connected with the onset of the outbreak.","output":"Is the 2019 novel coronavirus related to a spike of cosmic rays?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Universities in developing countries, including those in Nigeria, experience cybercrime risks due to poor management of their cyber spaces and resources. The outcome of these cybercrimes are threats and breaches of universities' cyber security. The threats and breaches have resulted in substantial financial, social, and intellectual property losses. In the recent past, Nigerian universities have started to respond to these cyber-attacks. Many of them now invest in anti-cybercrime tools and programs to mitigate cyber security threats and breaches. Despite this, the number of times Nigerian universities suffer from cyber-attacks and the losses that result from them keeps increasing. Our observation, however, indicates that most Nigerian universities run their cyber security without using scientifically derived frameworks that spell out how to manage threats and breaches that emanate from within and outside them. We consider this a problem to ongoing efforts made by Nigerian universities to mitigate cyber security threats and breaches. The study reported in this paper was therefore, carried out to explicate how Nigerian universities can develop actionable frameworks that can help them to mitigate cyber security threats and breaches. The study is based on literature review and propose how an actionable framework that Nigerian Universities can adopt to setoff cybersecurity programs can be developed. The process comprises of problem identification, description of objectives, designing and developing the artefact, testing, and evaluating the artefact, and communicating the result. We conclude that the framework provides a lucrative starting point for Nigerian universities to setoff efficient and effective cyber security program.","output":"Framework for Managing Cybercrime Risks in Nigerian Universities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Black theology, which is linked to black power in the context of the United States of America and black consciousness in the context of South Africa is often regarded as having nothing to do with spirituality, faith and salvation. It is often regarded by critics as radical, militant and political. In some circles its theological character is questioned. Advocates of liberation theology, past and present are accused of mixing religion with politics. The article traces the history of black theology, as part of liberation theology, which started in the 1960s in three contexts, namely Latin America, United States of America and South Africa. The article argues that spirituality, faith and salvation are central to black theology of liberation. The critical theological reflection that black theology of liberation is all about happens in the context of the spiritual journey of the poor believer and oppressed. Contribution: The contribution that this article makes is to serve as a corrective discourse that rebuts the mistaken accusation that black liberation theology has nothing to do with spirituality and faith. The article makes a direct link between spirituality and faith on the one hand and on the other hand liberating Christian praxis of the poor in their spiritual journey, in the context of South Africans as they struggle to liberate themselves amid poverty, service delivery struggles and COVID-19 and its implications.","output":"Black theology versus black spirituality and black faith: The centrality of spirituality and faith in black theology of liberation in the South African context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study explored the effects of social isolation from lockdown on Italian families in terms of work-family balance, family functioning and parenting. 104 parents (80.8% mothers) with at least one child aged from 2 to 14 years participated in the study.

The aim was to integrate positive and negative conceptualizations of mental health for predicting attitudes towards suicide, and towards suicide prevention, among students of the helping professions. The study participants (166 women and 73 men, mean age 22.84  5.15) answered a set of questionnaires, including a Questionnaire on Attitudes Towards Suicide, Goldberg Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), Psychological Well-Being Scale (PWB-42) and Centrality of Religiosity Scale. Multiple regression analysis showed that environmental mastery, purpose in life and positive relationships, controlled for religiousness and psychological problems related to general mental health, predicted the variability of attitudes towards suicide and pro-preventive orientation. Sociodemographic variables were not related to attitudes towards suicide. Our findings suggest that positive mental health, represented jointly by low mental health problems and eudaimonic components of happiness, plays a role in predicting pro-preventive attitudes. Therefore, improving positive mental health among students in the helping professions, these being the future gatekeepers, could be considered an auxiliary strategy for suicide prevention.

Different proposals have been put forward which combine all the available treatments and the different clinical presentations in an effort to select the best therapeutic options for each clinical context. As COPD is a chronic progressive disease, the escalation of therapy has traditionally been considered the most natural way to tackle it. However, the notion of COPD as a constantly progressing disease has recently been challenged and, in specific areas, this points to the possibility of a de-escalation in treatment. In this context, the clinician requires simple, specific recommendations to guide these changes in treatment in their daily clinical practice. To accomplish this, the first step must be a correct evaluation and an accurate initial preliminary diagnosis of the patients condition. Thereafter, the first escalation in therapy must be introduced with caution as the disease progresses, since clinical trials are not designed with clinical decision-making in mind. During this escalation, three possibilities are open to change the current treatment for a different one within the same family, to increase non-pharmacological interventions or to increase the pharmacological therapies. Beyond that point, a patient with persistent symptoms represents a complex clinical scenario which requires a specialized approach, including the evaluation of different respiratory and non-respiratory comorbidities. Unfortunately, there are few de-escalation studies available, and these are mainly observational in nature. The debate on de-escalation in pharmacological treatment, therefore, involves two main discussion points: the withdrawal of bronchodilators and the withdrawal of inhaled steroids. Altogether, the scheme for modifying treatment must be more personalized than just adding molecules, and the therapeutic response and its conditioning factors should be evaluated at each step before proceeding further.","output":"Step-Up and Step-Down Treatment Approaches for COPD: A Holistic View of Progressive Therapies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can infect many animal species, including minks, cats, and dogs.

The prevalence of vaccine acceptance increased from 76.4% (90% effectiveness) to 88.8% (95% effectiveness). Considering a 90% effective vaccine, Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, and five African countries (Democratic Republic of Congo, Benin, Uganda, Malawi, and Mali) had lower acceptance odds compared to Brazil.

However, chronic disease and female gender reduced the odds for vaccine acceptance. The main reasons underpinning vaccine refusal were fear of side effects (41.2%) and lack of confidence in vaccine effectiveness (15.1%).

The chemical modifications made to nucleic acids that have improved their resistance against nuclease degradation are briefly discussed. The design of cationic and neutral lipid nanoparticles that enable the systemic delivery of nucleic acids in vivo is reviewed, and the proof-of-concept evidence that intravenous administration of nucleic acids incorporated into lipid nanoparticles leads to decreased expression of target genes in humans. Preclinical results of the neutral BP-100-1.01 nanoparticle are highlighted. EXPERT OPINION To further improve the clinical potential of nucleic acid cancer drugs, we predict research on the next generation of lipid nanoparticles will focus on: i) enhancing nucleic acid delivery to poorly vascularized tumors, as well as tumors behind the blood-brain barrier; and ii) improving the accessibility of nucleic acids to the cytoplasm by enhancing endosomal escape of nucleic acids and/or reducing exocytosis of nucleic acids to the external milieu.","output":"Liposomal delivery of nucleic acid-based anticancer therapeutics: BP-100-1.01."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present narrative review, we analyzed the relationship between seronegative celiac disease (SNCD) and immunoglobulin deficiencies. For this purpose, we conducted a literature search on the main medical databases. SNCD poses a diagnostic dilemma. Villous blunting, intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) count and gluten challenge are the most reliable markers. Immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence tissue transglutaminase (tTG)-targeted mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) immune complexes in the intestinal mucosa of SNCD patients may be useful. In our experience, tTG-mRNA was similarly increased in seropositive celiac disease (CD) and suspected SNCD, and strongly correlated with the IELs count. This increase is found even in the IELs range of 15C25/100 enterocytes, suggesting that there may be a grey zone of gluten-related disorders. An immune deregulation (severely lacking B-cell differentiation) underlies the association of SNCD with immunoglobulin deficiencies. Therefore, CD may be linked to autoimmune disorders and immune deficits (common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)/IgA selective deficiency). CVID is a heterogeneous group of antibodies dysfunction, whose association with CD is demonstrated only by the response to a gluten-free diet (GFD). We hypothesized a familial inheritance between CD and CVID. Selective IgA deficiency, commonly associated with CD, accounts for IgA-tTG seronegativity. Selective IgM deficiency (sIgMD) is rare (<300 cases) and associated to CD in 5% of cases. We diagnosed SNCD in a patient affected by sIgMD using the tTG-mRNA assay. One-year GFD induced IgM restoration. This evidence, supporting a link between SNCD and immunoglobulin deficiencies, suggests that we should take a closer look at this association.","output":"Seronegative Celiac Disease and Immunoglobulin Deficiency: Where to Look in the Submerged Iceberg?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has provoked several changes in home care.

Another mechanism of protein birth is provided by overlapping genes. They are created de novo by mutations within a coding sequence that lead to the expression of a novel protein in another reading frame, a process called \\"overprinting.\\" To investigate this mechanism, we have analyzed the sequences of the protein products of manually curated overlapping genes from 43 genera of unspliced RNA viruses infecting eukaryotes. Overlapping proteins have a sequence composition globally biased toward disorder-promoting amino acids and are predicted to contain significantly more structural disorder than nonoverlapping proteins. By analyzing the phylogenetic distribution of overlapping proteins, we were able to confirm that 17 of these had been created de novo and to study them individually. Most proteins created de novo are orphans (i.e., restricted to one species or genus). Almost all are accessory proteins that play a role in viral pathogenicity or spread, rather than proteins central to viral replication or structure. Most proteins created de novo are predicted to be fully disordered and have a highly unusual sequence composition. This suggests that some viral overlapping reading frames encoding hypothetical proteins with highly biased composition, often discarded as noncoding, might in fact encode proteins. Some proteins created de novo are predicted to be ordered, however, and whenever a three-dimensional structure of such a protein has been solved, it corresponds to a fold previously unobserved, suggesting that the study of these proteins could enhance our knowledge of protein space.","output":"Overlapping genes produce proteins with unusual sequence properties and offer insight into de novo protein creation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Recent scientific evidences suggest a relevant role of the oral cavity in the transmission and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed, up to April 30, 2020, focusing on SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, oral cavity, and antimicrobial agents. RESULTS: Oral viral load of SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with the severity of COVID-19, and thus, a reduction in the oral viral load could be associated with a decrease in the severity of the condition. Similarly, a decrease in the oral viral load would diminish the amount of virus expelled and reduce the risk of transmission, since (i) during the first 10 days, the virus mainly accumulates at the nasal, oral, and pharyngeal area; (ii) the number of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor is greater in the salivary glands as compared with the lungs; and (iii) salivary droplets represent the most relevant transmission route. To reduce the oral viral load, antiseptic agents may be used, although the evidence on its efficacy is indirect and weak. CONCLUSIONS: Antiseptic mouth rinses, such as those containing cetylpyridinium chloride or povidone-iodine, may be able to decrease the severity of COVID-19 by reducing oral viral load in infected subjects and decreasing the risk of transmission by limiting viral load in droplets, generated in normal life, or in aerosols, produced during dental procedures.

Rarely, macroprolactinomas may invade the sphenoid sinus and pose a therapeutic challenge, as treatment with dopamine agonists and subsequent tumor shrinkage can lead to a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. Clinical Case: A 32-year-old female with no prior medical history presented to the emergency room of an outside hospital for headaches and visual changes. MRI demonstrated a 4.3 x 4.0 x 3.0 cm sellar mass with extension into the right cavernous sinus and sphenoid sinus, and prolactin was elevated to 1,859 ng/ml (3.4 - 21.4). Cabergoline was initiated at a dose of 0.25 mg twice a week with a decrease in her prolactin to 646 ng/ml one month later. Six months after initiation of therapy she transferred her care to our institution and presented for a routine endocrinology visit. She complained of rhinorrhea worse when upright that had begun two weeks prior to this encounter. Urgent MRI of the sella revealed an interval decrease in the size of the sellar mass to 2.1 x 2.7 x 1.5 cm and a fluid collection extending from the sella turcica to the left sphenoid sinus consistent with a CSF leak, and labs showed a prolactin level of 169 ng/ml. Cabergoline was discontinued and the patient was admitted to the hospital for treatment with antibiotics and acetazolamide. She underwent lumbar drain placement while awaiting definitive surgical management, which was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While off cabergoline, the sellar mass increased in size and her prolactin rose to 1,449 ng/ml, with no effect on the optic chiasm and visual fields. Three months later, she underwent transsphenoidal debulking of the pituitary mass with repair of the sellar floor and removal of lumbar drain. Her postoperative course was uncomplicated and she resumed cabergoline 0.25 mg twice weekly. A prolactin measured two weeks postoperatively was 337 ng/ml. Tumor histopathology revealed a 1.3 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm pituitary adenoma. Immunohistochemistry stained positive for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and prolactin only. An MRI of the sella and prolactin level will be repeated at her next endocrinology visit. Conclusions: CSF leak is a rare but serious complication from tumor shrinkage after medical management of large invasive prolactinomas, and patients with such tumors should be monitored closely for its development. CSF leaks can increase a patients risk for meningitis and subsequent morbidity and mortality. The management of patients with large prolactinomas with local invasion should involve a multidisciplinary approach for decision making, extensive patient education, and close follow up in order to identify and treat a CSF leak should it develop.","output":"Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak After Medical Management of Prolactinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) is a procedure combining laparoscopic gastric resection with endoscopic submucosal dissection for local resection of gastric tumors with appropriate, minimal surgical resection margins. The LECS concept was initially developed from the classical LECS procedure for gastric submucosal tumor resection. Many researchers reported that classical LECS was a safe and feasible technique for resection of gastric submucosal tumors, regardless of tumor location, including the esophagogastric junction. Recently, LECS was approved for insurance coverage by Japan's National Health Insurance plan and widely applied for gastric submucosal tumor resection. However, the limitations of classical LECS are the risk of abdominal infection, scattering of tumor cells in the abdominal cavity, and tumor cell seeding in the peritoneum. The development of modified LECS procedures, such as inverted-LECS, non-exposed endoscopic wall-inversion surgery, a combination of laparoscopic and endoscopic approaches to neoplasia with a non-exposure technique, and closed-LECS, has almost resolved these drawbacks. This has led to a recent increase in the indication of modified LECS to include patients with gastric epithelial neoplasms. The LECS concept is also beginning to be applied to tumor excision in other organs, such as the duodenum, colon and rectum. Further evolution of LECS procedures is expected in the future.

Drug repurposing is one of the most rapid strategies for addressing this need, and numerous compounds have already been selected for in vitro testing by several groups. These have led to a growing database of molecules with in vitro activity against the virus. Machine learning models can assist drug discovery through prediction of the best compounds based on previously published data. Herein, we have implemented several machine learning methods to develop predictive models from recent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro inhibition data and used them to prioritize additional FDA-approved compounds for in vitro testing selected from our in-house compound library. From the compounds predicted with a Bayesian machine learning model, lumefantrine, an antimalarial was selected for testing and showed limited antiviral activity in cell-based assays while demonstrating binding (Kd 259 nM) to the spike protein using microscale thermophoresis. Several other compounds which we prioritized have since been tested by others and were also found to be active in vitro. This combined machine learning and in vitro testing approach can be expanded to virtually screen available molecules with predicted activity against SARS-CoV-2 reference WIV04 strain and circulating variants of concern.

Identified as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the number of cases grew rapidly by human-to-human transmission in Wuhan. Social media, especially Sina Weibo (a major Chinese microblogging social media site), has become an important platform for the public to obtain information and seek help. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the characteristics of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who asked for help on Sina Weibo. METHODS: We conducted data mining on Sina Weibo and extracted the data of 485 patients who presented with clinical symptoms and imaging descriptions of suspected or laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. In total, 9878 posts seeking help on Sina Weibo from February 3 to 20, 2020 were analyzed. We used a descriptive research methodology to describe the distribution and other epidemiological characteristics of patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection. The distance between patients home and the nearest designated hospital was calculated using the geographic information system ArcGIS. RESULTS: All patients included in this study who sought help on Sina Weibo lived in Wuhan, with a median age of 63.0 years (IQR 55.0-71.0). Fever (408/485, 84.12%) was the most common symptom. Ground-glass opacity (237/314, 75.48%) was the most common pattern on chest computed tomography; 39.67% (167/421) of families had suspected and/or laboratory-confirmed family members; 36.58% (154/421) of families had 1 or 2 suspected and/or laboratory-confirmed members; and 70.52% (232/329) of patients needed to rely on their relatives for help. The median time from illness onset to real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was 8 days (IQR 5.0-10.0), and the median time from illness onset to online help was 10 days (IQR 6.0-12.0). Of 481 patients, 32.22% (n=155) lived more than 3 kilometers away from the nearest designated hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that patients seeking help on Sina Weibo lived in Wuhan and most were elderly. Most patients had fever symptoms, and ground-glass opacities were noted in chest computed tomography. The onset of the disease was characterized by family clustering and most families lived far from the designated hospital. Therefore, we recommend the following: (1) the most stringent centralized medical observation measures should be taken to avoid transmission in family clusters; and (2) social media can help these patients get early attention during Wuhans lockdown. These findings can help the government and the health department identify high-risk patients and accelerate emergency responses following public demands for help.","output":"Mining the Characteristics of COVID-19 Patients in China: Analysis of Social Media Posts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The relevance of airborne exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in indoor environments is a matter of research and debate, with special importance for healthcare low-risk settings. Experimental approaches to the bioaerosol sampling are neither standardized nor optimized yet, leading in some cases to limited representativity of the temporal and spatial variability of viral presence in aerosols. Airborne viral viability moreover needs to be assessed. A study has been conducted collecting five 24-hours PM10 samples in a COVID-19 geriatric ward in late June 2020, and detecting E and RdRp genes by RT-qPCR with a Ct between 36 and 39. The viral RNA detection at Ct=36 was related to the maximal numerosity of infected patients hosted in the ward. Lacking a direct infectivity assessment for the collected samples an experimental model has been defined, by seeding twelve nasopharyngeal swab extracts from COVID-19 positive patients on Vero E6 cells; only the four extracts with a viral load above E+10 viral copies (approximately Ct<24) have been able to establish a persistent infection in vitro. Therefore, the cytopathic effect, a key feature of residual infectivity, could be considered unlikely for the environmental PM10 samples showing amplification of viral RNA at Ct = 36 or higher.

MethodsWe conducted an observational, prospective case series study in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Clinical outcome data (Intensive Care Unit admission and mortality) were collected from all patients until discharge. Viremia was determined longitudinally during hospitalisation, in plasma and serum samples using two commercial and standardised RT-PCR techniques approved for use in diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Viral load (copies/mL and log10) was determined with quantitative TaqPathCOVID-19 test. ResultsSARS-CoV-2 viremia was studied in 57 hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Persistent viremia (PV) was defined as two or more quantifiable viral loads detected in blood samples (plasma/serum) during hospitalisation. PV was detected in 16 (28%) patients. All of them, except for one who rapidly progressed to death, cleared viremia during hospitalisation. Poor clinical outcome occurred in 62.5% of patients with PV, while none of the negative patients or those with sporadic viremia presented this outcome (p<0.0001). Viral load was significantly higher in patients with PV than in those with Sporadic Viremia (p<0.05). Patients presented PV for a short period of time: median time from admission was 5 days (Range=2-12) and 4.5 days (Range=2-8) for plasma and serum samples, respectively.

In a pilot trial in young adults with Down syndrome, memantine (a drug approved for Alzheimer's disease) showed a significant effect on a secondary measure of episodic memory. We aimed to test whether memantine would improve episodic memory in adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome. METHODS We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial with a parallel design, stratified by age and sex. Participants (aged 15-32 years) with either trisomy 21 or complete unbalanced translocation of chromosome 21 and in general good health were recruited from the community at one site in Brazil and another in the USA. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either memantine (20 mg/day orally) or placebo for 16 weeks. Computer-generated randomisation tables for both sites (allocating a placebo or drug label to each member of a unique pair of participants) were centrally produced by an independent statistician and were shared only with investigational pharmacists at participating sites until unblinding of the study. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment assignments. Neuropsychological assessments were done at baseline (T1) and week 16 (T2). The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to week 16 in the California Verbal Learning Test-second edition short-form (CVLT-II-sf) total free recall score, assessed in the per-protocol population (ie, participants who completed 16 weeks of treatment and had neuropsychological assessments at T1 and T2). Linear mixed effect models were fit to data from the per-protocol population. Safety and tolerability were monitored and analysed in all participants who started treatment. Steady-state concentrations in plasma of memantine were measured at the end of the trial. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02304302. FINDINGS From May 13, 2015, to July 22, 2020, 185 participants with Down syndrome were assessed for eligibility and 160 (86%) were randomly assigned either memantine (n=81) or placebo (n=79). All participants received their allocated treatment. Linear mixed effect models were fit to data from 149 (81%) participants, 73 in the memantine group and 76 in the placebo group, after 11 people (eight in the memantine group and three in the placebo group) discontinued due to COVID-19 restrictions, illness of their caregiver, adverse events, or low compliance. The primary outcome measure did not differ between groups (CVLT-II-sf total free recall score, change from baseline 034 points [95% CI -098 to 167], p=061). Memantine was well tolerated, with infrequent mild-to-moderate adverse events, the most common being viral upper respiratory infection (nine [11%] participants in the memantine group and 12 [15%] in the placebo group) and transient dizziness (eight [10%] in the memantine group and six [8%] in the placebo group). No serious adverse events were observed. Amounts of memantine in plasma were substantially lower than those considered therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease.

However, such prosperity on the store side does not guarantee a sufficient food supply for all populations. This study aims to understand if people's risk perception and food security status shaped their food procurement behaviors during the early outbreak of the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Extended from the theory of risk perception, food consumers may behave differently during a disastrous event in terms of store patronization. The study evaluates how food procurement behaviors are affected by perceived risk aversion, resource scarcity, and consumers food security status. METHODS: The study examines how people with different food security statuses made grocery shopping decisions at the risk of epidemic exposure based on a nationwide survey of 2590 participants in the U.S. during the early break of the pandemic in April 2020. The study uses a moderated mediation analysis on in-store shopping frequency and food expenditure. RESULTS: People having a food-secure status before the pandemic spent significantly more as a result of the reduced shopping frequency (i.e., the secure-insecure subgroup  = ?0.18, P < .01; the secure-secure subgroup  = ?0.35, P < .01). The increase in food expenditure was insignificant for people who were food-insecure before the pandemic (i.e., the insecure-insecure subgroup,  = ?0.01, P > .05; the insecure-secure subgroup,  = ?0.11, P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: The study reports that in general people reduced the frequency of grocery shopping trips to avoid epidemic exposure while increasing the food expenditure per trip.

We aim to investigate patients perceptions and experiences on the safety, effectiveness, tolerability, and unmet needs of the dual-drug combination dolutegravir/lamivudine focusing on patients receiving care in Brighton, United Kingdom. In addition, we will conduct a comparative analysis between patients on dolutegravir/lamivudine and patients on other dual-drug and three-drug combinations. Lastly, the study aims to provide recommendations to improve doctor-patient communication, knowledge and understanding of the treatment plan, and additional care that ought to be considered in patient-centred, holistic care plans. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Our qualitative methodological framework is based on three main methods: cultural domain analysis, focus group discussions, and in-depth interviews. Cultural domain analysis employs a range of techniques (free listing, pile sorts, and rankings) to elicit terms from informants regarding specific cultural domains (i.e., groups of items that are perceived to be of the same kind). This framework has been co-designed with a patient representative to ensure relevance, suitability, and co-production of knowledge. All methods have been tested to take place online via Zoom?, Skype?, or Microsoft Teams? should participants prefer to participate digitally rather than in person. Padlet?, an application to create online boards, will be used during the cultural domain analysis session. Data collected will be analysed following the completion of each method embracing an iterative approach through applied thematic analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval was obtained from the Health Research Authority (Reference 21/NW/0070). Findings will be used to produce recommendations to improve doctor and patient communication by identifying patients fears, worries, misconceptions, and general concerns of their drug regimen.

A cytokine storm in some patients after infection contributes to this mortality. In addition to lungs, the intestine is targeted during COVID-19 infection. The intestinal membrane serves as a barrier to prevent leakage of microorganisms and their products into the bloodstream; however, dietary fats can affect the gut microbiome and may increase intestinal permeability. In obese or diabetic individuals, there is an increase in the abundance of either Gram-negative bacteria in the gut or their product, endotoxin, in systemic circulation.

This review discusses conditions contributing to inflammation that are triggered by microbially derived factors from the gut.","output":"Can Dietary Fatty Acids Affect the COVID-19 Infection Outcome in Vulnerable Populations?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The use of laparoscopic and robotic procedures has increased in general surgery. Minimally invasive robotic surgery has made tremendous progress in a relatively short period of time, realizing improvements for both the patient and surgeon. This has led to an increase in the use and development of robotic devices and platforms for general surgery. The purpose of this review is to explore current and emerging surgical robotic technologies in a growing and dynamic environment of research and development. METHODS This review explores medical and surgical robotic endoscopic surgery and peripheral technologies currently available or in development. The devices discussed here are specific to general surgery, including laparoscopy, colonoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Benefits and limitations of each technology were identified and applicable future directions were described. RESULTS A number of FDA-approved devices and platforms for robotic surgery were reviewed, including the da Vinci Surgical System, Sensei X Robotic Catheter System, FreeHand 1.2, invendoscopy E200 system, Flex? Robotic System, Senhance, ARES, the Single-Port Instrument Delivery Extended Research (SPIDER), and the NeoGuide Colonoscope. Additionally, platforms were reviewed which have not yet obtained FDA approval including MiroSurge, ViaCath System, SPORT? Surgical System, SurgiBot, Versius Robotic System, Master and Slave Transluminal Endoscopic Robot, Verb Surgical, Miniature In Vivo Robot, and the Einstein Surgical Robot. CONCLUSIONS The use and demand for robotic medical and surgical platforms is increasing and new technologies are continually being developed. New technologies are increasingly implemented to improve on the capabilities of previously established systems.

Physiological, cellular and behavioral responses to heat-stress (HS) (40-41 C, 2 h) were evaluated in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. The effect of HS exposure before predator-scent stress (PSS) exposure (i.e., HS preconditioning) was examined. Finally, a possible mechanism of HS-preconditioning to PSS was investigated. Immunohistochemical analyses of chosen cellular markers were performed in the hippocampus and in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Plasma corticosterone levels were evaluated, and the behavioral assessment included the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and the acoustic startle response (ASR) paradigms. Endogenous levels of heat shock protein (HSP)-70 were manipulated using an amino acid (L-glutamine) and a pharmacological agent (Doxazosin). A single exposure to an acute HS resulted in decreased body mass (BM), increased body temperature and increased corticosterone levels. Additionally, extensive cellular, but not behavioral changes were noted. HS-preconditioning provided behavioral resiliency to anxiety-like behavior associated with PSS, possibly through the induction of HSP-70.

Methods: We compared clinical and laboratory results from 719 influenza and 973 COVID-19 patients from January to April 2020. We compiled laboratory results from the first 14 days of the hospitalized patients using parameters that are most significantly different between COVID-19 and influenza and hierarchically clustered COVID-19 patients. Findings: Compared to influenza, patients with COVID-19 exhibited a continued increase in white blood cell count, rapid decline of hemoglobin, more rapid increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and D-dimer, and higher level of alanine transaminase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and fibrinogen. COVID-19 patients were sub-classified into 5 clusters through a hierarchical clustering analysis. Medical records were reviewed and patients were risk stratified based on the clinical outcomes. The cluster with the highest risk showed 278% fatality, 94% ICU admission, 94% intubation, and 28% discharge rates compared to 0%, 38%, 22%, and 88% in the lowest risk cluster, respectively. Patients in the highest risk cluster had leukocytosis including neutrophilia and monocytosis, severe anemia, increased red blood cell distribution width, higher BUN, creatinine, D-dimer, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and troponin. Interpretation: There are significant differences in the clinical and laboratory courses between COVID-19 and influenza. Risk stratification in hospitalized COVID-19 patients using laboratory data could be useful to predict clinical outcomes and pathophysiology of these patients.

A better molecular understanding of COVID-19 in people with type diabetes mellitus (T2D) is mandatory, especially in countries with a high rate of T2D, such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Identification of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that make T2D patients prone to aggressive course of the disease can help in the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve our response to the disease pandemic. Herein, we employed a system genetics approach to explore potential genomic, transcriptomic alterations in genes specific to lung and pancreas tissues, affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and study their association with susceptibility to T2D in Emirati patients. Our results identified the Exocyst complex component, 6 (EXOC6/6B) gene (a component for docks insulin granules to the plasma membrane) with documented INDEL in 3 of 4 whole genome sequenced Emirati diabetic patients. Publically available transcriptomic data showed that lung infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed significantly lower expression of EXOC6/6B compared to healthy lungs. In conclusion, our data suggest that EXOC6/6B might be an important molecular link between dysfunctional pancreatic islets and ciliated lung epithelium that makes diabetic patients more susceptible to severe SARS-COV-2 complication.","output":"Cellular exocytosis gene (EXOC6/6B): a potential molecular link for the susceptibility and mortality of COVID-19 in diabetic patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues affecting millions of people worldwide.

We tested these hypotheses in a large US sample of adults assessed once before and twice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multilevel analyses indicated that people reported feeling younger with the emergence of COVID-19. We further tested demographic, health, and psychosocial predictors of changes in subjective age.

Omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin C have potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects that could offer protection against oxidative stress and liver damage. This study evaluated the hepatoprotective effect of omega-3 and vitamin C alone as well as in a combined form in methotrexate- (MTX-) induced acute liver injury in mice. Male ICR mice of seven groups (7 mice per group) were used. Groups 1 (control group) and 2 (MTX) received 0.9% saline/day (po) for 9 days. Groups 3 and 4 received 100 and 200 mg/kg bw/day omega-3 (po), respectively, for 9 days. Groups 5 and 6 received 100 and 200 mg/kg bw/day vitamin C (po), respectively, for 9 days, while group 7 received omega-3 (100 mg/kg bw/day) and vitamin C (100 mg/kg bw/day) (po) for 9 days. All animals in groups 2 to 7 received 20 mg/kg/day MTX (I.P.) once on the 10(th) day. Our results revealed that MTX significantly induced the elevation of transaminases, alkaline phosphates (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and malonaldehyde (MDA) while depleting the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) when compared to the control group. Treatment with omega-3 fatty acids or vitamin C significantly attenuated the antioxidants and biochemical alterations in a dose-independent manner.

The histopathological features were also improved by treatment with omega-3 and vitamin C. The combined form of omega-3 and vitamin C showed a remarkable improvement in the liver enzymes, oxidative stress biomarkers, and the histopathological architecture of the mice. Conclusively, the combination of omega-3 and vitamin C demonstrated a synergistic therapeutic effect against MTX-intoxicated mice, hence representing a potential novel strategy for the management of drug-induced liver disorders.","output":"Combination Treatment of Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Vitamin C Exhibited Promising Therapeutic Effect against Oxidative Impairment of the Liver in Methotrexate-Intoxicated Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Trs Marias Reservoir is the ninth largest reservoir in Brazil, becoming crucial for national strategic development.

This case report with a literature review emphasizes a unique presentation of COVID-19 that is highly important for health care providers to consider when treating their patients. CASE REPORT: A 65-year-old Caucasian male patient presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of dyspnea on exertion after his wifes recent diagnosis of COVID-19. He additionally had experienced a couple of episodes of self-resolving diarrhea a few days before presentation. Based on the patients clinical presentation and the laboratory workup identifying an elevated D-dimer, a computed tomography angiogram of the chest was obtained, which was significant for moderately large, bilateral pulmonary emboli with a saddle embolus, and an associated small, left lower lobe, pulmonary infarct. Ultrasound of the lower extremity showed non-occlusive deep vein thrombosis at the distal left femoral vein to the left popliteal vein. The patient was additionally diagnosed with COVID-19 when the results of the COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test returned as positive. The patient was admitted to the COVID unit, and he was started on an intravenously administered, unfractionated heparin drip for management of his bilateral pulmonary emboli and deep vein thrombosis. The patients clinical condition improved significantly with anticoagulation, and he was observed in the hospital for 3 days, after which he was discharged home on the enoxaparin bridge with warfarin. Post-discharge telephone calls at day 10 and week 4 revealed that the patient was appropriately responding to anticoagulation treatment and had no recurrence of his symptoms related to venous thromboembolism and COVID-19. CONCLUSION: As COVID-19 continues to lead to significant mortality, more data is emerging that is exposing its perplexing pathogenicity. Meanwhile, the presentation of venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 remains an unusual finding.

Currently, there are various clinical trials being conducted to develop effective treatments. It is estimated that it could take one or more years before these drugs pass all safety tests and concrete results with regard to their effectiveness become available. In addition, despite the recent development of vaccines (licensed for use under conditional licenses) and the commencement of COVID-19 vaccination programs in several countries, there is still a need for safe and novel strategies that may reduce the symptomatology and/or prevent the severe complications associated with COVID-19. Natural compounds previously shown to have antiviral potential should be thoroughly considered and investigated for use in prophylactic treatment of COVID-19 due to their availability and safety. RECENT FINDINGS: The current narrative review investigates whether there is evidence in the literature that supplementation with dietary minerals and vitamins may have a role in preventing infection with SARS-CoV-2 or in reducing COVID-19 symptomatology and disease progression. The current evidence from the literature supports that zinc and vitamin C have a potential in reducing the inflammatory response associated with SARS-CoV-2 while folate and vitamin D may have a role in antagonizing the entry of SARs-CoV-2 virus in host calls. SUMMARY: Thus, further research should be conducted that could lead to the development of nutritional supplements involving natural and widely available compounds such as zinc, folate, vitamin C, and vitamin D. The latter could be an effective, safe, and inexpensive way to either prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 and/or lessen the burden of COVID-19 disease.","output":"Keeping a Balance During the Pandemic: a Narrative Review on the Important Role of Micronutrients in Preventing Infection and Reducing Complications of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The National Cancer Act of 1971 instigated 50 years of momentum that raised the federal investment in cancer research from $500 million in 1972 to $6.5 billion in 2021.

Strikingly, the deconvolution of the entire set of intra-host variants reveals the existence of mutually exclusive viral mutational signatures, which prove that distinct hosts differently respond to SARS-CoV-2 infections. In particular, two signatures are likely ruled by APOBEC and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which induce hypermutation in a significant number of samples, and appear to be affected by severe purifying selection. Conversely, several mutations linked to low-rate mutational processes appear to transit to clonality in the population, eventually leading to the definition of new viral genotypes and to an increase of overall genomic diversity. Finally, we demonstrate that a high number of variants are observed in samples associated to independent lineages, likely due to signature-related mutational hotspots or to positive selection.","output":"Mutational Signatures and Heterogeneous Host Response Revealed Via Large-Scale Characterization of SARS-COV-2 Genomic Diversity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Earthquakes inevitably affect the mental health of local residents. In seismically active regions of Southwest China, local rural residents' dilapidated housing with poor seismic performance aggravates the impacts of earthquakes on their mental health. These residents' mental health is difficult to recognize because of the lack of appropriate assessment methods. In addition, rural residents in the area have a low socioeconomic status and cannot access adequate mental treatment. Thus, telemedicine could be an effective approach to assist mental health practice in such areas. However, the lack of telemedicine assessment factors in these areas makes it difficult to complete the correct triage and prioritization of rural residents' mental health quickly and effectively. To provide a foundation for applying telemedicine to assess the risk of mental health problems that rural residents in seismically active regions experience, this paper studied whether the degree of safety of housing can affect mental health. In this study, nine villages near the epicenter of the 2019 6.0-magnitude earthquake in Changning County, China were randomly selected, and 162 valid questionnaires were completed. SPSS statistical software was used to analyze the collected data. First, the satisfaction of rural residents with the degree of safety of housing significantly affected the K6 score and whether they suffered from mental problems. Second, the mental health of rural residents living in reinforced concrete frame structure housing was obviously superior to that of those living in other types of housing. Next, the most significant factor affecting mental health was the degree of wall cracks. Finally, a new approach was developed to assess and prioritize the mental health of rural residents by using degrees of housing safety and smart technology in seismically active regions. The telemedicine assessment approach is expected to be used in the future for mental health evaluation and the large-scale data scoring of rural residents.","output":"Telemedicine Assessment for the Mental Health of Rural Residents Based on the Safety Degree of Housing in Seismically Active Regions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing is necessary to prevent the rapid spread of a highly contagious disease, such as COVID-19, at least until a vaccine is found and mass-produced By reducing the probability of an uninfected person coming close or in physical contact with an infected one, the disease transmission in the community can be suppressed Although social distancing is simple to comprehend, it is not always easy to implement, mainly because not all public spaces are designed with this requirement in mind In this paper, we present a queue management tool that can be used to allow people that wait for a service practice social distancing In our approach, people are asked to join a virtual queue, in order to avoid crowds in physical waiting rooms or long waiting queues Machine learning is used to predict the estimated waiting time of queuers, so they are called just in time to get served We use past data and machine learning to predict how busy a location will be so that customers can pick the best time to visit the service Finally, we present the method we use to monitor people taking a service at any time and implement contact tracing in a privacy-preserving manner ? 2020 IEEE","output":"A Queue Management Approach for Social Distancing and Contact Tracing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rapid increases in cases of COVID-19 were observed in multiple cities in Iran towards the start of the pandemic. However, the true infection rate remains unknown. We aimed to assess the seroprevalence of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 18 cities of Iran as an indicator of the infection rate. METHODS: In this population-based cross-sectional study, we randomly selected and invited study participants from the general population (from lists of people registered with the Iranian electronic health record system or health-care centres) and a high-risk population of individuals likely to have close social contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals through their occupation (from employee lists provided by relevant agencies or companies, such as supermarket chains) across 18 cities in 17 Iranian provinces. Participants were asked questions on their demographic characteristics, medical history, recent COVID-19-related symptoms, and COVID-19-related exposures. Iran Food and Drug Administration-approved Pishtaz Teb SARS-CoV-2 ELISA kits were used to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies in blood samples from participants. Seroprevalence was estimated on the basis of ELISA test results and adjusted for population weighting (by age, sex, and city population size) and test performance (according to our independent validation of sensitivity and specificity). FINDINGS: From 9181 individuals who were initially contacted between April 17 and June 2, 2020, 243 individuals refused to provide blood samples and 36 did not provide demographic information and were excluded from the analysis. Among the 8902 individuals included in the analysis, 5372 had occupations with a high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and 3530 were recruited from the general population. The overall population weight-adjusted and test performance-adjusted prevalence of antibody seropositivity in the general population was 171% (95% CI 146-195), implying that 4a265a542 (95% CI 3a659a043-4a887a078) individuals from the 18 cities included were infected by the end of April, 2020. The adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies varied greatly by city, with the highest estimates found in Rasht (726% [539-928]) and Qom (585% [372-839]). The overall population weight-adjusted and test performance-adjusted seroprevalence in the high-risk population was 200% (185-217) and showed little variation between the occupations included. INTERPRETATIONS: Seroprevalence is likely to be much higher than the reported prevalence of COVID-19 based on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Iran. Despite high seroprevalence in a few cities, a large proportion of the population is still uninfected. The potential shortcomings of current public health policies should therefore be identified to prevent future epidemic waves in Iran.

A potential solution to this growing global problem is citizen-generated counter speech where citizens actively engage in hate-filled conversations to attempt to restore civil non-polarized discourse. However, its actual effectiveness in curbing the spread of hatred is unknown and hard to quantify. One major obstacle to researching this question is a lack of large labeled data sets for training automated classifiers to identify counter speech. Here we made use of a unique situation in Germany where self-labeling groups engaged in organized online hate and counter speech. We used an ensemble learning algorithm which pairs a variety of paragraph embeddings with regularized logistic regression functions to classify both hate and counter speech in a corpus of millions of relevant tweets from these two groups. Our pipeline achieved macro F1 scores on out of sample balanced test sets ranging from 0.76 to 0.97---accuracy in line and even exceeding the state of the art. On thousands of tweets, we used crowdsourcing to verify that the judgments made by the classifier are in close alignment with human judgment. We then used the classifier to discover hate and counter speech in more than 135,000 fully-resolved Twitter conversations occurring from 2013 to 2018 and study their frequency and interaction. Altogether, our results highlight the potential of automated methods to evaluate the impact of coordinated counter speech in stabilizing conversations on social media.","output":"Countering hate on social media: Large scale classification of hate and counter speech"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health emergency statutes should give executive-branch officials clear authority to respond swiftly in a crisis while setting forth principles to guide executive discretion. Statutes already provide specific authorizations and statutory guardrails for individually targeted measures like isolation and quarantine. New legislation is needed to provide similarly specific authorizations and guardrails for compulsory social distancing and face mask orders. Reforms should facilitate democratic accountability for executive-branch decisions in addition to protecting individual rights. This article offers five key principles to guide legislation. First, statutes should mandate transparency, which is critical to secure the publics trust. To ensure compulsory orders are conditioned on a demonstrated threat of significant risk and a suitable fit between the means and clearly stated ends, mandated disclosures should include statements of the strategic purpose orders are intended to serve, the scientific understanding on which they are based, and the criteria for when they can be lifted. Second, statutes should provide officials with a graded range of alternatives to ensure a sustainable emergency response that can be tailored to evolving conditions and understanding. To facilitate a scaled response that balances the risk of contributing to community transmission against other public priorities, classifications of services, businesses, and activities as essential or high-priority should be developed in advance. Third, statutes should provide substantive standards to ensure orders are neutral laws of general applicability that do not discriminate on the basis of religion. Fourth, to enable widespread voluntary compliance and minimize unjust distribution of the benefits and burdens of public health intervention, statutes should mandate that restrictions must be accompanied by financial and other material supports, legal protections, and accommodations for safer alternatives to restricted activities to the greatest extent possible within available resources. Finally, statutes should authorize criminal enforcement against individuals who violate social distancing orders only if executive-branch officials establish that it is the least restrictive alternative available to achieve the governments purpose. These principles should also guide executive officials as they exercise the discretion granted to them under existing statutes.This article proceeds in four parts. In Part I, I describe the evolution of public health emergency law through the turn of the twenty-first century, which determined the governmental powers available at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. In the Part II, I describe the community mitigation strategy implemented to slow the spread of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States after containment efforts failed. In Part III, I map the legal challenges to coronavirus emergency orders adjudicated in state and federal courts and describe their key themes. Finally, I propose statutory guardrails for state legislatures to guide the use of compulsory social distancing and PPE for the general public.","output":"Democratizing the Law of Social Distancing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We show that the eclectic\\"Boogaloo\\"extremist movement that is now rising to prominence in the U.S., has a hidden online mathematical order that is identical to ISIS during its early development, despite their stark ideological, geographical and cultural differences.

Thus, this study aimed to critically review non-pharmacological respiratory strategies for this population. Original studies were searched in six databases considering predefined inclusion criteria. Other studies and recommendations were also included after a manual search. Oxygen therapy, invasive (IMV) and non-invasive (NIV) ventilation were the most frequent addressed interventions. In general, the original studies cited these strategies, but detailed information on parameters used was not provided. The recommendations provided more detailed data, mainly based on experiences with other acute respiratory syndromes in childhood. In the context of oxygen therapy, the nasal catheter was the most recommended strategy for hypoxemia, followed by the high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC). However, the risks of contamination due to the dispersion of aerosols in the case of the HFNC were pointed out. Lung protective IMV with the use of bacteriological or viral filters was recommended in most documents, and there was great variation about PEEP titration. Alveolar recruitment maneuvers were mentioned in a few recommendations. NIV was not consensual between studies, and when selected, several precautions must be taken to avoid contamination. Airway suctioning with closed-circuit was recommended to reduce aerosol spread. Information on prone positioning and physiotherapy was even more scarce. In conclusion, oxygen therapy seems to be essential in the treatment of hypoxemia. If necessary, IMV should not be delayed, and protective strategies are encouraged for adequate pulmonary ventilation.

In this paper, we propose to run multiple analyses on the same set of data to produce a more robust list of risk factors. With our time-to-event survival data, the standard survival analysis were extended in three directions. The first is to extend from tests and corresponding p-values to machine learning and their prediction performance. The second is to extend from single-variable to multiple-variable analysis. The third is to expand from analyzing time-to-decease data with death as the event of interest to analyzing time-to-hospital-release data to treat early recover as a meaningful event as well. Our extension of the type of analyses leads to ten ranking lists. We conclude that 20 out of 30 factors are deemed to be reliably associated to faster-death or faster-recovery.

The identification of a set of topics important to the patient from social network service drug reviews would inform the design of patient-centered medication counseling. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) identify the distinctive topics from patient medication reviews unique to tadalafil versus sildenafil; (2) determine if the primary topics are distributed differently for each drug and for each patient characteristic (age and time on ED drug therapy); and (3) test if the primary topics affect satisfaction with ED drug therapy controlling for patient characteristics. METHODS: Data were collected from the patient medication reviews of sildenafil and tadalafil posted on WebMD and Ask a Patient. The latent Dirichlet allocation method of natural language processing was used to identify 5 distinctive topics from the patient medication reviews on each drug. Analysis of variance and a 2-sample t test were conducted to compare the topic distribution and assess whether patient satisfaction varies with the primary topics, age, and time on medication for each ED drug. Statistical significance was tested at an alpha of .05. RESULTS: The patient medication reviews of sildenafil (N=463) had 2 topics on treatment benefit and 1 each on medication safety, marketing claim, and treatment comparison, while the patient medication reviews of tadalafil (N=919) had 2 topics on medication safety and 1 each on the remaining subjects. Sildenafils reviewers quite frequently (94/463, 20.4%) mentioned erection sustainability as their primary topic, whereas tadalafils reviewers were more concerned about severe medication safety. Those who mentioned erection sustainability as their primary topic were quite satisfied with their treatment as opposed to those who mentioned severe medication safety as their primary topic (score 3.85 vs 2.44). The discovered topics reflected the marketing claims of blue magic and amber romance for sildenafil and tadalafil, respectively. The topic of blue magic was preferred among younger patients, while the topic of amber romance was preferred among older patients. The topic alternative choices, which appeared for both the ED drugs, reflected patient interest in the comparative effectiveness and price outside the drug labeling information. CONCLUSIONS: The patient medication reviews of ED drugs reflect patient preferences regarding drug labeling information, marketing claims, and alternative treatment choices.

This type of retrospective visual analysis, however, is prone to a variety of selection bias effects, especially for high-dimensional data where only a subset of dimensions is visualized at any given time. The risk of selection bias is even higher when analysts dynamically apply filters or perform grouping operations during ad hoc analyses. These bias effects threatens the validity and generalizability of insights discovered during visual analysis as the basis for decision making. Past work has focused on bias transparency, helping users understand when selection bias may have occurred. However, countering the effects of selection bias via bias mitigation is typically left for the user to accomplish as a separate process. Dynamic reweighting (DR) is a novel computational approach to selection bias mitigation that helps users craft bias-corrected visualizations.

The participants are 10 current preservice teachers. The researcher collected data from fieldwork supervisors, observations, and survey results from participants. Kolb's experiential theory was used in the analysis of co-requisite policy and observations of field experiences of students in a teacher education program. The article analyzed data that suggested that in-person observations and opportunities to practice classroom instruction contribute to teacher readiness and relationship building in comparison to online learning. Furthermore, states will have to re-assess their teacher certification requirements, quality control efforts, and mandatory exams since COVID-19, which may lead to the reauthorization of the pre-service guidelines. Program learning outcomes and critical assignments that allow candidates to demonstrate content knowledge and instructional delivery are being compromised. The finding were that pre-service candidates did not have the opportunity to demonstrate mastery of specific teacher performance expectations within the distance learning format. This article aims to encourage further research teacher education and distance learning to discuss potential alternatives to certification and creative ways to embed flexibility into teacher preparation. Substantial changes can lower the quality of a program and significantly decrease effectiveness while increasing data misrepresentation. Distance learning can potentially limit quality supervision and teacher mentoring. In addition, pre-service teachers will enter classrooms with substantially fewer clinical practice hours.","output":"Pre-Service Teacher Experiences during COVID 19: Exploring the Uncertainties between Clinical Practice and Distance Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Processing of bronchoscopes after a physical examination has to eliminate all micro-organisms that could have contaminated the endoscope and that may harm the following patient. The aim of this analysis is to define those micro-organisms that may contaminate the bronchoscope during the examination and that may cause disease in other patients. Methods Research of literature and analysis of laboratory data. Results During the passage of the respiratory tract the bronchoscope will be contaminated by the physiological flora of oral cavity, nasopharynx, trachea, bronchi, and pulmonary tissues. Whilst the oral cavity, the nasopharynx and the pharynx are the habitat for a great variety of bacteria the lower respiratory tract is virtually free of micro-organisms. However, in ventilated patients trachea and bronchi can become colonized as the result of bypassing the cleansing effect of the ciliated epithelium. In addition all agents that can cause bronchitis or pneumonia in immunocompromised or otherwise healthy individuals are potential contaminants of bronchoscopes. These microorganisms include bacteria, mycobacteria, yeasts and moulds, enveloped and non-enveloped viruses and rarely parasites. The bronchoscopic procedure can result in epithelial injury with subsequent bleeding. Therefore, all blood-borne pathogens, e.g. HIV or HBV are also potential contaminants of the bronchoscope. There are several reports of transmission of micro-organisms due to incomplete or faulty cleaning and disinfection procedures of bronchoscopes. These incidents include nearly all classes of micro-organisms but not parasites or viruses. However, the incubation period of viruses can be long and the association between bronchoscopy and infection may be obscure. Endospore forming micro-organisms and parasites are not part of the normal flora of the respiratory tract and may rarely cause disease, usually only in severely immunocompromised patients, but transmission of such organisms by bronchoscopy has never been reported. Conclusion The antimicrobial activity of the disinfection process, including chemical disinfectants for endoscopes has to include bacteria, fungi and viruses. Sporicidal activity may be only warranted in specific patient populations, i.e. after bronchoscopy of suspected anthrax patients or before examination of severely immunocompromised patients.","output":"Evidence-based spectrum of antimicrobial activity for disinfection of bronchoscopes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Earthrise photograph, taken on the 1968 Apollo 8 mission, became one of the most significant images of the 20th Century. It triggered a profound shift in environmental awareness and the potential for human unityinspiring the first Earth Day in 1970. Taking inspiration from these events 50 years later, we initiated Project Earthrise at our 2020 annual conference of inVIVO Planetary Health. This builds on the emergent concept of planetary health, which provides a shared narrative to integrate rich and diverse approaches from all aspects of society towards shared solutions to global challenges. The acute catastrophe of the COVID-19 pandemic has drawn greater attention to many other interconnected global health, environmental, social, spiritual, and economic problems that have been underappreciated or neglected for decades. This is accelerating opportunities for greater collaborative action, as many groups now focus on the necessity of a Great Transition. While ambitious integrative efforts have never been more important, it is imperative to apply these with mutualistic value systems as a compass, as we seek to make wiser choices. Project Earthrise is our contribution to this important process. This underscores the imperative for creative ecological solutions to challenges in all systems, on all scales with advancing global urbanization in the digital agefor personal, environmental, economic and societal health alike. At the same time, our agenda seeks to equally consider our social and spiritual ecology as it does natural ecology. Revisiting the inspiration of Earthrise, we welcome diverse perspectives from across all dimensions of the arts and the sciences, to explore novel solutions and new normative values.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Data were prospectively collected from all women undergoing POP surgery between May 2001 and October 2009. Pre- and postoperative urinary symptoms, Urinary Distress Inventory (UDI), and Urinary Impact Questionnaires (UIQ) scores were compared within and between groups. A generalized linear model was used for multivariate analysis. RESULTS Out of the 151 patients included, 87 patients underwent LSC, and 64 VS. Overall, after a median follow-up of 32.4 months, POP surgery improved urinary frequency (P = 0.006), voiding difficulty (P = 0.001), stress urinary incontinence (SUI) (P = 0.001), but not urgency (P = 0.29). VS was more effective in treating SUI (P < 0.001 vs. 0.52) while LSC more effective on voiding difficulty (P = 0.01 vs. 0.08). Postoperative de novo symptoms were observed in 35.8% of patients with no difference between the groups (P = 0.06). UDI (P = 0.04) and UIQ (P = 0.01) scores were significantly lower after surgery. However, LSC significantly improved UDI (P = 0.03) with no effect on UIQ (P = 0.29) scores while VS significantly improved both scores (P = 0.02 and 0.001, respectively). Upon multivariate analysis, only the improvement in the impact of urinary symptoms on daily living was independently associated to VS (OR = 5.45 [95% confidence interval 2.20-13.44], P = 0.01).

This has been exacerbated with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of digital pathology and whole slide imaging (WSI) as an educational tool for distance teaching is underutilised and not fully exploited. This paper highlights the utility and feedback on the use of WSI for distance education/teaching. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Building on an existing relationship with the University of the West Indies (UWI), pathologists at University Health Network, Toronto, provided distance education using WSI, a digitised slide image hosting repository and videoconferencing facilities to provide case-based teaching to 15 UWI pathology trainees. Feedback was obtained from residents via a questionnaire and from teachers via a discussion. RESULTS: There was uniform support from teachers who felt that teaching was not hampered by the 'virtual' engagement. Comfort levels grew with each engagement and technical issues with sound diminished with the use of a portable speaker. The residents were very supportive and enthusiastic in embracing this mode of teaching. While technical glitches marred initial sessions, the process evened out especially when the slide hosting facility, teleconferencing and sound issues were changed. CONCLUSIONS: There was unanimous endorsement that use of WSI was the future, especially for distance teaching. However, it was not meant to supplant the use of glass slides in their current routine, daily practice.","output":"Use of whole slide imaging (WSI) for distance teaching"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Multiple states have reported increases in opioid overdose deaths during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, however little is known about opioid-related presentations to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: This was a time series analysis of visits to 7 EDs in greater Chicago, Illinois from October 20, 2019 to July 25, 2020. We compared the number of ED visits for opioid-related diagnoses in the time period preceding the World Health Organization pandemic declaration (prepandemic period, October 20, 2019-July 3, 2020) to the time period following the World Health Organization declaration (pandemic period, March 8, 2020 to July 25, 2020) using a single-group interrupted time series analysis with Newey-West standard errors. We also present data on alcohol-related ED visits for comparison. RESULTS: We evaluated a total of 177,405 visits across the 7 EDs during the study period. The mean number of weekly ED visits in the prepandemic and pandemic periods was 4841 and 4029 weekly visits, respectively. In the interrupted time series analysis, there was no significant immediate effect of the pandemic start on opioid-related ED visits (-0.44 visits per 1000 ED visits, 95% CI -2.47 to 1.58, Pa=a0.66), however, there was a significant immediate effect of the pandemic start on alcohol-related ED visits (-4.1, 95% CI: -8.25 to -0.01, Pa<a0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Despite reductions in overall ED visit volumes and alcohol-related visits during COVID-19, the number of opioid-related visits was not significantly reduced during the early pandemic. These data reinforce the need to provide comprehensive treatment services for opioid use disorder during the co-occurring COVID-19 and opioid crises.","output":"Opioid-related Emergency Department Visits During COVID-19 in a Large Health System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper assesses how Argentine public universities responded to the crisis of the Covid-19 pandemic in three dimensions: teaching and learning, scientific research and community engagement, and internationalization activities For each of the dimensions, the actions developed, and the challenges encountered are presented I argue that the response was quick and consistent: it is related to an academic culture that is framed in the right to university, both individual right (access, permanence, and graduation to all citizens) and collective right (benefit socio-community development) The article concludes with a preliminary analysis of the agenda items to advance regulations and policies On several occasions a self-reflective exercise is carried out, as part of a community that is going through this situation of extraordinary urgency","output":"Universities and Covid-19 in Argentina: from community engagement to regulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The majority of patients enrolled in SWIFT PRIME trial (Solitaire FR With the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke) had computed tomographic perfusion (CTP) imaging before randomization; 34 patients were randomized after magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS Patients with middle cerebral artery and distal carotid occlusions were randomized to treatment with tPA (tissue-type plasminogen activator) alone or tPA+stentriever thrombectomy. The primary outcome was the distribution of the modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days. Patients with the target mismatch profile for enrollment were identified on MRI and CTP. RESULTS MRI selection was performed in 34 patients; CTP in 139 patients. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 17 in both groups. Target mismatch profile was present in 95% (MRI) versus 83% (CTP). A higher percentage of the MRI group was transferred from an outside hospital (P=0.02), and therefore, the time from stroke onset to randomization was longer in the MRI group (P=0.003). Time from emergency room arrival to randomization did not differ in CTP versus MRI-selected patients. Baseline ischemic core volumes were similar in both groups. Reperfusion rates (>90%/TICI [Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction] score 3) did not differ in the stentriever-treated patients in the MRI versus CTP groups. The primary efficacy analysis (90-day mRS score) demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in both subgroups (MRI, P=0.02; CTP, P=0.01). Infarct growth was reduced in the stentriever-treated group in both MRI and CTP groups. CONCLUSIONS Time to randomization was significantly longer in MRI-selected patients; however, site arrival to randomization times were not prolonged, and the benefits of endovascular therapy were similar.

In many practical scenarios, lies often affect groups of receivers, which inevitably entangles the payoffs of individuals to the payoffs of other agents in their group, and this makes the formalism of pairwise sender-receiver games inapt for where it might be useful the most. We therefore introduce group interactions among receivers, and study how their interconnectedness in higher-order social networks affects the evolution of lying. We observe a number of counterintuitive results that are rooted in the complexity of the underlying evolutionary dynamics, which has thus far remained hidden in the realm of pairwise interactions. We find conditions for honesty to persist even when there is a temptation to lie, and we observe the prevalence of moral strategy profiles even when lies favor the receiver at a cost to the sender. We confirm the robustness of our results by further performing simulations on hypergraphs created from real-world data using the SocioPatterns database.

Youth with a history of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), as well as youth from minoritized racial-ethnic backgrounds, may be especially vulnerable to experiencing COVID-19-related distress. The current aims are to examine whether exposure to pre-pandemic ACEs predicts mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in youth and whether racial-ethnic background moderated these effects. METHODS: From May to August 2020, 7,983 youth (M(age)= 12.5, range= 10.6-14.6 years old) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study(SM) (ABCD Study?) completed at least one of three online surveys measuring the impact of the pandemic on their mental health. Data was evaluated in relation to youths pre-pandemic mental health and ACEs. RESULTS: Pre-pandemic ACE history significantly predicted poorer mental health (across all outcomes) and greater COVID-19-related stress and impact of fears on well-being. Youth reported improved mental health during the pandemic (from May to August 2020). While reporting similar levels of mental health, youth from minoritized racial-ethnic backgrounds had elevated COVID-19-related worry, stress, and impact on well-being. Race and ethnicity generally did not moderate ACE effects. Older youth, girls, and those with greater pre-pandemic internalizing symptoms also reported greater mental health symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Youth who experienced greater childhood adversity reported greater negative affect and COVID-19-related distress during the pandemic. Although they reported generally better mood, Black, Asian American, and multiracial youth reported greater COVID-19-related worry and experienced COVID-19 related discrimination compared to non-Hispanic White youth, highlighting potential health disparities.","output":"Longitudinal Impact of Childhood Adversity on Early Adolescent Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the ABCD Study?

Here we performed next-generation RNA sequencing and a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis to characterize the dynamic transcriptome landscapes in PAMs following PRRSV infection. Totally 38222 annotated mRNAs, 12987 annotated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and 17624 novel lncRNAs in PRRSV-infected PAMs were identified through a transcripts computational identification pipeline. The differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs during PRRSV infection were characterized. Several differentially expressed transcripts were validated using qRT-PCR. Analyses on dynamic overrepresented GO terms and KEGG pathways in PRRSV-infected PAMs at different time points were performed.

RESULTS Of 189 patients with anterior circulation occlusions, 135 were treated within 0-8 hours, 33 were treated after 8 or more hours, and 21 were treated after wake-up stroke (WUS). Among 24 patients treated with posterior circulation occlusions, 4 had WUS. After treatment, 72.3% patients had TIMI 2/3 reperfusion; SICH rate was 8.7%; at 90 days, 36.6% recovered to mRS 2 or less. SICH rate was higher in patients with anterior circulation strokes who received treatment 8 or more hours after symptom onset (odds ratio [OR] = 3.8) and patients with WUS (OR = 4.9). In patients treated within 8 hours of onset of symptoms of anterior circulation stroke, SICH rate was only 6.7%. There was no difference in outcomes in patients with WUS compared with patients treated less than 8 hours after stroke onset. CONCLUSIONS This is the first and largest prospective study to the authors' knowledge that shows endovascular therapy for AIS patients in a real-world setting. High recanalization rates with low SICH rates were achieved using careful patient and therapy selection.","output":"Prospective acute ischemic stroke outcomes after endovascular therapy: a real-world experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The extraordinary measures taken by Spain to address the COVID-19 health crisis forced schools to move their face-to-face teaching activity to an on-line mode Physical Education (PE) teachers faced a new challenge: to adapt the contents of the subject, mainly practical and social to a virtual education, based mainly on digital resources However, this adaptation can be much more complex in the most disadvantaged or rural areas where many students have a significant digital bias: either they do not have access to the Internet, or they do not have acquired adequate competences for its use Therefore, the purpose of this retrospective case study is to present the teaching-learning processes and pedagogical strategies that the teachers of a rural (grouped) school of La Alcania Conquense carried out during the lockdown of the 2019-2020 academic course In this way, first of all, the tools and media used for communication between teachers and families, the special projects and resources mobilized, as well as the evaluation process during the cessation of face-to-face teaching activities are analyzed Next, the main response observed by the entire school community to this new situation were described In general terms, a solid commitment of students and families to the activities and challenges proposed in the EF classes has been observed Finally, possible actions for the next academic year are proposed depending on the social and health situation that may arise","output":"Reflections on the teaching and learning process in Physical Education during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The natural coumarin analogues docking scores were compared to standard Hydroxychloroquine. While the 3D module of SARS coronavirus main protease was predicted with the SWISS MODEL web server, as well as biochemical interaction tests were performed with the AutoDock Vina tool between the target protein with ligands. This research further showed that all the protease inhibitors accessed the target protein with negative dock energy. Molecular docking studies found that the natural coumarin analogue Inophyllum A showed an exceptional potential for inhibition with a binding energy of -8.4 kcal/mol.

While crucial to control the pandemic, isolation might have a significant impact on productivity and mental health. Especially for researchers working in healthcare, the current situation is complex. We therefore carried out a survey amongst researchers in the field of radiation oncology to gain insights on the impact of social isolation and working from home and to guide future work. Materials and methods: An online survey was conducted between March 27th and April 5th, 2020. The first part contained 14 questions intended to capture an overview of the specific aspects related to research while in isolation. The second (optional) part of the questionnaire was the validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a self-reported measure used to assess levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results: From 543 survey participants, 48.8% reported to work full-time from home. The impact on perceived productivity, with 71.2% of participants feeling less productive, caused 58% of participants to feel some level of guilt. Compared to normative data, relatively high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were recorded for the 335 participants who filled out the HADS questionnaire. Group comparisons found the presence of a supportive institutional program as the sole factor of statistical significance in both anxiety and depressive symptom levels. People having to work full-time on location showed higher depressive symptom levels than those working from home. Anxiety scores were negatively correlated with the number of research years. Conclusion: Results of the survey showed there is a non-negligible impact on both productivity and mental health. As the radiation oncology research community was forced to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, lessons can be learned to face future adverse situations but also to improve work-life balance in general.","output":"Conducting research in Radiation Oncology remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic: Coping with isolation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In September of 2020, Guan and colleagues wrote about their experience of an Assertive Community Psychiatry Program responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.

These regions are characterized by highly ordered and tightly packed lipid molecules. Several studies revealed that lipid rafts are involved in life cycle of different viruses, including coronaviruses. Among these recently emerged the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The main receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is represented by the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), although it also binds to sialic acids linked to host cell surface gangliosides. A new type of ganglioside-binding domain within the N-terminal portion of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was identified. Lipid rafts provide a suitable platform able to concentrate ACE-2 receptor on host cell membranes where they may interact with the spike protein on viral envelope. This review is focused on selective targeting lipid rafts components as a strategy against coronavirus. Indeed, cholesterol-binding agents, including statins or methyl--cyclodextrin (MCD), can affect cholesterol, causing disruption of lipid rafts, consequently impairing coronavirus adhesion and binding. Moreover, these compounds can block downstream key molecules in virus infectivity, reducing the levels of proinflammatory molecules [tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), interleukin (IL)-6], and/or affecting the autophagic process involved in both viral replication and clearance. Furthermore, cyclodextrins can assemble into complexes with various drugs to form hostCguest inclusions and may be used as pharmaceutical excipients of antiviral compounds, such as lopinavir and remdesivir, by improving bioavailability and solubility. In conclusion, the role of lipid rafts-affecting drugs in the process of coronavirus entry into the host cells prompts to introduce a new potential task in the pharmacological approach against coronavirus.","output":"Targeting Lipid Rafts as a Strategy Against Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The co-transformation of solid waste of natural and anthropogenic origin can be carried out through solid-state-fermentation systems to obtain bio-products with higher added value and lower environmental impact. METHODS: To evaluate the effect of Pleurotus ostreatus on co-transformation of oxo-degradable low-density polyethylene (LDPE(oxo)) sheets and lignocellulosic biomass (LCB), were assembled two 0.75 L microcosm systems in vertical (VMS) and horizontal (HMS) position. The pre-treated sheets with luminescent O(2) plasma discharges were mixed with pine bark, hydrolyzed brewers yeast and paper napkin fragments and incubated for 135 days at 20  1.0 C in the presence of the fungus. With the co-transformation residues, biochar (BC) was produced at 300  1.0 C (BC300) for 1 h, then used to carry out adsorption studies, using the malachite green dye (MG) at pH 4.0, 7.0 and 9.0  0.2. Finally, the biochar was the substrate for the germination of carnation seeds (Dianthus caryophyllus) and Ray-grass (Lolium sp.) in vitro. RESULTS: For HMS, the decrease in static contact angle (SCA) was 63.63% (p = 0.00824) and for VMS 74.45% (p = 0.00219), concerning the pristine. Plastic roughness in VMS was higher (26%) concerning the control. Throughout the 135 days, there were fungal growth and consequently laccase (Lac), manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP) activities. During the first 75 days, CO(2) production increased to 4.78  0.01 and 4.98  0.01 mg g-1 for HMS and VMS, respectively.

The absence of effective drugs for treatment of the disease has caused its rapid spread on a global scale. Similarly to the SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 is also involved in a complex interplay with the host cells. This infection is characterized by a diffused alveolar damage consistent with the Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome (ARDS). To explore the complex mechanisms of the disease at the system level, we used a network medicine tools approach. The protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between the SARS-CoV and the associated human cell proteins are crucial for the viral pathogenesis. Since the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 is accomplished by binding of the spike glycoprotein binding domain (RBD) to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), a molecule that can bind to the spike RDB-hACE2 interface could block the virus entry. Here, we performed a virtual screening of 55 compounds to identify potential molecules that can bind to the spike glycoprotein and spike-ACE2 complex interface. It was found that the compound ethyl 1-{3-[(2,4-dichlorobenzyl) carbamoyl]-1-ethyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-7-quinolinyl}-4-piperidine carboxylate (the S54 ligand) and ethyl 1-{3-[(2,4-dichlorobenzyl) carbamoyl]-1-ethyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-7-quinolinyl}-4 piperazine carboxylate (the S55 ligand) forms hydrophobic interactions with Tyr41A, Tyr505B and Tyr553B, Leu29A, Phe495B, respectively of the spike glycoprotein, the hotspot residues in the spike glycoprotein RBD-hACE2 binding interface. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations using the MM-GBSA method showed that the S54 ligand is a stronger binder than a known SARS-CoV spike inhibitor SSAA09E3 (N-(9,10-dioxo-9, 10-dihydroanthracen-2-yl) benzamide).

In this context, mathematical models are an important tool for supporting the study of spread and transmission of this disease and to understand how restrictive measures could control the epidemic. In the current study, we adopt a new mathematical model representing the dynamics of COVID-19. We estimate model parameters with a new Bayesian method while using the public Italian data, in order to reproduce the pandemic evolution for Italy and one of its regions, Umbria. Once the model is calibrated, we also apply an algorithm, called Conditional Robustness Analysis. This algorithm allows for us to understand the influence of epidemiological parameters and non-pharmaceutical interventions on the number of hospitalized patients. This pipeline of analysis provides a quantitative explanation of the number of underestimated positive cases during the first wave of the epidemic and of the impact of lock-down measures on the hospitalization capacity. Moreover, the calibrated model is quite accurate for making updated estimations of the epidemic evolution. ABSTRACT: This study started from the request of providing predictions on hospitalization and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) rates that are caused by COVID-19 for the Umbria region in Italy. To this purpose, we propose the application of a computational framework to a SEIR-type (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Removed) epidemiological model describing the different stages of COVID-19 infection. The model discriminates between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases and it takes into account possible intervention measures in order to reduce the probability of transmission. As case studies, we analyze not only the epidemic situation in Umbria but also in Italy, in order to capture the evolution of the pandemic at a national level. First of all, we estimate model parameters through a Bayesian calibration method, called Conditional Robust Calibration (CRC), while using the official COVID-19 data of the Italian Civil Protection. Subsequently, Conditional Robustness Analysis (CRA) on the calibrated model is carried out in order to quantify the influence of epidemiological and intervention parameters on the hospitalization rates. The proposed pipeline properly describes the COVID-19 spread during the lock-down phase. It also reveals the underestimation of new positive cases and the need of promptly isolating asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases. The results emphasize the importance of the lock-down timeliness and provide accurate predictions on the current evolution of the pandemic.","output":"Mathematical Modeling and Robustness Analysis to Unravel COVID-19 Transmission Dynamics: The Italy Case ?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Females are at higher risk for developing depression during adolescence than are males, particularly during exposure to stressors like the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Examining structural connections between brain regions involved in executive functioning may advance our understanding of sex biases in stress and depression. Here, we examined the role of the cingulum bundle in differentiating trajectories of depressive symptoms in males and females across adolescence and during the pandemic. METHODS: In a longitudinal study of 214 youth (121 females; ages 9C13 years at baseline), we examined whether fixel\\\\based properties of the cingulum bundle at baseline predict changes in females' and males' severity of depressive symptoms across four timepoints (4C7 years) in adolescence, including during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. We also tested whether cingulum properties predict self\\\\reported resilience and stress during the pandemic. RESULTS: Females had lower fiber density and cross\\\\section (FDC) of the cingulum than did males, a neural pattern that predicted greater increases in depressive symptoms, lower resilience, and higher stress during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Cingulum morphometry predicted changes in depressive trajectories in females, but not in males; specifically, females with lower FDC had significant increases in symptoms throughout adolescence, whereas females with higher cingulum FDC did not. Conversely, males had low, stable depressive symptoms throughout adolescence and higher resilience and lower stress during the pandemic compared to females. Higher cingulum FDC predicted higher resilience and lower stress in both sexes. CONCLUSIONS: In adults, the cingulum has been implicated in sex differences in stress reactivity. We show that in adolescents, the cingulum reflects sex differences in reports of stress and resilience that might contribute to the increased risk of stress\\\\related mood disorders in females. Adolescent females might benefit from cognitive interventions that strengthen the structural properties of the cingulum and increase their perceived resilience during periods of adversity and disruption.","output":"Sex\\\\specific vulnerability to depressive symptoms across adolescence and during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic: The role of the cingulum bundle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent trends in cancer epidemiology in low\\\\ and middle\\\\income countries show the need for urgent action.

For example, a double dissociation between grasping and between perceptual estimates was reported in previous experiments that pit real against illusory object size differences in the context of the Ponzo illusion. While most previous research on the relation between action and perception focused on one-handed grasping, everyday visuomotor interactions also entail the simultaneous use of both hands to grasp objects that are larger in size. Here, we examined whether this double dissociation extends to bimanual movement control. In Experiment 1, participants were presented with different-sized objects embedded in the Ponzo Illusion. In Experiment 2, we tested whether the dissociation between perception and action extends to a different illusion, the Wundt-Jastrow illusion, which has not been previously used in grasping experiments. In both experiments, bimanual grasping trajectories reflected the differences in physical size between the objects; At the same time, perceptual estimates reflected the differences in illusory size between the objects. These results suggest that the double dissociation between action and perception generalizes to bimanual movement control. Unlike conscious perception, bimanual grasping movements are tuned to real-world metrics, and can potentially resist irrelevant information on relative size and depth.","output":"A double dissociation between action and perception in bimanual grasping: evidence from the Ponzo and the Wundt-Jastrow illusions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper critically reconstructs the crowd psychological heritage in phenomenological and social science emotion research.

Indeed, is has been shown that LTR mount weak antibody response after SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccination. Nevertheless, the immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine has not yet been studied in LTR. Methods 49 lung-transplant SARS-CoV2 seronegative recipients were enrolled in a prospective cohort study and received the two doses regimen, day 0 and day 90, of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Immune response was assessed by measuring total anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies (Anti-SARS-CoV2 total Ig immunoassay, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, USA) at D0, D24, D84, D112 and D180. Endpoints At D180, 25% of LTR had positive total antibody levels (positivity threshold, > 1 (sample signal/threshold value). Age, CMV status, gender and initial respiratory disease had no influence on the immune response. Immune response was improved in patients whose immunosuppressive regimen did not include mycophenolate mofetil (53% versus 0%, p < 0.0001), and in patients who were transplanted for more than 18 months (0% versus 41%, p < 0.05), probably due to more aggressive immunosuppressive regimen in recently transplanted patients. Conclusions Immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine is poor in LTR, with only one in four patients mounting significant anti-SARS-CoV2 immune response at D180. Of note, according to expert recommendations, most LTR received an heterologous booster dose with a SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2). Additional serological analyses are planned to decipher whether vaccinal response is improved after the third dose in LTR.

There is a paucity of research on the factors that influence adherence to social distancing. Available research suggests that it varies with the specific behaviour and that reducing contact with family and friends is the hardest one. This study aims to identify factors associated with motivation to avoid meeting with family and friends during the second lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal. METHODS: We used data from a community-based survey, COVID-19 Barometer: Social Opinion, which includes sociodemographics, psychosocial variables, and subjective health and wellbeing indicators from 20th February to 19th March 2021. We included 1336 participants who answered the question To what extent is it easy for you to avoid visiting family and friends?. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with difficulty to avoid visiting family and friends. RESULTS: Preliminary data shows that 38.4% (513) had difficulties avoiding meeting with family and friends. Those with greater difficulty were the ones who have less education, higher negative emotionality, do not work remotely, have more difficulties to stay home and practice physical distancing and consider the Government's measures inadequate. Contrarily, those who have less difficulty avoiding visiting friends and family are older and have low risk perception of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests higher difficulty in avoiding visiting friends and family for those whose routines demand not staying at home, with low agreement with Government measures, and struggle with higher negative emotionality, confirming the personal costs of these behaviours and the importance of habits. Older people had less difficulty, suggesting that these measures may be closer to their usual routines. Interventions should consider the specificities of social interaction. KEY MESSAGES: Social distancing comes at an enormous cost to people's livelihoods and it also depends on people living circumstances. Interventions to improve adherence to social distancing should consider the specificity of social interaction and the potential dissonance created by the overall routines.","output":"Factors associated with motivation to avoid meeting family and friends during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Heavy alcohol and cannabinoid consumption prior to pneumonia infection resulted in an increased severity of disease in mice. Analysis of hospital discharge data showed an increased length of stay among alcohol-consuming pneumonia patients. Increased alcohol and cannabis sales during the early months of 2020 suggest that consumption of both substances has increased significantly during the pandemic, potentially representing an increased risk of severe COVID-19 mediated by lung inflammation. ABSTRACT: Risk factors for severe COVID-19 pathology are currently being investigated worldwide. The emergence of this highly infectious respiratory disease has plagued the world, with varying severity across populations of different age, race, and socio-economic level. These data suggest that other environmental or social factors may contribute to this diseases severity. Using a mouse model, we identify heavy alcohol and cannabinoid consumption as risk factors for increased pulmonary pathology in the setting of exposure to a microbial pulmonary pathogen (K. pneumoniae). We present observational evidence that pneumonia patients admitted to North Carolina hospitals have longer lengths of stay when they endorse alcohol use or have conditions considered alcohol attributable. We are concerned that the observed increase in alcohol and legal cannabinoid sales during lockdown and quarantine may contribute to increased pulmonary pathology among patients who become infected with COVID-19.","output":"Alcohol, Cannabis and Crossfading: Concerns for COVID-19 Disease Severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to assess the influence of postponing the first post-activation follow-up due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the aided sound field detection thresholds and speech recognition of cochlear implant (CI) users. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed at a tertiary referral center. Two groups of adult CI recipients were evaluated: (1) patients whose first post-activation follow-up was postponed due to COVID-19 closures (postponed group; n = 10) and (2) a control group that attended recommended post-activation follow-ups prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (control group; n = 18). For both groups, electric thresholds were estimated at initial activation based on comfort levels and were measured behaviorally at subsequent post-activation follow-ups. For the control group, behavioral thresholds were measured at the 1-month follow-up. For the postponed group, behavioral thresholds were not measured until 3 months post-activation since the 1-month follow-up was postponed. The aided pure-tone average (PTA) and word recognition results were compared between groups at the 3-month follow-up and at an interim visit 2C9 weeks later. RESULTS: At the 3-month follow-up, the postponed group had significantly poorer word recognition (23 vs. 42%, p = 0.027) and aided PTA (42 vs. 37 dB HL, p = 0.041) than the control group. No significant differences were observed between 3-month data from the control group and interim data from the postponed group. CONCLUSIONS: The postponed follow-up after CI activation was associated with poorer outcomes, both in terms of speech recognition and aided audibility. However, these detrimental effects were reversed following provision of an individualized map, with behaviorally measured electric threshold and comfort levels. While adult CI recipients demonstrate an improvement in speech recognition with estimated electric thresholds, the present results suggest that behavioral mapping within the initial weeks of device use may support optimal outcomes.","output":"Influence of Postponed Follow-Up after Cochlear Implant Activation during the COVID-19 Pandemic on Aided Sound Field Detection and Speech Recognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In light of recent positive trial data for endovascular therapy in acute ischemic stroke (AIS), stent retriever use by practitioners without prior experience with these devices may become more common.

However, traditional air quality assessments may fail to provide comprehensive, real-time monitoring of air quality because of the sparse distribution of air quality monitoring stations. Overcoming some key limitations of traditional surface monitoring data, Web-based social media platforms, such as Twitter, Weibo, and Facebook, provide a promising tool and novel perspective for environmental monitoring, prediction, and evaluation. This study aims to investigate the relationship between PM(2.5) levels and peoples emotional intensity by observing social media postings. This study defines the emotional intensity indicator, which is measured by the number of negative posts on Weibo, based on Weibo data related to haze from 2016 and 2017. This study estimates sentiment polarity using a recurrent neural networks model based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and verifies the correlation between high PM(2.5) levels and negative posts on Weibo using a Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple linear regression model. This study makes the following observations: (1) Taking the two-year data as an example, this study recorded the significant influence of PM(2.5) levels on netizens posting behavior. (2) Air quality, meteorological factors, the seasons, and other factors have a strong influence on netizens emotional intensity. (3) From a quantitative viewpoint, the level of PM(2.5) varies by 1 unit, and the number of negative Weibo posts fluctuates by 1.0168 units. Thus, it can be concluded that netizens emotional intensity is significantly positively affected by levels of PM(2.5).

Given the risk of early-season energy limitations, time- and energy-based carry-over effects stemming from environmental conditions across the annual cycle may have pronounced consequences for breeding phenology and fitness. Generally, when and where environmental conditions are most influential are poorly understood, limiting our ability to predict the future of climate sensitive populations. 2) For an alpine-breeding, migratory population of horned lark (Eremophila alpestris) in northern British Columbia, Canada (54.8N), we assessed how weather conditions across the annual cycle influenced clutch initiation date and offspring development. We also addressed how cross-seasonal effects on breeding parameters combine to influence reproductive fitness. 3) With 12 years of breeding data and 3 years of migration data, we used a sliding window approach to identify points during the annual cycle when weather events most influenced breeding phenology and offspring development. Consequences for breeding success were assessed using nest survival simulations. 4) Average clutch initiation date varied up to 11 days among years but did not advance from 2003 to 2019. Warmer temperatures at stopover and breeding sites advanced clutch initiation, but winter conditions had no effect. Sub-zero stopover temperatures carried over to prolong offspring development independent of clutch initiation date, potentially indicating energy-based carry-over effects acting on parental investment. Nest survival decreased with both later clutch initiation and prolonged offspring development, such that females nesting earlier and fledging offspring at a younger age were up to 45% more likely to reproduce successfully. 5) We demonstrate that stronger carry-over effects originated from environmental conditions closer to the breeding site in time and space, as well as the potential for energy-based mechanisms to link pre-breeding conditions to reproductive fitness. We also highlight the importance of extended stopovers for songbirds breeding in seasonal environments, particularly given that climatic conditions are becoming increasingly decoupled across stages of the annual cycle. Understanding the cross-seasonal mechanisms shaping breeding decisions in stochastic environments allows for more accurate predictions of population-level responses to climate change.","output":"The relative influence of cross-seasonal and local weather effects on the breeding success of a migratory songbird"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is maintained by the emergence of successive variants, highlighting the flexibility of the protein sequences of the virus.

Strikingly, antigenic sites are enriched in IDRs, in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and in the N-terminal domain (NTD), suggesting a key role of structural flexibility in the antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 protein surface. Mutations occurring in the S1 subunit and nucleoprotein (N) IDRs are critical for immune evasion and antibody escape, suggesting potential additional implications for vaccines and monoclonal therapeutic strategies.

Upon the arrival of military medical assets to the Javits Convention Center in NYC, the planned mission to care for non-SARS-CoV-2 patients was immediately changed to manage patients with (SARS-CoV-2)COVID-19 and their comorbid conditions. Healthcare professionals from every branch of the uniformed services, augmented by state and local resources, staffed the Javits New York Medical Station (JNYMS) from April 2020. METHODS: The data review reported aggregated summary statistics and participant observations collected by N.Y. State and U.S. military officials. RESULTS: During the 28 days of patient intake at the JNYMS, 1,095 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were transferred from NYC hospitals to the JNYMS. At its peak, the JNYMS accepted 119 patients in a single day, had a maximum census of 453, and had a peak intensive care unit census of 35. The median length of stay was 4.6 days (interquartile range: 3.1-6.9 days). A total of 103 patients were transferred back to local hospitals, and there were 6 deaths, with an overall mortality rate of 0.6% (95% CI, 0.3-1.2).

METHODS: A total of 21 university centers for radiation oncology from five different European countries (Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, and Austria) participated in the study which evaluated na?= 347 patients with confirmed (biopsy) inoperable NSCLC in UICC stage III A/B who received radical curative-intent RCT between 2010 and 2013. Patient and disease data were collected anonymously via electronic case report forms and entered into the multi-institutional RadPlanBio platform for central data analysis. GTV before RCT (initial planning CT, GTV1) and at 40-50a?Gy (re-planning CT for radiation boost, GTV2) was delineated. Absolute GTV before/during RCT and relative GTV changes were correlated with overall survival as the primary endpoint. Hazard ratios (HR) of survival analysis were estimated by means of adjusted Cox regression models. RESULTS: GTV1 was found to have a mean of 154.4a?ml (95%CI: 1.5-877) and GTV2 of 106.2a?ml (95% CI: 0.5-589.5), resulting in an estimated reduction of 48.2a?ml (pa?< 0.001). Median overall survival (OS) was 18.8 months with a median of 22.1, 20.9, and 12.6 months for patients with high, intermediate, and low GTV before RT. Considering all patients, in one survival model of overall mortality, GTV2 (2.75 (1.12-6.75, pa?= 0.03) was found to be a stronger survival predictor than GTV1 (1.34 (0.9-2, pa?> 0.05). In patients with available data on both GTV1 and GTV2, absolute GTV1 before RT was not significantly associated with survival (HR 0-69, 0.32-1.49, pa?> 0.05) but GTV2 significantly predicted OS in a model adjusted for age, T stage, and chemotherapy, with an HR of 3.7 (1.01-13.53, pa?= 0.04) per 300a?ml. The absolute decrease from GTV1 to GTV2 was correlated to survival, where every decrease by 50a?ml reduced the HR by 0.8 (CI 0.64-0.99, pa?= 0.04). There was no evidence for a survival effect of the relative change between GTV1 and GTV2.

Cytotoxic response against pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infected cells was increased more than 4-fold in patients who received 10,000 IU/day. Moreover, levels of IFN were significantly higher in this group. Beneficial effect of supplementation with 10,000 IU/day was also observed in participants who developed ARDS and stayed at the hospital for 8.0 days, whereas those who received 2,000 IU/day stayed for 29.2 days (p=0.0381). Administration of high doses of vitamin D(3) as adjuvant of the standard care treatment during hospitalization for COVID-19 may improve the inflammatory environment and cytotoxic response against pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, shortening the hospital stay and, possibly, improving the prognosis.","output":"Changes in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with severe COVID-19 treated with high dose of vitamin D"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of maternal deaths associated with COVID-19 registered in a collaborative Latin-American multi-country database. Methods This was an observational study implemented from March 1st 2020 to November 29th 2021 in eight Latin American countries. Information was based on the Perinatal Information System from the Latin American Center for Perinatology, Women and Reproductive Health. We summarized categorical variables as frequencies and percentages and continuous variables into median with interquartile ranges. Findings We identified a total of 447 deaths. The median maternal age was 31 years. 864% of women were infected antepartum, with most of the cases (603%) detected in the third trimester of pregnancy. The most frequent symptoms at first consultation and admission were dyspnea (730%), fever (690%), and cough (590%). Organ dysfunction was reported in 904% of women during admission. A total of 648% women were admitted to critical care for a median length of eight days. In most cases, the death occurred during the puerperium, with a median of seven days between delivery and death. Preterm delivery was the most common perinatal complication (769%) and 599% were low birth weight. Interpretation This study describes the characteristics of maternal deaths in a comprehensive multi-country database in Latin America during the COVID-19 pandemic. Barriers faced by Latin American pregnant women to access intensive care services when required were also revealed. Decision-makers should strengthen severity awareness, and referral strategies to avoid potential delays.

Radiomic features detention indirectly tissue features such as heterogeneity and shape and can, alone or in combination with demographic, histological, genomic, or proteomic data, be used for decision support system in clinical setting. METHODS: This article is a narrative review on Radiomics in Primary Liver Cancers. Particularly, limitations and future perspectives are discussed. RESULTS: In oncology, assessment of tissue heterogeneity is of particular interest: genomic analysis have demonstrated that the degree of tumour heterogeneity is a prognostic determinant of survival and an obstacle to cancer control. Therefore, that Radiomics could support cancer detection, diagnosis, evaluation of prognosis and response to treatment, so as could supervise disease status in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) patients. Radiomic analysis is a convenient radiological image analysis technique used to support clinical decisions as it is able to provide prognostic and / or predictive biomarkers that allow a fast, objective and repeatable tool for disease monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Although several studies have shown that this analysis is very promising, there is little standardization and generalization of the results, which limits the translation of this method into the clinical context. The limitations are mainly related to the evaluation of data quality, repeatability, reproducibility, overfitting of the model.

Although some restrictions are being removed, it is not certain when the pandemic is going to be definitively over. Pandemics can be seen as a highly complex logistic scenario. From this perspective, some of the indications provided for palliative radiotherapy (PRT) during the COVID-19 pandemic could be maintained in the future in settings that limit the possibility of patients achieving symptom relief by radiotherapy. This paper has two aims: (1) to provide a summary of the indications for PRT during the COVID-19 pandemic; since some indications can differ slightly, and to avoid any possible contradictions, an expert panel composed of the Italian Association of Radiotherapy and Clinical Oncology (AIRO) and the Palliative Care and Supportive Therapies Working Group (AIRO-palliative) voted by consensus on the summary; (2) to introduce a clinical care model for PRT [endorsed by AIRO and by a spontaneous Italian collaborative network for PRT named La Rete del Sollievo (The Net of Relief)]. The proposed model, denoted No cOmpRoMise on quality of life by pALliative radiotherapy (NORMALITY), is based on an AIRO-palliative consensus-based list of clinical indications for PRT and on practical suggestions regarding the management of patients potentially suitable for PRT but dealing with highly complex logistics scenarios (similar to the ongoing logistics limits due to COVID-19). MATERIAL AND METHODS: First, a summary of the available literature guidelines for PRT published during the COVID-19 pandemic was prepared. A systematic literature search based on the PRISMA approach was performed to retrieve the available literature reporting guideline indications fully or partially focused on PRT. Tables reporting each addressed clinical presentation and respective literature indications were prepared and distributed into two main groups: palliative emergencies and palliative non-emergencies. These summaries were voted in by consensus by selected members of the AIRO and AIRO-palliative panels. Second, based on the summary for palliative indications during the COVID-19 pandemic, a clinical care model to facilitate recruitment and delivery of PRT to patients in complex logistic scenarios was proposed. The summary tables were critically integrated and shuffled according to clinical presentations and then voted on in a second consensus round. Along with the adapted guideline indications, some methods of performing the first triage of patients and facilitating a teleconsultation preliminary to the first in-person visit were developed. RESULTS: After the revision of 161 documents, 13 papers were selected for analysis. From the papers, 19 clinical presentation items were collected; in total, 61 question items were extracted and voted on (i.e., for each presentation, more than one indication was provided from the literature). Two tables summarizing the PRT indications during the COVID-19 pandemic available from the literature (PRT COVID-19 summary tables) were developed: palliative emergencies and palliative non-emergencies. The consensus of the vote by the AIRO panel for the PRT COVID-19 summary was reached. The PRT COVID-19 summary tables for palliative emergencies and palliative non-emergencies were adapted for clinical presentations possibly associated with patients in complex clinical scenarios other than the COVID-19 pandemic. The two new indication tables (i.e., Normality model of PRT indications) for both palliative emergencies and palliative non-emergencies were voted on in a second consensus round. The consensus rate was reached and strong. Written forms facilitating two levels of teleconsultation (triage and remote visits) were also developed, both in English and in Italian, to evaluate the patients for possible indications for PRT before scheduling clinical visits. CONCLUSION: We provide a comprehensive summary of the literature guideline indications for PRT during COVID-19 pandemic. We also propose a clinical care model including clinical indications and written forms facilitating two levels of teleconsultation (triage and remote visits) to evaluate the patients for indications of PRT before scheduling clinical visits. The normality model could facilitate the provision of PRT to patients in future complex logistic scenarios.","output":"Palliative radiotherapy indications during the COVID-19 pandemic and in future complex logistic settings: the NORMALITY model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: There is significant interest in the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) attend the most seriously unwell and injured patients in the community; their data therefore present an early opportunity to examine self-harm trends. The primary aim was to compare the incidence of deliberate self-harm incident (DSH-I) encounters by HEMS before and during the first wave of COVID-19. METHODS: Data were obtained from all three East of England HEMS: total number of activations and stand-downs, number of DSH-I activations and stand-downs, self-harm mechanism and number of 'severe' DSH-I patient encounters, in two 61-day periods: 1 March to 30 April in 2019 (control) and 2020 (COVID-19). Severe DSH-I was defined as cardiac arrest and/or died prehospital. Proportions were compared with a Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: There were a total of 1725 HEMS activations: n=981 (control) and n=744 (COVID-19), a decrease of 24.2% during COVID-19. DSH-I patient encounters increased by 65.4%: n=26 (control) and n=43 (COVID-19). The proportion of encounters that were DSH-I and severe DSH-I both significantly increased during COVID-19: p=0.002 and p=0.001, respectively. The absolute number of hangings and falls from height both approximately tripled during COVID-19, whereas the number of other mechanisms remained almost constant. CONCLUSION: Despite a reduction in overall HEMS patient encounters, there were significant increases in both the proportion of DSH-Is and their severity attended by HEMS during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the East of England.","output":"Comparison of deliberate self-harm incidents attended by Helicopter Emergency Medical Services before and during the first wave of COVID-19 in the East of England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The following article is a qualitative study that analyses the perception of parents and high school students regarding teaching in times of Coronavirus disease COVID-19, with the idea of recognizing the facilitators and barriers for the teaching-learning process in the pandemic.

To leverage these, we present bioBakery 3, a set of integrated, improved methods for taxonomic, strain-level, functional, and phylogenetic profiling of metagenomes newly developed to build on the largest set of reference sequences now available. Compared to current alternatives, MetaPhlAn 3 increases the accuracy of taxonomic profiling, and HUMAnN 3 improves that of functional potential and activity. These methods detected novel disease-microbiome links in applications to CRC (1,262 metagenomes) and IBD (1,635 metagenomes and 817 metatranscriptomes). Strain-level profiling of an additional 4,077 metagenomes with StrainPhlAn 3 and PanPhlAn 3 unraveled the phylogenetic and functional structure of the common gut microbe Ruminococcus bromii, previously described by only 15 isolate genomes.

As a matter of fact, there is an urgent need for novel strategies and techniques aimed at the surveillance of the active emergence and spread of the variants of concern. Two PCRs were designed to target the binding domain region, spanning residues N417 through N501 of the Spike protein. Furthermore, very rapid, affordable and straightforward Denaturing High-Performance Liquid Chromatography screening was set up. The screening consisted of mixing the unknown sample with a standard sample of a known sequence, denaturing at high temperature for two minutes, renaturing for 15 minutes followed by a 2-minute run using the WAVE DHPLC system to detect the heteroduplexes which invariably originate whenever the unknown sample has a nucleotide difference with respect to the standard used. The workflow was able to readily detect new variants including the P.1 and the B.1.585 strains at a very affordable cost.

We visually present trends in the stay-at-home proportion by Census region, race, and SES throughout 2020 and conduct regression analyses to examine these patterns. From March to December, the stay-at-home proportion was highest in the Northeast (0.25 in March to 0.35 in December) and lowest in the South (0.24 to 0.30). Across all regions, the stay-at-home proportion was higher in block groups with a higher percentage of Blacks, as Blacks disproportionately live in urban areas where stay-at-home rates were higher (0.009 [CI: 0.008, 0.009]). In the South, West, and Midwest, higher-SES block groups stayed home at the lowest rates pre-pandemic; however, this trend reversed throughout March before converging in the months following.

ABSTRACT Background: The clinical course of COVID-19 critically ill patients, during their admission in the intensive care unit (UCI), including medical and infectious complications and support therapies, as well as their association with in-ICU mortality has not been fully reported. Objective: This study aimed to describe clinical characteristics and clinical course of ICU COVID-19 patients, and to determine risk factors for ICU mortality of COVID-19 patients. Methods: Prospective, multicentre, cohort study that enrolled critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted into 30 ICUs from Spain and Andorra. Consecutive patients from March 12th to May 26th, 2020 were enrolled if they had died or were discharged from ICU during the study period. Demographics, symptoms, vital signs, laboratory markers, supportive therapies, pharmacological treatments, medical and infectious complications were reported and compared between deceased and discharged patients. Results: A total of 663 patients were included. Overall ICU mortality was 31% (203 patients). At ICU admission non-survivors were more hypoxemic [SpO2 with non-rebreather mask, 90 (IQR 83 to 93) vs 91 (IQR 87 to 94); p<0.001] and with higher sequential organ failure assessment score [SOFA, 7 (IQR 5 to 9) vs 4 (IQR 3 to 7); p<0.001]. Complications were more frequent in non-survivors: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (95% vs 89%; p=0.009), acute kidney injury (AKI) (58% vs 24%; p<10-16), shock (42% vs 14%; p<10-13), and arrhythmias (24% vs 11%; p<10-4). Respiratory super-infection, bloodstream infection and septic shock were higher in non-survivors (33% vs 25%; p=0.03, 33% vs 23%; p=0.01 and 15% vs 3%, p=10-7), respectively. The multivariable regression model showed that age was associated with mortality, with every year increasing risk-of-death by 1% (95%CI: 1 to 10, p=0.014). Each 5-point increase in APACHE II independently predicted mortality [OR: 1.508 (1.081, 2.104), p= 0.015].

A total of 51 studies were included in the final review, comprising 56 091 hospitalized ALRI episodes. RESULTS: IV was detected in 3.0% (2.2%-4.0%) of all hospitalized ALRI cases, PIV in 2.7% (1.9%-3.7%), and AV in 5.8% (3.4%-9.1%). CV are technically difficult to culture, and they were detected in 4.8% of all hospitalized ALRI patients in one study. When respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and less common viruses were included, at least one virus was detected in 50.4% (40.0%-60.7%) of all hospitalized severe ALRI episodes. Moreover, 21.9% (17.7%-26.4%) of these viral ALRI were mixed, including more than one viral pathogen.

We limited our analysis to institutions that have implemented at least weekly PCR testing of dormitory-resident undergraduates. Our primary conclusions are that (i) the fraction of students that succumbed to a COVID-19 infection up through Nov 22, 2020 shows no correlation with either the total number of students on campus, or the fractional occupancy of dormitories, (ii) remote instruction vs. hybrid instruction has no significant measurable impact on cumulative infection rate, and (iii) there is evidence that testing 2 or 3 times per week is correlated with lower infection rates than weekly testing. These data are consistent with a hypothesis of students predominantly acquiring infection off-campus, with little community transmission within dormitory housing.

Methods A PubMed literature search (2016-2021) using the keywords, childhood obesity, gender, sex, obesity in youth, obesity in adolescents, COVID-19 and SARS-CoV2 was performed. Results Genetic predisposition, biologically low leptin levels, certain cultural beliefs and socio-economic statuses, as well as exposure to an obesogenic environment were found to have a positive association with childhood obesity. Additionally, the onset of COVID-19 further aggravates the childhood obesity epidemic, increasing childrens susceptibility to obesity and all associated consequential diseases. Discussion A possible key to the control and prevention of the burden of childhood obesity, lies in dealing with its precursors and risk factors. Certain factors, including socio-cultural norms, cultural beliefs and geographical factors are amenable. COVID-19 further challenged these and it is evident that the childhood obesity epidemic is still a critical one.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the usefulness of adding a rapid vulnerability screening to an illness acuity tool to predict mortality in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Large university hospital dedicated to providing COVID-19 care. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included are 1,428 consecutive inpatients aged &#8805;50 years. METHODS: Vulnerability was assessed using the modified version of PRO-AGE score (0-7; higher = worse), a validated and easy-to-administer tool that rates physical impairment, recent hospitalisation, acute mental change, weight loss, and fatigue. The baseline covariates included age, sex, Charlson comorbidity score, and the National Early Warning Score (NEWS), a well-known illness acuity tool. Our outcome was time-to-death within 60 days of admission. RESULTS: The patients had a median age of 66 years, and 58% were male. The incidence of 60-day mortality ranged from 22% to 69% across the quartiles of modified PRO-AGE. In adjusted analysis, compared with modified PRO-AGE scores 0-1 (\\"lowest quartile\\"), the hazard ratios (95% CI) for 60-day mortality for modified PRO-AGE scores 2-3, 4, and 5-7, were 1.4 (1.1-1.9), 2.0 (1.5-2.7), and 2.8 (2.1-3.8), respectively. The modified PRO-AGE predicted different mortality risk levels within each stratum of NEWS and improved the discrimination of mortality prediction models.

In this cross-sectional study, the first 150 consecutive asymptomatic participants at the CRC prevention program who resulted positive to fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and were thus referred to colonoscopy, underwent a psychosomatic assessment including psychiatric diagnoses (DSM-5), psychosomatic syndromes (DCPR-R), psychological distress, psychological well-being and lifestyle behaviors. Whereas only 5.3% of the sample showed at least one DSM-5 diagnosis, 51.3% showed at least one DCPR syndrome, such as allostatic overload, alexithymia, Type A behavior, and demoralization. Patients affected by psychosomatic syndromes presented with significantly higher psychological distress, lower psychological well-being and unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, such as tobacco smoking and unhealthy diet, in comparison with patients without DCPR syndromes. Among endoscopic outcomes, the presence of adenomas was significantly associated with DCPR irritable mood.

Here we present exploratory analyses on asymptomatic infections determined by nucleocapsid (N) seroconversion and time to viral clearance in participants with symptomatic infections determined by N seroconversion (primary data cut, March 5, 2021). METHODS: N seroconversion was assessed at all scheduled and illness visits in the fully vaccinated analysis set (Table). In this analysis, symptomatic infections are defined as N seroconversion  15 days post second dose in participants who attended an illness visit with  1 qualifying COVID-19 symptom and had  1 positive RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2. Asymptomatic infections are defined as N seroconversion  15 days post second dose in participants who did not meet the criteria for symptomatic infections. In participants with symptomatic infections, viral shedding in saliva was assessed for 28 days and cumulative incidence of viral clearance was determined. Table. AZD1222 VE against symptomatic and potentially asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections as determined by N seroconversion [Image: see text] RESULTS: Overall, 358 participants had SARS-CoV-2 infections as determined by N seroconversion (Table).

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease model inducible in susceptible strains of laboratory animals by immunization with protein constituents of myelin. We used myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) peptide 139-151 and its analogues to define motifs to search a protein database for structural homologues of PLP139-151 and identified five peptides derived from microbial Ags that elicit immune responses that cross-react with this self peptide. Exposure of naive SJL mice to the cross-reactive environmental peptides alone was insufficient to induce autoimmune disease even when animals were treated with Ag-nonspecific stimuli (superantigen or LPS). However, immunization of SJL mice with suboptimal doses of PLP139-151 after priming with cross-reactive environmental peptides consistently induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Furthermore, T cell lines from mice immunized with cross-reactive environmental peptides and restimulated in vitro with PLP139-151 could induce disease upon transfer into naive recipients.

MethodsWe performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of remdesivir for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The primary outcome was mortality, stratified by oxygen use (none, supplemental oxygen without mechanical ventilation, and mechanical ventilation). We conducted a frequentist random effects meta-analysis on the risk ratio (RR) scale and, to better contextualize the probabilistic benefits, we also performed a bayesian random effects meta-analysis on the risk difference scale.

Data were compiled from 63,476 adult patients visiting outpatient medicine clinics within a New York-area hospital system between March 1, 2020, and August 28, 2020. The outcome was a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) of a COVID-19 were analyzed using univariable and multivariable Poisson regression with robust standard errors. The prevalence of COVID-19 was higher among these outpatients (3.0%) than in the total population in New York State (2.2%) as of August 28, 2020. Multivariable analysis revealed adjusted prevalence ratios significantly greater than one for male sex (PR=1.10), age 40 to 64 compared to <40 (PR=1.19), and racial/ethnic minorities in comparison to White patients (Hispanic: PR=2.76; Black: PR=1.89; and Asian/others: PR=1.56). Nonetheless, factors including the advanced age of 65 compared to <40 (PR=0.69) and current smoking compared to non-smoking (PR=0.60) were related to significantly lower prevalence.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which initially appeared in China at the end of 2019, exhibits a high infectivity and pathogenicity compared to other coronaviruses. As the viral coat and other viral components are recognized as being foreign by the immune system, this can lead to initial symptoms, which are induced by the very efficiently working immune defense system via the respiratory epithelium. During severe courses a systemically expressed proinflammatory cytokine storm and subsequent changes in the coagulation and complement systems can occur. Virus-specific antibodies, the long-term expression of which is ensured by the formation of B memory cell clones, generate a specific immune response that is also detectable in blood (seroconversion). Specifically effective cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell populations are also formed, which recognize viral epitopes as pathogen-specific patterns in combination with MHC presentation on the cell surface of virus-infected cells and destroy these cells. At the current point in time it is unclear how regular, robust and durable this immune status is constructed. Experiences with other coronavirus infections (SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, MERS) indicate that the immunity could persist for several years. Based on animal experiments, already acquired data on other coronavirus types and plausibility assumptions, it can be assumed that seroconverted patients have an immunity of limited duration and only a very low risk of reinfection.

Population size and FRI rates were monitored over 10 months in the units of 50C90 individuals. Some units were open to the influx of potentially infectious convalescents (hereafter referred to as open units, and some were closed to such an influx (hereafter referred to as closed units). Virologic testing and polymerase chain reaction analysis were used to detect adenovirus on surface structures. Results. The odds ratio (OR) associated with FRI in closed units, compared with open units, was 1.13 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99C1.28). The OR in units with a population greater than the median size, compared with units with a population lower than the median size was 1.38 (95% CI, 1.23C1.55). Between 5% and 9% of surface samples obtained from selected units harbored viable adenovirus. Conclusions. FRI rates were not reduced in units that were closed to potentially contagious individuals. These findings imply that the primary source of the pathogen is likely environmental rather than human, and they underscore what is known about other virus types.

Currently available stent delivery systems make deployment in many locations in the GI tract difficult due to the inability to traverse curves or impossible due to the size requirements of the deployment systems. METHODS A 67-year-old male presented to our hospital with severe gallstone pancreatitis, requiring a prolonged intensive care unit course. Two days after discharge to a rehabilitation facility he developed acute abdominal pain and pneumoperitoneum. Operative exploration failed to identify a perforation. Subsequently, a left-upper-quadrant abscess developed that was drained percutaneously, yielding coliform bacteria. The drain produced several hundred milliliters of stool a day. A barium enema demonstrated a perforation in the descending colon from an old colo-colic anastomosis site. We proposed a novel over-the-scope (OTS) stent deployment method. Utilizing a heat-activated polymer sheath, the stent was affixed to the endoscope. A modified speed-banding attachment was created to permit release of the polymer sheath once endoscopic and fluoroscopic confirmation of the correct position was obtained. RESULTS Utilizing this method of OTS stent deployment, a fully covered 23  155 mm self-expanding metal stent (WallFlex, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) was placed in the colon. Endoscopic and fluoroscopic evaluation following stent placement confirmed stent coverage of the perforation with no ongoing evidence of leak. The patient was discharged to his home state 2 weeks after stent placement in stable condition.

These are generally classified into nastic (internally driven) and tropic (environmentally driven) movements. Nastic movements include circumnutations, a circular movement of plant organs commonly associated with search and exploration, while tropisms refer to the directed growth of plant organs toward or away from environmental stimuli, such as light and gravity. Tracking these movements is therefore fundamental for the study of plant behaviour. Convolutional neural networks, as used for human and animal pose estimation, offer an interesting avenue for plant tracking. Here we adopted the Social LEAP Estimates Animal Poses (SLEAP) framework for plant tracking. We evaluated it on time-lapse videos of cases spanning a variety of parameters, such as: (i) organ types and imaging angles (e.g., top-view crown leaves vs. side-view shoots and roots), (ii) lighting conditions (full spectrum vs. IR), (iii) plant morphologies and scales (100 m-scale Arabidopsis seedlings vs. cm-scale sunflowers and beans), and (iv) movement types (circumnutations, tropisms and twining). RESULTS Overall, we found SLEAP to be accurate in tracking side views of shoots and roots, requiring only a low number of user-labelled frames for training. Top views of plant crowns made up of multiple leaves were found to be more challenging, due to the changing 2D morphology of leaves, and the occlusions of overlapping leaves. This required a larger number of labelled frames, and the choice of labelling \\"skeleton\\" had great impact on prediction accuracy, i.e., a more complex skeleton with fewer individuals (tracking individual plants) provided better results than a simpler skeleton with more individuals (tracking individual leaves).

METHOD: Psychological resilience, depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms of 1,770 Chinese citizens were investigated during the epidemic peak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (23rd February 2020 to 2nd March 2020). The analyses were done through the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) scale. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms was found to be 47.1%, 31.9%, 45.9%, respectively, among all participants. From them, 18.2% showed moderate to severe symptoms of depression, 8.8% showed moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, and 16.6% showed moderate to severe symptoms of somatization. Psychological resilience was negatively correlated with depression (standardized B = -0.490, P<0.001), anxiety (standardized B = -0.443, P<0.001), and somatization symptom scores (standardized B = -0.358, P<0.001), while controlling for confounding factors. Analysis of the three-factor resilience structure showed that strength and tenacity were correlated with depression (standardized B = -0.256, P<0.001; standardized B = -0.217, P<0.001), anxiety (standardized B = -0.268, P<0.001; standardized B = -0.147, P<0.001), and somatization symptoms (standardized B = -0.236, P<0.001, standardized B = -0.126, P<0.01).

The interdisciplinary national student Global Health Network therefore initiated an online lecture series. Global Health - perspectives, opportunities and challenges included 14 lectures on a range of topics held by German and international academics from October 2020 to January 2021. Methods Evaluations were performed prior to, at midterm and after the series, including 5-point likert scales and open questions. Using quantitative and qualitative approaches, participants' motivation and learning outcomes of global health education were analysed. Results A total of 1393 students registered for the series. Individual lectures attracted on average 400 participants, mainly female medical students between 20-25 years, but also a variety of ages, genders and disciplines. Main reasons for participation included interest in COVID-19-related developments, learning about global health-specific topics, and professional development. More than 40% of participants reported to know little about global health before attending;after the lecture series, only 10% made this statement. In addition, 90% of participants perceived an increase of motivation to learn more about the topics, while about 40% gained motivation to become practically involved in the field. The lecture series was accredited in the curriculum at some universities, thus innovating the curriculum and enabling formal credits. Conclusions The new model of student-led online teaching proved to be feasible and demonstrated students' interest and positive impact on global health knowledge. Further institutional change and inclusion of global health in the curricula have to follow. Key messages Students need global health education to respond to global health-related challenges. Volunteer student-led initiatives can increase knowledge and interest and be an important driver for change towards improving global health education.","output":"Global health from home - results from a German student-led online lecture series during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Epithelial cells are the first host cells to be infected by incoming coronaviruses.

All (+)RNA viruses remodel intracellular membranes into unique structures for viral genome replication. Accumulating evidence suggests that picornaviruses from different genera use different strategies to generate viral replication organelles (ROs). For instance, enteroviruses (e.g. poliovirus, coxsackievirus, rhinovirus) rely on the Golgi-localized phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III beta (PI4KB), while cardioviruses replicate independently of the kinase. By which mechanisms cardioviruses develop their ROs is currently unknown. Here we show that cardioviruses manipulate another PI4K, namely the ER-localized phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III alpha (PI4KA), to generate PI4P-enriched ROs. By siRNA-mediated knockdown and pharmacological inhibition, we demonstrate that PI4KA is an essential host factor for EMCV genome replication. We reveal that the EMCV nonstructural protein 3A interacts with and is responsible for PI4KA recruitment to viral ROs. The ensuing phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) proved important for the recruitment of oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP), which delivers cholesterol to EMCV ROs in a PI4P-dependent manner. PI4P lipids and cholesterol are shown to be required for the global organization of the ROs and for viral genome replication. Consistently, inhibition of OSBP expression or function efficiently blocked EMCV RNA replication. In conclusion, we describe for the first time a cellular pathway involved in the biogenesis of cardiovirus ROs. Remarkably, the same pathway was reported to promote formation of the replication sites of hepatitis C virus, a member of the Flaviviridae family, but not other picornaviruses or flaviviruses. Thus, our results highlight the convergent recruitment by distantly related (+)RNA viruses of a host lipid-modifying pathway underlying formation of viral replication sites.","output":"Modulation of the Host Lipid Landscape to Promote RNA Virus Replication: The Picornavirus Encephalomyocarditis Virus Converges on the Pathway Used by Hepatitis C Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Os coronavrus s?o um grupo de vrus de RNA altamente diversificados, da famlia Coronaviridae, divididos em quatro gneros: alfa, beta, gama e delta, que causam doen?as leves a graves em seres humanos e animais H coronavrus humanos endmicos, como os alfacoronavrus 229E e NL63 os betacoronavrus OC43 e HKU1, que causam sndrome gripal ou pneumonia em seres humanos No entanto, j surgiram dois coronavrus zoonticos causadores de doen?a grave em seres humanos: o coronavrus causador da sndrome respiratria aguda grave (SARS-CoV) de 2002-2003 e o coronavrus causador da sndrome respiratria do Oriente Mdio (MERS-CoV) Em janeiro de 2020, o agente etiolgico responsvel por um cluster de casos de pneumonia grave em Wuhan, China, foi identificado como sendo um novo betacoronavrus, diferente do SARS-CoV e do MERS-CoV (6) Em 11 de fevereiro de 2020, o International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [Comit Internacional de Taxonomia Viral] anunciou que o vrus havia sido nomeado coronavrus da sndrome respiratria aguda grave 2 (SARS-CoV-2) e, no mesmo dia, a OMS nomeou a doen?a como doen?a do novo coronavrus, COVID-19 (8) Para fins de comunicao, vamos nos referir ao vrus como vrus causador da COVID-19 ou vrus da COVID-19 As sequncias gen?micas completas do vrus da COVID-19 j foram divulgadas e diferentes protocolos de deteco molecular j foram desenvolvidos Considerando-se a circulao atual da COVID-19 na regi?o das Amricas, a Organizao Pan-Americana da Sade / Organizao Mundial da Sade (OPAS/OMS) recomenda aos Estados Membros que assegurem a identificao rpida de casos suspeitos, coleta e envio de amostras aos laboratrios de referncia, e implementao de protocolos de deteco molecular, de acordo com a capacidade laboratorial Em 19 de mar?o de 2020, a OMS atualizou sua orientao provisria sobre testes laboratoriais para a doen?a do novo coronavrus (COVID-19) em casos suspeitos em seres humanos, incluindo informaes sobre coleta e envio de amostras, testes laboratoriais e notificao de casos e resultados de testes A OMS tambm atualiza as definies de casos suspeitos de COVID-19, conforme necessrio","output":"Diretrizes laboratoriais para deteco e diagnstico de infeco pelo vrus da COVID-19. 8 de julho de 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the development of autonomous driving technologies, robo-taxis (shared autonomous vehicles) are being tested on real roads.

To investigate introduction and understand the early transmission dynamics of the virus, we formed the South African Network for Genomics Surveillance of COVID (SANGS_COVID), a network of ten government and university laboratories. Here, we present the first results of this effort, which is a molecular epidemiological study of the first twenty-one SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes sampled in the first port of entry, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), during the first month of the epidemic. By combining this with calculations of the effective reproduction number (R), we aim to shed light on the patterns of infections that define the epidemic in South Africa. METHODS: R was calculated using positive cases and deaths from reports provided by the four major provinces. Molecular epidemiology investigation involved sequencing viral genomes from patients in KZN using ARCTIC protocols and assembling whole genomes using meticulous alignment methods. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian trees, lineage classification and molecular clock calculations. FINDINGS: The epidemic in South Africa has been very heterogeneous. Two of the largest provinces, Gauteng, home of the two large metropolis Johannesburg and Pretoria, and KwaZulu-Natal, home of the third largest city in the country Durban, had a slow growth rate on the number of detected cases. Whereas, Western Cape, home of Cape Town, and the Eastern Cape provinces the epidemic is spreading fast. Our estimates of transmission potential for South Africa suggest a decreasing transmission potential towards R=1 since the first cases and deaths have been reported. However, between 06 May and 18 May 2020, we estimate that R was on average 1.39 (1.04 C 2.15, 95% CI). We also demonstrate that early transmission in KZN, and most probably in all main regions of SA, was associated with multiple international introductions and dominated by lineages B1 and B. The study also provides evidence for locally acquired infections in a hospital in Durban within the first month of the epidemic, which inflated early mortality in KZN. INTERPRETATION: This first report of SANGS_COVID consortium focuses on understanding the epidemic heterogeneity and introduction of SARS-CoV-2 strains in the first month of the epidemic in South Africa. The early introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in KZN included caused a localized outbreak in a hospital, provides potential explanations for the initially high death rates in the province. The current high rate of transmission of COVID-19 in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape highlights the crucial need to strength local genomic surveillance in South Africa.

Similarly, histone deacetylation represses transcription of genes responsible for cell differentiation/death. A previous clinical study suggested potential pharmacodynamic antagonism between histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and DNA hypomethylating agents (HMA). Herein, to determine such antagonism, we used MDS/AML lines and NHD13 transgenic mice, and demonstrated that treatment with the pan-HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) significantly decreased TET2 expression and global 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels. Mechanistically, our RNAi screen revealed that HDAC4 was responsible for maintaining TET2 levels. Accordingly, HDAC4 knockout reduced expression levels of MTSS1, a known TET2 target, an event associated with decreased 5hmC enrichment on the MTSS1 enhancer. Retrospective analysis of GEO datasets demonstrated that lower HDAC4 levels predict worse prognosis for AML patients. In an MDS-L xenografted immunodeficient mouse model, vitamin C co-treatment prevented TET2 loss of activity seen following SAHA treatment. Accordingly, vitamin C co-treatment further reduced MDS-L cell engraftment relative to SAHA alone. In summary, our findings suggest that co-administration of a TET2 agonist with pan-HDACi treatment could effectively counter potential diminution in TET2 activity resulting from pan-HDACi treatment alone, providing a rationale for evaluating such combinations against high-risk MDS/AML.","output":"HDAC4 inhibition disrupts TET2 function in high-risk MDS and AML."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the first measures to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic was the confinement of the society and, consequently, the impossibility of providing presence-based training For this reason, the faculty had to change the training to a completely online model, in a very short period of time and without the possibility of planning the process of change The COVID-19 remains in our lives and continues to affect the training model Currently, there are teachers using online training, face-to-face classes and there are even dual models where the faculty teaches both presence-based and online classes at the same time For this reason, there is a need for training methods capable of adapting to different situations In this work the Flipped Classroom model (a method used in face-to-face classes to make students more active) has been adapted to a hybrid model which can be implemented in any situation at any time The model was applied during confinement in programming laboratories and the impact of this model has been measured through the works generated by students during the continuous evaluation The result has been highly positive because the number of works presented by students the generated academic doubts have increased, as well as the average grades obtained during the continuous evaluation ? 2020 ACM","output":"Hybrid Flipped Classroom: Adaptation to the COVID situation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 belong to the subfamily Coronaviridae and infect humans, they are constituted by four structural proteins: Spike glycoprotein (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N), and nonstructural proteins, such as Nsp15 protein which is exclusively present on nidoviruses and is absent in other RNA viruses, making it an ideal target in the field of drug design.

Cellular communication takes place within the tumor microenvironment, both via cell to cell contact, and through extracellular mechanisms such as exosomal signaling. Exosomes are very small membrane-bound vesicles that have been shown to play key roles in the progression of cancer including modulation of the tumor microenvironment through the induction of angiogenesis, the transfer of genetic information that confers drug resistance, and increased cell migration, invasion, proliferation, and survival, as well as the modulation of immune cell interactions.

However, it is possible that social relationships might have a protective effect. In the present study, we examine how the COVID-19 pandemic affected older adults well-being and loneliness, and the role of structural and functional characteristics of social relationships. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We use data from 99 older adults in Switzerland who participated (a) in a three-week micro-longitudinal study on social relationships and well-being in 2019 and (b) in a weekly online survey during four weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown. RESULTS: Our findings show that the global pandemic had substantial adverse effects on older adults emotional well-being and loneliness. In addition, aspects of social relationships were related to loneliness both before and during the pandemic. Only one functional feature of social relationships (satisfaction with communication during the pandemic) buffered adverse effects of the major stressful event. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Although the social distancing measures during COVID-19 presented a major stressor for older adults well-being and loneliness, being able to maintain social communication to a satisfactory level during that time reduced this effect. Therefore, enabling older adults to stay in touch with their social circle based on their personal preferences might reduce the impact that any future lockdown might have on their well-being.","output":"Well-Being and Loneliness in Swiss Older Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Social Relationships"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID19 pandemic has caused a mental health crisis worldwide, which may have different age-specific impacts, partly due to age-related differences in resilience and coping. The purposes of this study were to 1) identify the disparities in mental distress, perceived adversities, resilience, and coping during the COVID-19 pandemic among four age groups (18C34, 35C49, 50C64, and 65+);2) assess the age-moderated time effect on mental distress, and 3) estimate the effects of perceived adversities on mental distress as moderated by age, resilience and coping. Methods Data were drawn from a longitudinal survey of a nationally representative sample (n = 7830) administered during the pandemic. Weighted mean of mental distress and adversities (perceived loneliness, perceived stress, and perceived risk), resilience, and coping were compared among different age groups. Hierarchical random-effects models were used to assess the moderated effects of adversities on mental distress. Results The youngest age group (18C34) reported the highest mental distress at baseline with the mean (standard error) as 2.70 (0.12), which showed an incremental improvement with age (2.27 (0.10), 1.88 (0.08), 1.29 (0.07) for 35C49, 50C64, and 65 groups respectively). The older age groups reported lower levels of loneliness and perceived stress, higher perceived risk, greater resilience, and more relaxation coping (ps < .001). Model results showed that mental distress declined over time, and the downward trend was moderated by age group. Perceived adversities, alcohol, and social coping were positively associated with mental distress, whereas resilience and relaxation were negatively associated with it. Resilience and age group moderated the slope of each adversity on mental distress. Conclusions The youngest age group appeared to be most vulnerable during the pandemic. Mental health interventions may provide training to build resilience from everyday adversities for the vulnerable individuals and empower them to achieve personal growth that challenges age boundaries.","output":"Age disparities in mental health during the COVID19 pandemic: The roles of resilience and coping"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global emerging infectious disease. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the initial clinical characteristics of COVID-19 suspected and confirmed patients on admission in order to find out which kinds may be more likely to get positive nucleic acid testing results, and to explore the risk factors associated with all-cause death. METHODS: Medical records from 309 highly suspected cases with pneumonia were collected from February 13, 2020, to March 14, 2020, in a COVID-19-designated hospital of Wuhan. The majority of the clinical data were collected on the first day of hospital admission. RESULTS: Of 309 patients with median age 64 years (interquartile ranges [IQR], 53-72 years), 111 patients (35.9%) were confirmed by nucleic acid testing (median age 64 years, IQR: 56-71 years; 48 males). Of those 111 patients, 13 (11.7%) patients died. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with positive testing included fatigue (odds ratios [OR] = 3.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.88-5.24, p < 0.001), cough (OR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.32-0.95, p = 0.032), no less than 1 comorbidity (OR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.06-2.98, p = 0.030), and severe pneumonia (OR = 2.67; 95% CI: 1.20-5.97, p = 0.016). Furthermore, age, dyspnea, noneffective antibiotic treatment, white blood cell, lymphocyte, platelets, and organ dysfunction (e.g., higher lactate dehydrogenase) were significantly associated with all-cause in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Patients with severe forms of this disease were more likely to get positive results.

This resource was mined to identify emerging mutations and trends in mutations as the outbreak progressed over time. Information on transmission dynamics, prevalence, and persistence of intra-host mutants, and the position of a mutation on a protein were then used to prioritize 544 reported mutations based on their ability to impact ZIKV phenotype. Using this criteria, six mutants (representing naturally occurring mutations) were generated as synthetic infectious clones using a 2015 Puerto Rican epidemic strain PRVABC59 as the parental backbone. The phenotypes of these naturally occurring variants were examined using both cell culture and murine model systems. Mutants had distinct phenotypes, including changes in replication rate, embryo death, and decreased head size. In particular, a NS2B mutant previously detected during in vivo studies in rhesus macaques was found to cause lethal infections in adult mice, abortions in pregnant females, and increased viral genome copies in both brain tissue and blood of female mice. Additionally, mutants with changes in the region of NS3 that interfaces with NS5 during replication displayed reduced replication in the blood of adult mice. This analytical pathway, integrating both bioinformatic and wet lab experiments, provides a foundation for understanding how naturally occurring single mutations affect disease outcome and can be used to predict the of severity of future ZIKV outbreaks. To determine if naturally occurring individual mutations in the Zika virus epidemic genotype affect viral virulence or replication rate in vitro or in vivo, we generated an infectious clone representing the epidemic genotype of stain Puerto Rico, 2015. Using this clone, six mutants were created by changing nucleotides in the genome to cause one to two amino acid substitutions in the encoded proteins. The six mutants we generated represent mutations that differentiated the early epidemic genotype from genotypes that were either ancestral or that occurred later in the epidemic. We assayed each mutant for changes in growth rate, and for virulence in adult mice and pregnant mice. Three of the mutants caused catastrophic embryo effects including increased embryonic death or significant decrease in head diameter. Three other mutants that had mutations in a genome region associated with replication resulted in changes in in vitro and in vivo replication rates. These results illustrate the potential impact of individual mutations in viral phenotype.","output":"Single Amino Acid Mutations Affect Zika Virus Replication In Vitro and Virulence In Vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19, all regions of China have carried out prompt responsive actions in an active way to control and prevent the disease, among which rural areas face particularly severe challenges, because they are the weak link in the control and prevention of public health emergencies due to shortage of health resources and poor diagnostic and therapeutic level According to characteristics and the actual situation of the current rural primary healthcare settings, this guidedance introduced the requirements of setting environmental space for epidemic prevention and control, the process of referral, home observation, persons with special health care, health education for villagers, personal protection for health staff, and nosocomial infection control It would provide a standardized and safe way for primary healthcare settings in rural areas in the epidemic prevention and control Copyright ? 2020 by the Chinese General Practice","output":"Guidance on the Control and Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Primary Healthcare Settings in Rural China(First Edition)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum (viremia) of COVID-19 patients has been related to poor prognosis and death.

Here we introduce a novel, automated, custom-designed device for measuring the volume and pressure response of lungs, surpassing the capabilities of traditional machines and built to range size-scales to accommodate both murine and porcine tests. The software-controlled system is capable of constructing standardized continuous volume-pressure curves, while accounting for air compressibility, yielding consistent and reproducible measures while eliminating the need for pulmonary degassing. This device uses volume-control to enable viscoelastic whole lung macromechanical insights from rate dependencies and pressure-time curves. Moreover, the conceptual design of this device facilitates studies relating the phenomenon of diaphragm breathing and artificial ventilation induced by pushing air inside the lungs. System capabilities are demonstrated and validated via a comparative study between ex vivo murine lungs and elastic balloons, using various testing protocols. Volume-pressure curve comparisons with previous pressure-controlled systems yield good agreement, confirming accuracy. This work expands the capabilities of current lung experiments, improving scientific investigations of healthy and diseased pulmonary biomechanics. Ultimately, the methodologies demonstrated in the manufacturing of this system enable future studies centered on investigating viscoelasticity as a potential biomarker and improvements to patient ventilators based on direct assessment and comparisons of positive- and negative-pressure mechanics.","output":"Introducing a Custom-Designed Volume-Pressure Machine for Novel Measurements of Whole Lung Organ Viscoelasticity and Direct Comparisons Between Positive- and Negative-Pressure Ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic has revolutionized medical education with a rapid shift to online teaching and learning strategies.

However, daratumumab is a costly treatment and is administered indefinitely until disease progression. Therefore, it is unclear whether it is cost-effective to use daratumumab in the first-line setting compared with reserving its use until later lines of therapy. METHODS We created a Markov model to compare healthcare costs and clinical outcomes of transplant-ineligible patients treated with daratumumab in the first-line setting compared with a strategy of reserving daratumumab until the second-line. We estimated transition probabilities from randomized trials using parametric survival modeling. Lifetime direct healthcare costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for first-line daratumumab versus second-line daratumumab from a US payer perspective. RESULTS First-line daratumumab was associated with an improvement of 0.52 QALYs and 0.66 discounted life-years compared with second-line daratumumab. While both treatment strategies were associated with considerable lifetime expenditures ($1,434,937 v $1,112,101 in US dollars), an incremental cost of $322,836 for first-line daratumumab led to an ICER of $618,018 per QALY. The cost of daratumumab would need to be decreased by 67% for first-line daratumumab to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000 per QALY. CONCLUSION Using daratumumab in the first-line setting for transplant-ineligible patients may not be cost-effective under current pricing. Delaying daratumumab until subsequent lines of therapy may be a reasonable strategy to limit healthcare costs without significantly compromising clinical outcomes. Mature overall survival data are necessary to more fully evaluate cost-effectiveness in this setting.","output":"Cost-Effectiveness of First-Line Versus Second-Line Use of Daratumumab in Older, Transplant-Ineligible Patients With Multiple Myeloma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Malaria is an ancient infectious disease that threatens millions of lives globally even today.

METHODS: An online anonymous survey was conducted between 30 January and 3 February, 2020. The survey included two self-administered questionnaires: one collected personal information (gender, age, education background), current location, recent epidemic area contact history, the classification of population, and subjective sleep quality; the other was the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). RESULTS: A total of 2091 Chinese participated in the current study. The prevalence of PTSD among the Chinese public one month after the COVID-19 outbreak was 4.6%. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that gender (p < 0.001), epidemic area contact history (p = 0.047), classification of population (p < 0.001), and subjective sleep quality (p < 0.001) could be regarded as predictors for PTSD. LIMITATIONS: First, the majority of participants in this study were the general public, with confirmed or suspected patients being a small part. Second, the measurement of PTSD in this study might be vulnerable to selection bias because of an online self-report study, such as participants' recruitment. Third, the prevalence of PTSD in this study was estimated by an online questionnaire rather than a clinical interview.

In multivariable models, each unit increase in social distancing was associated with a 26% decrease (p < 0.0001) in COVID-19 incidence and a 31% decrease (p < 0.0001) in COVID-19 mortality. Percent crowding, minority population, and median household income were all statistically significant effect modifiers. County-level increases in social distancing led to reductions in COVID-19 incidence and mortality but were most effective in counties with lower percentages of black residents, higher median household incomes, and with lower levels of household crowding.","output":"Social Distancing Associations with COVID-19 Infection and Mortality Are Modified by Crowding and Socioeconomic Status"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This exploratory study examined the extent to which coping, resilience, experiences of subtle and blatant racism, and ethnic identity predicted stress-related growth in a national convenience sample of Asians and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs;N = 326) who experienced COVID-19-related racial discrimination.

In this report, we show that a SEIR model that properly accounts for the distribution of the incubation period suggests that R0 lie in the range 4.4 - 11.7. This estimate is based on the doubling time observed in the near-exponential phases of the epidemic spread in China, United States, and six European countries.

The current immunity level $hat i$ in a region is closely related to the cumulative fraction infected, which primarily depends on two factors: a) the initial potential for COVID-19 in the region (often quantified by the basic reproduction number $R_0$), and b) the timing, amount and effectiveness of preventive measures put in place. By means of a mathematical model including heterogeneities owing to age, social activity and susceptibility, and allowing for time-varying preventive measures, the risk for a new epidemic wave and its doubling time, and how they depend on $R_0$, $hat i$ and the overall effect of the current preventive measures, are investigated. Focus lies on quantifying the minimal overall effect of preventive measures $p_{Min}$ needed to prevent a future outbreak. The first result shows that the current immunity level $hat i$ plays a more influential roll than when immunity is obtained from vaccination. Secondly, by comparing regions with different $R_0$ and $hat i$ it is shown that regions with lower $R_0$ and low $hat i$ may now need higher preventive measures ($p_{Min}$) compared with other regions having higher $R_0$ but also higher $hat i$, even when such immunity levels are far from herd immunity.","output":"The risk for a new COVID-19 wave -- and how it depends on $R_0$, the current immunity level and current restrictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Unenhanced chest computed tomography (CT) can assist in the diagnosis and classification of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), complementing to the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests; the performance of which has yet to be validated in emergency department (ED) setting. The study sought to evaluate the diagnostic performance of chest CT in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 in ED. METHODS: This retrospective single-center study included 155 patients in ED who underwent both RT-PCR and chest CT for suspected COVID-19 from March 1st to April 1st, 2020. The clinical information, CT images and laboratory reports were reviewed and the performance of CT was assessed, using the RT-PCR as standard reference. Moreover, an adjudication committee retrospectively rated the probability of COVID-19 before and after the CT calculating the net reclassification improvement (NRI). Their final diagnosis was considered as reference. The proportion of patients with negative RT-PCR test that was directed to the referent hospital based on positive CT findings was also assessed. RESULTS: Among 155 patients, 42% had positive RT-PCR results, and 46% had positive CT findings. Chest CT showed a sensitivity of 84.6%, a specificity of 80.0% and a diagnostic accuracy of 81.9% in suggesting COVID-19 with RT-PCR as reference. Concurrently, corresponding values of 89.4%, 84.3% and 86.5% were retrieved with the adjudication committee diagnosis as reference. For the subgroup of patients with age > 65, specificity and sensitivity were 50% and 80.8%, respectively. In patients with negative RT-PCR results, 20% (18/90) had positive chest CT finding and 22% (4/18) of those were eventually considered as COVID-19 positive according to the adjudication committee. After CT, the estimated probability of COVID-19 changed in 10/104 (11%) patients with available data: 4 (4%) were downgraded, 6 (6%) upgraded. The NRI was 1.92% (NRI event -2.08% + NRI non-event 5.36%). No patient with negative RT-PCR but positive CT was eventually directed to hospital. CONCLUSION: Chest CT showed promising sensitivity for diagnosing COVID-19 across all patients' subgroups. However, CT did not modify the estimated probability of COVID-19 infection in a substantial proportion of patients and its utility as an emergency department triage tool warrants further analyses.","output":"Unenhanced computed tomography (CT) utility for triage at the emergency department during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conducting population-based serosurveillance for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) will estimate and monitor the trend of infection in the adult general population, determine the socio-demographic risk factors and delineate the geographical spread of the infection.

Almost all known cases of COVID-19-associated glomerulonephritis have been in patients of African descent, with G1 or G2 apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk alleles, and they presented collapsing type of FSGS. CASE REPORT: We report a case of biopsy-confirmed non-collapsing FSGS with secondary acute interstitial nephritis and AKI in a young White man with APOL1 low-risk genotype, who had COVID-19 pneumonia. His past history included arterial hypertension, anabolic steroids, and high-protein diet. He fully recovered from type 1 respiratory failure and AKI after transfusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma and intravenous treatment with dexamethasone administered for 16 days in a dose reduced from 16 to 2 mg/day. Due to progressing severe nephrotic proteinuria (22.6 g/24 h), intravenous methylprednisolone was administered (1500 mg divided in 3 pulses over 3 days) immediately followed by oral prednisone (0.6 mg/kg body weight), with dose reduced 19 weeks later and switched to cyclosporine A (4 mg/kg body weight). Kidney re-biopsy, at that time, showed a decrease in proportion of glomeruli affected with podocytopathy, but progression of interstitial lesions. After 23 weeks of therapy, partial remission of FSGS was attained and proteinuria dropped to 3.6 g/24 h. After 43 weeks, proteinuria decreased to 0.4 g/24 h and the serum creatinine concentration remained steady. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose glucocorticoid therapy was effective in the initial treatment of COVID-19-related non-collapsing FSGS, but had no effect on interstitial changes.

It is spread from human to human and has resulted in a global pandemic, posing a disastrous public health risk worldwide. Patients with chronic kidney disease, especially those on dialysis, are considered to be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 due to their immunocompromised status and frail condition. The home treatment setting of peritoneal dialysis (PD) has advantages in terms of implementing self-care when routine hospital visits and social activities are restricted, thus greatly reducing exposure of PD patients to the virus. Methods and Results: We outline general operational considerations in PD management during the COVID-19 pandemic, including precautionary measures for PD patients and healthcare staff. Precautionary measures for PD patients include education on prevention of, and screening for, COVID-19, preclinic screening, in-clinic management, meticulous remote patient management and special hospitalization arrangements. The diagnosis and treatment of PD patients with COVID-19 are discussed. Precautionary measures for PD staff include continuous education on, and training in, COVID-19, exposure history surveillance and self-monitoring for COVID-19 among healthcare personnel, appropriate personal protective equipment and hand hygiene, organization of medical activities and staffing, and adequate environment cleaning.

METHODS: A multicenter, descriptive survey design was used. All the AIEOP centers were invited to complete an on-line survey. Data collection was performed between March 15, 2020 and April 15, 2020. RESULTS: Thirty six out of 48 centers responded to the survey. All the centers implemented similar preventive measures in order to control the COVID-19 spread and 77.8% of centers have created structured pathways, specific protocols or procedures; 30% of centers reduced the number of inpatient beds and 90% outpatient activity. The prevalence data collected report 14 children positive and 35 healthcare professionals positive. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 is not spreading homogeneously in Italy and children are less infected. It will be necessary to define new processes and new strategies to ensure safety and continuity of care to children affected by cancer, even in the future, when the lockdown will end, and new measures will be implemented.","output":"[Management of the Covid-19 epidemic in Italian Pediatric Hematology and Oncology centers: a nurse-led AIEOP national survey]./ Gestione dell'epidemia Covid19 nei centri di oncoematologia pediatrica Italiani: survey nazionale AIEOP condotta da infermieri"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether patterns of work during COVID-19 pandemic altered by effort to contain the outbreak affected anxiety and depression.

SLs can exist mainly in an acidic and a lactonic form, both of which display inhibitory activity. Given the amphipathic nature of SLs it is feasible that these antimicrobial actions are the result of the perturbation of the physicochemical properties of targeted membranes. Thus, in this work we have carried out a biophysical study to unveil the molecular details of the interaction of an acidic SL with a model phospholipid membrane made of 1,2-dipalmitoy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC). Using differential scanning calorimetry it was found that SL altered the phase behaviour of DPPC at low molar fractions, producing fluid phase immiscibility with the result of formation of biosurfactant-enriched domains within the phospholipid bilayer. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed that SL interacted with DPPC increasing ordering of the phospholipid acyl chain palisade and hydration of the lipid/water interface. Small angle X-ray scattering showed that SL did not modify bilayer thickness in the biologically relevant L fluid phase. SL was found to induce contents leakage in 1-palmitoy-2-oleoy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) unilamellar liposomes, at sublytic concentrations below the cmc. This SL-induced membrane permeabilization at concentrations below the onset for membrane solubilization can be the result of the formation of laterally segregated domains, which might contribute to provide a molecular basis for the reported antimicrobial actions of SLs.","output":"Interaction of an acidic sophorolipid biosurfactant with phosphatidylcholine model membranes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly affected people at the end of life who are being cared for in community settings, as well as their families and the nurses who provide care.

Here, we evaluated the influence of aging metrics PhenoAge and PhenoAgeAccel to predict adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Furthermore, we sought to model adaptive metabolic and inflammatory responses to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection using individual PhenoAge components. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we assessed cases admitted to a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City. PhenoAge and PhenoAgeAccel were estimated using laboratory values at admission. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to estimate risk for COVID-19 lethality and adverse outcomes (ICU admission, intubation, or death). To explore reproducible patterns which model adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used k-means clustering using PhenoAge components. RESULTS: We included 1068 subjects of whom 222 presented critical illness and 218 died. PhenoAge was a better predictor of adverse outcomes and lethality compared to CA and SpO(2) and its predictive capacity was sustained for all age groups. Patients with responses associated to PhenoAgeAccel>0 had higher risk of death and critical illness compared to those with lower values (log-rank p<0.001). Using unsupervised clustering we identified four adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection: 1) Inflammaging associated with CA, 2) metabolic dysfunction associated with cardio-metabolic comorbidities, 3) unfavorable hematological response, and 4) response associated with favorable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptive responses related to accelerated aging metrics are linked to adverse COVID-19 outcomes and have unique and distinguishable features.

The von Neumann entropy of the graph of bonds is used to determine the influence of the cluster shape on the kinetic barrier. Numerical studies were carried out to assess the dependence of the barrier on the size of the cluster.

It can also significantly affect the results of phylogenetic analyses and the inference of evolutionary rates. The detection of recombination from samples of sequencing data is a very challenging problem and is further complicated for SARS-CoV-2 by its relatively slow accumulation of genetic diversity. The extent to which recombination is ongoing for SARS-CoV-2 is not yet resolved. To address this, we use a parsimony-based method to reconstruct possible genealogical histories for samples of SARS-CoV-2 sequences, which enables us to pinpoint specific recombination events that could have generated the data. We propose a statistical framework for disentangling the effects of recurrent mutation from recombination in the history of a sample, and hence provide a way of estimating the probability that ongoing recombination is present. We apply this to samples of sequencing data collected in England and South Africa and find evidence of ongoing recombination.","output":"Ongoing Recombination in SARS-CoV-2 Revealed through Genealogical Reconstruction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glomerulo-podocytic communication plays an important role in the podocytic injury in IgA nephropathy (IgAN). In this study, we examine the role of podocytic angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (AT1R) and prorenin receptor (PRR) in podocytic apoptosis in IgAN. Polymeric IgA (pIgA) was isolated from patients with IgAN and healthy controls. Conditioned media were prepared from growth arrested human mesangial cells (HMC) incubated with pIgA from patients with IgAN (IgA-HMC media) or healthy controls (Ctl-HMC media). A human podocyte cell line was used as a model to examine the regulation of the expression of AT1R, PRR, TNF- and CTGF by IgA-HMC media. Podocytic nephrin expression, annexin V binding and caspase 3 activity were used as the functional readout of podocytic apoptosis. IgA-HMC media had no effect on AngII release by podocytes. IgA-HMC media significantly up-regulated the expression of AT1R and PRR, down-regulated nephrin expression and induced apoptosis in podocytes. Mono-blockade of AT1R, PRR, TNF- or CTGF partially reduced podocytic apoptosis. IgA-HMC media activated NFB, notch1 and HEY1 expression by podocytes and dual blockade of AT1R with PRR, or anti-TNF- with anti-CTGF, effectively rescued the podocytic apoptosis induced by IgA-HMC media. Our data suggests that pIgA-activated HMC up-regulates the expression of AT1R and PRR expression by podocytes and the associated activation of NFB and notch signalling pathways play an essential role in the podocytic apoptosis induced by glomerulo-podocytic communication in IgAN. Simultaneously targeting the AT1R and PRR could be a potential therapeutic option to reduce the podocytic injury in IgAN.

While emerging evidence hints toward prior exposure to common-cold human coronaviruses (HCoV), the extent of- and conditions for-cross-protective immunity between SARS-CoV-2 and HCoVs remain open. Here, by leveraging a comprehensive pool of publicly available functionally evaluated SARS-CoV-2 peptides, we report 126 immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 peptides with high sequence similarity to 285 MHC-presented target peptides from at least one of four HCoV, thus providing a map describing the landscape of SARS-CoV-2 shared and private immunogenic peptides with functionally validated T cell responses. Using this map, we show that while SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic peptides in general exhibit higher level of dissimilarity to both self-proteome and -microbiomes, there exist several SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic peptides with high similarity to various human protein coding genes, some of which have been reported to have elevated expression in severe COVID-19 patients. We then combine our map with a SARS-CoV-2-specific TCR repertoire data from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls and show that whereas the public repertoire for the majority of convalescent patients are dominated by TCRs cognate to private SARS-CoV-2 peptides, for a subset of patients, more than 50% of their public repertoires that show reactivity to SARS-CoV-2, consist of TCRs cognate to shared SARS-CoV-2-HCoV peptides. Further analyses suggest that the skewed distribution of TCRs cognate to shared and private peptides in COVID-19 patients is likely to be HLA-dependent. Finally, by utilising the global prevalence of HLA alleles, we provide 10 peptides with known cognate TCRs that are conserved across SARS-CoV-2 and multiple human coronaviruses and are predicted to be recognised by a high proportion of the global population. Overall, our work indicates the potential for HCoV-SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD8+ T cells, which is likely dependent on differences in HLA-coding genes among individuals.

METHODS (165)Ho-MSNs were prepared using (165)Ho-acetylacetonate and MCM-41 silica particles, and stability was determined after irradiation in a nuclear reactor (reactor power, 1 MW; thermal neutron flux of approximately 5.5  10(12) neutrons/cm(2)s). SPECT/CT and tissue biodistribution studies were performed after intraperitoneal administration of (166)Ho-MSNs to SKOV-3 ovarian tumor-bearing mice. Radiotherapeutic efficacy was studied by using PET/CT with (18)F-FDG to determine tumor volume and by monitoring survival. RESULTS The holmium-MSNs were able to withstand long irradiation times in a nuclear reactor and did not release (166)Ho after significant dilution.

BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease is not yet well understood. The orbit provides a window into the body's microvasculature, and as such, it is a non-invasive opportunity to analyse the systemic circulation in vivo. By analysing the current literature, we test the hypothesis that non-invasive imaging of the retina could provide insight into the effect of COVID-19 on the retinal microvasculature. METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we screened PubMed databases and LitCOVID19 using the search criteria: (OCTA or Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography) AND (COVID-19 or corona or SARS-CoV-2) AND (retina or fundus). Databases were searched on 11 January 2022. The primary study outcomes were studies that utilised OCTA to analyse the retina; secondary outcomes involved studies that involved other imaging modalities such as OCT, fundus photography, and fundus autofluorescence. FINDINGS: The total number of studies included in this review was 32. Optical coherence tomography angiography scans show reduced central retinal vascular density, a thinner ganglion cell layer, a thicker retinal nerve fibre layer, and an enlarged foveal avascular zone. Optical coherence tomography scans demonstrate a thicker central macular thickness and other changes to the macula, ganglion cell, and inner nuclear layers. Many fundus photographs depicted cotton wool spots, microhaemorrhages, and vascular occlusions. Non-invasive imaging technology has demonstrated that COVID-19 can profoundly affect the retina.

Here we explore their overall experiences of learning/studying during this time in a phenomenological study. Five medical students were interviewed in depth and the audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim. Transcripts then underwent an interpretive phenomenological analysis. Our results highlighted a largely positive experience, with an improved culture of togetherness, freedom and sense of control. They also revealed issues with a lack of clinical exposure, potential negative impacts on ranking positions for those with dyslexia, and possible cheating in exams. There are some surprising resultsin particular the positive responses to how remote learning was delivered. These seemed to put our participants more on a par with their non-dyslexic colleaguesexcept in some examinations. It is our hope that medical educators may resist a return to the way things have always been done when the pandemic has resolved, and by doing so, continue to foster this new, positive culture and paradigm shift.","output":"The learning experiences of dyslexic medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic: a phenomenological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aging-associated decline of biological functions represents an important contributor to the increase in morbidity and mortality of human beings. Of these biological functions deterioration; there is a significant decline in the heart function, impairments in the lungs gas exchange, and impairments in the immune function. Many alterations in the body humeral and cellular immune response were observed with ageing process: The circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines are increased, the naive lymphocytes are decreased, the numbers of the antigen-presenting cells areelevated and the overall response is impaired. In addition, ageing is associated with a progressive restriction in the telomere length. Telomeres are located at chromosomes ends and play an essential role in preserving chromosome stability. Also, telomere length is very important to the immune system, because of the high sensitivity of the immune cells to the shortening of telomeres. Telomeres shortening adversely affect the immune cells' function and developments. These adverse changes increased the susceptibility for severe infection, risk of hospitalization, and even death. Elderly COVID-19 patients are at a real risk of complications due to impaired immune function, cytokine storm and defective respiratory function. Administration of anti-ageing immunomodulation factors like Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide NAD+ can minimize these changes through its potent immunomodulation and longevity effects. NAD+ has a direct inhibitory effect on PARP-1 and can prevent pro-inflammatory cytokines over-activation. Increasing the NAD+ level will also result in stabilizing telomeres and this has a positive impact on immune cells function.","output":"Influence of NAD+ as an ageing-related immunomodulator on COVID 19 infection: A hypothesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a serious health condition, associated with high health care costs, and poor outcomes. Patient empowerment and self-care are a key component of successful HF management. The emergence of telehealth may enable providers to remotely monitor patients statuses, support adherence to medical guidelines, improve patient wellbeing, and promote daily awareness of overall patients health. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of a voice activated technology for monitoring of HF patients, and its impact on HF clinical outcomes and health care utilization. METHODS: We conducted a randomized clinical trial; ambulatory HF patients were randomized to voice activated technology or standard of care (SOC) for 90 days. The system developed for this study monitored patient symptoms using a daily survey and alerted healthcare providers of pre-determined reported symptoms of worsening HF. We used summary statistics and descriptive visualizations to study the alerts generated by the technology and to healthcare utilization outcomes. RESULTS: The average age of patients was 54 years, the majority were Black and 45% were women. Almost all participants had an annual income below $50,000. Baseline characteristics were not statistically significantly different between the two arms. The technical infrastructure was successfully set up and two thirds of the invited study participants interacted with the technology. Patients reported favorable perception and high comfort level with the use of voice activated technology. The responses from the participants varied widely and higher perceived symptom burden was not associated with hospitalization on qualitative assessment of the data visualization plot. Among patients randomized to the voice activated technology arm, there was one HF emergency department (ED) visit and 2 HF hospitalizations; there were no events in the SOC arm. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of remote symptom monitoring of HF patients using voice activated technology. The varying HF severity and the wide range of patient responses to the technology indicate that personalized technological approaches are needed to capture the full benefit of the technology. The differences in health care utilization between the two arms call for further study into the impact of remote monitoring on health care utilization and patients wellbeing.","output":"Voice activated remote monitoring technology for heart failure patients: Study design, feasibility and observations from a pilot randomized control trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 from China, all deferrable medical activities have been suspended, to redirect resources for the management of COVID patients The goal of this retrospective study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on head and neck cancers' diagnosis in our Academic Hospital METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients treated for head and neck cancers between March 12 and November 1, 2020 was carried out, and we compared these data with the diagnoses of the same periods of the 5 previous years RESULTS: 47 patients were included in this study We observed a significative reduction in comparison with the same period of the previous 5 years CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a decrease in the number of new H&N cancers diagnoses, and a substantial diagnostic delay can be attributable to COVID-19 control measures","output":"Diagnosis and treatment delay of head and neck cancers during COVID-19 era in a tertiary care academic hospital: what should we expect?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in China, and due to the open accessibility of COVID-19 data, several researchers and modellers revisited the classical epidemiological models to evaluate their practical applicability. While mathematical compartmental models can predict various contagious viruses dynamics, their efficiency depends on the model parameters. Recently, several parameter estimation methods have been proposed for different models. In this study, we evaluated the Ensemble Kalman filters performance (EnKF) in the estimation of time-varying model parameters with synthetic data and the real COVID-19 data of Hubei province, China. Contrary to the previous works, in the current study, the effect of damping factors on an augmented EnKF is studied. An augmented EnKF algorithm is provided, and we present how the filter performs in estimating models using uncertain observational (reported) data. Results obtained confirm that the augumented-EnKF approach can provide reliable model parameter estimates.

However, its primary receptor portfolio remains controversial, potentially including sialic acid, coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR), integrins, and CD46. We and others have shown that Ad26 can use CD46, but these observations were questioned on the basis of the inability to cocrystallize Ad26 fiber with CD46. Recent work demonstrated that Ad26 binds CD46 with its hexon protein rather than its fiber. We examined the functional consequences of Ad26 for infection in vitro and in vivo. Ectopic expression of human CD46 on Chinese hamster ovary cells increased Ad26 infection significantly. Deletion of the complement control protein domain CCP1 or CCP2 or the serine-threonine-proline (STP) region of CD46 reduced infection. Comparing wild-type and sialic acid-deficient CHO cells, we show that the usage of CD46 is independent of its sialylation status. Ad26 transduction was increased in CD46 transgenic mice after intramuscular (i.m.) injection but not after intranasal (i.n.) administration. Ad26 transduction was 10-fold lower than Ad5 transduction after intratumoral (i.t.) injection of CD46expressing tumors. Ad26 transduction of liver was 1,000-fold lower than that ofAd5 after intravenous (i.v.) injection. These data demonstrate the use of CD46 by Ad26 in certain situations but also show that the receptor has little consequence by other routes of administration. Finally, i.v. injection of high doses of Ad26 into CD46 mice induced release of liver enzymes into the bloodstream and reduced white blood cell counts but did not induce thrombocytopenia. This suggests that Ad26 virions do not induce direct clotting side effects seen during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination with this serotype of adenovirus. IMPORTANCE The human species D Ad26 is being investigated as a low-seroprevalence vector for oncolytic virotherapy and gene-based vaccination against HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. However, there is debate in the literature about its tropism and receptor utilization, which directly influence its efficiency for certain applications. This work was aimed at determining which receptor(s) this virus uses for infection and its role in virus biology, vaccine efficacy, and, importantly, vaccine safety.","output":"Ex Vivo and In Vivo CD46 Receptor Utilization by Species D Human Adenovirus Serotype 26 (HAdV26)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens are overexpressed as altered-self in most common epithelial cancers.

METHODS This was a retrospective multicentric study. All patients undergoing incisional hernia repair between 2016 and 2018 at 6 participating university centers were included. Patients were classified according to the Ventral Hernia Working Group (VHWG). All consecutive patients who underwent abdominal wall repair using biosynthetic long-term absorbable mesh (Phasix?) in contaminated fields (grade 3 and 4 of the VHWG classification) were included. Patients were followed-up until September 2021. Preoperative, operative, and postoperative data were collected. All patients' surgical site infections (SSIs) and surgical site occurrences (SSOs) were recorded. The primary outcome of interest was the clinical incisional hernia recurrence rate. RESULTS One hundred and eight patients were included: 77 with VHWG grade 3 (71.3%) and 31 with VHWG grade 4 (28.7%). Median time follow-up was 41 months [24; 63]. Twenty-four patients had clinical recurrence during the follow-up (22.2%). The SSI and SSO rates were 24.1% and 36.1%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, risk factors for incisional hernia recurrence were previous recurrence, mesh location, and postoperative enterocutaneous fistula. CONCLUSIONS At the 3 year follow-up, the recurrence rate with a biosynthetic absorbable mesh (Phasix?) for incisional hernia repair in high-risk patients (VHWG grade 3 and 4) seemed to be suitable (22.2%).

Therefore, the application of suitable rapid serological tests could provide useful information, however, little evidence regarding their robustness is currently available. In this work, we evaluated and compared the analytical performance of a rapid lateral-flow test (LFA) and a fast semiquantitative fluorescent immunoassay (FIA) for anti-nucleocapsid (anti-NC) antibodies, with the reverse transcriptase real-time PCR assay as the reference. In 222 patients, LFA showed poor sensitivity (55.9%) within two weeks from PCR, while later testing was more reliable (sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 93.1%). Moreover, in a subset of 100 patients, FIA showed high sensitivity (89.1%) and specificity (94.1%) after two weeks from PCR. The coupled application for the screening of 183 patients showed satisfactory concordance (K = 0.858). In conclusion, rapid serological tests were largely not useful for early diagnosis, but they showed good performance in later stages of infection.

Therefore, many habitats and species protected under the Habitats and Birds Directives are dependent on or linked to agricultural practices. This implies that sustaining agriculture of a high natural value is a priority in achieving the aim of halting the loss of biodiversity in the European Union (EU). However, extensive agriculture is unprofitable in many regions of the EU, which results in it being either abandoned or intensified in the absence of financial support. Hence, organic farming (OF), which is most often supported with public funds, can be an alternative to conventional agriculture in N2K areas. This article is an empirical study of the differences in perceiving the possibilities of farm functioning in a protected area (PA) by organic and conventional farm owners. It was examined whether this could be the actual path to improving farmers living conditions in the context of legal protection of naturally valuable areas.

The conventional function of these transporters is to transfer their amino acid substrates across the lipid bilayer; the direction of the transfer is dictated by the combined gradients for the amino acid substrates and the co-transported ions (Na(+), H(+), K(+) or Cl(?)) across the membrane. In cases of electrogenic transporters, the membrane potential also contributes to the direction of the amino acid transfer. In addition to this expected traditional function, several unconventional functions are known for some of these amino acid transporters. This includes their role in intracellular signaling, regulation of acidCbase balance, and entry of viruses into cells. Such functions expand the biological roles of these transporters beyond the logical amino acid homeostasis. In recent years, two additional unconventional biochemical/metabolic processes regulated by certain amino acid transporters have come to be recognized: macropinocytosis and obesity. This adds to the repertoire of biological processes that are controlled and regulated by amino acid transporters in health and disease.

WEPs provided food, nutrition, herbs and other plant products for people in underdeveloped areas, such as the Everest region, to maintain their daily lives. Chenthang Town is the only Sherpa ethnic township in Tibet, China. The core purpose of this research is to investigate, collect and record the WEPs and related local knowledge and functions within the Sherpa community. The ultimate goal is to answer the question of why Sherpa people choose these particular plants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The field study was carried out in the six Sherpa communities of Chenthang Township from September 2019 to August 2020. The WEPs and related local knowledge were collected through semistructured interviews and direct observations. The field work was performed with the assistance of local guides. During the field survey, we collected plant specimens based on the principle of one plant with one vernacular name. In this study, we utilised a use report (UR) and cultural importance index (CI) to evaluate the comprehensive utilization value of WEPs in the daily diet of Sherpa people. RESULTS: We interviewed 78 people individually who provided us with 1199 use reports. In total, we collected 84 WEPs belonging to 65 genera in 41 families. These species were identified as 78 distinct ethno-species by local people, and the vernacular name of each ethno-species was recorded. Then, these use reports were classified into six use categories. All these plants were native wild plants. In these plants, Arisaema utile, Sorbus cuspidata and Elaeagnus umbellata have been introduced into home gardens by local people. Following the description of the Sherpa people, we articulated a collection calendar for WEPs. The Sherpa collect WEPs throughout nearly the entire year, January and February being the exceptions. CONCLUSION: The collection calendar of wild edible plants reflects the wisdom of the Sherpa in terms of survival. The Sherpa cleverly survive the food shortage periods by harnessing the phenology of different species. In general, WEPs can provide the Sherpa with seasonal carbohydrates, nutrition, healthcare supplements and other products and services necessary for survival, which is likely why the Sherpa choose these plants.

All patients with new presentations of AL undergo diagnostic flow cytometry (FC) analysis at our institution on peripheral blood and/or bone marrow samples. The FC database was searched for new diagnoses of adult ( 18 years) and pediatric (<18 years) AL during the following timeframes: [1] 3/13-6/10/20 (90 days after the first announced restriction) and [2] 2/11-3/12/20 (30 days prior to the first restriction). The database was searched for the same time periods in 2019 (3/13-6/10/19 and 2/10-3/12/19). A diagnosis of AL was considered new if the patient had not previously been diagnosed with AL or evolved to AL from an underlying myeloid neoplasm. Clinical data were collected from the electronic medical record. We used a Fisher's exact test to compare the distribution of new patients in the 30 days prior and 90 days following the announced COVID-19 restrictions in Maryland in 2020 to that of new patients in the corresponding time periods for 2019. The Cochran-Armitage test was used to compare trends in new patients with AL in the 30 days prior and 90 days following COVID-19 restrictions, as compared to the same time period in 2019. Statistical significance was defined as a p-value <0.05. Results: Between 3/13- 6/10/20, there were 25 new diagnoses of AL (11 women/14 men) with a median age of 51 years (range: 2.6 - 89 years; 10 pediatric/15 adult). During the same 90 day period in 2019, there were 32 new diagnoses of AL (18 women/14 men) with a median age of 63 years (range: 8 - 93 years; 2 pediatric/30 adult). Figure 1 shows the distribution of new AL diagnoses in adult patients by date of presentation. This decrease was most pronounced in the first 30 days, in which only one new adult patient with AL presented to JHH. The distribution of adult patients diagnosed in the 30 days prior and 90 days following the March 2020 restrictions was significantly different from the corresponding time period in 2019 (p=0.03); however, the overall trend of new adult AL diagnoses in the 30 days prior and the 90 days following the March 2020 restrictions was not significantly different from the corresponding time period in 2019 (p= 0.77). Of note, many patients with AL reported symptoms that overlapped with those of COVID-19 including fatigue (40%), dyspnea (35%) and fever (22%). 35.1% of patients diagnosed with AL after restrictions had no characteristic symptoms of COVID-19, as compared to 12.5% of patients diagnosed with AL during this period in 2019 (Table 1). Discussion: These data suggest that new presentations of adult AL were delayed by COVID-19-related restrictions. Given the acuity of AL, this delay may have affected clinical outcomes. Interestingly, pediatric new AL cases did not decrease during this time period. The reasons are unclear, though parents appear to have remained willing to seek care for their children even during the uncertain days at the beginning of the pandemic, perhaps due to the media reporting that COVID-19 infection was less aggressive in young people. Given the possibility of additional lockdowns due to COVID-19 variants or new pandemics, these data highlight the importance of encouraging patients to seek care in the event of illness, screening patients for both infectious and non-infectious disease, and ensuring that routine medical care remains accessible.

Abstract INTRODUCTION: Death due to cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of mortality in persons with severe mental disorder. There is dearth of information on cardiovascular risk profile of persons with SMD.This study is done to examine the documentation of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profile among patients who had cardiac event during inpatient admission in a tertiary care centre. METHODS: An audit of electronic medical records for documentation of CVD risk factors of smoking, alcohol use, obesity, elevated glucose levels, elevated blood pressure was done. RESULTS: 18 among 1260 in patients with Severe mental disorders had cardiac event during 2-year study period. Nearly half of them were smokers and had alcohol use disorder. Majority of them have diabetes and hypertension. There was no documentation of history of hyperlipidemia or family history of cardiometabolic risk factors in the medical records. Out of 18 who had cardiac event, 13 had elevated FBS, 10 had elevated BP, 10 had BMI>25, 9 had high HBA1C, 17 had deranged lipid profile when evaluated during hospital stay. Though some of the patients were on treatment for diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia, these parameters were deranged in most of them suggesting either poor compliance to medications or inadequate management. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that there are inadequacies in cardiovascular risk assessment and documentation in persons with severe mental disorders. Although the sample may not be representative of persons with severe mental disorders, major disparities in risk factor evaluation were found- particularly in hospitalised patients.","output":"Myths, Facts and Information in COVID Pandemic awaiting the third wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Skull base osteomyelitis that is secondary to otitis media is extremely rare in the modern antibiotic era.

Food waste generation has noticeably increased during the pandemic across the globe. To alleviate the associated health and environmental concerns, food waste could be converted into electricity and heat through FEWWN systems using waste-to-energy facilities, such as anaerobic digesters and combined heat and power units in wastewater treatment plants and livestock farms. In this work, a multi-period multi-objective optimization model is proposed for the design of efficient nexus systems under various impacts of the pandemic. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed modelling framework, a case study for New York State is presented. The optimized nexus systems could potentially reduce the food waste disposal amounts by 38%. A clear trade-off between the objectives is revealed by the Pareto-optimal solutions. The minimum total cost for the FEWWN system is $27.1 million;the optimal unit processing profit is $11.9 per ton processed food waste. Spatial analyses illustrate a strong correlation between facility selections and their processing capacities.

RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that a salinity stress inducible PHD (plant homeodomain) finger domain containing protein GmPHD5 can read the \\"histone code\\" underlying the methylated H3K4. GmPHD5 interacts with other DNA binding proteins, including GmGNAT1 (an acetyl transferase), GmElongin A (a transcription elongation factor) and GmISWI (a chromatin remodeling protein). Our results suggest that GmPHD5 can recognize specific histone methylated H3K4, with preference to di-methylated H3K4. Here, we illustrate that the interaction between GmPHD5 and GmGNAT1 is regulated by the self-acetylation of GmGNAT1, which can also acetylate histone H3. GmGNAT1 exhibits a preference toward acetylated histone H3K14. These results suggest a histone crosstalk between methylated H3K4 and acetylated H3K14. Consistent to its putative roles in gene regulation under salinity stress, we showed that GmPHD5 can bind to the promoters of some confirmed salinity inducible genes in soybean. CONCLUSION: Here, we propose a model suggesting that the nuclear protein GmPHD5 is capable of regulating the crosstalk between histone methylation and histone acetylation of different lysine residues. Nevertheless, GmPHD5 could also recruit chromatin remodeling factors and transcription factors of salt stress inducible genes to regulate their expression in response to salinity stress.","output":"GmPHD5 acts as an important regulator for crosstalk between histone H3K4 di-methylation and H3K14 acetylation in response to salinity stress in soybean"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Despite growing evidence about myocardial injury in hospitalized COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, the mechanism behind this injury is only poorly understood and little is known about its association with SARS-CoV-2-mediated myocarditis. Furthermore, definite evidence of the presence and role of SARS-CoV-2 in cardiomyocytes in the clinical scenario is still lacking. METHODS: We histologically characterized myocardial tissue of 40 patients deceased with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first wave of the pandemic. Clinical data were also recorded and analyzed. In case of findings supportive of myocardial inflammation, histological analysis was complemented by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens and in situ RNA hybridization for the detection of viral genomes. RESULTS: Both chronic and acute myocardial damage was invariably present, correlating with the age and comorbidities of our population. Myocarditis of overt entity was found in one case (2.5%). SARS-CoV-2 genome was not found in the cardiomyocytes of the patient with myocarditis, while it was focally and negligibly present in cardiomyocytes of patients with known viral persistence in the lungs and no signs of myocardial inflammation. The presence of myocardial injury was not associated with myocardial inflammatory infiltrates. CONCLUSIONS: In this autopsy cohort of COVID-19 patients, myocarditis is rarely found and not associated with SARS-CoV-2 presence in cardiomyocytes. Chronic and acute forms of myocardial damage are constantly found and correlate with the severity of COVID-19 disease and pre-existing comorbidities.

Instead, memory B cells that emerge five months after vaccination of naive individuals express antibodies that are similar to those that dominate the initial response. While individual memory antibodies selected over time by natural infection have greater potency and breadth than antibodies elicited by vaccination, the overall neutralizing potency of plasma is greater following vaccination.

The purpose of our prospective study was to assess associations between digital peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) measures and first-onset major CVD events in a sample of FHS (Framingham Heart Study) participants. METHODS: Using a fingertip PAT device, we assessed pulse amplitude in Framingham Offspring and Third Generation participants (n=3865; mean age, 5514 years; 52% women) at baseline and in 30-second intervals for 4 minutes during reactive hyperemia. The PAT ratio (relative hyperemia index) was calculated as the post-to-pre occlusion pulse signal ratio in the occluded arm, relative to the same ratio in the control (nonoccluded) arm, and corrected for baseline vascular tone. Baseline pulse amplitude and PAT ratio during hyperemia are measures of pressure pulsatility and microvascular function in the finger, respectively. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to relate PAT measures in the fingertip to incident CVD events. RESULTS: During follow-up (median, 9.2 years; range, 0.04C10.0 years), 270 participants (7%) experienced new-onset CVD events (n=270). In multivariable models adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors, baseline pulse amplitude (hazard ratio [HR] per 1 SD, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.90C1.21]; P=0.57) and PAT ratio (HR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.84C1.08]; P=0.43) were not significantly related to incident composite CVD events, including myocardial infarction or heart failure. However, higher PAT ratio (HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.61C0.94]; P=0.013), but not baseline pulse amplitude (HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.89C1.49]; P=0.29), was related to lower risk for incident stroke. In a sensitivity analysis by stroke subtype, higher PAT ratio was related to lower risk of incident ischemic stroke events (HR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.53C0.86]; P=0.001).

Various techniques such as pleural abrasion and pleurectomy are used to reduce the recurrence rate, but there exists no consensus among surgeons on which surgical technique offers the lowest risk of recurrence.We aimed to compare the efficiency and recurrence risk of pleural abrasion and pleurectomy methods in patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax undergoing a wedge resection for the bulleous part of the paranchyme. MATERIALS AND METHODS Statistically compared variables between the 2 groups were age, sex, symptoms, smoking status, number of previous pneumothorax episodes, surgical indication, bleb number, estimated blood loss, intraoperative complication, duration of the surgery, conversion to open surgery, postoperative drainage amount, chest tube removal time, length of hospital stay, morbidity, mortality, duration of narcotic analgesic usage, pain according to Visual Analog Scale evaluation, follow-up period, and postoperative recurrence. RESULTS The medical records of 88 patients undergoing surgery between 2013 and 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. The pleural abrasion group was superior to the pleurectomy group in terms of operation time, drainage volume, time to drain removal, hospital stay, and Visual Analog Scale pain score on postoperative day 0. Statistically, there was no difference between the pleural abrasion group and the pleurectomy group in the recurrence rates after operation (2.0% vs. 2.5%, respectively; P=0.89).

The model was experimented on node-link failures at various locations on big networks. The proposed model could generate excellent alternate routes and the bandwidth needed for rapid rerouting of multimedia traffic. As multiple node-link failures increase, bandwidth usage also increases which slows down multimedia traffic routing. The proposed model outperforms common proactive and reactive models, in terms of throughput and running time.

This meta-analysis compares the risk factors of CFR between fatal patients and non-fatal patients. RESULTS: Two cohort studies are included in this study. After comparing the patients between fatal cases and non-fatal cases, several important factors are found to significantly increase the CFR in patients with COVID-19, and include the age ranging 60C70 (OR = 1.85; 95% CI = 1.62 to 2.11; P < .00001) and especially70 (OR = 8.45; 95% CI = 7.47 to 9.55; P < .00001), sex of male (OR = 1.88; 95% CI = 1.30 to 2.73; P = .0008), occupation of retirees (OR = 4.27; 95% CI = 2.50 to 7.28; P < .00001), and severe cases (OR = 691.76; 95% CI = 4.82 to 99,265.63; P = .01).

It is mentioned that free oxygen and/or nitrogen radicals play a prominent role in this phase. To minimize this problem, a modified histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution that contains modified antioxidants has been developed. Our aim was to evaluate this solution in improving the viability of the pancreas in comparison with standard HTK and University of Wisconsin (UW) solutions in a porcine model of pancreas transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-three Landrace pigs were divided into three identical groups. After a 10-hour preservation time at 4C, the pancreas was implanted in the organs of the recipients in a standardized manner. Serum parameters were assessed prior to and after implantation on the 1(st) postoperative day, 3(rd) postoperative day, and 7(th) postoperative day. Furthermore, three biopsies were taken: prior to and after reperfusion, and on Day 7 to assess the grafts. RESULTS An analysis of serum glucose among the three groups showed no significant differences. Evaluation of the insulin levels showed no significant difference between the modified and standard HTK groups; however, differences between HTK and UW were significant (p = 0.004 in favor of UW solutions). The histopathological results showed a trend of a higher grade of rejection of pancreas tissue in the UW group compared to both HTK groups. CONCLUSION The modified HTK solution could preserve the pancreas for the preservation of the graft with similar results to those observed for standard solutions without any significant difference. The trend showed that the pathological finding in the UW group was not as good as that in the modified HTK and standard HTK groups.","output":"Evaluation of the modified HTK solution in pancreas transplantation-An experimental model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergency department (ED) crowding is a critical healthcare issue worldwide that leads to long waits and poorer healthcare outcomes. Goldratts theory of constraints (TOC) has been used effectively to improve such problematic environments for more than three decades.

Goldratt used a simple dice game with a straight flow (I-shape) to illustrate the impact of dependent resources and statistical fluctuations in managing resources. Additionally, games help to overcome resistance to change and gain ownership by having participants develop their solutions. This new cooperative game illustrates an ED environment where patients may follow different care pathways according to their clinical needs, timeliness of care is measured in minutes, the demand is highly uncertain, and treatment must frequently start almost immediately. A Monte Carlo simulation validated the TOC solution to this ED game, achieving results similar to the real TOCs implementations.

Their pathogenicity for pigs has been tested by oral infection of colostrum-deprived newborn, and of severely immunosuppressed weaned pigs, but colonisation of conventional weaned pigs by porcine EPEC has not been experimentally studied. EPEC show similarities to enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) additionally carrying shiga toxin genes integrated into the chromosome by lambdoid phages. We have demonstrated earlier that the porcine EPEC prototype strain P86-1390 (O45) could be transduced in vivo (in ligated loops of weaned pigs), by Stx2 phage derived from a human EHEC. Thus, the ability of this porcine EPEC strain to colonise conventional weaned pigs under farming conditions became a question of relevance to human health. To clarify this question, four intragastric infection experiments were performed on a total of 95 conventional weaned pigs. The EPEC P86-1390 and other well-characterised porcine EPEC strains were applied to 54 pigs, leaving 41 weaned pigs as negative controls. In three experiments moderate predispositions were applied: coinfections with enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) or with low-virulence TGE coronavirus, application of fumonisin B1 with a normal therapeutic dose of dexamethasone, and the increase of soybean protein concentration in the feed. A total of 41 weaned pigs served as negative controls inoculated with a commensal porcine E. coli. Housing conditions simulated the farm environment. As an overall result, ileal segments of 18.5% of infected pigs were shown to be colonised by EPEC, while no EPEC were detected in the ilea of controls. Among predisposing factors occurring on farms, feed protein content increased by 20% (26.3% crude protein, provided by 48% soybean meal) seemed to enhance EPEC colonisation and resulted in the mobilisation of spontaneous latent EPEC/ETEC infection. The results indicate that under normal farm conditions porcine EPEC may colonise conventional weaned pigs by inducing ileal attaching effacing (AE) lesions with reasonable frequency, without clinical signs. The results also suggest that conventional weaned pigs may represent undetected reservoirs of porcine EPEC, potentially giving rise to the emergence of new types of EHEC due to natural transduction by Stx phages.","output":"Colonisation of conventional weaned pigs by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and its hazard potential for human health."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV2 might conduce to rapid respiratory complications challenging healthcare systems worldwide.

These aspects may be particularly relevant in stress-related disorders such as fibromyalgia (FM) in which previous evidence demonstrated a causal effect of psychological stressors on chronic non-inflammatory pain of FM (2). Recent studies highlighted a significant worsening of FM symptoms after COVID-19 related lockdown period (3-4), but the levels of perceived stress and distress have not been evaluated yet. Objectives: The aim of this study is to establish the COVID-19 related perceived stress and distress among patients with FM who experienced the COVID-19 quarantine in Italy. Data were retrieved from a larger nationwide online survey involving patients affected by different rheumatic diseases (RD). Methods: We collected data from May to September 2020 from RD patients living in Italy during the COVID-19 quarantine by an ad-hoc online survey. Eleven associations of RD patients sent a call by using their mailing list, webpages and social network. They asked to complete an anonymous online survey which included the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Impact Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize results. Results: 79 of 507 (15.6%) of RD patients who completed the survey declared to have been diagnosed FM. 77 (97.5%) were females, with a mean ( SD) age of 51.0  12.4 yrs. In FM patients, the mean (SD) PSS score was 23.8  8.1. In particular, 8 (10.1%) reported low, 38 (48.1%) moderate and 33 (41.8%) high PSS scores. Moreover, IES-R mean (SD) score was 38.5  17.2. Among FM patients, 51 (64.6%) reported scores greater than 33, indicating the probable presence of a PTSD. With regard to the IES-R subscale scores, the total sample did not show a prominence of one of the three main domains: intrusion (13.9  7.3), avoidance (11.9  6.1) and hyperarousal (12.6  5.9). In these FM patients, self-reported major sources of anxiety were related to personal and relatives' health (59.5%), followed by social withdrawal (21.5%) and employment loss/ financial difficulties (11.4%). There was a slight increase of self-reported use of antidepressants (15 [18.9%] vs 16 [20.2%]) and anxiolytics drugs (4 [5.1%] vs 5 [6.3%]) after lockdown period. Conclusion: These results confirm that psychosocial stress and distress were highly pervasive in FM after COVID-19 national lockdown. It is known that stressed status may exacerbate and/or precipitate later development of FM symptoms. These data support the substantial worsening of somatic burden of FM after lockdown period reported in previous studies (3-4).

In this review we explore the complete picture from epidemiology and virology to clinical impact and immunology. Three striking aspects emerge. The first is the degree of similarity: although the infecting viruses are all different, the clinical outcome, viral evasion strategies, immune response, and long-term sequelae share many common features. The second is the interplay between the infant immune system and viral infection: the immaturity of the infant immune system alters the outcome of viral infection, but at the same time, viral infection shapes the development of the infant immune system and its future responses. Finally, both the virus and the immune response contribute to damage to the lungs and subsequent disease, and therefore, any prevention or treatment needs to address both of these factors.","output":"Respiratory viral infections in infants: causes, clinical symptoms, virology, and immunology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) remains under scrutiny as a stand-alone bariatric procedure. The most feared complication after LSG is staple line leak. METHODS Eight bariatric centers in Israel participated in this study. A retrospective analysis was performed by querying all the LSG cases performed between June 2006 and June 2010. The data collected included patient demographics, anthropometrics, and operative and perioperative parameters. RESULTS Among the 2,834 patients who underwent LSG, 44 (1.5%) with gastric leaks were identified. Of these 44 patients, 30 (68%) were women. The patients had a mean age of 41.5 years and a body mass index (BMI) of 45.4 kg/m(2). Intraoperative leak tests and routine postoperative swallow studies were performed with 33 patients, and all but one patient (3%) failed to detect the leaks. Leaks were diagnosed at a median of 7 days postoperatively: early (0-2 days) in nine cases (20%), intermediately (3-14 days) in 32 cases (73%), and late (>14 days) in three cases (7%). For 38 patients (86%), there was clinical suspicion, later confirmed by imaging or operative findings. Computed tomography, swallow studies, and methylene blue tests were performed for 37, 21, and 15 patients, respectively, and the results were positive, respectively, for 31 (84%), 11 (50%), and 9 (60%) of these patients. Reoperation was performed for 27 of the patients (61%). Other treatment methods included percutaneous drainage (n = 28, 63.6%), endoscopic placement of stents (n = 11, 25%), clips (n = 1, 2.3%), and fibrin glue (n = 1, 2.3%). In 33 of the patients (75%), the leak site was found in the upper sleeve near the gastroesophageal junction. The median time to leak closure was 40 days (range, 2-270 days), and the overall leak-related mortality rate was 0.14% (4/2,834). CONCLUSION Gastric leak is the most common cause of major morbidity and mortality after LSG. Routine tests to rule out leaks seem to be superfluous. Rather, selective utilization is recommended. Management options vary, depending mainly on patient disposition. An accepted algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of gastric leak has yet to be proposed.","output":"Gastric leaks after sleeve gastrectomy: a multicenter experience with 2,834 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the content of key functional strategies of companies in the real sector of the economy The purpose of the article is to assess the changes in the economic behaviour of companies in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, to analyse business practices in adapting functional strategies to new risks, and to determine the directions for transforming functional strategies An analysis of companies' business practices showed that the pandemic had a significant impact on the economic behaviour of companies, transforming not only their tactics, but also their strategy The functional strategies of the companies have undergone significant changes - marketing, production, personnel management strategies The transformation of the marketing sphere is due to new trends in the sphere of consumption that have arisen as a result of the introduction of restrictive measures by states The changed conditions of production activities necessitated accelerated digitalization and robotization of production, restructuring of supply chains and determined the need for the formation of innovative production strategies that meet the conditions of the Industry 4 0 era The strategy and tactics of personnel management of companies are adapting to the conditions of the epidemic using a remote work format, digitalization of processes and tasks, and the use of new approaches in management Based on the results of the study, the authors concluded that the pandemic has highlighted problems in the ability of companies to learn quickly in a rapidly changing environment Today, the surviving companies are those that have been able to best adapt to unforeseen threats For them, the coronavirus pandemic is not the cause of the crisis, but a turning point and a unique opportunity to develop in a highly competitive environment ? 2021 Natalia Baryshnikova et al , published by Sciendo 2021","output":"Enterprises' strategies transformation in the real sector of the economy in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims This poster reflects how the experience of staying with people of diverse nations and cultural background helped the stranded IMGs cope with this agony in a foreign land during an unprecedented tumultuous situation. The aim is to show that despite diversity among people, the hard times made them unite and overcome countless difficulties. Background The COVID 19 pandemic has been a period of global health crisis and has exponentially affected mental health issues in the world population. In these difficult times, several International Medical Graduates (IMGs), who had come to the UK to attend their PLAB exams, were left stranded as the exams were postponed, flights cancelled and borders sealed. Faced with huge uncertainty their mental health was of great concern. At this time the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO) came forward to help this cohort of stranded doctors in terms of accommodation, finances, mental health support, preparation for exams to the extent of liaising with General Medical Council (GMC) and Home Office. The virtual support group provided a platform for IMGs from different nations and cultures to get in touch with each other helping overcome mental burden and stress. The stories presented in the poster show how unity in diversity helped these young doctors deal with mental trauma amidst the Pandemic. Method 276 doctors from 27 countries were looked after by BAPIO. From those excerpts taken from 26 IMGs, personal narratives was used as a method for qualitative assessment. The percentage of IMGs clearing their exams and getting jobs in the NHS has been used for quantitative assessment. Result Qualitative: The personal narratives of the IMGs show how they were positively impacted by staying together albeit different nationalities and cultural background. Quantitative: A total of 21 IMGs out of the 26 cleared their PLAB 2 exams and got registration under General Medical Council giving a percentage of 81.7%. 20 IMGs have successfully joined the NHS in various posts giving a job success rate of 95.2%. Conclusion The experience of living and sharing housings with people from different nationalities, has increased appreciation and also prepared them to work in the NHS which has a diverse work force. This learning experience has been integral for all of us in shaping our life in the UK making everyone more compassionate.","output":"Post traumatic growth during COVID-19: unity in diversity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We aim to describe the early and upto 16 months follow-up of post-coronavirus disease (COVID), multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), with special reference to cardiac involvement. STUDY DESIGN: This cohort non-interventional descriptive study included patients <18 years admitted between May, 2020 and April, 2021. Based on underlying similarities, children were classified as post-COVID MIS-C with overlapping Kawasaki Disease, MIS-C with no overlapping Kawasaki Disease, and MIS-C with shock. Post-discharge, patients were followed at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 16 months. RESULTS: Forty-one patients predominantly males (73%), at median age of 7 years (range 0.2-16 years) fulfilled the World Health Organisation criteria for MIS-C. Cardiac involvement was seen in 15 (36.5%); impaired left ventricle (LV) function in 5 (12.2%), coronary artery involvement in 10 (24.4%), pericardial effusion in 6 (14.6%) patients, and no arrhythmias. There were two hospital deaths (4.9%), both in MIS-C shock subgroup (2/10, 20%). At 1 month, there was persistent LV dysfunction in 2/5, coronary artery abnormalities in 7/10, and pericardial effusion resolved completely in all patients. By 6 months, LV function returned to normal in all but coronary abnormalities persisted in two patients. At last follow-up (median 9.8 months, interquartile range 2-16 months), in 36/38 (94.7%) patients, coronary artery dilatation was persistent in 2 (20%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Children with MIS-C have a good early outcome, though MIS-C with shock can be life-threatening subgroup in a resource-constrained country setting.

Specific prophylactic treatments like vaccines, have been authorized for use by regulatory bodies in multiple countries, however there is an urgent need to identify new, safe, and targeted therapeutics as post-exposure therapy for COVID-19. Among a plethora of potential pharmacological targets, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) membrane receptor, which plays a crucial role in viral entry, is representing an attractive intervention opportunity for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral discovery process. In this scenario, we envisioned that binding to ACE2 by multivalent attachment of ligands to nanocarriers incorporating antiviral therapeutics, it would increase receptor avidity and impart specificity to these nanovectors for host cells, particularly in the pulmonary tract, which is the primary entry route for SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we report the design and development of novel polymeric nanoparticles (NP), densely grafted with various ligands to selectively bind to ACE2, as innovative nanovectors for targeted drug delivery. We first evaluated the impact of these biocompatible targeted NP (TNP) on ligand binding toward ACE2 and measured their competition ability vs a model of spike protein (Lipo-S1). Next, we tested the effectiveness of the most performing nanoprotopype, TNP-1, loaded with a model anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug such as remdesivir (RDV), on antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells. The RDV-TNP-1 exhibited a significantly improved antiviral effect compared to RDV at the same concentration, which resulted in a more potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell-based assays with respect to unloaded TNP (TNP-1E). Interestingly, TNP-1E also exhibited a basal antiviral activity, potentially due to a direct competitive mechanism with viral particles for the ACE2 binding site. We also measured the anti-exopeptidase activity of TNP-1E against ACE2 protein. Collectively, these insights warrant in-depth preclinical development for our nanoprototypes, for example as potential inhalable drug carriers, with the perspective of a clinical translation.","output":"Development of targeted nanoparticles loaded with antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The microbiology should be a part of curricula;especially after epidemic COVID-19.

Design and methods We collected 405 complete surveys, which structured with 47 knowledge items and 18 opinion items about microorganisms. Results We found a lack of knowledge among citizens and corresponding misconceptions about microorganisms. There were no statistically significant differences in citizens' knowledge by age and gender, but citizens with higher educational attainment had better knowledge scores. Participants equate the terms virus, bacteria and microorganisms, an error that can lead to misconceptions. We found that between 15.0 and 20.0% of citizens experience fear of microorganisms. Regarding gender, age and degree level, there were statistically significant differences in participants' opinions about microorganisms. 45.5% of the participants agreed that the topic of microorganisms is underrepresented in school. This is probably the reason why 44.2% of the participants are not interested in microbiology, although 74.6% are aware that knowledge about microorganisms is important and useful.

Yet reducing sepsis mortality by lowering circulating levels of TNF lost favour when positive endpoints in earlier simplistic models could not be reproduced in well-conducted human trials. Newer information with anti-TNF biologicals has encouraged reintroducing this concept for treating COVID-19. Viral models have had encouraging outcomes, as have the effects of anti-TNF biologicals on community-acquired COVID-19 during their long-term use to treat chronic inflammatory states. The positive outcome of a large scale trial of dexamethasone, and its higher potency late in the disease, harmonises well with its capacity to enhance levels of IL-7R&#945;, the receptor for IL-7, a cytokine that enhances lymphocyte development and is increased during the cytokine storm. Lymphoid germinal centres required for antibody-based immunity can be harmed by TNF, and restored by reducing TNF. Thus the IL-7- enhancing activity of dexamethasone may explain its higher potency when lymphocytes are depleted later in the infection, while employing anti-TNF, for several reasons, is much more logical earlier in the infection. This implies dexamethasone could prove to be synergistic with rIL-7, currently being trialed as a COVID-19 therapeutic. The principles behind these COVID-19 therapies are consistent with the observed chronic hypoxia through reduced mitochondrial function, and also the increased severity of this disease in ApoE4-positive individuals. Many of the debilitating persistent aspects of this disease are predictably susceptible to treatment with perispinal etanercept, since they have cerebral origins.","output":"Background to new treatments for COVID-19, including its chronicity, through altering elements of the cytokine storm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To analyze the efficacy of minimally invasive beating heart technique for mitral valve surgery in the cardiac patients with previous sternotomy and giant left ventricle. METHODS: Eighty cardiac patients with previous sternotomy and giant left ventricle according to the diagnostic criteria that left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) was 70 mm, who underwent mitral valve surgery at our center from January 2006 to January 2019 were analyzed. We divided all patients into minimally invasive beating heart technique group (n = 30) and conventional median resternotomy arrested heart technique group (n = 50) according to the surgical methods. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were compared between two groups. RESULTS: Minimally invasive beating heart technique compared to the conventional median resternotomy arrested heart technique for mitral valve surgery in the cardiac patients with previous sternotomy and giant left ventricle had significant differences in operation time(P = 0.002), cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time(P < 0.001), intraoperative blood loss(P < 0.001), postoperative transfusion ratio(P = 0.01), postoperative transfusion amount(P < 0.001), postoperative drainage volume(P = 0.001), extubation time(P = 0.04), intensive care unit (ICU) stay time(P = 0.04) and postoperative hospital stay time(P < 0.001), but no significant differences in re-exploration for bleeding, postoperative 30-day mortality, postoperative complications and 6 months postoperative echocardiographic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Using the method of minimally invasive beating heart technique for mitral valve surgery in the cardiac patients with previous sternotomy and giant left ventricle is effective and reliable, meanwhile reduce the operation time and CPB time, decrease the transfusion ratio and transfusion amount, shorten postoperative ICU stay and hospital stay time, promote the early extubation so that accelerate the patients early recovery.

METHODS: We report clinical characteristics and biological findings of five consecutive patients presenting to our tertiary care center between April 2020 and February 2021 with various neurological symptoms occurring after recent nitrous oxide abuse. RESULTS: Our patients presented with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord (4/5 patients) or with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (1/5 patients). No patient had reduced vitamin B-12 titer, but all had elevated blood levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid. This reflects the functional deficit in vitamin B-12 that can be linked to nitrous oxide consumption. After vitamin B-12 supplementation, clinical signs regressed at least partially in all 5 patients. CONCLUSION: We report an elevated incidence of neurological complications of nitrous oxide abuse occurring during the recent COVID-19 lockdown.

Findings A total of 2338 studies were reviewed, and 12 studies were included in our analysis, covering six countries across the SEAR (Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, and India) for three conditions of interest (HIV, TB, dengue fever). We identified significant disruption to TB testing (range=25% to 77.9%) and diagnoses (range=50% to 58%) in India, Nepal, and Indonesia; and similar disruptions were observed for screening, new diagnoses and commencing HIV treatment in India and Thailand. There was also drastically reduced case detection for dengue fever (range=75% to 90% disrupted) in Bhutan and Sri Lanka. No studies were identified for malaria nor hepatitis in any country, and nor for any service in the remaining six SEAR countries.

In this paper, a mathematical model is proposed to analyze the dynamic behavior of COVID-19. Based on inter-city networked cou-pling effects, a fractional-order SEIHDR system with the real-data from 23 January to 18 March, 2020 of COVID-19 is discussed. Meanwhile, hospitalized individuals and the mortality rates of three types of individuals (exposed, in-fected and hospitalized) are firstly taken into account in the proposed model. And infectivity of individuals during in-cubation is also considered in this paper. By applying least squares method and predictor-correctors scheme, the numer-ical solutions of the proposed system in the absence of the inter-city network and with the inter-city network are stim-ulated by using the real-data from 23 January to 18 - m March, 2020 where m is equal to the number of predic-tion days. Compared with integer-order system ( = 0), the fractional-order model without network is validated to have a better fitting of the data on Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Huanggang and other cities. In contrast to the case with-out network, the results indicate that the inter-city network system may be not a significant case to virus spreading for China because of the lock down and quarantine measures, however, it may have an impact on cities that have not adopted city closure. Meanwhile, the proposed model better fits the data from 24 February to 31, March in Italy, and the peak number of confirmed people is also predicted by this fraction-order model. Furthermore, the existence and unique-ness of a bounded solution under the initial condition are considered in the proposed system. Afterwards, the basic re-production number R0 is analyzed and it is found to hold a threshold: the disease-free equilibrium point is locally asymp-totically stable when R0 [] 1, which provides a theoretical basis for whether COVID-19 will become a pandemic in the future.","output":"A fractional-order SEIHDR model for COVID-19 with inter-city networked coupling effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Government debt development is a timeless issue in economics that has gained even more attention in light of the global financial crisis and the Covid 19 pandemic crisis.

Lung-protective ventilation in coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory failure may result in severe respiratory acidosis without significant hypoxemia. Low-flow extracorporeal Co2 removal can facilitate lung-protective ventilation and avoid the adverse effects of severe respiratory acidosis. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of extracorporeal Co2 removal using the Hemolung Respiratory Assist System in correcting severe respiratory acidosis in mechanically ventilated coronavirus disease 2019 patients with severe acute respiratory failure. Design: Retrospective cohort analysis of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 mechanically ventilated with severe hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis and treated with low-flow extracorporeal Co2 removal. Setting: Eight tertiary ICUs in the United States. Patients: Adult patients supported with the Hemolung Respiratory Assist System from March 1, to September 30, 2020. Interventions: Extracorporeal Co2 removal with Hemolung Respiratory Assist System under a Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization for coronavirus disease 2019. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was improvement in pH and Paco2 from baseline. Secondary outcomes included survival to decannulation, mortality, time on ventilator, and adverse events. Thirty-one patients were treated with Hemolung Respiratory Assist System with significant improvement in pH and Pco2 in this cohort. Two patients experienced complications that prevented treatment. Of the 29 treated patients, 58% survived to 48 hours post treatment and 38% to hospital discharge. No difference in age or comorbidities were noted between survivors and nonsurvivors.

While the initial target of SARS-CoV-2 is the respiratory tract, it is becoming increasingly clear that there is a complex interaction between the virus and the immune system ranging from mild to controlling responses to exuberant and dysfunctional multi-tissue directed autoimmune responses. The immune system plays a dual role in COVID-19, being implicated in both the anti-viral response and in the acute progression of the disease, with a dysregulated response represented by the marked cytokine release syndrome, macrophage activation, and systemic hyperinflammation. It has been speculated that these immunological changes may induce the loss of tolerance and/or trigger chronic inflammation. In particular, molecular mimicry, bystander activation and epitope spreading are well-established proposed mechanisms to explain this correlation with the likely contribution of HLA alleles. We performed a systematic literature review to evaluate the COVID-19-related autoimmune/rheumatic disorders reported between January and September 2020. In particular, we investigated the cases of incident hematological autoimmune manifestations, connective tissue diseases, antiphospholipid syndrome/antibodies, vasculitis, Kawasaki-like syndromes, acute arthritis, autoimmune-like skin lesions, and neurologic autoimmune conditions such as Guillain-Barr syndrome. We screened 6263 articles and report herein the findings of 382 select reports which allow us to conclude that there are 2 faces of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2, that include a benign virus controlling immune response and a many faceted range of dysregulated multi-tissue and organ directed autoimmune responses that provides a major challenge in the management of this viral disease.

We estimated the odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection for staff and pupils over the period August-December 2020, dependent on measures of recent exposure to known cases linked to their educational settings. Results The total number of cases in a school was not associated with a subsequent increase in the odds of testing positive (staff OR per case: 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.00;pupil OR per case: 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02). Among pupils, the number of recent cases within the same year group was significantly associated with subsequent increased odds of testing positive (OR per case: 1.12, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.15).

Subsequently, a national safety alert was issued regarding patients being inappropriately co-prescribed two anticoagulants following a medication change, and associated monitoring. Objective To describe which people were switched from warfarin to DOACs; identify potentially unsafe co-prescribing of anticoagulants; and assess whether abnormal clotting results have become more frequent during the pandemic. Methods Working on behalf of NHS England we conducted a population cohort based study using routine clinical data from >17 million adults in England. Results 20,000 of 164,000 warfarin patients (12.2%) switched to DOACs between March and May 2020, most commonly to edoxaban and apixaban. Factors associated with switching included: older age, recent renal function test, higher number of recent INR tests recorded, atrial fibrillation diagnosis and care home residency. There was a sharp rise in co-prescribing of warfarin and DOACs from typically 50-100 per month to 246 in April 2020, 0.06% of all people receiving a DOAC or warfarin. INR testing fell by 14% to 506.8 patients tested per 1000 warfarin patients each month. We observed a very small increase in elevated INRs (n=470) during April compared with January (n=420). Conclusions Increased switching of anticoagulants from warfarin to DOACs was observed at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic in England following national guidance.

This interspecies spill-over has triggered transmission in 58 patients epidemiologically linked to three pet shops. Incidentally, three dwarf hamsters imported from the Netherlands and centralized in a warehouse distributing animals to pet shops were positive for SARS-CoV-2 spike variant phylogenetically related to European B.1.258 strains from March 2020. This B.1.258 strain almost disappeared in July 2021. While no hamster-to-human transmission of B.1.258-like strain was found in this outbreak, molecular docking showed that its spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) has a similar binding energy to human ACE2 compared to that of Delta variant AY.127. Therefore, the potential of this B.1.258-related spike variant for interspecies jumping cannot be ignored. The co-circulation of B.1.258-related spike variants with Delta AY.127, which originated in Europe and was not previously found in Hong Kong, suggested that hamsters in our wholesale warehouse and retail pet shops more likely have acquired these viruses in the Netherlands or stopovers during delivery by aviation than locally.

While capitalism demands constant growth, acceleration and efficiency, the outbreak urges societies to reduce, slow down and be patient. This article provides a sociological comment on the pandemic that focuses on the role of time and temporality. It explores the multiple ways in which the required responses to Covid-19 are at odds with the temporal order of capitalism. In the midst of crisis, the specific features, contradictions and weaknesses of the time regime governing modern societies become even more apparent ? and make sociological scrutiny more necessary than ever. While this comment relates to the insights provided by the sociology of time, it uses a children?s book to illustrate its argument. Drawing on Michael Ende?s story of the orphan girl Momo and the grey gentlemen who steal people?s time, I recapture the main features of capitalism as a time regime: measurement and commodification of time, temporal expansion, acceleration, appropriation of the future, and unequal temporal autonomy. The current pandemic challenges both individual and collective temporalities that are governed by these temporal imperatives of capitalism. I conclude with reflections on the feasibility of a more sustainable temporal order that Michael Ende?s novel hints at and suggest how sociological research could support such an endeavour in the current crisis.","output":"The coronavirus and the temporal order of capitalism: Sociological observations and the wisdom of a childrens book"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is an urgent need for anti-viral agents that treat and/or prevent Covid-19 caused by SARS-Coronavirus (CoV-2) infections.

METHODS: We employed near real-time weekly data on cancer care to determine the adverse effect of the pandemic on cancer services. We also used these data, together with national death registrations until June 2020 to model deaths, in excess of background (pre-COVID-19) mortality, in people with cancer. Background mortality risks for 24 cancers with and without COVID-19-relevant comorbidities were obtained from population-based primary care cohort (Clinical Practice Research Datalink) on 3 862 012 adults in England. RESULTS: Declines in urgent referrals (median=?70.4%) and chemotherapy attendances (median=?41.5%) to a nadir (lowest point) in the pandemic were observed. By 31 May, these declines have only partially recovered; urgent referrals (median=?44.5%) and chemotherapy attendances (median=?31.2%). There were short-term excess death registrations for cancer (without COVID-19), with peak relative risk (RR) of 1.17 at week ending on 3 April. The peak RR for all-cause deaths was 2.1 from week ending on 17 April. Based on these findings and recent literature, we modelled 40% and 80% of cancer patients being affected by the pandemic in the long-term. At 40% affected, we estimated 1-year total (direct and indirect) excess deaths in people with cancer as between 7165 and 17 910, using RRs of 1.2 and 1.5, respectively, where 78% of excess deaths occured in patients with 1 comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Dramatic reductions were detected in the demand for, and supply of, cancer services which have not fully recovered with lockdown easing. These may contribute, over a 1-year time horizon, to substantial excess mortality among people with cancer and multimorbidity. It is urgent to understand how the recovery of general practitioner, oncology and other hospital services might best mitigate these long-term excess mortality risks.","output":"Estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer services and excess 1-year mortality in people with cancer and multimorbidity: near real-time data on cancer care, cancer deaths and a population-based cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airborne transmission is one of the routes for the spread of COVID-19 which is caused by inhalation of smaller droplets containing SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., either virus-laden particulate matter: PM and/or droplet nuclei) in an indoor environment. Notably, a significant fraction of the small droplets, along with respiratory droplets, is produced by both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals during expiratory events such as breathing, sneezing, coughing and speaking. When these small droplets are exposed to the ambient environment, they may interact with PM and may remain suspended in the atmosphere even for several hours. Therefore, it is important to know the fate of these droplets and processes (e.g., physical and chemical) in the atmosphere to better understand airborne transmission. Therefore, we reviewed existing literature focussed on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the spread of COVID-19 and present an environmental perspective on why airborne transmission hasn't been very conclusive so far. In addition, we discuss various environmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) and sampling difficulties, which affect the conclusions of the studies focussed on airborne transmission. One of the reasons for reduced emphasis on airborne transmission could be that the smaller droplets have less number of viruses as compared to larger droplets. Further, smaller droplets can evaporate faster, exposing SARS-CoV-2 within the small droplets to the environment, whose viability may further reduce. For example, these small droplets containing SARS-CoV-2 might also physically combine with or attach to pre-existing PM so that their behaviour and fate may be governed by PM composition. Thus, the measurement of their infectivity and viability is highly uncertain due to a lack of robust sampling system to separately collect virions in the atmosphere. We believe that the present review will help to minimize the gap in our understanding of the current pandemic and develop a robust epidemiological method for mortality assessment.","output":"Why airborne transmission hasn't been conclusive in case of COVID-19?

RAS protein activator like 2 (RASAL2) is considered a double-edged sword in carcinogenesis. Herein, we investigated the role of RASAL2 in response to H. pylori infection and gastric tumorigenesis. METHODS Bioinformatics analyses of local and public databases were applied to analyzeRASAL2 expression, signaling pathways, and clinical significance. In vitro cell culture, spheroids, patient-derived organoids, and in vivo mouse models were utilized. Molecular assays included ChIP, Co-IP, western blotting, qPCR and immunocyto/histochemistry. RESULTS H. pylori infection induced RASAL2 expression via an NF-B-dependent mechanism where NF-kB was directly bound to the RASAL2 promoter activating its transcription. By gene silencing and ectopic overexpression, we found that RASAL2 upregulated -catenin transcriptional activity. RASAL2 inhibited PP2A activity through direct binding with subsequent activation of the AKT/-catenin signaling axis. Functionally, RASAL2 silencing decreased nuclear -catenin levels and impaired tumor spheroids and organoids formation. Furthermore, the depletion of RASAL2 impaired tumor growth in gastric tumor xenograft mouse models. Clinicopathological analysis indicated that abnormal overexpression of RASAL2 correlated with poor prognosis and chemoresistance in human gastric tumors. CONCLUSION These studies uncovered a novel signaling axis of NF-B/RASAL2/-catenin, providing a novel link between infection, inflammation and gastric tumorigenesis.","output":"Helicobacter pylori-induced RASAL2 through activation of NF-kB promotes gastric tumorigenesis via -catenin signaling axis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To construct a prediction model of pathologic complete response (pCR) in locally advanced rectal cancer patients who received programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibody and total neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy by using radiomics based on MR imaging data and to investigate its predictive value. Methods: A clinical diagnostic test study was carried out. Clinicopathalogical and radiological data of 38 patients with middle-low rectal cancer who received PD-1 antibody combined with total neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and underwent TME surgery from January 2019 to September 2021 in our hospital were retrospectively collected. Among 38 patients, 23 were males and 15 were females with a median age of 68 (47-79) years and 13 (34.2%) a chieved pCR. These 38 patients were stratified and randomly divided into the training group (n=26) and test group (n=12) for modeling. All the patients underwent rectal MRI before treatment. The clinical, imaging and radiomics features of all the patients were collected, and the clinical feature model and radiomics model were constructed. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of each model were drawn, and the constructed model was evaluated through the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. Results: There were no significant differences in age, gender, primary location of tumor and postoperative pathology between the two groups (all P>0.05). Forty-one features were extracted from region of interest in each modality, including 9 first-order features, 24 gray level co-occurrence matrix features and 8 shape features. From 38 patients, 41 features were extracted from each imaging modality of baseline and preoperative DWI and T2WI images, totally 164 features. Only 4 features were preserved after correlation analysis between each pair of features and t-test between pCR and non-pCR subjects. After LASSO cross validation, only the first-order skewness of the baseline DWI image before treatment and the volume in the baseline T2WI image before treatment were retained. The area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the prediction model established by applying these two features in the training group and the test group were 0.856 and 0.844, 77.8% and 100.0%, 88.2% and 75.0%, 77.8% and 66.7%, 88.2% and 100.0%, respectively. The decision curve analysis of the radiomics model showed that the strategy of this model in predicting pCR was better than that in treating all the patients as pCR and that in treating all the patients as non-pCR.

As a result, the Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is used for diagnosing. COVID19 has different key signs on a CT scan differ from other viral pneumonia. These signs include ground glass opacities, consolidations, and crazy paving. In this paper, an Artificial Intelligence-inspired Model for COVID19 Diagnosis and Prediction for Patient Response to Treatment (AIMDP) is proposed. AIMDP model has two main functions reflected in two proposed modules, namely, the Diagnosis Module (DM) and Prediction Module (PM). The Diagnosis Module (DM) is proposed for early and accurately detecting the patients with COVID 19 and distinguish it from other viral pneumonias using COVID19 signs obtained from CT scans. The DM model, uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a Deep learning technique for segmentation, can process hundreds of CT images in seconds to speed up diagnosis of COVID19 and contribute in its containment. In addition, some countries have no ability to provide all patients with the treatment and intensive care services, so it will be mandatory to give treatment to only responding patients. In this context, the Prediction Module (PM) is proposed for predicting the ability of the patient to respond to treatment based on different factors e.g. age, infection stage, respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and the treatment regimens.

Methods Medline, Embase and the grey literature were searched for papers from inception to 10th September 2020. Screening (and grading) was undertaken by two reviewers according to pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Met-analysis was not possible so the result were summarised narratively. Results 2276 papers were screened resulting in 16 being included in the review. All studies were from Europe, mostly the UK; the median sample size was 308.5, mean age of participants 78.7 and 42% were female. 15/16 used the Clinical Frailty Scale; reported mortality ranged from 19 to 65%. Most, but not all studies showed an association between increasing frailty and a greater risk of dying. Two studies indicated a sub-additive relationship between frailty, COVID-19 and death, and one study showed no increase in dying. Conclusions This review showed that whilst many studies have shown an association between an increased risk of COVID-19 related death with increasing frailty, other studies demonstrate a more nuanced understanding of frailty and outcomes in COVID-19 is needed. Clinicians should exert caution in placing too much emphasis on the influence of frailty alone when discussing likely prognosis in older people with COVID-19 infection.","output":"What is the relationship between validated frailty scores and mortality for adults with COVID-19 in acute hospital care?

re-infection. We compared two assays that are correlated with NAbs, the haemagglutination test (HAT) and surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). METHODS: The specificity of the HAT was compared with the sVNT and the sensitivity and persistence of antibodies in patients with varying severity of illness was assessed in cohort of 71 patients at 4 to 6 weeks and 13-16 weeks. The kinetics was assessed in first, second and third week in patients with varying severity of acute illness. RESULTS: The specificity of the HAT was >99%, and sensitivity was similar to lower than the sVNT. The levels of HAT significantly and positively correlated (Spearman's r= 0.78, p<0.0001) with those of the sVNT. Patients with moderate and severe illness had higher in the HAT titres compared to those with mild illness. 6/7 patients with severe illness had a titre of >1:640 during the second week of illness, whereas only 5/31 patients with mild illness had a titre of >1:160 in the second week of illness. CONCLUSIONS: Since the HAT is a simple, and very cheap assay to perform, it would be ideal to use as an indicator of NAbs in resource-poor settings.","output":"Comparison of two assays to detect IgG antibodies to the receptor binding domain of the SARS?CoV?2 as a surrogate marker for assessing neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper proposes a new representation for the Public Help Index  (briefly, PHI ).

We estimated one- and two-dose mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Quebec, Canada including protection against varying outcome severity, variants of concern (VOC), and the stability of single-dose protection out to 16 weeks post-vaccination. METHODS: A test-negative design compared vaccination among SARS-CoV-2 test-positive and weekly-matched (10:1), randomly-sampled, test-negative HCWs using linked surveillance and immunization databases. Vaccine status was defined by one dose 14 days or two doses 7 days before illness onset or specimen collection. Adjusted VE was estimated by conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Primary analysis included 5,316 cases and 53,160 controls. Single-dose VE was 70% (95%CI: 68-73) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 73% (95%CI: 71-75) against COVID-19 illness and 97% (95%CI: 92-99) against associated hospitalization. Two-dose VE was 86% (95%CI: 81-90) and 93% (95%CI: 89-95), respectively, with no associated hospitalizations. VE was higher for non-VOC than VOC (73% Alpha) among single-dose (77%, 95%CI: 73-81 versus 63%, 95%CI: 57-67) but not two-dose recipients (87%, 95%CI: 57-96 versus 94%, 95%CI: 89-96). Across 16 weeks, no decline in single-dose VE was observed with appropriate stratification based upon prioritized vaccination determined by higher versus lower likelihood of direct patient contact. CONCLUSION: One mRNA vaccine dose provided substantial and sustained protection to HCWs extending at least four months post-vaccination. In circumstances of vaccine shortage, delaying the second dose may be a pertinent public health strategy to consider.","output":"Single-dose mRNA vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers extending 16 weeks post-vaccination: a test-negative design from Quebec, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The association between hunger and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is less known especially in vulnerable populations receiving HIV care and treatment services. Caregivers of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) are vulnerable and likely to experience hunger due to additional economic pressure in caring for OVC. Using data from the community-based, USAID-funded Kizazi Kipya project, this study assesses the association between hunger and ART adherence among caregivers of OVC in Tanzania. HIV positive caregivers enrolled in the project from January to July 2017 were analyzed. The outcome variable was adherence to ART, defined as \\"not having missed any ART dose in the last 30 days,\\" and household hunger, measured using the Household Hunger Scale (HHS), was the main independent variable. Data analysis included multivariable logistic regression. The study analyzed 11,713 HIV positive caregivers who were on ART at the time of enrollment in the USAID Kizazi Kipya project in 2017. Aged 48.2 years on average, 72.9% of the caregivers were female. While 34.6% were in households with little to no hunger, 59.4 and 6.0% were in moderate hunger and severe hunger households, respectively. Overall, 90.0% of the caregivers did not miss any ART dose in the last 30 days. ART adherence rates declined as household hunger increased (p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that the odds of adhering to ART was significantly lower by 42% among caregivers in moderate hunger households than those in little to no hunger households (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.50-0.68). The decline increased to 47% among those in severe hunger households (OR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.41-0.69). Hunger is an independent and a significant barrier to ART adherence among caregivers LHIV in Tanzania. Improving access to adequate food as part of HIV care and treatment services is likely to improve ART adherence in this population.","output":"Hunger and Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy: Learning From HIV Positive Caregivers of Orphans and Vulnerable Children in Tanzania"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coworking spaces (CWS) are open creative labs that provide a community-like environment and the necessary surroundings for their users to build and maintain networks with different actors inside and outside the CWS. With a wide variety of knowledge and skills available in trusted surroundings as well as similar value orientations, coworkers enjoy favorable conditions to establish their network-style. However, research has not investigated the benefit of coworkers social networks as far as their individual creativity is concerned so far. This paper takes several network characteristics into account: structure in terms of network size and centrality in the CWS, but also trusted and reciprocal relationships, supportiveness, diversity of knowledge exchanged, and the individual openness to core coworking values. Based on the literature on social networks and small group research, we developed a research model. We tested it to get deeper insights into the phenomenon by relying on 113 coworkers in 33 private German coworking spaces. The results show that a central position in the CWS allowing for direct exchange and high individual openness to core coworking values positively affects social involvement and the diversity of knowledge exchanged, and finally, a coworkers individual creativity. Managerial implications include the vital role of a central position in the CWS for creativity and a somewhat balanced composition of coworkers working alone or in a team.","output":"Social networks in coworking spaces and individual coworkers creativity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: the outbreak and rapid spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has evolved into an unprecedented global pandemic. The infection impairs several human organs and systems, however, it is not clear how it affects thyroid function. The study therefore aimed at measuring plasma levels of thyroid hormones and Hs-CRP in COVID-19 patients and apparently healthy uninfected controls to assess the possible effect of SAR-CoV-2 infection on thyroid function. METHODS: in this cross-sectional study carried out between May-August 2020, 90 consenting participants comprising 45 COVID-19 patients and 45 apparently healthy uninfected controls were recruited. Plasma FT3, FT4, TSH and Hs-CRP were measured using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. Data was analysed using SPSS version 20 and statistical significance set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: the mean plasma FT3 and TSH concentrations were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (p < 0.001, p < 0.001 respectively). Euthyroidism was observed in all uninfected controls, whereas 35 (77.8%) COVID-19 patients were euthyroid. Sick euthyroid and subclinical hypothyroidism was observed in 7 (15.6%) and 3 (6.7%) COVID-19 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: though there was a preponderance of euthyroidism among COVID-19 patients, significantly higher mean plasma levels of TSH and FT3, sick euthyroid syndrome and subclinical hypothyroidism observed among some COVID-19 patients may be indicative of disease-related thyroid function changes. Hence, there is need to pay attention to thyroid function during and after treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Assessment of thyroid function of newly diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Substance Use Disorder (SUD) is a debilitating chronic illness with significant morbidity and mortality across the United States. The AAMC and LCME have supported the efforts for more effective medical education of SUD to address the existing stigma, knowledge, and treatment gaps. The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated social, economic, and behavioral impacts have added to this urgency. The University of South Carolina School of Medicine Greenville (USCSOMG), in collaboration with community organizations, has successfully implemented an integrated SUD education curriculum for medical students. Students learn about SUD in basic sciences, receive case-based education during clinical exercises, and are provided the opportunity to become a recovery coach and participate in the patient and family recovery meetings through this curriculum during preclinical years. During the clinical years, SUD education is enhanced with exposure to Medication for Addition Treatment (MAT). Students also partake in the care coordination of patients with SUD between the hospital and community recovery organizations. All students receive MAT waiver training in their final year and are prepared to prescribe treatment for SUD upon graduation. The experiences in this integrated curriculum integration can perhaps assist other organizations to implement similar components and empower the next generation of physicians to be competent and effective in treating patients with SUD.

It argues that there are stakeholders at individual, institutional, national and international levels, with overlapping but, more often, different or even conflicting interests. Depending on the interests of given stakeholders, different conclusions regarding the ethics of international nurse recruitment may be reached. There is no right or wrong with these varying ethical positions because they reflect different beliefs and philosophies that are not amenable to value judgment. To illustrate and support this line of argument, this article analyzes the underpinnings of two ethical standards published by the International Council of Nurses and the UK Department of Health. In addition, a case study on China augments the argument by demonstrating limitations of the one-size-fits-all approach to the issue. The most important question in understanding and evaluating the ethical standards of international nurse recruitment is to know whose interests they are designed to represent and protect.","output":"One size doesn't fit all: ethics of international nurse recruitment from the conceptual framework of stakeholder interests."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The uncontrolled progression of the aids epidemic has made the development of an efficacious human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine a major objective of scientific research.

Simple methods such as Akaike Information Criterion are commonly used but they do not incorporate the uncertainty of the model's parameters, which can give misleading choices when comparing models with similar fit to the data. One approach to model selection in a more rigorous way that uses the full posterior distributions of the models is to compute the ratio of the normalising constants (or model evidence), known as Bayes factors. These normalising constants integrate the posterior distribution over all parameters and balance over and under fitting. However, normalising constants often come in the form of intractable, high-dimensional integrals, therefore special probabilistic techniques need to be applied to correctly estimate the Bayes factors. One such method is thermodynamic integration (TI), which can be used to estimate the ratio of two models' evidence by integrating over a continuous path between the two un-normalised densities. In this paper we introduce a variation of the TI method, here referred to as referenced TI, which computes a single model's evidence in an efficient way by using a reference density such as a multivariate normal - where the normalising constant is known. We show that referenced TI, an asymptotically exact Monte Carlo method of calculating the normalising constant of a single model, in practice converges to the correct result much faster than other competing approaches such as the method of power posteriors. We illustrate the implementation of the algorithm on informative 1- and 2-dimensional examples, and apply it to a popular linear regression problem, and use it to select parameters for a model of the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea.","output":"Simulating normalising constants with referenced thermodynamic integration: application to COVID-19 model selection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to variations in serotypes among different strains of avian infectious bronchitis viruses (IBV), vaccination of chicks with imported vaccines fails to protect them from IBV infections in Taiwan.

The attenuated vaccine was not pathogenic in 1-week-old chicks, had a neutralization index (NI) of greater than 4.4 and efficacy of 90% when inoculated birds were challenged with a field IBV strain. Similar results were obtained for a vaccine made from a Taiwan Group II IBV strain. Additionally, the TW I attenuated vaccine strain had no reversion to virulence after five back passages in chicks.

This technology aims to recover broadband speech signals from narrowband speech signals with a limited frequency band. However, due to the limitations of current voice equipment and channel conditions, the existing voice band expansion technology often ignores the high-frequency and low-frequency correlation of the audio, resulting in excessive smoothing of the recovered high-frequency spectrum, too dull subjective hearing, and insufficient expression ability. In order to solve this problem, a neural network model PCA-NN (principal components analysis-neural network) based on principal component image analysis is proposed. Based on the nonlinear characteristics of the audio image signal, the model reduces the dimension of high-dimensional data and realizes the effective recovery of the high-frequency detailed spectrum of audio signal in phase space. The results show that the PCA-NN, i.e., neural network based on principal component analysis, is superior to other audio expansion algorithms in subjective and objective evaluation; in log spectrum distortion evaluation, PCA-NN algorithm obtains smaller LSD. Compared with EHBE, Le, and La, the average LSD decreased by 2.286 dB, 0.51 dB, and 0.15 dB, respectively.

Following Jaques's work, the midlife crisis became a popular means of describing how-and why-men and women around the age of 40 became disillusioned with work, disenchanted with relationships and detached from family responsibilities. Post-war sociological and psychological studies of middle age regarded the midlife crisis as a manifestation of either biological or psychological change, as a moment in the life course when-perhaps for the first time-people felt themselves to be declining towards death. Although the midlife crisis has often been dismissed as a myth or satirized in novels and films, the concept has persisted not only in stereotypical depictions of rebellion and infidelity at midlife, but also in research that has sought to explain the particular social, physical and emotional challenges of middle age. In the spirit of the pioneering research of John Wilkins, John Bernal and Peter Medawar, each of whom in different ways emphasized the complex interrelations between science and society, I want to argue that the emergence of the midlife crisis-as concept and experience-during the middle decades of the twentieth century was not coincidental.

We aimed to investigate the association of BMI and different weight classes with outcomes in hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This cohort study is a secondary data analysis of the University of Louisville Pneumonia Study database, a prospective study of hospitalised adult patients with CAP from June, 2014, to May, 2016, in Louisville, KY, USA. BMI as a predictor was assessed both as a continuous and categorical variable. Patients were categorised as weight classes based on World Health Organization definitions: BMI of <18.5 kgm(?2) (underweight), BMI of 18.5 to <25 kgm(?2) (normal weight), BMI of 25.0 to <30 kgm(?2) (overweight), BMI of 30 to <35 kgm(?2) (obesity class I), BMI of 35 to <40 kgm(?2) (obesity class II), and BMI of 40 kgm(?2) (obesity class III). Study outcomes, including time to clinical stability, length of stay, clinical failure and mortality, were assessed in hospital, at 30 days, at 6 months and at 1 year. Clinical failure was defined as the need for noninvasive ventilation, invasive ventilation or vasopressors within 1 week of admission. Patient characteristics and crude outcomes were stratified by BMI categories, and generalised additive binomial regression models were performed to analyse the impact of BMI as a continuous variable on study outcomes adjusting for possible confounding variables. 7449 patients were included in the study. Median time to clinical stability was 2 days for every BMI group. There was no association between BMI as a continuous predictor and length of stay <5 days (chi-squared=1.83, estimated degrees of freedom (EDF)=2.74, p=0.608). Clinical failure was highest in the class III obesity group, and higher BMI as a continuous predictor was associated with higher odds of clinical failure. BMI as a continuous predictor was significantly associated with 30-day (chi-squared=39.97, EDF=3.07, p<0.001), 6-month (chi-squared=89.42, EDF=3.44, p<0.001) and 1-year (chi-squared=83.97, EDF=2.89, p<0.001) mortalities. BMI 24.14 kgm(?2) was a risk factor whereas BMI 26.97 kgm(?2) was protective for mortality at 1-year. The incremental benefit of increasing BMI plateaued at 35 kgm(?2). We found a protective benefit of obesity on mortality in CAP patients. However, we uniquely demonstrate that the association between BMI and mortality is not linear, and no incremental benefit of increasing BMI levels is observed in those with obesity classes II and III.","output":"Association between body mass index and mortality in hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mobile contact tracing apps have been developed by many countries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Trials have focussed on unobserved population trials or staged scenarios aimed to simulate real life. No efficacy measure has been developed that assesses the fundamental ability of any proximity detection protocol to accurately detect, measure, and therefore assess the epidemiological risk that a mobile phone owner has been placed at. This paper provides a fair efficacy formula that can be applied to any mobile contact tracing app, using any technology, allowing it's likely epidemiological effectiveness to be assessed. This paper defines such a formula and provides results for several simulated protocols as well as one real life protocol tested according to the standard methodology set out in this paper. The results presented show that protocols that use time windows greater than 30 seconds or that bucket their distance analogue (E.g. RSSI for Bluetooth) provide poor estimates of risk, showing an efficacy rating of less than 6%. The fair efficacy formula is shown in this paper to be able to be used to calculate the 'Efficacy of contact tracing' variable value as used in two papers on using mobile applications for contact tracing [6]. The output from the formulae in this paper, therefore, can be used to directly assess the impact of technology on the spread of a disease outbreak. This formula can be used by nations developing contact tracing applications to assess the efficacy of their applications. This will allow them to reassure their populations and increase the uptake of contact tracing mobile apps, hopefully having an effect on slowing the spread of COVID-19 and future epidemics.","output":"A fair efficacy formula for assessing the effectiveness of contact tracing applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectivesIt has been previously demonstrated that healthcare professionals would like additional education on medical cannabis. However, there has not yet been a review of the status of medical cannabis curriculum for medical and allied healthcare trainees worldwide, even though future healthcare workers will be placed on the forefront of patient care and must be prepared to counsel patients.

Selected articles were subsequently screened using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria.ResultsAllied healthcare trainees lacked sufficient knowledge about medical cannabis and did not feel prepared to counsel patients on this subject. Additionally, they expressed a growing interest in medical cannabis and would like more standardized education on the topic. Finally, faculty and deans in various institutions agreed on the need to educate students on the subject, and aimed to implement courses on medical cannabis or expand their existing curricula.ConclusionsWhile the medical cannabis landscape is developing, medical and allied health students are not properly educated and knowledgeable on this emerging field of clinical care.

First, some providers lost income due to postponed services or patients refraining from seeking care. Second, other providers took on new tasks by treating (high volumes of) COVID-19 patients.

We reviewed if and how countries have adjusted payments to health providers during 2020 using an analytical framework and data from 20 countries. The analysis is based on information collected in the COVID-19 Health System Response Monitor (HSRM) and complemented by grey literature by country representatives who are experts on health policy and have reported the developments and responses to the pandemic since is very onset. We found that payments were not adjusted for many providers whose income did not depend on activity such as salaries, capitations and budgets. Most of the compensatory payments were in the form of new salaries and budgets that substituted activity-based payments, and some higher fees to compensate for activity shortfalls. New FFS payments were created to incentivize virtual services. Payments for COVID-19 related costs included mainly new fees for services. Hospitals also received new budgets to cover the costs of adjusting wards, creating new (ICU) beds, and hiring more workforce. Some countries also created new per diem and DRG tariffs to pay for COVID-19 patients. Consumables such as personal protective equipment and hygiene material were provided in-kind or reimbursed in-cash. Overall, governments bore many COVID-19 financial risks. Payment adjustments should be carefully designed in order to protect providers from income shortfalls without undermining productivity, access or quality of care.

METHODS: The number of hospitalizations for self-harm (ICD-10 codes X60-X84) in France from 1st January to 31st August 2020 (including a two-month confinement) was compared to the same periods in 2017C2019. Statistical methods comprised Poisson regression, Cox regression and Student's t-test, plus Spearman's correlation test relating to spatial analysis of hospitalizations. OUTCOMES: There were 53,583 self-harm hospitalizations in France during January to August 2020. Compared to the same period in 2019, this represents an overall 85% decrease (Relative Risk [95% Confidence Interval] = 091 [090C093]).This decrease started in the first week of confinement and persisted until the end of August. Similarly, decrease was found in both women (RR=090 [088C092]) and men (RR=094 [091C095]), and in all age groups, except 65 years and older. Regarding self-harm hospitalizations by means category, increases were found for firearm (RR=120 [103C140]) and for jumping from heights (RR=110 [101C121]). There was a trend for more hospitalizations in intensive care (RR=103 [099C107]). The number of deaths at discharge from hospital also increased (Hazard Ratio = 119 [109C131]). Self-harm hospitalizations were weakly correlated with the rates of hospitalization for COVID-19 across administrative departments (Spearman's rho =-021; p = 003), but not with overall hospitalizations.

METHODS: Adults with COVID-19 were enrolled at medical centers in Israel, Germany, and the United States (Figure 1). Severe outcome was defined as intensive care unit admission, non-invasive or invasive ventilation, or death. Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), interferon gamma inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured using an analyzer providing values within 15 minutes (MeMed Key?). A signature indicating the likelihood of severe outcome was derived generating a score (0-100). Description of derivation cohort [Image: see text] RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Between March and November 2020, 518 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, of whom 394 were eligible, 29% meeting a severe outcome. Age ranged between 19-98 (median 61.5), with 59.1% male. Patients meeting severe outcomes exhibited higher levels of CRP and IP-10 and lower levels of TRAIL (Figure 2; p < 0.001). Likelihood of severe outcome increased significantly (p < 0.001) with higher scores. The signatures area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.86 (95% confidence interval: 0.81-0.91). Performance was not confounded by age, sex, or comorbidities and was superior to IL-6 (AUC 0.77; p = 0.033) and CRP (AUC 0.78; p < 0.001). Clinical deterioration proximal to blood draw was associated with higher signature score. Scores of patients meeting a first outcome over 3 days after blood draw were significantly (p < 0.001) higher than scores of non-severe patients (Figure 3). Moreover, the signature differentiated patients who further deteriorated after meeting a severe outcome from those who improved (p = 0.004) and projected 14-day survival probabilities (p < 0.001; Figure 4).

These viruses are widespread in birds, and they vary in antigenicity forming three major clades and numerous antigenic variants. The most important features of the human monoclonal antibody FLD194 studied here are its broad specificity for all major clades of H5 influenza HAs, its high affinity, and its ability to block virus infection, in vitro and in vivo. As a consequence, this antibody may be suitable for anti-H5 therapy and as a component of stockpiles, together with other antiviral agents, for health authorities to use if an appropriate vaccine was not available. Our mutation and structural analyses indicate that the antibody recognizes a relatively conserved site near the membrane distal tip of HA, near to, but distinct from, the receptor-binding site. Our analyses also suggest that the mechanism of infectivity neutralization involves prevention of receptor recognition as a result of steric hindrance by the Fc part of the antibody. Structural analyses by EM indicate that three Fab fragments are bound to each HA trimer. The structure revealed by X-ray crystallography is of an HA monomer bound by one Fab. The monomer has some similarities to HA in the fusion pH conformation, and the monomer's formation, which results from the presence of isopropanol in the crystallization solvent, contributes to considerations of the process of change in conformation required for membrane fusion.","output":"Structures of complexes formed by H5 influenza hemagglutinin with a potent broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibody."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Junior physicians report higher levels of psychological distress than senior doctors and report several barriers to seeking professional mental health support, including concerns about confidentiality and career progression. Mobile health (mHealth) apps may be utilized to help overcome these barriers to assist the emotional well-being of this population and encourage help-seeking. OBJECTIVE: This study describes the development and pilot trial of the Shift mHealth app to provide an unobtrusive avenue for junior physicians to seek information about, and help for, well-being and mental health concerns, which is sensitive to workplace settings. METHODS: A 4-phase iterative development process was undertaken to create the content and features of Shift involving junior physicians using the principles of user-centered design. These 4 phases wereneeds assessment, on the basis of interviews with 12 junior physicians; prototype development with user experience feedback from 2 junior physicians; evaluation, consisting of a pilot trial with 22 junior physicians to assess the usability and acceptability of the initial prototype; and redesign, including user experience workshops with 51 junior physicians. RESULTS: Qualitative results informed the content and design of Shift to ensure that the app was tailored to junior physicians needs. The Shift app prototype contained cognitive behavioral, mindfulness, value-based actions, and psychoeducational modules, as well as a tracking function that visualized patterns of daily variations in mood and health behaviors. Pilot-testing revealed possible issues with the organization of the app content, which were addressed through a thorough restructuring and redesign of Shift with the help of junior physicians across 3 user experience workshops. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the importance of ongoing end user involvement in the creation of a specialized mHealth app for a unique working population experiencing profession-specific stressors and barriers to help-seeking.

Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) is a soluble secreted protein that can antagonize Fas ligand (FasL)-induced apoptosis and promote tumorigenesis. It remains unclear whether TIPE can regulate DcR3 expression. In this study, we examined this question by analyzing the relationship between these factors in CRC. Bioinformatics and tissue microarrays were used to determine the expression of TIPE and DcR3 and their correlation in CRC. The expression of TIPE and DcR3 in colon cancer cells was detected. Plasma samples were collected from CRC patients, and DcR3 secretion was measured. Then, dual-luciferase reporter gene analysis was performed to assess the interaction between TIPE and DcR3. We exogenously altered TIPE expression and analyzed its function and influence on DcR3 secretion. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to stimulate TIPE-overexpressing HCT116 cells, and alterations in signaling pathways were detected. Additionally, inhibitors were used to confirm molecular mechanisms. We found that TIPE and DcR3 were highly expressed in CRC patients and that their expression levels were positively correlated. DcR3 was highly expressed in the plasma of cancer patients. We confirmed that TIPE and DcR3 were highly expressed in HCT116 cells. TIPE overexpression enhanced the transcriptional activity of the DcR3 promoter. TIPE activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to regulate the expression of DcR3, thereby promoting cell proliferation and migration and inhibiting apoptosis. In summary, TIPE and DcR3 are highly expressed in CRC, and both proteins are associated with poor prognosis. TIPE regulates DcR3 expression by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in CRC, thus promoting cell proliferation and migration and inhibiting apoptosis.

This paper theorises some of the ways in which that crisis can be understood in cultural and discursive terms, as a rupture in normativity, a disturbance in social relationality and as a state of exception. Drawing on Judith Butler's theories of performativity, the paper investigates how such a cultural rupture can be understood to affect performative subjectivity, identity and selfhood, whereby a breach in normative everydayness prompts the re-constitution of subjectivity itself. The paper explores how the reconfiguration of identity is experienced as corporeal and as a site of anxiety and lost dignity. The final section of the paper draws some initial conclusions about the potency of cultural and identity transformation for new ethics of non-violence, arguing that the obligation to resist norms of mobility and contact is an ethical obligation of necessary cohabitation.","output":"Identity in the disrupted time of COVID-19: Performativity, crisis, mobility and ethics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A total of 446 serum samples from 88 herds in Korea were examined for antibody to porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) using blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

In this paper, the transfer learning technique has been applied to clinical images of different types of pulmonary diseases, including COVID-19. It is found that COVID-19 is very much similar to pneumonia lung disease. Further findings are made to identify the type of pneumonia similar to COVID-19. Transfer Learning makes it possible for us to find out that viral pneumonia is same as COVID-19. This shows the knowledge gained by model trained for detecting viral pneumonia can be transferred for identifying COVID-19. Transfer Learning shows significant difference in results when compared with the outcome from conventional classifications. It is obvious that we need not create separate model for classifying COVID-19 as done by conventional classifications. This makes the herculean work easier by using existing model for determining COVID-19. Second, it is difficult to detect the abnormal features from images due to the noise impedance from lesions and tissues. For this reason, texture feature extraction is accomplished using Haralick features which focus only on the area of interest to detect COVID-19 using statistical analyses. Hence, there is a need to propose a model to predict the COVID-19 cases at the earliest possible to control the spread of disease. We propose a transfer learning model to quicken the prediction process and assist the medical professionals. The proposed model outperforms the other existing models. This makes the time-consuming process easier and faster for radiologists and this reduces the spread of virus and save lives.","output":"Detection of COVID-19 using CXR and CT images using Transfer Learning and Haralick features"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objectives To better target new vaccines and treatments being developed for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus (influenza), we studied the association of age with prevalence, diagnostic features and course of illness of these infections in primary care patients. Methods Secondary analysis of observational data on the aetiology, diagnosis and prognosis in adults presenting to primary care with acute cough in 12 European countries (2007-2010) using regression analyses corrected for clustering of patients within countries. Age groups were 18-59 years, 60-74 years, and 75 years and older (75+). Results Nasopharyngeal swabs for 144 (4.6%), 169 (5.4%) and 104 (3.4%) out of 3104 patients were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for RSV, influenza A and influenza B, respectively. RSV-prevalence in patients 75+ (8.5%) was twice the prevalence in those under 60 years (4.2%). Influenza prevalence was not associated with age. Diagnostic features for these viruses were not associated with age. Symptom duration was associated with age for RSV and influenza B, but not for influenza A. The odds of unresolved symptoms after 28 days was associated with age for RSV only. Illness deterioration was associated with age for RSV, with patients 75+ at increased risk, but not for influenza.

This would improve patient journeys through emergency medicine. The study objective was to derive, internally and externally validate machine learning models to predict emergency patient wait times that are applicable to a wide variety of emergency departments. Methods Twelve emergency departments provided three years of retrospective administrative data from Australia (2017-19). Descriptive and exploratory analyses were undertaken on the datasets. Statistical and machine learning models were developed to predict wait times at each site and were internally and externally validated. Model performance was tested on COVID-19 period data (January to June 2020). Results There were 1,930,609 patient episodes analysed and median site wait times varied from 24 to 54 minutes. Individual site model prediction median absolute errors varied from +/-22.6 minutes (95%CI 22.4,22.9) to +/- 44.0 minutes (95%CI 43.4,44.4). Global model prediction median absolute errors varied from +/-33.9 minutes (95%CI 33.4, 34.0) to +/-43.8 minutes (95%CI 43.7, 43.9). Random forest and linear regression models performed the best, rolling average models under-estimated wait times. Important variables were triage category, last-k patient average wait time, and arrival time. Wait time prediction models are not transferable across hospitals. Models performed well during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Conclusions Electronic emergency demographic and flow information can be used to approximate emergency patient wait times.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS Thirty patients (16 men and 14 women; mean age, 67 years) were prospectively recruited. Patients underwent three scans (one standard-dose scan and two low-dose scans at noise indexes [NIs] of 33, 60, and 70, respectively). All three scans were reconstructed with FBP, ASIR, and MBIR. Objective and subjective image qualities were compared. Dose-length products and effective doses for each scans were recorded. Mean image noise and attenuation values were compared between different reconstruction algorithms using repeated-measures analysis of variance and paired Student t tests. The interobserver variation between the two radiologists for subjective image quality and lesion assessment was estimated by using weighted kappa statistics. RESULTS Objective image analysis supports significant noise reduction with low-dose scans using the MBIR technique (p < 0.05). There was no significant change in mean CT numbers between different reconstructions (p > 0.05). Subjective analysis reveals no significant difference between image quality and diagnostic confidence between low-dose MBIR scans compared with standard-dose scans reconstructed using ASIR (p > 0.05). Average effective doses were 3.7, 1.2, and 0.9 mSv for standard scans at NIs of 33, 60, and 70, respectively. CONCLUSION MBIR shows superior noise reduction and improved image quality.

Despite consistent increases in LE for both males and females in Ethiopia, the country has simultaneously witnessed an increasing discrepancy in LE between males and females. METHODS: This study used Pollards actuarial method of decomposing LE to compare age- and cause- specific contributions to changes in sex differences in LE between 1995 and 2015 in Ethiopia. RESULTS: Life expectancy at birth in Ethiopia increased for both males and females from 48.28 years and 50.12 years in 1995 to 65.59 years and 69.11 years in 2015, respectively. However, the sex differences in LE at birth also increased from 1.85 years in 1995 to 3.51 years in 2015. Decomposition analysis shows that the higher male mortality was consistently due to injuries and respiratory infections, which contributed to 1.57 out of 1.85 years in 1995 and 1.62 out of 3.51 years in 2015 of the sex differences in LE. Increased male mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) also contributed to the increased difference in LE between males and females over the period, accounting for 0.21 out of 1.85 years and 1.05 out of 3.51 years in 1995 and 2015, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: While injuries and respiratory infections causing male mortality were the most consistent causes of the sex differences in LE in Ethiopia, morality from NCDs is the main cause of the recent increasing differences in LE between males and females. However, unlike the higher exposure of males to death from injuries due to road traffic injuries or interpersonal violence, to what extent sex differences are caused by the higher male mortality compared to female mortality from respiratory infection diseases is unclear. Similarly, despite Ethiopias weak social security system, an explanation for the increased sex differences after the age of 40 years due to either longer female LE or reduced male LE should be further investigated.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers an evidence-based behavioral weight management intervention called MOVE!, mostly delivered through in-person group sessions. Few eligible Veterans participate due to factors like distance and preferences, mirroring barriers in the general population. Practical alternatives to standard in-person programs are needed to improve access and engagement. A self-directed lifestyle intervention called D-ELITEdelivered through pre-recorded videos by DVD or online streamingpreviously efficacious in a general primary care population, may provide such an alternative. This pragmatic clinical trial will evaluate whether D-ELITE improves weight and general health status among Veterans with obesity, relative to VA usual care. The yearlong intervention includes one orientation by phone, supplemental lifestyle coaching primarily via technology-based messages, 12 DVD or online streaming sessions over 3 months, and continued self-directed weight management for months 4C12. Participants use MyFitnessPal.com or paper booklets for self-monitoring weight, diet, and physical activity. Follow-up assessments at 12 and 24 months are administered by mail or phone.

The precise mechanism of viral pathogenesis is not fully understood, which remains a major hurdle for medical intervention. Here we generated an interactome profile of protein-protein interactions based on host and viral protein structural similarities information. Further computational biological study combined with Gene enrichment analysis predicted key enriched pathways associated with viral pathogenesis. The results show that axon guidance, membrane trafficking, vesicle-mediated transport, apoptosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, Vpu mediated degradation of CD4 T cell, and interferon-gamma signaling are key events associated in SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Further, degree centrality analysis reveals that IRF1/9/7, TP53, and CASP3, UBA52, and UBC are vital proteins for IFN-?3-mediated signaling, apoptosis, and proteasomal degradation of CD4, respectively. We crafted chronological events of the virus life cycle. The SARS-CoV-2 enters through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and the genome is trafficked to the early endosomes in a RAB5-dependent manner. It is predicted to replicate in a double-membrane vesicle (DMV) composed of the endoplasmic reticulum, autophagosome, and ERAD machinery. The SARS-CoV-2 down-regulates host translational machinery by interacting with protein kinase R, PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, and heme-regulated inhibitor and can phosphorylate eIF2a.

Objective: This study was aimed to evaluate the correlation between PLR levels and the severity of COVID-19 patients in Zagazig University Hospital. Patients and Methods: At Zagazig University Hospitals' Isolation Hospital, a comparative cross-sectional study was conducted on 48 confirmed COVID-19 patients over the age of 18 of both sexes. Patients were categorized into two groups based on the severity of their symptoms (mild and severe) At least one of the following criteria was met by very ill patients: 1- Oxygen saturation is below 93% in the resting condition. 2- Breathing difficulty, RR equal or higher than 30 times/min. All patients underwent a laboratory investigations with assessment of PLR. Results: A higher platelet count/lymphocyte ratio was not related with more severe disease since the median in severe cases (197.31) was somewhat higher than the median in mild cases (184.72) with non-statistically significant differences. Our study proved a strong correlation between a decrease in platelet count and the severity of illness. Because of its low AUC of 0.559, PLR was ruled out as a diagnostic biomarker that might be used to predict the severity of disease. The optimal cut-off value was = 5.1464, sensitivity was 60%, specificity was 55.6%, positive predictive value (PPV) was 69.2%, negative predictive value (NPV) was 45.5% and its accuracy was 58.3% (p>0.05).

Methods: Hospitalised patients with moderate (n = 5) and severe (n = 5) COVID-19 were recruited and transfused with CP from donors who recovered from mild (n = 5), moderate (n = 5), or severe (n = 1) COVID-19. Neutralising antibodies (NAbs) to the virus were measured at the end of the study using a surrogate virus neutralisation test as an alternative to the plaque reduction assay. Clinical improvement was assessed based on the modified World Health Organization Research and Development Blueprint six-point scale, Brixia Chest-X-Ray scoring, and laboratory parameters. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04407208). Findings: CP transfusion in three doses of 3 mL/kg of recipient body weight at 2-day intervals was well tolerated. Good clinical improvement was achieved in all patients with moderate disease and in two patients with severe disease. Most patients at baseline had detectable NAbs with median inhibition rates comparable to those of the donors (9091% vs. 8631%; p = 0379). This could be due to the unavailability of pre-donation NAb testing and postponed CP administration that required communal consent. Interpretation: This study highlights the safety of CP therapy.

One population that might benefit from telehealth are individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS). Although FXS is the leading inherited cause of intellectual disability, it is nonetheless a low incidence disorder. Individuals with FXS and their families are involved in research studies, clinical trials and receive interventions - many of which are only offered in a few locations in the United States and thus, not easily accessible to many families. The current project explored the feasibility of using telehealth procedures to collect multimodal behavioural and psychological assessment data from these families. METHODS: Participation in the current study involved online surveys, measures of physiological indices of stress, live interviews and observations of mother-child interactions conducted via distance videoconferencing using the family's own technology when possible. Across all modes of data collection, we obtained information regarding the feasibility of participating entirely via distance by documenting missing data as well as each mother's overall impression of participating via distance. RESULTS: Our telehealth procedures were successfully implemented across a wide range of technology platforms with limited difficulty, and we documented little missing data due to technology-related challenges. Perhaps most importantly, however, our sample of mothers reported high satisfaction with participating via distance. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that a wide range of services and types of assessments may be amenable to telehealth procedures.

However, definitive evidence is lacking. We therefore conducted a feasibility and pilot trial for a large randomised controlled trial of sugammadex, neostigmine, and postoperative pulmonary complications. METHODS: Patients aged 40 years having elective or expedited abdominal or intrathoracic surgery were recruited in Australia and Hong Kong. Perioperative care was at the discretion of clinicians, except for the use of rocuronium and/or vecuronium for neuromuscular blockade and the randomised intervention (sugammadex or neostigmine) for reversal. Feasibility measurements included recruitment, crossover, acceptability, completeness, and workload. Trial coordinator feedback was systematically sought. Patient-reported quality of life was measured using the EQ-5D-5L score. The primary pilot outcome was the incidence of new pulmonary complications up to hospital discharge (or postoperative day 7 if still in hospital). RESULTS: Among 150 eligible patients, 120 consented to participate (recruitment rate 80%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 73 to 86%). The randomised intervention was administered without crossover to 115 of 117 patients who received reversal (98%, 95% CI 94 to 100%). The protocol was acceptable or highly acceptable to the anaesthetist in 108 of 116 cases (93%, 95% CI 87 to 97%; missing = 4). Four patients of the 120 patients were lost to follow-up at 3 months (3.3%, 95% CI 0.9 to 8.3%). Case report forms were complete at 3 months for all remaining patients. The median time to complete trial processes was 3.5 h (range 2.5C4.5 h). Trial coordinators reported no barriers to trial processes. Patients were aged 64 (standard deviation 11) years, 70 (58%) were male and 50 (42%) were female, and planned surgeries were thoracic (23 [19%]), upper abdominal (41 [34%]), and lower abdominal (56 [47%]). The primary outcome was observed in 5 (8.5%) of the 59 sugammadex patients and 5 (8.2%) of the 61 neostigmine patients (odds ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.28 to 3.67).

There is great uncertainty regarding how countries' characteristics will affect the spread of the epidemic; to date, there are few studies that attempt to predict the spread of the epidemic in African countries. In this paper, we investigate the role of demographic patterns, urbanisation and comorbidities on the possible trajectories of COVID-19 in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal. METHODS: We use an augmented deterministic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model to predict the true spread of the disease, under the containment measures taken so far. We disaggregate the infected compartment into asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic and severely symptomatic to match observed clinical development of COVID-19. We also account for age structures, urbanisation and comorbidities (HIV, tuberculosis, anaemia). RESULTS: In our baseline model, we project that the peak of active cases will occur in July, subject to the effectiveness of policy measures. When accounting for the urbanisation, and factoring in comorbidities, the peak may occur between 2 June and 17 June (Ghana), 22 July and 29 August (Kenya) and, finally, 28 May and 15 June (Senegal). Successful containment policies could lead to lower rates of severe infections. While most cases will be mild, we project in the absence of policies further containing the spread, that between 0.78% and 1.03%, 0.61% and 1.22%, and 0.60% and 0.84% of individuals in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal, respectively, may develop severe symptoms at the time of the peak of the epidemic. CONCLUSION: Compared with Europe, Africa's younger and rural population may modify the severity of the epidemic. The large youth population may lead to more infections but most of these infections will be asymptomatic or mild, and will probably go undetected. The higher prevalence of underlying conditions must be considered.","output":"The relatively young and rural population may limit the spread and severity of COVID-19 in Africa: a modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Stent retrievers apply mechanical force to the intracranial vasculature. Our aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the long Solitaire 4  40 mm stent retriever for large vessel occlusion in stroke patients. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients treated for acute ischemic large vessel occlusion stroke with the Solitaire 2 FR 4  40 device between May and October 2016 at our institution. Patient-specific data at baseline and at discharge were documented. Reperfusion was graded with the thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) classification. Postinterventional angiograms and follow-up cross-sectional imaging were used to evaluate complications. RESULTS TICI 2b/3 recanalization was achieved in 20 of 23 patients (87.0%), in 17 patients with the first retriever pass. NIHSS improved from a mean score at presentation of 16 (range 4-36) to 11 (range 0-41) at discharge. Mean mRS score at discharge was 3 (range 0-6) and 3 (range 0-6) at 90 days post-treatment. No infarcts in other territories were observed. One patient showed a (reversible) vasospasm in the postinterventional angiogram and another a small contrast extravasation in follow-up imaging. CONCLUSION The Solitaire 2 FR 4  40 stent retriever is a safe and efficient device for large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke with a high recanalization rate and a low peri- and postinterventional complication rate together with a good clinical outcome. Despite potentially higher friction and shearing forces, no increased incidence of visible damage to the vessel wall was observed.","output":"Safety of the Solitaire 4  40 mm Stent Retriever in the Treatment of Ischemic Stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In dogs with bacterial cystitis that is resistant to multiple antibiotics, resulting from repeated infections andantimicrobial administration, especially if the dog has impaired renal function and the induction of systemic side effectsby intravenous or oral administration is a concern, intravesical instillation of antibiotics might represent an alternativetreatment option. In human and veterinary medicine, a number of studies showed intravesical instillation of antibiotics iseffective for the therapy multidrug-resistant bacterial urinary tract infection (UTI).

The risk factors for the recurrent UTI were spinal cord injury and CKD which had been managed for 1 year. Ultrasound-guided cystocentesis wasperformed to obtain a urine sample for urinalysis, bacteriologic culture, and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Bacterialcystitis caused by multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli was diagnosed on the basis of bacterial culture, and antimicrobialsusceptibility testing. Because the dog had CKD, reducing the clearance of meropenem, intravesical instillation of antibiotics was initiated. The intravesical instillation process consisted of the emptying of the urinary bladder, infusion of adiluted meropenem solution (8.5 mg/kg diluted in 20 mL of saline solution) into the bladder through a urethral catheter,and retention of the meropenem solution in the bladder for 1 h, and its removal.

To investigate how interhomolog sequence polymorphism affects crossovers, we sequenced multiple recombinant populations of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Crossovers were elevated in the diverse pericentromeric regions, showing a local preference for polymorphic regions. We provide evidence that crossover association with elevated diversity is mediated via the Class I crossover formation pathway, although very high levels of diversity suppress crossovers. Interhomolog polymorphism causes mismatches in recombining molecules, which can be detected by MutS homolog (MSH) mismatch repair protein heterodimers. Therefore, we mapped crossovers in a msh2 mutant, defective in mismatch recognition, using multiple hybrid backgrounds. Although total crossover numbers were unchanged in msh2 mutants, recombination was remodelled from the diverse pericentromeres towards the less-polymorphic sub-telomeric regions. Juxtaposition of megabase heterozygous and homozygous regions causes crossover remodelling towards the heterozygous regions in wild type Arabidopsis, but not in msh2 mutants. Immunostaining showed that MSH2 protein accumulates on meiotic chromosomes during prophase I, consistent with MSH2 regulating meiotic recombination. Our results reveal a pro-crossover role for MSH2 in regions of higher sequence diversity in A. thaliana.","output":"MSH2 shapes the meiotic crossover landscape in relation to interhomolog polymorphism in Arabidopsis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A marked increase in frequency of acute acral eruptions (AAE) was observed in children during the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring period. Objectives: In this observational multicenter study, based on children with AAE, we aimed to assess the proportion of household members possibly infected by SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We collected data from all children observed with AAE, prospectively from April 7, 2020 to June 22, 2020, and retrospectively since February 28, 2020. The primary outcome was the household infection rate, defined as the proportion of family clusters having at least one member with COVID-19 infection other than the child with AAE (index child). The definition of a case was based on characteristic clinical signs and a positive PCR or serology. Results: The study included 103 children in 10 French departments and in Quebec. The median age was 13 years and the interquartile range [8-15], with a female-to-male ratio of 1/1.15. In children with AAE, all PCR tests were negative (n=18), and serology was positive in 2/14 (14.3%) cases. We found no significant anomalies in the lab results. 66 of the 103 families (64.1%) of included children had at least one other infected member apart from the index child. The total number of household members was 292, of whom 119 (40.8%) were considered possibly infected by SARS-CoV-2. No index children or households exhibited severe COVID-19. Discussion: Among the 103 households included, 64.1% had at least one infected member.

Seroconversion is measured frequently around the world, but the milk conversion rate is unknown. RESEARCH AIMS: To determine (1) the prevalence and (2) the dynamics of immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human milk amongst lactating mothers in the Netherlands. METHODS: In this large prospective cohort study, lactating mothers (N = 2312) were included between October 12, 2020 and February 24, 2021. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine levels of IgA antibodies in human milk and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in serum against the ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. RESULTS: A total of 691 (30.6%) participants had SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in human milk and/or serum. Of these participants, 524 (23.1%) had IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human milk, and 356 (15.7%) had IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum. A total of 199 (8.8%) participants had antibodies in both human milk and serum. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA antibodies in human milk remain present at least 10 months after a polymerase chain reaction confirmed infection. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human milk was 23.1% in our cohort. This high prevalence of antibodies in human milk might lead to passive immunity in many breastfed infants and may serve as protection against COVID-19.","output":"Antibodies Against SARS-CoV-2 in Human Milk: Milk Conversion Rates in the Netherlands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we propose and validate with data extracted from the city of Santiago, capital of Chile, a methodology to assess the actual impact of lockdown measures based on the anonymized and geolocated data from credit card transactions Using unsupervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) semantic topic discovery, we identify temporal patterns in the use of credit cards that allow us to quantitatively assess the changes in the behavior of the people under the lockdown measures because of the COVID-19 pandemic An unsupervised latent topic analysis uncovers the main patterns of credit card transaction activity that explain the behavior of the inhabitants of Santiago City The approach is non-intrusive because it does not require the collaboration of people for providing the anonymous data It does not interfere with the actual behavior of the people in the city;hence, it does not introduce any bias We identify a strong downturn of the economic activity as measured by credit card transactions (down to 70%), and thus of the economic activity, in city sections (communes) that were subjected to lockdown versus communes without lockdown This change in behavior is confirmed by independent data from mobile phone connectivity The reduction of activity emerges before the actual lockdowns were enforced, suggesting that the population was spontaneously implementing the required measures for slowing virus propagation","output":"Non-Intrusive Assessment of COVID-19 Lockdown Follow-Up and Impact Using Credit Card Information: Case Study in Chile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 has become a worldwide pandemic that is seriously jeopardising people's health.

These studies assume the availability of a sufficient amount of human-annotated data to train models that can generalize to corresponding test data. In real-world situations, however, researchers often have limited or no in-house training data. Existing systems and external data can help jump-start deidentification on in-house data; however, the most efficient way of utilizing existing systems and external data is unclear. This article investigates the transferability of a state-of-the-art neural clinical deidentification system, NeuroNER, across a variety of datasets, when it is modified architecturally for domain generalization and when it is trained strategically for domain transfer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a comparative study of the transferability of NeuroNER using 4 clinical note corpora with multiple note types from 2 institutions. We modified NeuroNER architecturally to integrate 2 types of domain generalization approaches. We evaluated each architecture using 3 training strategies. We measured transferability from external sources; transferability across note types; the contribution of external source data when in-domain training data are available; and transferability across institutions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Transferability from a single external source gave inconsistent results. Using additional external sources consistently yielded an F1-score of approximately 80%. Fine-tuning emerged as a dominant transfer strategy, with or without domain generalization. We also found that external sources were useful even in cases where in-domain training data were available.

We investigated the effect of the deficient and excessive VitD on emotion, behavior and attention. METHODS 351 preschool children in a multicenter study in Shanghai, China that had serum 25(OH)D measurements and emotion, behavior and attention measures were included in the analyses. In animal experiments, C57 mice were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 8): control (C) group, VitD deficiency (VDD) group, and VitD overdose (VDO) group. The emotion, behavior and attention of juvenile mice were evaluated through the behavioral experiments. RESULTS There was an \\"U\\" relationship between serum 25(OH)D concentration and emotion, behavior and attention. Compared with 20-40 ng/mL group, the odds ratios (ORs) were 1.5 (1.0, 4.8) for emotional problem, 3.8 (1.2, 12.1) for conduct problem and 1.8 (1.1, 5.7) for inattention in <20 ng/mL group. Meanwhile, compared with 20-40 ng/mL group, ORs were 9.5 (2.9, 31.4) for impulsive hyperactivity, and 3.9 (1.2, 12.9) for conduct problem in >40 ng/mL group. Consistent with the results in children, animal experiments showed that the attention level decreased in VDD group, while the anxiety level, hyperactive level and aggressiveness in VDD group and VDO group were significantly increased, respectively.

The need to continue offering physical exercise to individuals after stroke became an emergency. However, these individuals may have barriers to adhere to the programs delivered remotely. There is a lack of evidence related to adherence, attendance, safety, and satisfaction of remote exercise programs for this population. Objective: The aim was to evaluate adherence and barriers to attend a remote physical exercise program for individuals after stroke. We aimed (a) to identify adherence and attendance rate of the remote physical exercise program (i.e., number of participants engaged, number of sessions attended, and exercise time in remote program); (b) to identify the safety of a remote physical exercise program (i.e., falls, pain, or dizziness when performing the exercises, fear, or insecurity); and (c) to identify the overall experience to participate in a remote program. Materials and methods: This is a longitudinal study, including 36 stroke survivors who already attended a face-to-face physical exercise program prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The remote physical exercise program included sessions for 2 days/week for a duration of 22 weeks, with a total of 44 sessions, which were delivered asynchrony via recorded video sessions. As outcome measures, we performed two questionnaires (via weekly telephone calls) to identify attendance, barriers, safety, and overall experience related to the program. Results: The adherence rate was 86 (9%). The attendance rate was 19, with a total of 8 sessions (108.3 min/week). The main barriers for lower attendance rate were as follows: lack of motor skills and physical fitness to workout in 80 reports (20.6%), followed by no exercise companion in 44 reports (11.3%). The remote physical program has been shown to be safe, and the overall experience was positive from the perspectives of the participants and the family members. Conclusion: Although the adherence rate was high, the attendance rate was low on the remote physical exercise program. The main barriers to attending the program remotely reflect the need of tailoring individually an asynchrony mode of delivering the sessions to individuals after stroke.

Recombinants invariably inherited all four coat proteins from the same parent, and novel recombinant proteins were not observed. RNAase T1 fingerprints of virus RNA, prepared from representatives of each recombinant type, confirmed the approximate crossover sites that had been deduced from the inheritance of proteins.

Severe cases can have case fatality ratio 25% or higher in low-middle income countries, but early diagnosis and timely treatment have a proven benefit. The Smart Triage program in Jinja Regional Referral Hospital in Uganda will provide expedited sepsis treatment in children through a data-driven electronic patient triage system. To complement the ongoing Smart Triage interventional trial, we propose methods for a concurrent cost-effectiveness analysis of the Smart Triage platform. METHODS: We will use a decision-analytic model taking a societal perspective, combining government and out-of-pocket costs, as patients bear a sizeable portion of healthcare costs in Uganda due to the lack of universal health coverage. Previously published secondary data will be used to link healthcare utilization with costs and intermediate outcomes with mortality. We will model uncertainty via probabilistic sensitivity analysis and present findings at various willingness-to-pay thresholds using a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. DISCUSSION: Our proposed analysis represents a first step in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of an innovative digital triage platform designed to improve clinical outcomes in pediatric sepsis through expediting care in low-resource settings. Our use of a decision analytic model to link secondary costing data, incorporate post-discharge healthcare utilization, and model clinical endpoints is also novel in the pediatric sepsis triage literature for low-middle income countries. Our analysis, together with subsequent analyses modelling budget impact and scale up, will inform future modifications to the Smart Triage platform, as well as motivate scale-up to the district and national levels.

However, the experience regarding the use of Telemedicine in neuromuscular disorders is very limited and the scientific literature is extremely scarce. From the first experiences in the '50s, the development of Telemedicine has been supplemented and supported by the implementation of ICT to guarantee the secure and effective transmission of medical data. Italian national guidelines (2010-2020) describe the technical and professional guarantees necessary to provide Telemedicine services. Nevertheless, at the time the pandemic appeared, no guidelines for clinical evaluation or for the administration of functional scales remotely were available for neuromuscular diseases. This has been a critical point when clinical evaluations were mandatory also for the renewal of drug prescriptions. However, the common opinion that telemedicine basic services were important to overcome the change in medical practice due to COVID-19 in neuromuscular diseases, even in pediatric age, emerged. Moreover, alternative digital modalities to evaluate patients at home in a kind of virtual clinic were considered as a field of future development.","output":"Telemedicine applied to neuromuscular disorders: focus on the COVID-19 pandemic era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To evaluate incidental findings in major trauma patients, and to explore whether computed tomography (CT) could be used to assess prevalence and estimate disease spread in the general population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population included all patients admitted following major trauma between 1 January 2020 and 30 April 2020 with CT including the lungs (n=523). Major trauma patients admitted pre-COVID-19 from 1-31 January and 1-31 March 2019 comprised a control group (n=252). The assessing radiologists, blinded to the time period, used double reading with consensus to determine if the patient had CT signs of COVID-19. Lung appearances were classified as no evidence of COVID-19; minor signs; or major signs. The proportion of patients with incidental COVID-19 changes was recorded over the study period, and the percentage of the population who had been affected by COVID-19 by the end of April 2020 estimated. RESULTS: CT appearances consistent with COVID-19 began to exceed a background pre-COVID rate in the second week of February and did not decline until 2 weeks after lockdown. By the end of April 2020, approximately 45% of the population had been infected. CONCLUSIONS: CT of major trauma patients can be used to monitor the spread of COVID-19. This novel technique could be used retrospectively or prospectively anywhere where trauma scans are available, to monitor the disease in the local population.","output":"COVID-19: could CT provide the best population level biomarker?

Renal scintigraphy using glomerularly filtered tracers allows combined acquisition of renograms and GFR estimation but requires repeated blood sampling for several hours. In contrast, dynamic PET imaging using the glomerularly filtered tracer [(68)Ga]Ga-DOTA bears the potential to non-invasively estimate the GFR by compartmental kinetic modelling. Here, we report the, to our knowledge, first comparison of human renal dynamic [(68)Ga]Ga-DOTA PET imaging in comparison to renal scintigraphy and compare PET-derived to serum creatinine-derived GFR measurements. METHODS: Dynamic [(68)Ga]Ga-DOTA PET data were acquired for 30 min immediately after tracer injection in 12 patients. PET and renal scintigraphy images were visually interpreted in a consensus read by three nuclear medicine physicians. The functional renal cortex was segmented to obtain time-activity curves. The arterial input function was estimated from the PET signal in the abdominal aorta. Single-compartmental tracer kinetic modelling was performed to calculate the GFR using complete 30-min (GFR(PET-30)) and reduced 15-min PET data sets (GFR(PET-15)) to evaluate whether a shorter acquisition time is sufficient for an accurate GFR estimation. A modified approach excluding minutes 2 to 10 was applied to reduce urinary spill-over effects. Serum creatinine-derived GFR(CKD) (CKD-EPI-formula) was used as reference standard. RESULTS: PET image interpretation revealed the same findings as conventional scintigraphy (2/12 patients with both- and 1/12 patients with right-sided urinary obstruction). Model fit functions were substantially improved for the modified approach to exclude spill-over. Depending on the modelling approach, GFR(CKD) and both GFR(PET-30) and GFR(PET-15) were well correlated with interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) from 0.74 to 0.80 and Pearsons correlation coefficients (PCCs) from 0.74 to 0.81. For a subgroup of patients with undisturbed urinary efflux (n = 9), correlations were good to excellent (ICCs from 0.82 to 0.95 and PCCs from 0.83 to 0.95). Overall, GFR(PET-30) and GFR(PET-15) were excellently correlated (ICCs from 0.96 to 0.99 and PCCs from 0.96 to 0.99). CONCLUSION: Renal [(68)Ga]Ga-DOTA PET can be a suitable alternative to conventional scintigraphy. Visual assessment of PET images and conventional renograms revealed comparable results. GFR values derived by non-invasive single-compartmental-modelling of PET data show a good correlation to serum creatinine-derived GFR values. In patients with undisturbed urinary efflux, the correlation was excellent. Dynamic PET data acquisition for 15 min is sufficient for visual evaluation and GFR derivation.

We discuss our strategies for optimal breast cancer management during COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study at Clnico San Carlos Hospital to analyze breast cancer patient management during the pandemic outbreak and surgical strategy after the pandemic outbreak. We created a practical and dynamic tool based on a \\"traffic light\\" system for prioritizing surgical time. Every patient was contacted by telephone with a preoperative COVID-19 protocol. After surgical procedures, patient satisfaction was assessed using EORTC IN-PATSAT32. RESULTS: Breast cancer patients actively treated with surgical procedures were put on a waiting list and received systemic therapy. Telemedicine was used to evaluate any side effects and to avoid unnecessary hospital visits. Surgery was only considered after the pandemic outbreak and then only those procedures designed to minimize surgical complications and therefore reduce hospital stay. We also measured patients satisfaction with medical and nursing scales that resulted very good evaluation tending to excellent.

Since services resumed in June, 2020 (ie, following the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic), several new procedures to reduce COVID-19 transmission have been implemented, but the extent to which these measures are acceptable to patients has not yet been examined. We aimed to assess patient attitudes towards the measures implemented within St Mark's Bowel Cancer Screening Centre, St Mark's Hospital, Harrow, UK. Methods We surveyed patients who underwent colonoscopy after their procedure and asked a series of questions using the five-point Likert scales. Factor analysis was used to group questions into mutually exclusive groups, with three factors were subsequently identified: attitudes towards measures to reduce hospital-based COVID-19 transmission (factor 1; five items), attitudes towards precolonoscopy COVID-19 swabbing (factor 2; two items), and attitudes towards protective clothing (factor 3; two items). Scales ranged from five to 25 for factor 1 and two to ten for factors 2 and 3 (with higher scores representing more positive attitudes). Descriptive statistics were used to calculate means, whereas linear regression was used to test associations between participant demographics, COVID-19 anxiety, and bowel cancer anxiety with attitudinal factors. Participation in the study was voluntary and consent was obtained from all participants. Findings Of the 408 patients invited, 288 patients (71%) who underwent colonoscopy between July 1, 2020, and May 1, 2021, were surveyed. Participants were predominantly men (n=182; 63%) and of White (n=167; 58%) or South Asian ethnicity (n=59; 20%; the mean age of all participants was 6652 years [SD 529]). The mean score was 2312 for factor 1, 760 for factor 2, and 815 for factor 3. South Asian adults were less positive towards measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission (factor 1; 2304) than White adults (2318;  coefficient 031; p=0035). COVID-19 anxiety was the only predictor of attitudes towards protective clothing (factor 3), with higher COVID-19 anxiety being associated with more positive attitudes towards protective clothing (025; p=0037). Interpretation Attitudes towards COVID-19 prevention measures were highly positive. Future service evaluation should focus on reassuring South Asian patients of measures to reduce hospital-related infection (eg, through information provision).

Depression was less likely in neurosurgeons who had minor concerns, compared with those with significant health concerns for their families (OR, 0.36). In multivariate analysis after controlling for effects of other covariates, odds of depression were significantly higher among neurosurgeons who did not feel safe with the provided personal protective equipment (OR, 2.43) and who were exposed to a COVID-19-positive colleague (OR, 2.54). Participants who had moderate concerns for their families had lesser odds of anxiety/depression than did those with significant concerns (OR, 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the modifiable risk factors of depression in this study, it is recommended that the safety of neurosurgeons be ensured by providing appropriate safety measures for them to regain their confidence and hence reduce the incidence of depression.","output":"COVID 19-Depression and Neurosurgeons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Association of American Medical Colleges suggested that medical students not be involved in direct patient care activities in the United States because of the COVID pandemic. Our objectives are to (1) describe the rapid creation and implementation of a fully online simulation-based pediatric emergency medicine training intervention for medical student learners using existing simulation center staff (faculty, technicians, actors) and resources (simulation technology, scenario files) and (2) report student and faculty feedback on the intervention. METHODS: The sessions involved the use of our existing simulation center faculty, staff, and resources. Feedbacks on the sessions were collected via a survey from faculty and students at the end of each session. RESULTS: Sixteen simulation sessions were conducted (8 febrile infant, 8 anaphylactic toddler). Forty-eight students, 2 technicians, 2 actors, and 10 faculty participated. Ninety percent of the students agreed with the statements, I am more comfortable with pediatrics after this session, participating improved my pediatric knowledge/skills, this session was more useful than other learning activities I am involved in at this time. Seventy percent of the students agreed with the statement, I learned as much from observing as when I was actively involved. All faculty agreed with the statement, this was an effective educational strategy compared to other distance learning. Most faculty (60%) disagreed with the statement, virtual simulation was equal to or superior to in-person simulation.

The aim of this study was to identify which blood tests could be used to assist in diagnosing COVID-19. METHOD: A retrospective review was performed on consecutive patients referred to hospital with a clinical suspicion of COVID-19 over a period of four weeks. The patient's clinical presentation and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR) were recorded. The patients were divided by diagnosis into COVID (COVID-19 infection) or CONTROL (an alternate diagnosis). A retrospective review of consecutive patients over a further two-week period was used for the purposes of validation. RESULTS: Overall, 399 patients (53% COVID, 47% CONTROL) were analysed. White cell count, neutrophils and lymphocytes were significantly lower, while lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin were significantly higher, in the COVID group in comparison to CONTROL. Combining the white cell count, lymphocytes and ferritin results into a COVID Combined Blood Test (CCBT) had an area under the curve of 0.79. Using a threshold CCBT of -0.8 resulted in a sensitivity of 0.85 and a specificity of 0.63. Analysing this against a further retrospective review of 181 suspected COVID-19 patients, using the same CCBT threshold, resulted in a sensitivity of 0.73 and a specificity of 0.75. The sensitivity was comparable to the SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR. DISCUSSION: Mathematically combining the blood tests has the potential to assist clinical acumen allowing for rapid streaming and more accurate patient flow pending definitive diagnosis.

The epidemic spread in China and beyond its borders, involving 114 countries with more than 5 million dead. On March 11, the WHO declared the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to be a pandemic and encouraged nations to adopt harsh restrictive measures. Therefore, patients more and more often turn to dental offices only for emergencies. Healthcare professionals, including dentists, are at high infectious risk. In fact, the closeness to the oral cavity and nasopharynx and the use of drills or ultrasonic devices that cause aerosol release, make dental professions at high risk of bacterial and viral infections. The way patients are treated has changed. In fact, it should be mandatory to carry out a pre-treatment telephone triage and the use of mouthwashes to reduce bacterial load. In the current pandemic, it is necessary to adopt specific safety protocols that can protect dental operators as well as limit the spread of the virus. The purpose of this review is to present an overview on ways to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contagion in dentistry by focusing on the immediate situation as well as by looking towards the future.

Recent evidence suggests that opioid epidemics are getting worse with the COVID-19 crisis. The increase in opioid abuse could be attributed to the extended lockdowns and the social distancing recommendations, hindering chronic pain patients' access to regular office visits and monitoring in addition to limited access to behavioral services like group therapies and other pain management interventions. Use of telemedicine as an alternative to in-person follow-up visits has faced many limitations due to technological challenges and cost. Chronic pain patients living in developing countries face extra burden during the pandemic. Limited access to outpatient clinics and hesitance to visit hospitals due to COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to reduction in supply of opioids, are some of the limiting factors. Unfortunately, the low-income class with limited financial capabilities faces further barriers to access the chronic pain services and treatments like opioid prescriptions. Medical entities involved in care of chronic pain patients have adopted different strategies to overcome these challenges. In addition to expanding on educational programs to medical staff and patients, modifying the strict opioid pre-scribing and dispensing regulations has been successful. Another positive trend has been the growing use of opioid sparing interventions, such as multimodal analgesia, regional blocks, and interventional pain procedures.","output":"Opioid epidemics during the pandemic: Further insights to the same story"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Recent evidence indicates a potential therapeutic role of fluvoxamine for COVID-19. In the TOGETHER randomized platform clinical trial for acutely symptomatic patients with COVID-19, we assessed the efficacy of fluvoxamine vs. placebo in preventing either extended emergency room observation or hospitalization due to COVID-19. Herein, we report the preliminary findings. Methods This placebo-controlled, randomized, adaptive, platform trial conducted among symptomatic Brazilian adults confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 included eligible patients with a known risk factor for progression to severe disease. Patients were randomly assigned to either fluvoxamine (100 mg twice daily for 10 days) or placebo. The primary endpoint was a composite outcome of emergency room observation for >6 hours or hospitalization from COVID-19 up to 28 days post randomization. Secondary outcomes included viral clearance at day 7, time to hospitalization, mortality, and adverse drug reactions. We used a Bayesian analytic framework to determine effects along with probability of success of intervention compared to placebo. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04727424) and is ongoing. Results The study team screened 9020 potential participants for this trial. The trial was initiated on June 2, 2020, with the current protocol reporting randomization from January 15, 2021 to August 6th 2021, when the trial arms were stopped for superiority. A total of 3238 patients were allocated to fluvoxamine (n=739), placebo (n=733) and other treatments (n=1766). Herein, we report the effectiveness of fluvoxamine vs. a concurrent placebo control. The average age of participants was 50 years (range 18-102 years); 57% were female. The proportion of patients observed in an emergency room for >6 hours or admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 was lower for the fluvoxamine group compared to placebo (77/739 vs 108/733; Relative Risk [RR]: 0.71; 95% Bayesian Credible Interval [95% BCI]: 0.54 - 0.93), with a probability of superiority of 99.4% surpassing the prespecified superiority threshold of 97.6% (risk difference 4.3%). Of the composite primary outcome events, 88% were hospitalizations. We found no significant relative effects between the fluvoxamine and placebo groups on viral clearance at day 7 (Odds ratio [OR]: 0.75; 95% Confidence Intervals [95% CI]: 0.53 - 1.07), mortality (OR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.36 - 1.30), time to death (Hazard ratio [HR]: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.58 - 1.08), days hospitalized (Mean Difference (MD) 1.22 days; 95% CI: 0.98 - 1.53), number of days ventilated (MD 1.10; 95% CI: 0.70 - 1.73) or other secondary outcomes. Data capturing all 28 days of follow-up will be reported after August 26th, 2021. Conclusions Treatment with fluvoxamine (100 mg twice daily for 10 days) among high-risk outpatients with early diagnosed COVID-19, reduced the need for extended emergency room observation or hospitalization.

As a result of the pandemic, there is a strong ethical or moral imperative to consider how to help the most generous people usage healthy products. Utilitarianism and Kantian have become popular ethical theories that state the right actions that layout clear and actionable principles. This paper reviews (1) how Utilitarianism and Kantianism theories could produce benefit arguments on ethical purchases of cosmetic products from an advertising context, (2) how these theories contributed in the context of COVID-19 to help reduce any harmful health issues via advertising, and (3) Utilitarianism and Kantian theories have proven useful during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to case studies of cosmetics products and advertising in Western and Asian contexts. In addition to these two ethical theories, this paper discussed other issues. The purpose is not to argue which theory is the only relevant ethical theory but to contend with pure utilitarianism. Kantian's finding was similar to the topic argument in other ways. However, both theories reviewed as the most effective way to help societies identify and perceive the necessary costs of goods values. Before adopting utilitarian or Kantian theories, the community must clearly understand these two theories' merit values in product advertising.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty-nine patients who developed gastric leakage out of 4294 patients who underwent LSG from 2010 to 2018 were considered in this study. Patients' outcomes in terms of incidence of resolution and time to leakage resolution were compared by leakage characteristics and type of treatment. Three patients were lost to follow up. RESULTS Leakage occurred in a median of 6 days from surgery, and for majority of patients (80.3%), it was in the upper part of the sleeve. The median dimension of leakage was 6.5 mm. Low level leakage resulted in a lower time of resolution (p < 0.001). Patients with clinical leakage were treated with surgery or endoscopic placement of a self-expandable metal stent (SEMS). The median time of leakage resolution was 42 days. The hospitalization time for SEMS was shorter with a 68.3% of complete resolution compared with the 29.4% of surgery. In patients with subclinical and small leakage, a conservative treatment was successful in 87.5%. Overall 39.4% of patients needed a second line treatment after that the first failed. CONCLUSION Leakage could be treated conservatively if subclinical and < 5 mm. Surgery is mandatory if a perigastric collection is present or an organ lesion is suspected.

We systematically reviewed all the studies about thrombotic events on COVID-19 patients in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, MedRxiv, bioRxiv, from Dec 1, 2019 to July 5, 2020. The weighted mean difference (MD) or odds ratio (OR) or relative risk (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for clinical data in COVID-19 patients with or without thrombotic events was calculated. Results 12 articles contained 1083 patients were included for meta-analysis. The prevalence of thrombosis was 22 % (95 % CI 0.08C0.40) in COVID-19 patients and increased to 43 % (95 % CI 0.29C0.65) after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Compared with non-thrombotic patients, thrombotic patients had higher levels of D-dimer (MD = 2.79 g/ml, 95 % CI 2.27C3.31 g/ml), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (MD = 112.71 U/L, 95 % CI 62.40C163.02 U/L), and white blood cells (WBC) (MD = 1.14 *109/L, 95 % CI 0.47C1.81*109/L) while decreased lymphocytes (MD= -0.20*109/L, 95 % CI -0.38 C -0.02*109/L).

We have analyzed Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccine integrity under different movement conditions to provide information that may improve the distribution of vaccines to the target population. METHODS: Syringes of reconstituted Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines were prepared in a laminar flow chamber to be subjected to a stability analysis in order to evaluate the impact of movement conditions on mRNA integrity. RNA integrity was checked by the lack of RNA peaks under the original mRNA peak in the electropherogram resulting from potential fragments from RNA degradation. Samples were then exposed for 180 min at room temperature (211C, 5510% of humidity) under different movement conditions. RESULTS: We report that the integrity of the mRNA of the COVID-19 reconstituted vaccines after continuous moderate movement at room temperature is maintained for at least three hours with values of fluorescence units (FU) under the original mRNA peak of 0.380.06 in Pfizer-BioNTech and 0.961.18 FU in Moderna, equal to the values obtained without movement (0.360.08 FU in Pfizer-BioNTech and 1.120.19 FU in Moderna).

During development, axons respond to diverse cues present in the extracellular matrix or at the surface of other cells to navigate to specific targets, where they establish precise connections with post-synaptic partners. Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) represent a large group of structurally diverse proteins well known to mediate adhesion for neural circuit assembly. Through their adhesive properties, CAMs act as major regulators of axon navigation, fasciculation, and synapse formation. While the adhesive functions of CAMs have been known for decades, more recent studies have unraveled essential, non-adhesive functions as well. CAMs notably act as guidance cues and modulate guidance signaling pathways for axon pathfinding, initiate contact-mediated repulsion for spatial organization of axonal arbors, and refine neuronal projections during circuit maturation. In this review, we summarize the classical adhesive functions of CAMs in axonal development and further discuss the increasing number of other non-adhesive functions CAMs play in neural circuit assembly.","output":"To Stick or Not to Stick: The Multiple Roles of Cell Adhesion Molecules in Neural Circuit Assembly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals. The unique long b' (ULB') region of HCMV contains at least 19 open reading frames (ORFs); however, little is known about the function of UL145 and UL136. We characterized UL145 and UL136 in low-passage clinical isolates from Chinese infants. MATERIAL/METHODS The clinical strains of HCMV were recovered from the urine from HCMV-infected infants. Human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HELFs) were infected with clinical isolates of HCMV, and the viral DNA and mRNA for UL145 and UL136 were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing techniques. We also predicted the structure and function of UL145 and UL136 proteins. RESULTS Sixty-two Chinese infants infected with HCMV were recruited into this study and the clinical isolates were recovered from the urine. Two strains among the low-passage isolates, D2 and D3, were obtained. The UL145 and UL136 sequences were deposited with GenBank under accession numbers of DQ180367, DQ180381, DQ180377, and DQ180389. The mRNA expression of both UL145 and UL136 was confirmed by reverse transcription (RT-PCR) assays. UL145 was predicted to contain 1 protein kinase C phosphorylation site, 2 casein kinase II phosphorylation sites and a zinc finger structure. UL136 was predicted to contain a protein kinase C phosphorylation site, N-myristoylation site, cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site and tyrosine kinase II phosphorylation site. Both UL145 and UL136 are highly conserved. CONCLUSIONS UL145 may act as an intranuclear regulating factor by direct binding to DNA, while UL136 may be a membrane receptor involving signal transduction.","output":"Characterization of human cytomegalovirus UL145 and UL136 genes in low-passage clinical isolates from infected Chinese infants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT : It is widely feared that the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to a significant worsening of the food security situation in low and middle-income countries.

We find large, but heterogeneous, price changes for different vegetables with relatively larger changes seen at the farm level, compared to the consumer level, leading to winners and losers among local vegetable farmers due to pandemic-related trade disruptions. We further note that despite substantial hurdles in domestic trade reported by most value chain agents, increases in marketing-and especially transportation-costs have not been the major contributor to overall changes in retail prices. Marketing margins even declined for half of the vegetables studied.

We hypothesise that the PENG block is safe and effective for patients with hip fracture when provided by emergency physicians and trainees in the emergency department (ED), for which it may be superior to fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) and femoral nerve block (FNB). Methods From October 2019 to July 2020, consecutive patients receiving regional anaesthesia for hip fracture in the ED of a single large regional hospital were prospectively enrolled. Pain scores were assessed prior to regional anaesthesia then at 15, 30 and 60 minutes after regional anaesthesia. Maximal reduction in pain scores within 60 minutes were assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (at rest and on movement) or the Pain Assessment IN Advanced Dementia tool (at rest). Patients were followed for opioid use for 12 hours after regional anaesthesia and adverse events over the duration of their admission. Results There were 67 eligible patients during the enrolment period, with 52 (78%) prospectively enrolled. Thirty-three received femoral blocks (19 FICB, 14 FNB) and 19 received a PENG block. There was no difference in maximum pain score reduction between the groups whether measured at rest or on movement. Clinicians providing the PENG block were less experienced in the technique than those providing FICB or FNB. There was no difference in adverse effects between groups. Although opioid use was similar between the groups, more patients were opioid free after a PENG block. Conclusions Although there was no difference in maximal pain score reduction, this study demonstrated that the PENG block was feasible and could be provided safely and effectively to patients with hip fracture in the ED. On this basis, a larger randomised controlled study should now be designed.","output":"Pericapsular nerve group block for hip fracture is safe and effective in the emergency department: a prospective observational study comparing pericapsular nerve group block to fascia iliaca compartment block and femoral nerve block."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has led to popular conspiracy theories regarding its origins and widespread concern over the level of compliance with preventive measures.

METHODS: We obtained wearable data covering baseline, incremental mobility restriction, and lockdown periods from 1,824 city-dwelling, working adults aged 21C40 years, incorporating 206,381 nights of sleep and 334,038 days of PA. Distinct rest-activity rhythm (RAR) profiles were identified using k-means clustering, indicating participants temporal distribution of step counts over the day. Hierarchical clustering of the proportion of days spent in each of these RAR profiles revealed four groups who expressed different mixtures of RAR profiles before and during the lockdown. RESULTS: Time in bed increased by 20 min during the lockdown without loss of sleep efficiency, while social jetlag measures decreased by 15 min. Resting heart rate declined by ~2 bpm. PA dropped an average of 42%. Four groups with different compositions of RAR profiles were found. Three were better able to maintain PA and weekday/weekend differentiation during lockdown. The least active group comprising ~51% of the sample, were younger and predominantly singles. Habitually less active already, this group showed the greatest reduction in PA during lockdown with little weekday/weekend differences.

However, studies based on large-scale necropsies of cattle are rare because they require special skills and equipment. This study places particular emphasis on fatal respiratory diseases in adult cattle. The objectives of this study were to assess the importance of respiratory diseases as a cause of death in adult cattle and to determine associated lesions as well as associated pathogens of infectious causes of respiratory diseases in adult cattle. This study showed that respiratory diseases are the second leading cause of death in adult cattle after digestive diseases. Among respiratory diseases, we noticed a strong predominance of infectious pulmonary lesions, mainly characterized by fibrinous, hemorrhagic and/or necrotic bronchopneumonia. These bronchopneumonia are mainly associated with the detection of a bacteria, Mannheimia haemolytica. This study suggests that Mannheimia haemolytica should be included in the differential diagnosis of BRD in adult cattle. ABSTRACT: In young cattle, bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a major cause of death and Mannheimia haemolytica is a frequent pathogen. Knowledge of fatal BRD in adult cattle is more limited. We assessed the importance of infectious BRD as a cause of death in adult cattle and determined the associated pathogens. We analyzed data from 737 adult cattle necropsies at the Pathology Unit for Large Animals at Oniris, Nantes, France over a 6 year period (2013C2019). Each carcass was subjected to a complete necropsy. Lungs showing macroscopic lesions were classified into three categories: infectious primary pulmonary (IPP) lesions, thromboembolic pneumonia (TEP) and others (aspiration pneumonia, verminous pneumonia, and local extension of an extra-pulmonary inflammatory process). Half of the lungs with IPP macroscopic lesions were sampled for histology and submitted for polymerase chain reaction. BRD was the second leading cause of death (15.7%) after digestive diseases (32.2%). A strong predominance of IPP lesions (42.3%) and TEP lesions (39.6%) was also demonstrated. In IPP macroscopic lesions, fibrinous, hemorrhagic and/or hecrotic (FHN) bronchopneumonia accounted for 77.6% of macroscopic lesions. Mannheimia haemolytica was significantly associated with FHN bronchopneumonia macroscopic lesions. This study suggests that Mannheimia haemolytica should be included in the differential diagnosis of BRD in adult cattle.","output":"Infectious Bovine Respiratory Diseases in Adult Cattle: An Extensive Necropsic and Etiological Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This comment highlights the major civil or commercial (mostly contract) law provisions in 24 judicial documents newly released by the Supreme Peoples Court or High Peoples Courts in China in response to the outbreak of COVID-19 and assesses the significance of key changes to the pre-pandemic law.

According to our spatial distribution analysis, ACE2 was relatively highly expressed in some brain locations, such as the choroid plexus and paraventricular nuclei of the thalamus.

This situation makes telemedicine necessary as it can overcome geographical barriers, increase the number of people served, and provide online clinical support for patients. However, the outcomes of telemedicine have not yet been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study is to describe the epidemiological features and clinical symptoms of patients receiving remote diagnosis and treatment at the online outpatient clinic of our hospital, as well as to analyze the outcomes and advantages of telemedicine, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data from patients receiving remote diagnosis and treatment via consultation services for COVID-19 concerns at the online outpatient clinic of Henan Provincial People's Hospital from January 24 to February 17, 2020, were collected. A retrospective analysis was performed on epidemiological features, clinical symptoms, and preliminary outcomes. RESULTS: Online inquiry, consultation, and suggestions were provided for patient concerns related to COVID-19. Our hospital also offered offline noncontact drug delivery services following online ordering and payment. A total of 4589 patients receiving remote diagnosis and treatment were recruited. The daily number of online outpatient visits initially increased and then decreased, reaching its peak on January 28 when the daily number of online outpatient visits totaled 612. Of 4589 patients, 1940 (42.3%) were males and 2649 (57.7%) were females (age range: 78 days to 85 years). Most patients were aged 20-39 years (n=3714, 80.9%) and came from Henan Province (n=3898, 84.9%). The number of patients from other provinces was 691 (15.1%). During the online consultations, patients discussed the following symptoms: fever (n=2383), cough (n=1740), nasal obstruction (n=794), fatigue (n=503), and diarrhea (n=276). A total of 873 orders of noncontact drug delivery following online payment was completed. The daily number of such orders gradually stabilized after the initial, steady increase. For offline drug delivery orders, the median (IQR) was 36 (58). An online satisfaction survey was filled out postconsultation by patients; of the 985 responses received, 98.1% (n=966) of respondents were satisfied with the service they received. CONCLUSIONS: Remote diagnosis and treatment offered via online outpatient consultations effectively reduced the burden on hospitals, prevented overcrowding, reduced the risk of cross-infection, and relieved patients' anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak.

We investigated the temporal progression in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Jan 20 to Feb 6, 2020 in Shanghai. Final date of follow-up was February 25, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 249 patients enrolled, the median age was 51 years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male. The duration from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 4(2-7) days in symptomatic patients. Fever was occurred in 235(94.3%) patients. A total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been discharged after 16(12-20) days hospitalization. The estimated median duration of fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [CIs]: 8-11 days) after onset of symptoms. Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P <0.0001). Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms. 154(94.5%) of these patients showed radiological improvement on day 14. The median duration to negative reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days (95 CIs: 10-12 days). Viral clearance was more likely to be delayed in patients in ICU than those not in ICU (P <0.0001). In multivariate logistical analysis, age (Odds ratio [OR]a?=a?1.06) and CD4 T cell count (ORa?=a?0.55 per 100 cells/ul increase) were independently associated with ICU admission.

In Denmark, IMD is a notifiable disease and data collection on sequelae information has been automated, enabling studies of sequelae due to IMD diagnosed after discharge. The aim of this study was to examine possible determinants for sequelae after IMD and to describe the distribution of sequelae by age, serogroup and clinical presentation, for all cases in Denmark from 2005C2020. METHODS: Data from The National Database for Notifiable Infectious Diseases was linked to data from The Danish National Patient Register and the Civil Registration System. Logistic regression models were used to study whether age, serogroup and/or clinical presentation were associated with sequelae. A descriptive analysis of the proportion of different types of sequelae across age groups, serogroups and clinical presentations was performed. RESULTS: In total, 25% of IMD survivors experienced one or more sequelae. We found no significant association between sequelae and age. The five most common sequelae in decreasing order of incidence were hearing loss, epilepsy, learning disabilities, headache and visual defects/loss of vision, with rates ranging from 8.2 to 2.8% of IMD survivors. The proportion of survivors with hearing loss and visual defects/loss of vision was not significantly different between clinical presentations. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest revising IMD treatment guidelines, to include routine referral to hearing and vision tests, irrespective of clinical presentation. Furthermore, it is important to increase the awareness among parents of children who have had IMD of possible future learning disabilities to make sure that necessary measures are taken in a timely manner.

In this study, an antimicrobial peptide from chicken (AMP) was recombinantly expressed in the Pichia pastoris expression system, which induced a series of cellular autolysis phenotypes after methanol treatment, such as the aggregated, lysed, irregular, and enlarged cell morphology, while the cells expressing a recombinant aflatoxin-detoxifizyme (ADTZ) were not autolyzed. A comparative transcriptomic analysis showed that the transcriptomic profiles of cells derived from the autolysis and non-autolysis groups were well discriminated, suggesting that the mechanisms of autolysis were at the transcriptional level. A further differential expression gene (DEG) analysis showed that the DEGs from the two groups were involved mainly in autophagy, the MAPK signaling pathway, transcriptional factors, the central carbon metabolism, anti-stress functions, and so on. In the autolysis group, the cell activity was significantly reduced with the MAPK signaling pathway, the central carbon metabolism was down-regulated, and components of the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (CVT) and mitophagy pathways were up-regulated, suggesting that the autophagy involved in the trafficking of intracellular molecules in the vacuole and mitochondrion contributed to autolysis, which was regulated by transcriptional factors and signal pathways at the transcriptional level.

MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Self-controlled case series and conditional Poisson regression were used to determine the incidence rate ratio and risk ratio with corresponding 95% confidence intervals for a first deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or bleeding event. In the self-controlled case series, the incidence rate ratios for first time outcomes after covid-19 were determined using set time intervals and the spline model. The risk ratios for first time and all events were determined during days 1-30 after covid-19 or index date using the matched cohort study, and adjusting for potential confounders (comorbidities, cancer, surgery, long term anticoagulation treatment, previous venous thromboembolism, or previous bleeding event). RESULTS: Compared with the control period, incidence rate ratios were significantly increased 70 days after covid-19 for deep vein thrombosis, 110 days for pulmonary embolism, and 60 days for bleeding. In particular, incidence rate ratios for a first pulmonary embolism were 36.17 (95% confidence interval 31.55 to 41.47) during the first week after covid-19 and 46.40 (40.61 to 53.02) during the second week. Incidence rate ratios during days 1-30 after covid-19 were 5.90 (5.12 to 6.80) for deep vein thrombosis, 31.59 (27.99 to 35.63) for pulmonary embolism, and 2.48 (2.30 to 2.68) for bleeding. Similarly, the risk ratios during days 1-30 after covid-19 were 4.98 (4.96 to 5.01) for deep vein thrombosis, 33.05 (32.8 to 33.3) for pulmonary embolism, and 1.88 (1.71 to 2.07) for bleeding, after adjusting for the effect of potential confounders. The rate ratios were highest in patients with critical covid-19 and highest during the first pandemic wave in Sweden compared with the second and third waves. In the same period, the absolute risk among patients with covid-19 was 0.039% (401 events) for deep vein thrombosis, 0.17% (1761 events) for pulmonary embolism, and 0.101% (1002 events) for bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that covid-19 is a risk factor for deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and bleeding.

Using an intact live mouse pancreatic lobule preparation, we observed that S1 elicited Ca(2+) signals in stellate cells and macrophages, but not in the dominant acinar cells. The Ca(2+) signals occurred mostly in the form of repetitive Ca(2+) spikes. The probability of observing Ca(2+) signals depended on the S1 concentration. The threshold was close to 70 nM, whereas at 600 nM, all cells responded. The SARS-Cov-2 nucleocapsid protein did not elicit any Ca(2+) signals in any of the three cell types tested. The S1-induced Ca(2+) signals in stellate cells started much faster (122  37s) than those in macrophages (468  68s). Furthermore, the interleukin-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) abolished the responses in macrophages without affecting the Ca(2+) signals in stellate cells. The S1-elicited Ca(2+) signals were completely dependent on the presence of external Ca(2+) and were abolished by a selective inhibitor (CM4620) of Orai1 Ca(2+) Release Activated Ca(2+) channels.

This study aimed to assess the influence of a novel enhanced stress-resilience training (ESRT) course delivered at the start of core surgical training in a single UK statutory education body. METHOD: All newly appointed core surgical trainees (CSTs) were invited to participate in a 5-week ESRT course teaching mindfulness-based exercises to develop tools to deal with stress at work and burnout. The primary aim was to assess the feasibility of this course; secondary outcomes were to assess degree of burnout measured using Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) scoring. RESULTS: Of 43 boot camp attendees, 38 trainees completed questionnaires, with 24 choosing to participate in ESRT (63.2 per cent; male 13, female 11, median age 28 years). Qualitative data reflected challenges delivering ESRT because of arduous and inflexible clinical on-call rotas, time pressures related to academic curriculum demands and the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic (10 of 24 drop-out). Despite these challenges, 22 (91.7 per cent) considered the course valuable and there was unanimous support for programme development. Of the 14 trainees who completed the ESRT course, nine (64.3 per cent) continued to use the techniques in daily clinical work. Burnout was identified in 23 trainees (60.5 per cent) with no evident difference in baseline MBI scores between participants (median 4 (range 0C11) versus 5 (1C11), P = 0.770). High stress states were significantly less likely, and mindfulness significantly higher in the intervention group (P < 0.010); MBI scores were comparable before and after ESRT in the intervention cohort (P = 0.630, median 4 (range 0C11) versus 4 (1C10)).

However, in the vast majority of SEIR models and models derived from them transitions from one population group to another are described using the mass-action law which assumes population homogeneity. That causes some methodological limitations or even drawbacks, particularly inability to reproduce observable dynamics of key characteristics of infection such as, for example, the incubation period and progression of the disease's symptoms which require considering different time scales as well as probabilities of different disease trajectories. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to simulate the epidemic dynamics that is based on a system of differential equations with time delays to precisely reproduce a duration of infectious processes (e.g. incubation period of the virus) and competing processes like transition from infected state to the hospitalization or recovery. The suggested modeling approach is fundamental and can be applied to the study of many infectious disease epidemiology. However, due to the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic we have developed and calibrated the delay-based model of the epidemic in Germany and France using the BioUML platform. Additionally, the stringency index was used as a generalized characteristic of the non-pharmaceutical government interventions implemented in corresponding countries to contain the virus spread. The numerical analysis of the calibrated model demonstrates that adequate simulation of each new wave of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread requires dynamic changes in the parameter values during the epidemic like reduction of the population adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions or enhancement of the infectivity parameter caused by an emergence of novel virus strains with higher contagiousness than original one.

Methods: The study included all the cases reported from March 8 to May 31, 2020 in the state. Any person with history of international or domestic travel from high burden states, those presenting with Influenza-like or Severe Acute Respiratory Illness and high-risk contacts of COVID19 cases, who were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive were included. Detailed analysis based on contact tracing data available from line-list of the state surveillance unit was performed using cluster analysis software package. Findings: Amongst the 3404 COVID-19 positive cases, 3096 (91%) were asymptomatic while 308 (9%) were symptomatic. Majority of the asymptomatic cases were in the age range of 16-50 years while symptomatic cases were between 31-65 years. Most of those affected were males. Cluster analysis of 822 cases indicated that the secondary attack rate, size of the cluster (dispersion) and occurrence of overt clinical illness is significantly higher when the index case in a cluster was symptomatic compared to an asymptomatic. Interpretation: Our findings indicate that both asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases transmit the infection; however, the main driving force behind the spread of infection within the state was significantly higher from symptomatic cases. This has major implications for policies related to testing.

Frequently occurring mutations were observed, which suggested that full understanding of the genomic and epidemiological characteristics is critical in the fight against PEDV epidemics. Comparative analysis of 49 available genomes clustered the PEDV strains into pandemic (PX) and classical (CX) groups and identified four hypervariable regions (V1 to V4). Further study indicated key roles for the spike (S) gene and the V2 region in distinguishing between the PX and CX groups and for studying genetic evolution. Genotyping and phylogeny-based geographical dissection based on 219 S genes revealed the complexity and severity of PEDV epidemics in Asia. Many subgroups have formed, with a wide array of mutations in different countries, leading to the outbreak of PEDV in Asia. Spatiotemporal reconstruction based on the analysis suggested that the pandemic group strains originated from South Korea and then extended into Japan, Thailand, and China. However, the novel pandemic strains in South Korea that appeared after 2013 may have originated from a Chinese variant. Thus, the serious PED epidemics in China and South Korea in recent years were caused by the complex subgroups of PEDV.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This bidirectional (226 prospective and 42 retrospectives) cohort study was performed at a tertiary care teaching hospital in South India. We compared the respiratory distress syndrome and neonatal death amongst preterm twins from 28 to 34 weeks born < 14 days (Group A, n=268) and after 14 days (Group B, n=268) of completion of a single course of antenatal steroids. We used multivariable regression analysis (log-binomial model) to adjust for confounding variables. We generated a propensity-matched score with probit regression to analyse outcomes (respiratory distress and neonatal deaths). RESULTS: The two groups had significant differences in the distribution of birthweight, gestation period and mode of delivery. On adjusted analysis, the period of gestation below 33 weeks and weight below 1.5 kg had the maximum influence on respiratory and other morbidities, and weight less than 1 kg on neonatal death. [adjusted relative risk (ARR) 26.06, (95%CI=2.37-285.5), p=0.008]. On propensity scoring after matching all these variables, we found an [ARR of 2.0 (95% CI: 1.03-3.88), P=0.017] for neonatal death after 14 days of steroid injection. The ARR for respiratory distress syndrome was 1.13 in those born after 14 days of steroids, though it did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: On propensity scoring, the steroid-delivery interval more than 14 days was associated with a significantly increased risk (ARR of 2) of neonatal death.","output":"Comparison of Respiratory Distress Syndrome amongst Preterm Twins (28-34 Weeks) Born within and after Two Weeks of Completion of Single Antenatal Corticosteroid Course: a Bidirectional Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social networks have become increasingly popular lately, being a complementary method of expression and communication. With the adoption of quarantine and social distancing imposed by the authorities as measures to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, society has used the opportunity offered by digital technology to continue its concern related to the protection and conservation of the environment, especially the forest. The purpose of this study was to highlight the public interest regarding the forests in the context of COVID-19, especially the extent to which public opinion expressed on social networks has determined public forest management policies. The results revealed a major interest in preserving biodiversity and forestry, in reducing legal logging and stopping illegal logging, and monitoring of timber shipments as measures to combat illegal logging. During the analyzed period (i.e., 1 February 2020 to 31 July 2020), several legislative acts were adopted that overlap with the requests and needs identified by environmental organizations, acts that address the issue of illegal logging, conservation, and protection of the forest, monitoring the traceability of wood. The legislation adopted in the analyzed timeframe and shortly after responded to several major topics related to the licensing and withdrawal of the logging license for illegal logging, amending the legislation for the conservation of biodiversity and the classification of areas with virgin forests as strictly protected forests. An IT system has also been implemented by the government environmental authority that allows the supervision of timber transport, offering the possibility of active involvement of civil society.","output":"The Role of Social Media in Public Forest Management Policies during COVID-19: Implications for Stakeholder Engagement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current shortages of Filtering Facepiece Respirators (FFRs) have created a demand for effective methods for N95 decontamination and reuse. Before implementing any reuse strategy it is important to determine what effects the proposed method has on the physical functioning of the FFR. Here we investigate the effects of two potential methods for decontamination; dry heat at 95 {degrees}C, and autoclave treatments. We test both fit and filtration efficiency for each method. For the dry heat treatment we consider the 3M 1860, 3M 1870, and 3M8210+ models. After five cycles of the dry heating method, all three FFR models pass both fit and filtration tests, showing no degradation. For the autoclave tests we consider the 3M 1870, and the 3M 8210+. We find significant degradation of the FFRs following the 121 {degrees}C autoclave cycles. The molded mask tested (3M 8210+) failed fit testing after just 1 cycle in the autoclave. The pleated (3M 1870) mask passed fit testing for 5 cycles, but failed filtration testing. The 95 {degrees}C dry heat cycle is scalable to over a thousand masks per day in a hospital setting, and is above the temperature which has been shown to achieve the requisite 3 log kill of SARS-CoV-2[1], making it a promising method for N95 decontamination and reuse.","output":"Effect of Dry Heat and Autoclave Decontamination Cycles on N95 FFRs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Galaxy is a mature, browser accessible workbench for scientific computing.

METHOD: A web\\\\based cross\\\\sectional survey was administered during and shortly after the COVID\\\\19 related lockdown in Spain and Greece. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to identify country differences associated with eating behaviour, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. RESULTS: This study included 1,002 responders in Spain and 839 in Greece. The mean  SD of restraint, emotional and external eating was 2.5  0.79, 2.1  0.81 and 2.6  0.65 in Spain, whereas 2.7  0.85, 2.3  0.99 and 2.9  0.74 in Greece. Spanish participants had lower average scores of restraint and external eating compared to Greek participants (p < .001), but no difference was seen for emotional eating. In Spain, 13.6%, and 12.3% of the survey respondents reported moderate to severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively, whereas in Greece the respective values were 18.8 and 13.2%. After adjusting for several risk factors, a higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms was observed in Spain compared to Greece (p = .001), but no difference was seen for depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated high scores of inappropriate eating behaviours and a high frequency of depressive and anxiety symptoms in two Mediterranean countries during the COVID\\\\19 outbreak.

Infiltrated neutrophils can be stimulated to form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), leading to renal injury. However, the relationship between the increase of C3 and the release of NETs in AKI was not clear. Here we found that IRI in the mouse kidney leads to increased neutrophils infiltration and NET formation. Furthermore, neutrophils depletion by anti-Ly6G IgG (1A8) did not reduce C3 activation but reduced kidney injury and inflammation, indicating a link between neutrophils infiltration and renal tissue damage. Pretreatment with 1A8 suppressed ischemia-induced NET formation, proving that extracellular traps (ETs) in renal tissue were mainly derived from neutrophils. Renal ischemia injury also leads to increased expression of C3. Moreover, C3 KO mice (C3 KO) with IRI exhibited attenuated kidney damage and decreased neutrophils and NETs. In vitro, C3a primed neutrophils to form NETs, reflected by amorphous extracellular DNA structures that colocalized with CitH3 and MPO. These data reveal that C3 deficiency can ameliorate AKI by reducing the infiltration of neutrophils and the formation of NETs.

Background Shared seasonal patterns, such as between influenza and some respiratory bacterial infections, can create associations between phenomena not causally related. Objectives To estimate the association of influenza with subsequent bacterial infections after full adjustment for confounding by seasonal and long\\\\term trends. Methods Time series of weekly counts of notified cases of invasive infections with Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, in Montral, Canada, 1996C2008, were modelled by negative binomial regression, with terms representing seasonal and long\\\\term trends and terms for numbers of positive laboratory tests for influenza A and B. Results The associations of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and N. meningitidis with influenza disappeared after seasonal terms were added to the model. However, the influenza B count remained associated with the S. pyogenes counts for the same week and the following week: S. pyogenes incidence rate ratios were 1.0376 (95% CI: 1.0009C1.0757) and 1.0354 (0.9958C1.0766), respectively, for each increase of 1 in the influenza count. Conclusions Influenza B accounts for about 8percnt; of the incidence of invasive S. pyogenes infections, over and above any effect associated with modellable seasonal and long\\\\term trends. This association of influenza B with S. pyogenes infections can be attributed largely to the years 1997, 2001, 2007 and 2008, when late peaks in influenza B counts were followed by peaks in S. pyogenes notifications.

Prior to boarding, all passengers underwent a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test; the tests results were all negative. On Day 0, 3, 5, 8 and 11, Biosynex? rapid antigen diagnostic tests were carried out on all or some of the crew members and tourists who may have had contact with new positive cases. Each day, forehead or temporal temperatures were measured using an infrared thermometer and questions were asked concerning the subjects' health status. When a subject was positive, the person and their contacts were isolated in individual cabins. The infected person then left the vessel to be received in a communal reception centre on the nearest island.

Due to COVID-19, we increased our utilization of telestroke. Given this change in workflow, we investigated how residents utilize telestroke for Code Brain (CB) acute stroke evaluations and if expanding the use of telestroke in neurology residency programs is justified. Methods: We retrospectively compared the number of CB evaluations, door to needle (DTN) times, door to decision (DTD) times, and NIHSS from March - June 2019 (in-person evaluations) against those in March - June 2020 (telestroke evaluations). We limited our study to resident-involved cases. Nighttime and weekend CBs are run by a neurology resident and are remotely supervised. Daytime CBs can be run by a resident, fellow, or attending. We assumed that nighttime CBs are resident-run and daytime evaluations are the stroke team's evaluation. Statistical analysis was performed using R. Results: There were a total of 217 CBs in March - June 2019 and 115 in March - June 2020. In 2019, there were 120 daytime and 97 nighttime CBs;in 2020 there were 62 and 53. The mean DTN for the day for 2019 and 2020 was 45.9  23.2 and 48.4  20.2 (P=0.08). The mean DTN during the night for 2019 and 2020 was 67.3  53.7 and 53.8  25.8 (P=0.64). The mean DTD during the day for 2019 and 2020 was 48.1  41.0 and 44.9  37.6 (P=0.25). The mean DTD during the night for 2019 and 2020 was 60.9  51.1 and 65.8  94.6 (P=0.68). Using a generalized linear model approach to correct for shift (day/night), age, NIHSS, we found no significant differences in DTN or DTD before and after implementing resident-run telestroke. Using Cohen's approach (1988) we estimated a Type 2 error probability at 7%. Discussion: Our findings show that resident-run telestroke CBs are comparable to CBs run by fellows and attendings as DTN and DTD were not significantly different between the CBs run by residents in-person or via telestroke. These metrics are also comparable for CBs in which a fellow or attending are supervising or running the CB. Implementing resident-run telestroke consultation showed no effect on DTN or DTD after accounting for patient age, NIHSS, or the time of day. These data should reassure programs seeking to grant telestroke privileges to trainees.","output":"Efficacy and utility of resident-run telestroke evaluations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autonomous learning shifts the focus from teaching to learning in relation to lifelong learning skills.

Therefore, this meta-analysis study aims to investigate the incidence of liver injury among published literature from 2019-Jan-01 to 2020-April-03 to provide an outline for further studies on the liver injury of COVID-19. Four databases including Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Scopus were searched for studies published from 2019-Jan-01 to 2020-April-03. Data analysis and drawing of charts were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software Version 2.2 (Biostat, USA). The search yielded 450 publications, of which 64 potentially eligible studies were identified for full-text review and 21 studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria remained. A total of 4191 COVID-19 patients were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of liver injury was 19.5% (95% CI: 14.3-26.1). According to our results, there was significant heterogeneity among the 19 studies (X2 = 738.5; p < 0.001; I2 = 94.34%).

Recent studies suggest that PP in spontaneously breathing, nonintubated patients with acute respiratory failure is well tolerated and improves oxygenation. However, little is known regarding patient triggered ventilation in intubated patients with ARDS undergoing PP. We conducted a retrospective review of our experience with placing patients in the prone position in 2 cohorts of subjects with moderate and severe ARDS (ie, one cohort with ARDS related to COVID-19, the other with ARDS unrelated to COVID-19), many of whom were receiving pressure support ventilation (PSV). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis in a single 22-bed mixed ICU. The subjects included in the analysis were &#8805; 18 y old, met the Berlin definition for moderate or severe ARDS (whether related COVID-19 or not), and underwent PP during invasive ventilation. RESULTS: 39 subjects were included in the analysis: 20 subjects had ARDS related to COVID-19, while 19 had ARDS related to other etiologies. A total of 113 PP episodes were analyzed: 84 during PSV and 29 during volume control continuous mandatory ventilation. PP during PSV was well tolerated and was effective in improving arterial oxygenation (ie, an increase of median [Formula: see text] from 100 mm Hg [interquartile range 75-120] before PP to 135 mm Hg [interquartile range 111-161] at the end of the PP session, P < .0001). No significant difference between continuous mandatory ventilation and PSV was noted regarding arterial oxygenation during PP. Compared with continuous mandatory ventilation mode, PP during PSV was associated with a significant decrease in the use of neuromuscular blocking agents (4% vs 69% of subjects, P < .001), while sedative requirements remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective analysis of consecutive intubated subjects with moderate or severe ARDS, related or not to COVID-19, spontaneous breathing during PP was well tolerated and achieved significant improvement in arterial oxygenation.","output":"Prone Positioning in Spontaneously Breathing Subjects With Moderate or Severe ARDS During Invasive Ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nucleocapsid (N) protein is a structural component of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and can induce antibody responses in SARS patients during infection.

By January 2021, LFD community testing sites were set up across English local authority areas to support the management and containment of regional COVID-19 cases, initially targeting essential workers unable to work from home during the national lockdown. This study aimed to examine the characteristics and motivations of individuals accessing community LFD testing across two local authority areas (LAAs) in the South West of England. METHODS: Data were collected as part of a service evaluation from December 22(nd) 2020 until March 15(th) 2021 for two LAAs. Demographic and postcode data were collected from an online test appointment booking platform and the National Health Service testing service online system, with data accessed from Public Health England. An online survey was sent to individuals who made a testing appointment at an LAA1 site using the online booking platform, consisting of 12 questions to collect data on individuals motivations for and experiences of testing. RESULTS: Data were available for individuals who completed 12,516 tests in LAA1 and 12,327 tests in LAA2. Most individuals who engaged with testing were female, working age, white, and worked as early years or education staff, health and social care staff, and supermarket or food production staff. 1249 individuals completed the survey with 60% of respondents reported getting tested for work-related reasons. Individuals first heard about LFD testing through various channels including work, media, and word of mouth, and decided to get tested based on the ease and convenience of testing, workplace communications, and to identify asymptomatic cases to help stop the spread. Most tests were completed by individuals living in less deprived areas based on national deciles of deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: While national and local COVID-19 testing strategies have evolved, community and personal LFD testing remains a crucial pillar of the testing strategy.

Whereas classical trials mostly evaluate only one investigational drug, platform trials embed various trials under a shared master protocol to enable the evaluation of multiple interventions for a disease or condition. Platform trials have mostly been used to evaluate cancer therapies, but also recently for COVID-19. The EU Patient-cEntric clinicAl tRial pLatforms (EU-PEARL) project aims to expand the use of platform trials as the backbone of drug development. Description of Issue EU-PEARL is a Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking funded project (2019-2023), and a strategic public and private sector alliance, which aims to support the transformation of the classical trial approach into a cross-company collaborative, multi-compound platform, centred around patients, not diseases. How to operationalize and sustain this? A multi-stakeholder, mixed-methods approach is taken, focused around the concept of an integrated research platform (IRP), i.e., a common enabling framework for platform trials. The IRP will be established as a sustainable and scalable global solution, consisting of an infrastructure, workflows, and guidance on how to meet complex regulatory, ethical, legal, statistical and data requirements. Lessons from COVID-19 trials will be incorporated. Results A disease-agnostic IRP is being developed, as well as four disease specific IRPs in four areas of high public health relevance, i.e. major depressive disorder, tuberculosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and neurofibromatosis.

Reduced in-person clinic exposures and social distancing requirements have significantly affected trainee education. Similar to programs around the USA, in early March 2020, our program was faced with an urgent need to pivot both our clinical and educational programs to virtual platforms. Within these limitations, we harnessed innovative educational models and restructured our curriculum to ensure adequate clinical and didactic exposure. We divided trainees clinical rotations into four blocks, which include Inpatient consult service, Outpatient in-person and procedure clinics, Telehealth Clinics and Research/Elective week. By assigning specific rotations, we were able to ensure fellows were seeing adequate numbers of patients both through telemedicine and inperson while ensuring we complied with social distancing requirements. We further were able to ensure that trainee hands-on procedure training was not compromised. Acknowledging challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and learner engagement in virtual environment, we designed an innovative educational portfolio. Utilizing synchronous and asynchronous learning methods, we have developed multiple complementary educational initiatives including: Rocket Rheumatology, Board Games, At the Elbow, Radiology Reading Rheum, Ultrasound Buddies, The History Rheum, and Rapid-Fire Journal Club.

The most common high-risk HPV types in cervical cancer are HPV 16 and 18, and the most common low-risk types causing genital warts are HPV 6 and HPV 11. In this study, applying novel AllGlo fluorescent probes, we established a quadruplex quantitative PCR method to simultaneously detect and differentiate HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 in a single tube. METHODS: The specificity, the sensitivity, the detection limit, the reproducibility and the standard curve of this method were examined. Finally, clinical samples that had been tested previously by TaqMan PCR and HPV GenoArray (GA) test were used to verify the accuracy and sensitivity of the method. RESULTS: The assay has a sensitivity of 10(1) to 10(2) copies/test and a linear detection range from 10(1) to 10(8) copies/test. The mean amplification efficiencies for HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 were 0.97, 1.10, 0.93 and 1.20, respectively, and the mean correlation coefficient (r(2)) of each standard curve was above 0.99 for plasmid templates ranging from 10(3) to 10(7) copies/test. There was 100% agreement between the AllGlo quadruplex quantitative PCR, HPV GA test and TaqMan uniplex qPCR methods. CONCLUSIONS: AllGlo quadruplex quantitative PCR in a single tube has the advantages of relatively high throughput, good reproducibility, high sensitivity, high specificity, and a wide linear range of detection.

There are a large number of birthCdeath model variants that have been developed; these impose different assumptions about the temporal dynamics of the parameters and about the sampling process.

This unification includes both models where the process is the same for all lineages and those in which it varies across types. We also outline a straightforward procedure for deriving likelihood functions for arbitrarily complex birthCdeath(-sampling) models that will hopefully allow researchers to explore a wider array of scenarios than was previously possible.

With the recent second and third waves of coronavirus disease -19 (COVID-19) infections worldwide, the race is not only to encourage but also to achieve mass vaccination. METHODS: A total of 397 HCPs from across Jazan province participated in an anonymous online cross-sectional survey conducted for a period of 45 days (March 30, 2021 to May 13, 2021) in Jazan province, Saudi Arabia. Data was collected using a validated 22-items self-report survey. RESULTS: For both COVID-19 vaccines, majority of reports were related to flu-like symptoms including fever, chills, headache, fatigue, tiredness, and myalgia. Statistically significant associations were observed between the severity of side effects and gender (2=73.32; p<0.001), type of vaccine (2=112.08; p<0.001), and presence of known allergies (2=99.69; p<0.001). Female HCPs were more likely to report any side effects compared with male HCPs (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 3.72; p<0.001).

The results indicate that while the applied experimental procedures are useful, we could draw limited conclusions about the dynamic nature of infection diffusion. We discussed the possible reasons for the above and used them to formulate research hypotheses that could serve the scientific community in future research efforts. ABSTRACT: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first discovered in China; within several months, it spread worldwide and became a pandemic. Although the virus has spread throughout the globe, its effects have differed. The pandemic diffusion network dynamics (PDND) approach was proposed to better understand the spreading behavior of COVID-19 in the US and Japan. We used daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 from 5 January 2020 to 31 July 2021, for all states (prefectures) of the US and Japan. By applying the pandemic diffusion network dynamics (PDND) approach to COVID-19 time series data, we developed diffusion graphs for the US and Japan. In these graphs, nodes represent states and prefectures (regions), and edges represent connections between regions based on the synchrony of COVID-19 time series data. To compare the pandemic spreading dynamics in the US and Japan, we used graph theory metrics, which targeted the characterization of COVID-19 bedhavior that could not be explained through linear methods. These metrics included path length, global and local efficiency, clustering coefficient, assortativity, modularity, network density, and degree centrality. Application of the proposed approach resulted in the discovery of mostly minor differences between analyzed countries. In light of these findings, we focused on analyzing the reasons and defining research hypotheses that, upon addressing, could shed more light on the complex phenomena of COVID-19 virus spread and the proposed PDND methodology.","output":"The COVID-19 Infection Diffusion in the US and Japan: A Graph-Theoretical Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Web-based social media is increasingly being used across different settings in the health care industry. The increased frequency in the use of the Internet via computer or mobile devices provides an opportunity for social media to be the medium through which people can be provided with valuable health information quickly and directly. While traditional methods of detection relied predominately on hierarchical or bureaucratic lines of communication, these often failed to yield timely and accurate epidemiological intelligence. New web-based platforms promise increased opportunities for a more timely and accurate spreading of information and analysis. This article aims to provide an overview and discussion of the availability of timely and accurate information. It is especially useful for the rapid identification of an outbreak of an infectious disease that is necessary to promptly and effectively develop public health responses. These web-based platforms include search queries, data mining of web and social media, process and analysis of blogs containing epidemic key words, text mining, and geographical information system data analyses. These new sources of analysis and information are intended to complement traditional sources of epidemic intelligence. Despite the attractiveness of these new approaches, further study is needed to determine the accuracy of blogger statements, as increases in public participation may not necessarily mean the information provided is more accurate.","output":"Mining Social Media and Web Searches For Disease Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract With a high global impact, the main target of recent health-related studies focuses on the current pandemic caused by COVID-19, a zoonotic infection mediated by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which shows high transmission and mortality capacity.

However, the mean-field approach cannot show the detailed contagion process, which is important in the control of epidemic. To fill this gap, we present a novel approach to study how the topological structure of complex network influences the concrete process of epidemic spreading. After transforming the network structure into hierarchical layers, we introduce a set of new parameters, i.e., the average fractions of degree for outgoing, ingoing, and remaining in the same layer, to describe the infection process. We find that this set of parameters are closely related to the degree distribution and the clustering coefficient but are more convenient than them in describing the process of epidemic spreading. Moreover, we find that the networks with exponential distribution have slower spreading speed than the networks with power-law degree distribution.

METHODS: 105 patients admitted to our hospital with clinical- and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were studied. Data were collected from January 17, 2020 to March 5, 2020. RESULTS: 105 patients (57 male and 48 female) were confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. Among the 105 patients, 55 (52%) had made short trips to Wuhan during the two weeks before the onset of illness, and these were the first-generation confirmed cases. An exact date of close contact with someone in Wenzhou with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection from Wuhan (the second-generation confirmed cases) could be provided by 38 (36%) patients. Of the remaining patients, six (6%; the third-generation confirmed cases) were familial clusters of the second-generation confirmed cases, three (3%) had no definite epidemiological features, and 16 (15%) were from the same location as for the case report. CONCLUSION: Due to the infectiousness of COVID-19, patients with infections should be diagnosed and treated as early as possible after developing fever symptoms or showing other clinical characteristics or imaging features.

We compared this standard with a suction calibration system (SCS) that performs all functions with one insertion, and measured each step's duration. METHODS Primary LSG was performed using a bougie and SCS in alternating order. Number of tube movements to achieve optimal placement, durations of decompression, leak testing, and overall operative time, and remnant linear measurements were obtained. RESULTS LSG was performed in 26 patients (15 women, 11 men; mean age 36.8 years; mean BMI 45.3 kg/m(2)). The mean number of tube movements was significantly greater for the bougie than for the SCS (8.13 vs. 3.58; p < 0.0001). Percent reductions achieved using the SCS were: time to full decompression of the stomach, 62% (21 vs. 8 s; p < 0.138); tube placement, 51% (101 vs. 49 s; p < 0.0001); leak testing, 78% (119 vs. 26 s; p < 0.0003); and mean operative duration (from tube insertion to end of stapling), 21% (875 vs. 697 s; p < 0.019). Variance of the staple-line distance, measured from the greater curvature to the staple line, was 1.64 and 0.92 for the bougie and SCS, respectively, indicating a reduction in corkscrewing, for a 43.9% straighter sleeve. CONCLUSION SCS maintained the gastric wall in place, thereby preventing corkscrewing, and reducing total operating time.

The association of aberrant DNA methylation with lymphomagenesis provides rationale for clinical application of hypomethylating agents. Azacitidine, an epigenetic modifier which inhibits DNA methyltransferase, has shown clinical activity as a single agent and in combination in R/R PTCL. We report the findings of the first study of oral azacitidine (CC-486) plus CHOP as initial treatment for PTCL (ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT03542266). METHODS: This phase 2 study prioritized enrollment of PTCL-TFH. Subjects received CHOP on day 1 of each cycle for 6 cycles. Priming with oral azacitidine (CC-486) at 300 mg daily was administered for 7 days prior to cycle 1 of CHOP, and for 14 days before CHOP cycles 2-6. Supportive care included mandatory G-CSF. The primary endpoint is CR per 2014 IWG criteria. Secondary endpoints include ORR, safety and survival. Correlative biomarker studies are planned to assess genomic mutations by next-generation-sequencing (NGS), in addition to methylation and transcription profiles. Using a Simon two-stage design comparing an CR of 60% with treatment to an unacceptable CR of 35% (alpha=10%, power=80%), 9 or more CR out of 17 enrolled patients were required to declare the treatment worthy of further study. RESULTS: From 6/2018 to 3/2020, 21 subjects with previously untreated PTCL were enrolled at 4 centers, and the study met its accrual. At study entry, 17 patients (81%) had PTCL-TFH (16 AITL and 1 TFH), 3 with PTCL-NOS, 1 with ATLL, including 5 (24%) with CD30+ disease. The median age was 66 years (range 22-77), and the M:F ratio was 1.6:1. Nineteen (90%) had stage III/IV disease, 10 (48%) had elevated LDH, 7 (33%) had bone marrow involvement, and 9 (43%) had IPI 3-5. Treatment was generally well tolerated with expected side effects. Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicities included neutropenia (71.4%), thrombocytopenia (9.5%) and anemia (14.3%), with febrile neutropenia uncommon (14.3%). Grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicities included fatigue (14.3%), hyponatremia (14.3%), diarrhea (4.8%), vomiting (4.8%), rash (4.8%), and elevated ALT (4.8%). One incidence each of influenza A, COVID-19 pneumonia, C.diff and strongyloides hyperinfection were observed and treated. There was no study treatment-related mortality to date. As of July 2020 at a median follow-up of 7 months (range 4-25 months), one subject withdrew consent after cycle 1 (patient preference), and 20 subjects had at least one response assessment, including 15 completed treatment, 2 progressed during treatment, and 3 nearing completion of therapy. At interim assessment after cycle 3 (n=20), the ORR was 85% with CR at 55% (90%CI of 34.7%-74.1%). To date, the preliminary end-of-treatment (EOT, n=17) CR was 76.5% (90%CI of 53.9%-91.5%) for all evaluable patients and was 86.7% for 15 PTCL-TFH, exceeding primary endpoint threshold. CR did not correlate with CD30 expression. The estimated 1-yr PFS for all patients was 56.8% (95%CI of 26.3%-87.3%), with 1-yrs PFS for PTCL-TFH at 61.1% (95%CI of 29.5%-92.7%), and the estimated 1-yr OS for all patients was 74.4% (95%CI of 48.8%-100.0%), with 1-yr OS for PTCL-TFH at 88.9% (95%CI of 68.4%-100.0%). Mutational status by NGS was determined in 15 patients to date. The frequencies of the TET2, RHOA, DNMT3A, and IDH2 mutations were 73%, 40%, 13% and 13%, respectively. TET2 mutations were significantly associated with CR (p=0.014), favorable PFS (p-0.012) and OS (p=0.042). In contrast, DNMT3A mutations were associated with adverse OS (p=0.028). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first demonstration that addition of hypomethylating agent oral azacitidine (CC486) to CHOP as initial therapy is feasible, safe, and induces high CR rate in PTCL-TFH subtype, with expected side effects. Although preliminary, the EOT CR to date exceeds the threshold of meeting study primary endpoint. Final efficacy data as well as response according to subtype and mutational profiling will be updated at ASH. This active combination will be further evaluated in the upcoming ALLIANCE/Intergroup randomized study A051902, comparing oral azacitidine-CHO(E)P with duvelisib-CHO(E)P against CHO(E)P in CD30 negative PTCL.

Second, we used an individual-level network-based model to reconstruct the epidemic dynamics in Hubei Province and examine the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic spreading with various scenarios. Our simulation results show that without continued control measures, the epidemic in Hubei Province could have become persistent. Only by continuing to decrease the infection rate through 1) protective measures and 2) social distancing can the actual epidemic trajectory that happened in Hubei Province be reconstructed in simulation. Finally, we simulate the COVID-19 transmission with non-Markovian processes and show how these models produce different epidemic trajectories, compared to those obtained with Markov processes. Since recent studies show that COVID-19 epidemiological parameters do not follow exponential distributions leading to Markov processes, future works need to focus on non-Markovian models to better capture the COVID-19 spreading trajectories.

However, the risk of major stroke is very high for only the first few days after TIA and minor ischaemic stroke, and observational studies show substantially greater benefits of early medical treatment in the acute phase than do longer-term trials. We hypothesised that the short-term benefits of early aspirin have been underestimated. METHODS Pooling the individual patient data from all randomised trials of aspirin versus control in secondary prevention after TIA or ischaemic stroke, we studied the effects of aspirin on the risk and severity of recurrent stroke, stratified by the following time periods: less than 6 weeks, 6-12 weeks, and more than 12 weeks after randomisation. We compared the severity of early recurrent strokes between treatment groups with shift analysis of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. To understand possible mechanisms of action, we also studied the time course of the interaction between effects of aspirin and dipyridamole in secondary prevention of stroke. In a further analysis we pooled data from trials of aspirin versus control in which patients were randomised less than 48 h after major acute stroke, stratified by severity of baseline neurological deficit, to establish the very early time course of the effect of aspirin on risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke and how this differs by severity at baseline. FINDINGS We pooled data for 15,778 participants from 12 trials of aspirin versus control in secondary prevention. Aspirin reduced the 6 week risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke by about 60% (84 of 8452 participants in the aspirin group had an ischaemic stroke vs 175 of 7326; hazard ratio [HR] 042, 95% CI 032-055, p<00001) and disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke by about 70% (36 of 8452 vs 110 of 7326; 029, 020-042, p<00001), with greatest benefit noted in patients presenting with TIA or minor stroke (at 0-2 weeks, two of 6691 participants in the aspirin group with TIA or minor stroke had a disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke vs 23 of 5726 in the control group, HR 007, 95% CI 002-031, p=00004; at 0-6 weeks, 14 vs 60 participants, 019, 011-034, p<00001). The effect of aspirin on early recurrent ischaemic stroke was due partly to a substantial reduction in severity (mRS shift analysis odds ratio [OR] 042, 026-070, p=00007). These effects were independent of dose, patient characteristics, or aetiology of TIA or stroke. Some further reduction in risk of ischaemic stroke accrued for aspirin only versus control from 6-12 weeks, but there was no benefit after 12 weeks (stroke risk OR 097, 084-112, p=067; severity mRS shift OR 100, 077-129, p=097). By contrast, dipyridamole plus aspirin versus aspirin alone had no effect on risk or severity of recurrent ischaemic stroke within 12 weeks (OR 090, 95% CI 065-125, p=053; mRS shift OR 090, 037-172, p=099), but dipyridamole did reduce risk thereafter (076, 063-092, p=0005), particularly of disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke (064, 049-084, p=00010). We pooled data for 40,531 participants from three trials of aspirin versus control in major acute stroke. The reduction in risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke at 14 days was most evident in patients with less severe baseline deficits, and was substantial by the second day after starting treatment (2-3 day HR 037, 95% CI 025-057, p<00001). INTERPRETATION Our findings confirm that medical treatment substantially reduces the risk of early recurrent stroke after TIA and minor stroke and identify aspirin as the key intervention.

Therefore, in this research we fabricated electrospun nanofibers composite with polyvinyl alcohol, aloe vera, and zinc oxide nanoparticles for end application in medical devices. Electrospun nanofibers were made with varying concentrations of aloe vera (1%, 2%, 3%, 4%) having a constant concentration of ZnO (0.5%) with varying concentrations of ZnO nanoparticles (1%, 2%, 3%, 4%) having a constant concentration of aloe vera (0.5%). To check the morphology and composition, all prepared nanofibers were subjected to different characterization techniques, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). In addition, its antimicrobial activity was checked both with qualitative and quantitative approaches against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria and gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria. The results suggest that increasing ZnO concentration kills and inhibits bacterial growth more proficiently compared to increasing aloe vera concentration in electrospun nanofibers; the highest antimicrobial was found with 4% ZnO, killing almost 100% of gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria and 99.2% of gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria.

In order to address the COVID-19 pandemic by limiting transmission, an intense global effort is in the development of a safe and effective vaccine, which generally requires several years of pre-clinical and clinical stages of evaluation as well as strict regulatory approvals. However, because of the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 worldwide, the development and testing of a new vaccine are being accelerated. There are currently some authorized, not yet approved, vaccines to fight COVID-19, besides other ones in clinical evaluation or in a pre-clinical stage, and many more being researched. In this work, we used natural language processing and a machine learning model to predict good candidate vaccines.

Feline leukemia virus infection was conquered in less than two decades and the mysteries of feline immunodeficiency virus were largely unraveled in several years. After a half century, FIP remains one of the last important infections of cats for which we have no single diagnostic test, no vaccine and no definitive explanations for how virus and host interact to cause disease. How can a ubiquitous and largely non-pathogenic enteric coronavirus transform into a highly lethal pathogen? What are the interactions between host and virus that determine both disease form (wet or dry) and outcome (death or resistance)? Why is it so difficult, and perhaps impossible, to develop a vaccine for FIP? What role do genetics play in disease susceptibility? This review will explore research conducted over the last 5 years that attempts to answer these and other questions.

The identification of novel drugs and efficient therapies against these infectious viruses is need of the hour. The eruption of COVID-19 is caused by a novel acute respiratory syndrome virus SARS-CoV-2 which has taken the whole world by storm as it has transformed into a global pandemic. This lethal syndrome is a global health threat to general public which has already affected millions of people. Despite the development of some potential vaccines and repurposed drugs by some Pharma companies, this health emergency needs more attention due to the less efficacy of these vaccines coupled with the emergence of novel and resistant strains of SARS-CoV-2. Due to enormous structural diversity and biological applications, natural products are considered as a wonderful source of drugs for such diseases. Natural product based drugs constitute a substantial proportion of the pharmaceutical market particularly in the therapeutic areas of infectious diseases and oncology. The naturally occurring bioactive antiviral phytochemicals including alkaloids, flavonoids and peptides have been subjected to virtual screening against COVID-19. Since there is no specific medicine available for the treatment of Covid-19, designing new drugs using in silico methods plays an all important role to find that magic bullet which can target this lethal virus. The in silico method is not only quick but economical also when compared to the other conventional methods which are hit and trial methods. Based on this in silico approach, various natural products have been recently identified which might have a potential to inhibit COVID-19 outbreak. These natural products have been shown by these docking studies to interact with the spike protein of the novel coronavirus. This spike protein has been shown to bind to a transmembrane protein called Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), this protein acts as a receptor for the viral spike protein. This comprehensive review article anticipates providing a summary of the authentic and peer reviewed published literature about the potential of natural metabolites that can be developed into possible lead compounds against this new threat of Covid-19. Main focus of the article will be to highlight natural sources of potential anti-coronavirus molecules, mechanism of action, docking studies and the target proteins as well as their toxicity profiles. This review article intends to provide a starting point for the research endeavors that are needed for the design and development of drugs based on pure natural products, their synthetic or semi-synthetic derivatives and standardized plant extracts.

Close to nothing is known on what impact pandemic-related restrictions have had on the everyday life of older persons in nursing homes, and this study therefore set out to explore everyday life in a nursing home during the COVID-19, as experienced by the people living there.Methods: A random sample of 10 persons aged 85 to 100 years, living in a nursing home in an urban setting in Sweden were interviewed in June 2020. The nursing home was publicly run and had been impacted by visitor restrictions, cancelled activities and physical distancing requirements since March 2020. The participants were recruited through nursing home management and were interviewed over a two-week period using medically approved visors and physical distancing. The interviews were analysed using thematic analysis, which involves familiarisation, coding and definition of themes.Findings: The nursing home represented a bubble, protecting the persons living there from the virus but isolating them from the outside world. The older persons felt taken care of and lived one day at a time, without fear of the virus, but they also felt that they were in the hands of others, and they had lost the opportunity to do what really mattered.Interpretation: The findings provide empirical support for negative consequences of visitor restrictions, physical distancing and cancelled activities for people living in nursing homes.

In addition, neuroinflammation can alter bloodCbrain barrier (BBB) permeability. Controlling inflammatory responses is considered a promising therapeutic approach for TBI. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has already been used clinically for decades, and it is still widely used to treat various autoimmune diseases. However, the effects of HCQ on inflammation and the potential mechanism after TBI remain to be defined. The aim of the current study was to elucidate whether HCQ could improve the neurological recovery of mice post-TBI by inhibiting the inflammatory response via the TLR4/NF-B signaling pathway. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI) and randomly divided into groups that received intraperitoneal HCQ or vehicle daily after TBI. TAK-242 (3.0 mg/kg), an exogenous TLR4 antagonist, was injected intraperitoneally 1 h before TBI. Behavioral assessments were performed on days 1 and 3 post-TBI, and the gene expression levels of inflammatory cytokines were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The presence of infiltrated immune cells was examined by flow cytometry and immunostaining. In addition, BBB permeability, tight junction expression and brain edema were investigated. RESULTS: HCQ administration significantly ameliorated TBI-induced neurological deficits. HCQ alleviated neuroinflammation, the activation and accumulation of microglia and immune cell infiltration in the brain, attenuated BBB disruption and brain edema, and upregulated tight junction expression. Combined administration of HCQ and TAK-242 did not enhance the neuroprotective effects of HCQ. CONCLUSIONS: HCQ reduced proinflammatory cytokine expression, and the underlying mechanism may involve suppressing the TLR4/NF-B signaling pathway, suggesting that HCQ is a potential therapeutic agent for TBI treatment.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional and preliminary data from a prospective study, which examines 55 COPD patients. K-means clustering analysis was applied to cluster COPD patients based on the synchrogram index. Linear regression and multivariable regression analysis were used to determine the correlation between the synchrogram index and the exercise capacity assessed by a six-minute walking test (6MWT). RESULTS: The 55 COPD patients were separated into a synchronized group (median 0.89 (0.64C0.97), n = 43) and a desynchronized group (median 0.23 (0.02C0.51), n = 12) based on K-means clustering analysis.

According to the Gothenburg Framework of Person-centred Care, care should be documented in continuously revised care plans and based on patients' personally formulated goals and resources to secure a continuous partnership. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine care plans produced within a randomised controlled trial that tested a person-centred care intervention in older people with acute coronary syndrome. Nurses with training in the theory and practice of person-centred care had written the care plans. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of care plans developed in a randomised controlled trial for assessing person-centred care in patients with acute coronary syndrome (Myocardial Infarct [MI] or unstable angina pectoris). The study sample included 84 patients, with three care plans for each patient from inpatient (T1), outpatient (T2) and primary care (T3), that is, a total of 252 care plans. We conducted a descriptive quantitative content analysis of the care plans to examine the reported patients' life-world and medical/health resources and goals. RESULTS: The analysis illustrates the differences and overlaps between life-world and medical/health goals and resources. The documented goals and resources change over time: life-world goals and resources decreased with time as medical/health goals and resources documentation increased. CONCLUSIONS: This paper illustrates that in the setting of a randomised controlled trial, nurses with training in person-centred care recorded fewer life-world and more medical/health goals over time. Placing life-world goals at the top of the goal hierarchy enables alignment with medical/health goals.

RESULTS: 34% of the participants reported that they will definitely get vaccinated against Covid-19 and 39% that they would probably. Intended uptake was strongly associated with age, opinion on the governments dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, medical risk, spoken language, gender, and to a lesser extent with having known someone who was hospitalised because of Covid-19. Similar predictors were identified for attitudes to vaccination in general. Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy was more marked in age groups below 54 years old.

Traditional echocardiographic and global longitudinal strain (GLS) values were compared with prior and subsequent echocardiograms. Results: Among 96 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 with complete echocardiograms, 67 (70%) had adequate image quality for strain analysis. The cohort was predominantly male (63%) and 18% had prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Echocardiograms were largely normal with median [IQR] LV ejection fraction (EF) 62% [56%, 68%]. However, median GLS was abnormal in 91% (-13.5% [-15.0%, -10.8%]). When stratified by CVD, both groups had abnormal GLS, but presence of CVD was associated with worse median GLS (-11.6% [-13.4%, -7.2%] vs -13.9% [-15.0%, -11.3%], p=0.03). There was no difference in EF or GLS when stratified by symptoms or need for intensive care.

METHODS: We carried out a systematic review of the literature documenting the health sector application and utility of PBB in low- and middle-income countries. We then collected empirical data to examine the experience of health sector application of PBB at County Level in Kenya. RESULTS: In the financial year 2017/18, counties utilised the PBB approach for health sector planning. The PBB approach was perceived by keys stakeholders; to have improved the alignment of technical priorities with budgetary allocation, and to have increased transparency, accountability and openness of the process. Its challenges included lack of clear tools and guidelines to support implementation, low capacity at county level, political interference and the organisation of the public sector electronic financial management system around line item budgeting system. CONCLUSION: PBB is potentially a useful tool for aligning health sector planning and budgeting and ensuring the Annual Work Plan is more result oriented. However, realisation of this goal would be enhanced by the developing clear tools and guidelines to support its implementation, building capacity for county health sector managers to better understand the PBB application, and reforming the public-sector budgetary management system to align it with the PBB approach.","output":"Examining health sector application and utility of program-based budgeting: County level experiences in Kenya"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Analog space missions were created to study the human factor in extraordinary conditions that would occur in future space habitats.

INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is recognized as a major public health issue and remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. There is a clear association between adiposity, blood lipid profile, and adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) with the risk of CVD. However, the assessment of body composition parameters, dietary patterns and nutritional intervention in CVD patients undergoing a cardiovascular rehabilitation (CR) program remains insufficient. PURPOSE: to characterize body composition, lipid profile and MD adherence in patients with CVD who were attending an exercise-based CR program during COVID-19 era. METHODS: The study was developed between October 2020 and January 2021 in a phase III centre-based CR program. Body composition was assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry Hologic Explorer-W. Adherence to the MD was assessed by the 14-item MD questionnaire. Fasting blood sample was taken for measurement of lipid profile. RESULTS: A sample of 41 patients (mean age 64.4  7.9 years, 87.8% male) was evaluated. The most prevalent CVD were coronary artery disease (89.5%) and heart failure (21.1%). The main CVD risk factors at admission in the CR program were dyslipidaemia (71.1%), hypertension (68.4%), physical inactivity (26.3%) and diabetes mellitus (21.0%). In our sample the mean body mass index was 28  3.8 kg/m2, being most patients overweight (75.6%), and having a substantially increased risk of metabolic complications (85.3%) accordingly to waist-hip ratio. Body composition assessment showed that 14.6% of the patients had a body fat mass index above 90th percentile. Although only 9.8% of the patients had reduced fat free mass, 17.1% showed appendicular lean mass below the reference value. In addition, less than one third of the patients (31.7%) revealed a high adherence to the MD pattern. A sub-analysis on blood lipids (n = 26) showed that most patients had levels of LDL cholesterol (76.9%) and non-HDL cholesterol (65.4%) above the therapeutic target and 15.4% had triglycerides higher than 150 mg/dl. CONCLUSION: Body composition, lipid profile and dietary patterns, play a major role in CVD secondary prevention. Our findings showed that a substantial number of CVD patients, in COVID-19 era, did not have optimal body composition, were above lipid profile targets, and had a low/medium adherence to the MD. Thus, this study highlights the relevance of nutrition on cardiometabolic status and demonstrates the crucial role of nutritional intervention as an integrated part of a long-term phase III CR program. Moreover, further research about nutritional intervention in patients undergoing CR is warranted.","output":"Body composition, lipid profile and mediterranean diet adherence in cardiovascular disease patients attending a long-term exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation program during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The use of telehealth saw a rapid surge during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Patients gave high scores for clarity of communication during the visit, and for satisfaction with the formulation of treatment plans and their ability to ask questions, they gave the lowest scores to the effectiveness of telemedicine in replacing an in-person visit and ease of interface navigation. Conclusions: The high overall patient satisfaction reported by our patients seeking care for a spinal pathology supports the growing body of evidence promoting the use of telehealth for orthopedic care. Further research is needed in a standardized telehealth examination of patients with spinal disorders.","output":"The Efficacy of Telehealth for the Treatment of Spinal Disorders: Patient-Reported Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread explosively worldwide since the beginning of 2020. According to a multinational consensus statement from the Fleischner Society, computed tomography (CT) is a relevant screening tool due to its higher sensitivity for detecting early pneumonic changes. However, physicians are extremely occupied fighting COVID-19 in this era of worldwide crisis. Thus, it is crucial to accelerate the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic tool to support physicians. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to rapidly develop an AI technique to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia in CT images and differentiate it from nonCCOVID-19 pneumonia and nonpneumonia diseases. METHODS: A simple 2D deep learning framework, named the fast-track COVID-19 classification network (FCONet), was developed to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia based on a single chest CT image. FCONet was developed by transfer learning using one of four state-of-the-art pretrained deep learning models (VGG16, ResNet-50, Inception-v3, or Xception) as a backbone. For training and testing of FCONet, we collected 3993 chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, other pneumonia, and nonpneumonia diseases from Wonkwang University Hospital, Chonnam National University Hospital, and the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology public database. These CT images were split into a training set and a testing set at a ratio of 8:2. For the testing data set, the diagnostic performance of the four pretrained FCONet models to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia was compared. In addition, we tested the FCONet models on an external testing data set extracted from embedded low-quality chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia in recently published papers. RESULTS: Among the four pretrained models of FCONet, ResNet-50 showed excellent diagnostic performance (sensitivity 99.58%, specificity 100.00%, and accuracy 99.87%) and outperformed the other three pretrained models in the testing data set. In the additional external testing data set using low-quality CT images, the detection accuracy of the ResNet-50 model was the highest (96.97%), followed by Xception, Inception-v3, and VGG16 (90.71%, 89.38%, and 87.12%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: FCONet, a simple 2D deep learning framework based on a single chest CT image, provides excellent diagnostic performance in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia. Based on our testing data set, the FCONet model based on ResNet-50 appears to be the best model, as it outperformed other FCONet models based on VGG16, Xception, and Inception-v3.","output":"COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis Using a Simple 2D Deep Learning Framework With a Single Chest CT Image: Model Development and Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Digital approaches to delivering person-centered care training to nursing home staff have the potential to enable widespread affordable implementation, but there is very limited evidence and no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating digital training in the nursing home setting. The objective was to evaluate a digital person-centered care training intervention in a robust RCT. DESIGN: We conducted a 2-month cluster RCT in 16 nursing homes in the United Kingdom, randomized equally to receive a digitally adapted version of the WHELD person-centered care home training program with virtual coaching compared to the digital training program alone. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted in UK nursing homes. There were 175 participants (45 nursing home staff and 130 residents with dementia). METHODS: The key outcomes were the well-being and quality of life (QoL) of residents with dementia and the attitudes and knowledge of nursing home staff. RESULTS: There were significant benefits in well-being (t = 2.76, P = .007) and engagement in positive activities (t = 2.34, P = .02) for residents with dementia and in attitudes (t = 3.49, P = .001), including hope (t = 2.62, P = .013) and personhood (t = 2.26, P = .029), for staff in the group receiving digital eWHELD with virtual coaching compared to the group receiving digital learning alone. There was no improvement in staff knowledge about dementia. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The study provides encouraging initial clinical trial evidence that a digital version of the WHELD program supported by virtual coaching confers significant benefits for care staff and residents with dementia.

Recent trends in STB among those with OUD are lacking. We investigated trends in STB among US adults with versus without OUD using six waves of cross-sectional, nationally-representative, epidemiological data.Methods: Data came from the 2015-2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (combined n = 241,675). We compared past-year STB outcomes (i.e., thoughts of seriously considering killing self (SI), suicide plan (SP), suicide attempt (SA)) among adults with versus without past-year OUD. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression tested the association between survey-year and past-year STB outcomes (i.e., SI, SP/SA) stratified by OUD status.Results: Between 2015 and 2020, 26% versus 4% of those with and without OUD, respectively, reported SI, 10% versus 1% reported a SP, and 6% versus 1% reported SA (all ps < 0.001). In adjusted analyses, across survey years, no changes in the prevalence of SI were observed for adults with or without OUD, and no changes were observed over time for SP/SA in adults with or without OUD. OUD severity and treatment status did not moderate the relationship between OUD and STB outcomes.Conclusions: Among US adults, OUD was associated with thoughts of suicide and suicide behavior. The heightened prevalence of STB in adults with OUD has not changed in recent years.

The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control recommends the provision of support for tobacco cessation. We argue that the provision of smoking cessation services in clinical settings is a fundamental clinical responsibility and permits the opportunity to more effectively assist with cessation. The role of clinicians in prioritising smoking cessation is essential in all settings. Clinical benefits of implementing cessation services in hospital settings have been recognised for three decades-but have not been consistently provided. The Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation has used an 'organisational change' approach to its introduction and has served as the basis for the introduction of cessation programmes in hospital and primary care settings in Canada and elsewhere. The significance of smoking cessation dwarfs that of many preventive interventions in primary care. Compelling evidence attests to the importance of providing cessation services as part of cancer treatment, but implementation of such programmes has been slow. We recognise that the provision of such services must reflect the realities and resources of a particular health system. In low-income and middle-income countries, access to treatment facilities pose unique challenges. The integration of cessation programmes with tuberculosis control services may offer opportunities; and standardisation of peri-operative care to include smoking cessation may not require additional resources. Mobile phones afford unique opportunities for interactive cessation programming. Health system change is fundamental to improving the provision of cessation services; clinicians can be powerful advocates for such change.","output":"Smoking cessation: health system challenges and opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Proportional assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors (PAV+) is a mode of ventilation that provides assistance in proportion to patient effort. This may have physiological and clinical advantages when compared with pressure support ventilation (PSV). Our objective was to compare these two modes in patients being weaned from mechanical ventilation. DESIGN Prospective randomised controlled trial comparing PSV with PAV+. SETTING University-affiliated, tertiary referral intensive care unit (ICU). PARTICIPANTS Mechanically ventilated patients on a controlled mode of ventilation for at least 24 hours, who were anticipated to be spontaneously ventilated for at least 48 hours after randomisation. INTERVENTIONS Nil. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was time to successful liberation from the ventilator after the commencement of a spontaneous mode of ventilation. Secondary outcomes were requirement of rescue (mandatory) ventilation, requirement of sedative drugs, requirement for tracheostomy, re-intubation within 48 hours of extubation, ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, and ICU and hospital mortality. RESULTS 50 patients were randomised to either PSV (n = 25) or PAV+ (n = 25). There was no significant difference between the PAV+ and PSV groups in time to successful weaning (84.3 v 135.9 hours, respectively; P = 0.536). Four patients randomised to PAV+ were crossed over to PSV during weaning. There was no significant difference between groups for rescue ventilation, reintubation within 48 hours, tracheostomy, sedatives and analgesics prescribed, and ICU and hospital LOS. ICU mortality was higher in the PSV group (25% v 4 %; P = 0.002).

Several reports have provided conflicting recommendations regarding contact lenses (CL) use during COVID-19, causing confusion among CL wearers. The aim of this study is to assess CL wearers' attitudes toward CL wear and care during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional online survey was used to assess the participants' attitude toward CL wear and care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey layout was based on Google form? specifically developed for CL wearers. Demographic characteristics and CL history and profile were also collected for each participant. RESULTS: A total of 196 CL wearers completed the online survey with an average age was 26 ( 4.1) and 90.8 % of participants were females. As reported by the participants, social media was the main source of information about COVID-19. 38.8 % of the study population reported stopping CL wear during the pandemic. The main stated reason for lens discontinuation was decreased social activities during the pandemic. 61.2 % of participants continued lens wear, with the majority reported considerable changes in their behaviors toward CL wear and care during the pandemic. This includes reinforced hands cleaning before and after lens wear, disinfecting of CLs and CL case and less frequent CL aftercare visits. CONCLUSION: The majority of the study population have continued CL wear during the pandemic. Contact lens wearers reported profound changes in attitudes toward CL wear including improved care and maintenance. Additionally, changes in CL purchase habit have been reported with more tendency for online purchase. CL cessation has been associated with several perceived reasons mainly attributed to reduced outdoor activity and fear of ocular infection. Levels of compliance among CL wearers should be assessed and reinforced during the current pandemic and similar lockdown situation to reduce possible CL-related complications and dropout.","output":"Assessment of contact lens wearers' attitude toward contact lens wear and care during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: A cross-sectional online survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The morphological transition of the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans from budding to hyphal growth has been implicated in its ability to cause disease in animal models. Absence of SR-like RNA-binding protein Slr1 slows hyphal formation and decreases virulence in a systemic candidiasis model, suggesting a role for post-transcriptional regulation in these processes. SR (serine-arginine)-rich proteins influence multiple steps in mRNA metabolism and their localization and function are frequently controlled by modification. We now demonstrate that Slr1 binds to polyadenylated RNA and that its intracellular localization is modulated by phosphorylation and methylation. Wildtype Slr1-GFP is predominantly nuclear, but also co-fractionates with translating ribosomes. The non-phosphorylatable slr1-6SA-GFP protein, in which six serines in SR/RS clusters are substituted with alanines, primarily localizes to the cytoplasm in budding cells. Intriguingly, hyphal cells display an slr1-6SA-GFP focus at the tip near the Spitzenk?rper, a vesicular structure involved in molecular trafficking to the tip. The presence of slr1-6SA-GFP hyphal tip foci is reduced in the absence of the mRNA-transport protein She3, suggesting that unphosphorylated Slr1 associates with mRNA-protein complexes transported to the tip. The impact of SLR1 deletion on hyphal formation and function thus may be partially due to a role in hyphal mRNA transport.","output":"Post-translational modification directs nuclear and hyphal tip localization of C. albicans mRNA-binding protein Slr1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the emergence of the digital age, smart healthcare services based on the new generation of information technologies play an increasingly important role in improving the quality of resident health.

It has not been consistently explored on an acute care surgery service as a method of increasing clinic availability and efficiency within a safety-net hospital system. Socioeconomic hardships associated with an in-person clinic visit can deter patients with limited resources. A virtual clinic for post-operative laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients was developed. We hypothesized that a virtual follow-up increases clinic efficiency and availability for new patients without compromising patient safety. METHODS: A retrospective review of patient and clinic outcomes before and after implementing virtual post-op visits for uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients on an acute care surgery service was performed. Providers called post-operative patients using a standardized questionnaire. Data included outpatient clinic composition (new vs. post-operative patients), elective operations scheduled, emergency department visits, and loss to follow-up rates. RESULTS: February to March 2017 was the baseline pre-intervention period, while February to March 2019 was post-intervention. Pre-intervention clinics consisted of 17% new and 50% post-op visits, in comparison to 31% new and 27% post-op visits in the post-intervention group (p < 0.01). Elective operations scheduled increased slightly from 8.4 to 11.5 per 100 patient visits, but was not statistically significant (p = 0.09). There was no change in the number of post-operative patients returning to the emergency department (p = 0.91) or loss to follow-up (p = 0.30) rates. CONCLUSIONS: Through the implementation of virtual post-operative visits for laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients, clinic efficiency improved by increasing new patient encounters, decreasing post-operative volume, and trending towards increased operations scheduled. This change did not compromise patient safety. Further implementation of telemedicine on an acute care surgery service is a promising method to expand services offered to an at-risk population and increase efficiency in a resource-limited environment.","output":"Using telemedicine on an acute care surgery service: improving clinic efficiency and access to care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nucleolus is a prominent sub-nuclear structure found in all eukaryotes.

Among students entering new undergraduate clinical clerkships, this study aimed to investigate (1) reported proactive behaviors and their association with social integration and (2) enabling and inhibiting factors for proactive behavior. METHOD: This study was conducted at the 5-year MBBS program at Western Sydney University during academic year 2019C2020. Using a convergent mixed methods approach, survey and interview data from third-, fourth-, and fifth-year students were collected. Surveys explored 5 proactive behaviors: feedback seeking, information seeking, task negotiation, positive framing, and relationship building. Interviews elicited descriptions of how students described their proactivity and what influenced students to be proactive when entering a new clerkship. Data were integrated using the following the thread and mixed methods matrix techniques. RESULTS: Students exhibited all 5 proactive behaviors. Survey data showed positive framing and task negotiation had the highest and lowest scores, respectively. Only positive framing correlated significantly with social integration scores (r = 0.27; P < .01), but this contrasted to interviews, in which students described how other proactive behaviors also led to social integration. Proactive behavior scores decreased across academic years. Integrated data showed 3 linked antecedents to whether students exhibited proactive behavior: feeling capable of being proactive, individual intention to be proactive, and the immediate environment and system-level factors. CONCLUSIONS: Students who framed the experience positively were more likely to report increased social integration. Initiating task negotiation was challenging for most students. The authors propose a conceptual model for proactivity and social integration to support socialization and learning during clinical transitions for future research and interventional design.","output":"Medical Students Socialization Tactics When Entering a New Clinical Clerkship: A Mixed Methods Study of Proactivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Human infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a pandemic characterized by a plethora of diseases, of which those affecting the internal organs and nervous system can have severe, life-threatening consequences. Among the manifestations of the disease at the viral entry site, diseases in oral mucosa adnexa are rarely reported. This case report describes a COVID-19-associated aggravating parotid gland disease. CASE REPORT: The 47-year-old, SARS-CoV-2-positive male patient, already hospitalized and now in need of ventilation, had been referred for intensive care treatment due to increasing respiratory problems. A unilateral swelling of the cheek was noticed, the cause of which was initially a parotid gland infection. Examination ruled out mechanical causes of the parotid gland. During further treatment, the patient developed a parotid abscess, which was drained extra orally. CONCLUSION: The oral cavity is primarily considered as a reservoir of the pathogen. There is an increasing number of reports detailing inflammation of the major salivary glands associated with SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the robot for resection of these tumors. METHODS We performed a retrospective review of the evolution and outcomes of our surgical technique for inferior or posterior mediastinal pathology. RESULTS During a 30-month period, 153 patients underwent robotic surgery for pathology in the mediastinum, located in the inferior or posterior mediastinum in 75 of these patients. The most common indications for surgery were posterior mediastinal mass or lymph node in 41 patients, esophageal or bronchogenic cysts in 11 patients, esophageal leiomyoma in 7 patients, and diaphragmatic elevation in 7 patients. The median tumor size was 4.4 cm, and the median length of stay was 1 day. One patient was converted to thoracotomy, but no patients were converted for bleeding. Morbidity occurred in 9 patients (12%), major in 1 patient (a delayed esophageal leak after epiphrenic diverticulectomy). There was no mortality. Technical improvements included using robotic arm 3 posteriorly for retraction, side-docking, or coming over the back of the patient for tumors inferior to the inferior pulmonary vein and for diaphragmatic plication and using the lateral decubitus position for extraction of tumors larger than 3 cm via an access port over the tenth rib above the diaphragmatic fibers.

In Australia, EVT is provided at few, mainly metropolitan, comprehensive stroke centres (CSC). There are significant challenges for Australias rural and remote populations in accessing EVT, but improved access can be facilitated by a drip and ship approach. TACTICS (Trial of Advanced CT Imaging and Combined Education Support for Drip and Ship) aims to test whether a multicomponent, multidisciplinary implementation intervention can increase the proportion of stroke patients receiving EVT. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a non-randomised controlled, stepped wedge trial involving six clusters across three Australian states. Each cluster comprises one CSC hub and a minimum of three primary stroke centre (PSC) spokes. Hospitals will work in a hub and spoke model of care with access to a multislice CT scanner and CT perfusion image processing software (MIStar, Apollo Medical Imaging). The intervention, underpinned by behavioural theory and technical assistance, will be allocated sequentially, and clusters will move from the preintervention (control) period to the postintervention period. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Proportion of all stroke patients receiving EVT, accounting for clustering. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Proportion of patients receiving IVT at PSCs, proportion of treated patients (IVT and/or EVT) with good (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0C2) or poor (mRS score 5C6) functional outcomes and European Quality of Life Scale scores 3 months postintervention, proportion of EVT-treated patients with symptomatic haemorrhage, and proportion of reperfusion therapy-treated patients with good versus poor outcome who presented with large vessel occlusion at spokes.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological features and clinical symptoms of patients receiving remote diagnosis and treatment at the online outpatient clinic of our hospital during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, and to analyze the outcomes and advantages of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: All patients receiving remote diagnosis and treatment and consultation services over COVID-19 concerns at the online outpatient clinic of Henan Provincial People's Hospital from January 24 to February 17, 2020, were collected. A retrospective analysis was performed on their epidemiological features, clinical symptoms, and preliminary outcomes. RESULTS: Online inquiry, consultation, and suggestions were provided over COVID-19 concerns for the patients. Meanwhile, the hospital offered offline non-contact drug delivery services following online ordering and payment. A total of 4,589 patients receiving remote diagnosis and treatment were recruited. The daily number of online outpatient visits first increased and then decreased, reaching the peak on January 28 when the daily number of online outpatient visits was 612. There were 1,940 males and 2,649 females (26.5%). The youngest was aged 78 days, and the eldest 85 years old. Most of the patients were aged 20 to 39 years old, and there were 3,714 patients in this age group, accounting for 80.9%. According to the statistics, most of the patients receiving online outpatient consultation over COVID-19 concerns came from Henan Province, and the number of such patients was 3,898, accounting for 84.9%. The number of patients from other provinces was 691, accounting for 15.1%. Based on the symptoms presented in the online outpatient consultation (one patient might be combined with more than one symptom), there were 2,383 patients with fever, 1,740 patients with cough, 796 patients with nasal obstruction, 503 patients with fatigue, and 276 patients with diarrhea. A total of 873 orders of non-contact drug delivery following online payment were completed. The daily number of such orders gradually stabilized after the initial steady increase.

Those with mutations in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor binding domain (RBD) are associated with increased transmission and severity. In this study, we developed both antibody quantification and functional neutralization assays. Analyses of both COVID-19 convalescent and diagnostic cohorts strongly support the use of RBD antibody levels as an excellent surrogate to biochemical neutralization activities. Data further revealed that the samples from mRNA vaccinated individuals had a median of 17 times higher RBD antibody levels and a similar degree of increased neutralization activities against RBD-ACE2 binding than those from natural infections. Our data showed that N501Y RBD had fivefold higher ACE2 binding than the original variant. While some antisera from naturally infected subjects had substantially reduced neutralization ability against N501Y RBD, all blood samples from vaccinated individuals were highly effective in neutralizing it. Thus, our data indicates that mRNA vaccination may generate more neutralizing RBD antibodies than natural immunity.

The aim of this study was to analyze the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Croatian SOTRs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 7 September to 27 November 2020 (beginning of the second COVID-19 pandemic wave), a cross-sectional screening for COVID-19 was performed in the adult outpatient liver (LTRs; N = 280) and kidney transplant recipients (KTRs; N = 232). Serum samples were initially tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Vircell Microbiologists, Granada, Spain). All positive samples were confirmed using a virus neutralization test (VNT). Data on risk exposure and COVID-19 related symptoms were collected using a questionnaire. RESULTS: The transplanted cohorts seroprevalence detected by ELISA and VNT was 20.1% and 3.1%, respectively. Neutralizing (NT) antibodies developed in 15.6% of anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG positive SOTRs. The difference in seropositivity rates between LTRs and KTRs was not statistically significant (ELISA 21.1% vs. 19.0%, P = 0.554; VNT 3.6% vs. 2.6%, P = 0.082). Overall VNT positivity rates were higher in patients who reported participation in large community events (5.9% vs. 1.0%; P = 0.027) as well as in patients who reported COVID-19 related symptoms in the past six months. In addition, symptomatic VNT positive patients showed significantly higher (P = 0.031) NT antibody titers (median 128, interquartile range (IQR) = 32-128) compared to asymptomatic patients (median 16, IQR = 16-48). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that 15.6% of anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA positive Croatian SOTRs developed NT antibodies indicating protective immunity.

including antipsychotic, anxiolytic, antiemetic, antiviral, immunomodulatory effects along with inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and modulation of blood-brain barrier - is in line with the historical French commercial name for CPZ, i e LARGACTIL, chosen as a reference to its \\"LARGe ACTion\\" properties The discovery of those CPZ properties, as for many other molecules in psychiatry, is both the result of serendipity and careful clinical observations Using this approach, the field of mental illness could provide innovative therapeutic approaches to fight SARS-CoV-2","output":"[Repurposing of chlorpromazine in COVID-19 treatment: the reCoVery study]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Differential privacy (DP) is a widely-accepted and widely-applied notion of privacy based on worst-case analysis. Often, DP classifies most mechanisms without external noise as non-private [Dwork et al., 2014], and external noises, such as Gaussian noise or Laplacian noise [Dwork et al., 2006], are introduced to improve privacy. In many real-world applications, however, adding external noise is undesirable and sometimes prohibited. For example, presidential elections often require a deterministic rule to be used [Liu et al., 2020], and small noises can lead to dramatic decreases in the prediction accuracy of deep neural networks, especially the underrepresented classes [Bagdasaryan et al., 2019]. In this paper, we propose a natural extension and relaxation of DP following the worst average-case idea behind the celebrated smoothed analysis [Spielman and Teng, 2004]. Our notion, the smoothed DP, can effectively measure the privacy leakage of mechanisms without external noises under realistic settings. We prove several strong properties of the smoothed DP, including composability, robustness to post-processing and etc. We proved that any discrete mechanism with sampling procedures is more private than what DP predicts. In comparison, many continuous mechanisms with sampling procedures are still non-private under smoothed DP. Experimentally, we first verified that the discrete sampling mechanisms are private in real-world elections. Then, we apply the smoothed DP notion on quantized gradient descent, which indicates some neural networks can be private without adding any extra noises.

Flu pandemics from 1880 to 2020 took place during maximum or minimum of solar cycles. The article discusses several factors that modulated the development of the COVID-19 pandemic: SA dynamic, genetic population features, environment temperature, the effect of lockdowns, and vaccination in various countries. The population genetic composition turned out to be the most significant factor for coronavirus mortalities during a SA global minimum 2019-2020. COVID-19 pandemic is most severe in countries with a dominant haplogroup R1b (the relative number of deaths per million is more than 12-25). Local COVID-19 epidemics were more easily in countries with a dominant haplogroup N (relative number of deaths less than 3). The incidence per million people in haplogroups R1b: R1a: N has a ratio of about 7: 2: 1. This ratio does not depend on the pandemic waves and the population vaccinated rate. Vaccination effectiveness may depend on the population's genetic characteristics too. It is expected to maintain extremely low solar activity during the 30 years.

In addition, the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has further compounded the effect of health inequities observed in Indigenous populations, including NHPI communities. Reversible lifestyle habits, such as diet, may either be protective of or contribute to the increasing prevalence of health inequities in these populations via the immunoepigenetic-microbiome axis. This axis offers insight into the connection between diet, epigenetics, the microbiome composition, immune function, and response to viral infection. Epigenetic mechanisms that regulate inflammatory states associated with metabolic diseases, including diabetes, are impacted by diet. Furthermore, diet may modulate the gut microbiome by influencing microbial diversity and richness; dysbiosis of the microbiome is associated with chronic disease. A high fiber diet facilitates a favorable microbiome composition and in turn increases production of intermediate metabolites named short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that act on metabolic and immune pathways. In contrast, low fiber diets typically associated with a westernized lifestyle decreases the abundance of microbial derived SCFAs. This decreased abundance is characteristic of metabolic syndromes and activation of chronic inflammatory states, having larger implications in disease pathogenesis of both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders that once thrived on healthy traditional diets may be more sensitive than non-indigenous peoples to the metabolic perturbation of westernized diets that impinge on the immunoepigenetic-gut microbiome axis.

The regulation of this balance is not completely understood. We have previously shown that the cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane protein A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17cyto) binds to Thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) and the destabilization of this interaction favors the dimeric state of Trx-1. Here, we investigate whether ADAM17 plays a role in the conformation and activation of Trx-1. We found that disrupting the interacting interface with Trx-1 by a site-directed mutagenesis in ADAM17 (ADAM17cyto(F730A)) caused a decrease of Trx-1 reductive capacity and activity. Moreover, we observed that ADAM17 overexpressing cells favor the monomeric state of Trx-1 while knockdown cells do not. As a result, there is a decrease of cell oxidant levels and ADAM17 sheddase activity and an increase in the reduced cysteine-containing peptides in intracellular proteins in ADAM17cyto overexpressing cells. A mechanistic explanation that ADAM17cyto favors the monomeric, active state of Trx-1 is the formation of a disulfide bond between Cys(824) at the C-terminal of ADAM17cyto with the Cys(73) of Trx-1, which is involved in the dimerization site of Trx-1. In summary, we propose that ADAM17 is able to modulate Trx-1 conformation affecting its activity and intracellular redox state, bringing up a novel possibility for positive regulation of thiol isomerase activity in the cell by mammalian metalloproteinases.","output":"ADAM17 cytoplasmic domain modulates Thioredoxin-1 conformation and activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction and importance: Increased total serum bilirubin rarely reported in mild COVID-19 patients. It occurs mostly in severe cases, particularly in those who have liver diseases and admitted to an intensive care unit. The main cause of increased liver biochemistries in Covid-19 patients related to used drugs, the presence of the ACE2 receptor in the liver, and robust inflammatory response. However, limited studies available regarding to jaundice in COVID19 patients. Case presentation: Here we present a case of hyperbilirubinemia in a mild asymptomatic COVID-19 patient, the patient was diagnosed by RT-PCR three days prior to presentation fever, dark urine, and of acute onset of jaundice. The patient was diagnosed by physical examination and laboratory findings, and treated successfully by high-quality natural honey. Clinical discussion: A recent studies of COVID-19 increased total serum bilirubin have been reported, mostly after the appearance of the COVID-19 symptoms. The case in the current study was a 48-year-old male patient who was diagnosed with mild COVID-19 three days prior to presentation. After 2 days increased total serum bilirubin.

The curriculum covers technologies for manual and remotely sensed topographic data methods, including (1) Global Positioning Systems and Global Navigation Satellite System (GPS/GNSS) surveys, (2) Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry, and (3) ground-based (terrestrial laser scanning, TLS) and airborne lidar. Course content focuses on Earth-surface process applications but could be adapted for other geoscience disciplines. Many other field courses were canceled in summer 2020, so this course served a broad range of undergraduate and graduate students in need of a field course as part of degree or research requirements. Resulting curricular materials are available freely within the National Association of Geoscience Teachers' (NAGT's) Teaching with Online Field Experiences collection. The authors pre-collected GNSS data, uncrewed-aerial-system-derived (UAS-derived) photographs, and ground-based lidar, which students then used in course assignments. The course was run over a 2-week period and had synchronous and asynchronous components. Students created SfM models that incorporated post-processed GNSS ground control points and created derivative SfM and TLS products, including classified point clouds and digital elevation models (DEMs). Students were successfully able to (1) evaluate the appropriateness of a given survey/data approach given site conditions, (2) assess pros and cons of different data collection and post-processing methods in light of field and time constraints and limitations of each, (3) conduct error and geomorphic change analysis, and (4) propose or implement a protocol to answer a geomorphic question. Overall, our analysis indicates the course had a successful implementation that met student needs as well as course-specific and NAGT learning outcomes, with 91 % of students receiving an A, B, or C grade. Unexpected outcomes of the course included student self-reflection and redirection and classmate support through a daily reflection and discussion post. Challenges included long hours in front of a computer, computing limitations, and burnout because of the condensed nature of the course. Recommended implementation improvements include spreading the course out over a longer period of time or adopting only part of the course and providing appropriate computers and technical assistance. This paper and published curricular materials should serve as an implementation and assessment guide for the geoscience community to use in virtual or in-person high-resolution topographic data courses that can be adapted for individual labs or for an entire field or data course.","output":"A remote field course implementing high-resolution topography acquisition with geomorphic applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The time of COVID-19 is the time of storytelling-stories of chaos, loss, and despair, but also of victories large and small, acts of kindness, and deep connections.

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is a valuable experimental tool facilitating quantification of the thermodynamic parameters that characterize recognition processes involving biomacromolecules. The method provides access to all relevant thermodynamic information by performing a few experiments. In particular, ITC experiments allow to by-pass tedious and (rarely precise) procedures aimed at determining the changes in enthalpy and entropy upon binding by van't Hoff analysis. Notwithstanding limitations, ITC has now the reputation of being the \\"gold standard\\" and ITC data are widely used to validate theoretical predictions of thermodynamic parameters, as well as to benchmark the results of novel binding assays.

We aimed to establish whether health outcomes and care differed between patients infected with COVID-19 with BD and patients without a diagnosis of severe mental illness. METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study of all patients with identified COVID-19 and respiratory symptoms who were hospitalized in France between February and June 2020. The outcomes were in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We used propensity score matching to control for confounding factors. RESULTS: In total, 50 407 patients were included, of whom 480 were patients with BD. Patients with BD were 2 years older, more frequently women and had more comorbidities than controls without a diagnosis of severe mental illness. Patients with BD had an increased in-hospital mortality rate (26.6% v. 21.9%; p = 0.034) and similar ICU admission rate (27.9% v. 28.4%, p = 0.799), as confirmed by propensity analysis [odds ratio, 95% confidence interval (OR, 95% CI) for mortality: 1.30 (1.16C1.45), p < 0.0001]. Significant interactions between BD and age and between BD and social deprivation were found, highlighting that the most important inequalities in mortality were observed in the youngest [OR, 95% CI 2.28 (1.18C4.41), p = 0.0015] and most deprived patients with BD [OR, 95% CI 1.60 (1.33C1.92), p < 0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients with BD were at an increased risk of mortality, which was exacerbated in the youngest and most deprived patients with BD. Patients with BD should thus be targeted as a high-risk population for severe forms of COVID-19, requiring enhanced preventive and disease management strategies.","output":"Mortality among inpatients with bipolar disorders and COVID-19: a propensity score matching analysis in a national French cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the article was to discuss the utilization of indigenous informed epistomologies for the prevention and control of COVID-19 The incorporation of indigenous epistemologies and methodologies can create decolonized frameworks and structures that explore innovative local solutions for future health interventions Therefore, it is suggested that indigenous communities across Africa be considered as knowledge partners who contribute to the solution by sharing their cultural ways of doing, knowing and being rather than passive participants who needed to be protected This can go a long way in informing potential intervention models that are effective and culturally appropriate Such outcomes would also lead to culturally safe, appropriate, and culturally competent programs by Africans and for Africans","output":"Use of indigenous informed epistemologies can inform intervention models to fight COVID-19 in Africa.

One possible mechanism is differential immunological and neuroendocrine responses to traumatic stress exposure. In the current prospective study, we aimed to identify whether sex is indirectly associated with the probability of developing nonremitting PTSD through pro-inflammatory markers and whether steroid hormone concentrations influence this effect. Female (n = 179) and male (n = 197) trauma survivors were recruited from an emergency department and completed clinical assessment within 24 h and blood samples within three hours of trauma exposure. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1 [Formula: see text] , TNF, IFN), and steroid hormone (estradiol, testosterone, progesterone, cortisol) concentrations were quantified in plasma. Compared to men, women had a higher probability of developing nonremitting PTSD after trauma (p = 0.04), had lower pro-inflammatory cytokines and testosterone (ps<0.001), and had higher cortisol and progesterone (ps<0.001) concentrations. Estradiol concentrations were not different between the sexes (p = 0.24). Pro-inflammatory cytokines were a significant mediator in the relationship between sex and probability of developing nonremitting PTSD (p < 0.05), such that men had higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines which were associated with lower risk of nonremitting PTSD development. This effect was significantly moderated by estradiol (p < 0.05), as higher estradiol levels in men were associated with higher pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations and lower risk for developing nonremitting PTSD. The current results suggest that sex differences in the pro-inflammatory cytokine response to trauma exposure partially mediate the probability of developing nonremitting PTSD, and that the protective ability to mount an pro-inflammatory cytokine response in men may depend on higher estradiol levels in the aftermath of trauma exposure.","output":"Sex Differences in Peritraumatic Inflammatory Cytokines and Steroid Hormones Contribute to Prospective Risk for Nonremitting Posttraumatic Stress Disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is a rapidly evolving phenomenon that presents serious practical challenges and complex clinical considerations for health care workers, health care administrators, and policy formulators.

For the purposes of this report, HSCT is defined as any transplantation of blood-or marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells, regardless of transplant type (i.e., allogeneic or autologous) or cell source (i.e., bone marrow, peripheral blood, or placental or umbilical cord blood). Such OIs as bacterial, viral, fungal, protozoal, and helminth infections occur with increased frequency or severity among HSCT recipients. These evidence-based guidelines contain information regarding preventing OIs, hospital infection control, strategies for safe living after transplantation, vaccinations, and hematopoietic stem cell safety. The disease-specific sections address preventing exposure and disease for pediatric and adult and autologous and allogeneic HSCT recipients. The goal of these guidelines is twofold: to summarize current data and provide evidence-based recommendations regarding preventing OIs among HSCT patients. The guidelines were developed for use by HSCT recipients, their household and close contacts, transplant and infectious diseases physicians, HSCT center personnel, and public health professionals. For all recommendations, prevention strategies are rated by the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence supporting the recommendation.

A 78-year-old female with prior Streptococcus agalactiae mitral valve endocarditis treated with antibiotics presented one year later with severe, symptomatic aortic insufficiency. She subsequently underwent TAVR given high surgical risk. Six weeks post-TAVR, she presented with syncope, fever, and complete heart block. Transthoracic echocardiogram was not demonstrative of vegetation. Blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus lugdunensis. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) demonstrated vegetations of the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves and aorto-mitral continuity. While awaiting surgery, the patient developed cardiac arrest; she was resuscitated and taken to surgery emergently. The patient underwent TAVR explantation, bovine pericardial tissue aortic and porcine bioprosthetic mitral valve replacements, and tricuspid valve repair.

Yet, the impact of the pandemic and associated governmental regulations on early adolescents' emotional well-being has yet to be clarified. In the current study, we explored daily fluctuations in mood in 54 early adolescents (Mage = 11.07) during the first few months (April 2020CJune 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the role of parents and peers on adolescents' mood variability was investigated. Adolescents rated their mood (i.e., happiness, anger, sadness, anxiety) and peer interactions once a day during four separate weeks across different weeks of containment measures in the Netherlands. Moreover, adolescents reported on their experienced attachment to parents and peers and internalizing problems during baseline and the final measurement, respectively. Results showed relatively stable levels of mood during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, individual differences in mood variability during the first assessment week were negatively associated with the experienced level of attachment to both parents and peers. Moreover, heightened levels of mood variability did not mediate the link between attachment and internalizing problems.

Our past development trajectories have led to high emissions, persistent inequality and a world that is fragmented across multiple contradictions. How can countries shift to development pathways that deliver zero poverty and zero carbon? In developing a theory of just transition, the article begins by reviewing a range of theoretical approaches from different traditions, building in particular on neo-Gramscian approaches. It applies and modifies core components of Gramscis approach, building a neo-Gramscian theory of just transitions around concepts of ideology, hegemony, change agents and fundamental conditions. The theory suggests how coalitions of change agents can come together behind a just transition. The coalition needs to gain broader support, establish a new cultural hegemony in support of just transitions and be able to transform the fundamental conditions of the 21st century. The article briefly considers how this better understanding can be applied to the practice of shifting development pathways.

In search of a more effective treatment for VL, one of the main strategies is the development and screening of new antileishmanial compounds. Here, we reported the synthesis of seven new acetyl functionalized 1,2,3-triazolium salts, together with four 1,2,3-triazole precursors, and investigated their effect against different strains of L. infantum from dogs and humans. The 1,2,3-triazolium salts exhibited better activity than the 1,2,3-triazole derivatives with IC50 range from 0.12 to 8.66 M and, among them, compound 5 showed significant activity against promastigotes (IC50 from 4.55 to 5.28 M) and intracellular amastigotes (IC50 from 5.36 to 7.92 M), with the best selective index (SI ~ 6-9) and reduced toxicity. Our findings, using biochemical and ultrastructural approaches, demonstrated that compound 5 targets the mitochondrion of L. infantum promastigotes, leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increase of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial alteration. Moreover, quantitative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that compound 5 induces the reduction of promastigote size and cytoplasmic vacuolization. Interestingly, the effect of compound 5 was not associated with apoptosis or necrosis of the parasites but, instead, seems to be mediated through a pathway involving autophagy, with a clear detection of autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm by using both a fluorescent marker and TEM. As for the in vivo studies, compound 5 showed activity in a mouse model of VL at 20 mg/kg, reducing the parasite load in both spleen and liver (59.80% and 26.88%, respectively). Finally, this compound did not induce hepatoxicity or nephrotoxicity and was able to normalize the altered biochemical parameters in the infected mice.

Smart homes equipped with internet of things devices can allow older persons to live longer in their homes. Previous surveys used to identify sensor-based data sets in human activity recognition systems have been limited by the use of public data set characteristics, data collected in a controlled environment, and a limited number of older participants. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study is to build a model that can learn the daily routines of older persons, detect deviations in daily living behavior, and notify these anomalies in near real-time to relatives. METHODS: We extracted features from large-scale sensor data by calculating the time duration and frequency of visits. Anomalies were detected using a parametric statistical approach, unusually short or long durations being detected by estimating the mean () and standard deviation () over hourly time windows (80 to 355 days) for different apartments. The confidence level is at least 75% of the tested values within two () from the mean. An anomaly was triggered where the actual duration was outside the limits of 2 standard deviations (?2, +2), activity nonoccurrence, or absence of activity. RESULTS: The patterns detected from sensor data matched the routines self-reported by users. Our system observed approximately 1000 meals and bathroom activities and notifications sent to 9 apartments between July and August 2020. A service evaluation of received notifications showed a positive user experience, an average score of 4 being received on a 1 to 5 Likert-like scale.

Reliable and accessible sources of web-based health information are critical for cultivating patient-centered care. However, the accessibility and use of web-based health information remains largely unknown for deaf individuals. We used gaze-tracking technology to understand the navigation and use of web-based health information by deaf adults who communicate with sign language and by hearing adults. OBJECTIVE: This paper discusses our protocol for implementing gaze-tracking technology in a study that included both deaf and hearing participants. We report the preliminary results and lessons learned from the implementation of the protocol. METHODS: We conducted gaze-tracking sessions with 450 deaf signers and 450 hearing participants as a part of a larger, multisite mixed methods research study. Then, we conducted qualitative elicitation interviews with a subsample of 21 deaf and 13 hearing participants, who engaged in a search task and reviewed their gaze recordings. To our knowledge, no study has implemented a similar research protocol to better understand the experiences of deaf adults. As such, we also examined research staff notes and observations from team meetings regarding the conduct of gaze-tracking data to delineate lessons learned and best practices for research protocols in this area. RESULTS: Findings from the implementation of this study protocol highlight the use of gaze technology with deaf participants. We developed additional protocol steps to minimize gaze disruption from either lipreading or communicating in sign language. For example, research assistants were often unable to maintain eye contact with participants while signing because of the need to simultaneously point at the computer monitor to provide instructions related to gaze study components, such as the calibration process. In addition to developing ways to effectively provide instructions in American Sign Language, a practice exercise was included in the gaze tracker session to familiarize participants with the computer and technology. The use of the playback feature permitted a deeper dialogue between researchers and participants, which we found vital for understanding the experiences of deaf participants. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our experience using the study protocol through a large research project, incorporating gaze-tracking technology offers beneficial avenues for better understanding how individuals interact with health information. Gaze tracking can determine the type and placement of visual content that attracts attention from the viewers of diverse backgrounds, including deaf individuals. The lessons learned through this study will help future researchers in determining ideal study designs, such as suitable protocols and participant characteristics (eg, deaf signers), while including gaze trackers in their projects. This approach explored how different ways of presenting health information can affect or enable visual learners to engage and use health information effectively.

One hundred sharps containers were audited in November 2019 to assess whether they complied with the health and safety regulations across surgical, medical, and acute wards. Meetings with the appropriate staff members were organised and posters placed throughout the hospital to raise awareness. One hundred twenty-five sharps containers were re-audited in July 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic to ascertain if there was an improvement. In November 2019, a total of 56% of sharps containers were overfilled and hence were non-compliant with safety regulations. A re-audit performed in July 2020 found only 17% of sharps containers to be overfilled, which was a significant improvement (p = 0.0064) in practice.

One study concerned repetitions at one temperature, the other concerned isothermal experiments at various temperatures. Multilevel models characterize variation at various levels and handle dependencies in the data. The Weibull model was applied using Bayesian regression. The research question was how parameters varied with experimental conditions and how data can best be analyzed: no pooling (each experiment analyzed separately), complete pooling (all data analyzed together) or partial pooling (connecting the experiments while allowing for variation between experiments). In the first case study, level 1 consisted of the measurements, level 2 of the group of repetitions. While variation in the initial number parameter was low (set by the researchers), the Weibull shape factor varied for each repetition from 0.58-1.44, and the rate parameter from 0.006-0.074 h. With partial pooling variation was much less, with complete pooling variation was strongly underestimated. In the second case study, level 1 consisted of the measurements, level 2 of the group of repetitions per temperature experiment, level 3 of the cluster of various temperature experiments. The research question was how temperature affected the Weibull parameters. Variation in initial numbers was low (set by the researchers), the rate parameter was obviously affected by temperature, the estimate of the shape parameter depended on how the data were analyzed. With partial pooling, and one-step global modeling with a Bigelow-type model for the rate parameter, shape parameter variation was minimal. Model comparison based on prediction capacity of the various models was explored. The probability distribution of calculated decimal reduction times was much narrower using multilevel global modeling compared to the usual single level two-step approach. Multilevel modeling of microbial heat inactivation appears to be a suitable and powerful method to characterize and quantify variation at various levels. It handles possible dependencies in the data, and yields unbiased parameter estimates. The answer on the question \\"to pool or not to pool\\" depends on the goal of modeling, but if the goal is prediction, then partial pooling using multilevel modeling is the answer, provided that the experimental data allow that.","output":"To pool or not to pool: That is the question in microbial kinetics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The production of biomolecules that require human\\\\specific lipid environments is extremely useful for basic research and medical applications.

Using saliva with or without Tris-buffered saline (TBS) dilution, linearity, and limits of the N1 and N2 regions of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA were assessed using EDX SARS-CoV-2 RNA standard dissolved in RNase-free water (RFW). Fluorescence intensities in non-diluted saliva were higher than those in TBS-diluted samples. Linear regression analysis of detected quantification cycle values and spiked standard RNA concentrations showed that the coefficient of determination of the N1 and N2 genes was 0.972 and 0.615 in RFW and 0.947 and 0.660 in saliva, respectively. N1- and N2-positive detection rates in saliva were 46% (6/13 tests) and 0% (0/12 tests) at one copy/reaction, respectively. These results indicate good quantitativeness and sensitivity for N1 but not for N2.

METHODS: A total of 219 LT recipients were enrolled between May 5, 2020, and August 6, 2020, at the University Hospital Heidelberg. Serum blood samples were collected and tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS: Taking into account known risk factors of arterial hypertension, obesity, diabetes, or leukopenia, LT recipients a priori represented a high-risk cohort for severe COVID-19 with 101 of 219 (46.1%) presenting with more than 2 risk factors for severe COVID-19. Out of 219 LT recipients, 8 (3.7%) either had a positive test result for nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA or anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG. Five of eight (62.5%) did not show any clinical signs of infection, three of eight (37.5%) had self-limited disease, and none required hospitalization for COVID-19.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of pre-existing comorbidities among COVID-19 patients and their mortality risks with each category of pre-existing comorbidity. Methods: To conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL databases were searched using pre-specified search strategies. Further searches were conducted using the reference list of the selected studies, renowned preprint servers (eg, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN), and relevant journals' websites. Studies written in the English language included if those were conducted among COVID-19 patients with and without comorbidities and presented survivor vs non-survivor counts or hazard/odds of deaths or survivors with types of pre-existing comorbidities. Comorbidities reported in the selected studies were grouped into eight categories. The pooled likelihoods of deaths in each category were estimated using a fixed or random-effect model, based on the heterogeneity assessment. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot asymmetry and Egger's regression test. Trim and Fill method was used if there any publication bias was found. Results: A total of 41 studies included in this study comprised of 27 670 samples. The most common pre-existing comorbidities in COVID-19 patients were hypertension (39.5%), cardiovascular disease (12.4%), and diabetes (25.2%). The higher likelihood of deaths was found among COVID-19 patients who had pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (odds ratio (OR) = 3.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.86-4.09), immune and metabolic disorders (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 2.03-2.85), respiratory diseases (OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.72-2.19), cerebrovascular diseases (OR = 4.12, 95% CI = 3.04-5.58), any types of cancers (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.63-3.03), renal (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 2.60-3.51), and liver diseases (OR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.50-3.69). Conclusions: This study provides evidence that COVID-19 patients with pre-existing comorbidities had a higher likelihood of death. These findings could potentially help health care providers to sort out the most susceptible COVID-19 patients by comorbidities, take precautionary measures during hospitalization, assess susceptibility to death, and prioritize their treatment, which could potentially reduce the number of fatalities in COVID-19.","output":"Effects of underlying morbidities on the occurrence of deaths in COVID-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic and similar outbreaks in the future, drones can be set up to reduce human interaction for medical supplies delivery, which is crucial in times of pandemic.

There is no doubt that the older population (above the age of 60) is the most vulnerable age category due to multiple co-morbidities, which often is not in their favour. Age category, types of co-morbidities and nutritional levels indeed play a pivotal role in determining mortality rates. This paper focuses on Kerala, a southern Indian state and how it maintained low mortality levels due to COVID-19 during the first wave despite being the state with the highest proportion of the older population. The present study argues although the state possessed a robust health system and had an active engagement of the public health sector with its citizens through local governments, it was the states meticulous planning, innovative schemes centred around older persons such as reverse quarantine, the prevailing excellent nutritional status among its population and initiatives to ensure good nutrition through food security schemes like essential grocery kits and community kitchens that helped to develop the bodys resistance to infection and thus played a significant role in flattening the curve for Keralas older adult COVID-19 deaths effectively, thereby achieving a high recovery rate and low rates of fatality during the first wave of COVID-19 in Kerala. Methods: PreCCOVID-19 health conditions of older adults in Kerala were analysed through Kerala Ageing Survey (KAS) panel data and Longitudinal Ageing Survey in India (LASI) data. Percentage analysis, Logistic regression method and Cox hazard regression methods were used to analyse the effect of nutritional levels on health and mortality among older adults in Kerala. Publically available COVID-19 data from the Government of Kerala and the Government of India were used to analyse the COVID-19 death rates. In addition, changes in dietary patterns and other preventive measures taken to fight against COVID-19 were investigated through qualitative response. Result: The study found that nutritional status influences mortality and co-morbidities among older adults in Kerala in the pre-COVID situation. Furthermore, the study found that though nutritional indicators, that is, overweight or obese, significantly increases the risk of comorbid conditions among older adults, good nourishment reduces the risk of all-cause mortality. The study also found that Keralas COVID-19 fatality was much lower when compared to India and developed nations like the US, UK and Italy. Even if Kerala is one of the highly COVID-19 affected states, the effective nutritional intervention by the Government of Kerala through its various schemes to build up the general immunity of the states citizens, especially high-risk groups; thereby achieving low COVID fatality in the state.Conclusion: Based on Keralas experience, nutritional factors influence the population in building up the bodys resistance to infection against COVID-19. Even though the fatality rate is very low, obesity coupled with non-communicable diseases affects preventive measures of the state. There is an immediate and persuasive need to find new and more efficient clinical studies apart from socio-epidemiological studies, which could play a pivotal role in determining COVID-19 health outcomes.","output":"Nutritional Status and COVID-19 among Older Persons in Kerala, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE TAS-102 is effective for treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This study determined whether combining bevacizumab (Bmab) with TAS-102 improves clinical outcomes in refractory mCRC. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed data from Japanese patients with refractory mCRC who received TAS-102 (35 mg/m2 , twice a day) with (T-B group) or without Bmab (TAS-102 monotherapy; T group) between July 2014 and December 2018. The primary endpoint was median overall survival (OS), and secondary endpoints were median time to treatment failure, overall response rate, and the incidence of adverse events. Clinical outcomes were compared using propensity score matched analysis. RESULTS Data from 57 patients were analyzed (T-B group: 21 patients, T group: 36 patients). Median OS was significantly longer in the T-B group than the T group (14.4 months vs. 4.5 months, p < .001). Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that combination therapy with Bmab was significantly correlated with OS. Propensity score matched analysis confirmed that the median OS was significantly longer in the T-B group than the T group (14.4 months vs. 6.1 months, p = .006) and that there was a significant correlation between Bmab and OS. The incidence of hypertension (grade 2) as an adverse event was significantly higher in the T-B group than the T group (23.8% vs. 0.0%, p = .005), whereas other adverse events were comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSION Treatment with Bmab in combination with TAS-102 is significantly associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with mCRC refractory to standard therapies.

These networks could be both formal and informal, with positive effects seen at both individual and community levelsespecially during crisis management. In building urban resilience and to ensure access to support and services, social capital has been fundamental throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to explore different forms of social capital networks in the informal urban settlements (known as slums) of Dhaka, Bangladesh, and how these networks were helpful during the pandemic. Methods This qualitative study was conducted in three urban slums (Kallyanpur pora bosti, Dholpur, and Shyampur) in Dhaka city). In-depth phone interviews with residents (aged 18 years) of the slums were carried out by the research team, using a semi-structured questionnaire of 13 open-ended questions. Additional probing was done as necessary, depending on the clarity and specificity of the information provided by respondents. We used a snowballing sampling technique and verbal, informed consent was obtained before interviews. Thematic analysis was done. Ethical clearance was acquired from the institutional review board of BRAC James P Grant School of Public Health (2019-034-IR). Findings Between Oct 21, 2020, and Jan 12, 2021, 30 phone interviews were conducted with 22 women and 8 men. Thematic analysis showed that the most marginalised individuals in urban slums are highly dependent upon their social structures, in whom bonding social capital through informal networks is most evident. These networks are based on the trust and reliance built among people whilst living together in close proximity for a long time. Immediate family members and relatives were described as the primary point of contact for any support during emergencies. Respondents who had bridged social capital networks, and were now affiliated with different local community groups, had greater access to relief (such as food, face masks, and soap) and financial support than those who did not form social networks beyond the slums. Informal networks with landlords, local shopkeepers, pharmacies, and neighbours played a crucial role during the COVID-19 pandemic, by providing food or cash support or lending goods in credit. Interpretation Strengthening different forms of social capital is vital in building urban resilience and our findings highlight the importance of prevailing social capital networks and their roles during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Given the critical importance of blood donation and transfusion we analyzed 92 blood samples of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 stratified by symptoms. Study Design and Methods: We therefore tested blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 via RT-PCR targeting the E gene. In addition, we tested each blood sample for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies via ELISA and performed plaque reduction neutralization tests. Results: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was absent in the blood of mild to asymptomatic patients (57 individuals) and only detectable in individuals with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to the intensive care unit (35 individuals) (n = 6/92 [6.5%];p = 0.023 Fishers exact test). Interestingly, anti-spike IgG antibodies were not significantly higher in intensive care unit patients compared to mild patients, but we found that their neutralizing capacity was disproportionately increased (p &lt; 0.001).

Many previous studies have investigated the impact of working from home on the productivity of employees. However, most of these studies usually use a qualitative analysis method such as survey and interview, and the studied participants do not work from home for a long continuing time. Due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a large number of companies asked their employees to work from home, which provides us an opportunity to investigate whether working from home affects their productivity. In this study, to investigate the difference of developer productivity between working from home and working onsite, we conduct a quantitative analysis based on a dataset of developers' daily activities from Baidu Inc, one of the largest IT companies in China. In total, we collected approximately four thousand records of 139 developers' activities of 138 working days. Out of these records, 1,103 records are submitted when developers work from home due to COVID-19 pandemic. We find that WFH has both positive and negative impacts on developer productivity in terms of different metrics, e.g., the number of builds/commits/code reviews. We also notice that working from home has different impacts on projects with different characteristics including programming language, project type/age/size. For example, working from home has a negative impact on developer productivity for large projects. Additionally, we find that productivity varies for different developers.

Lombardy, one of the most active Italian regions in organ/tissue procurement, has been strongly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, data concerning the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission after tissue transplantation are controversial. Here, we aimed to evaluate the presence/absence of SARS-CoV-2 in different cardiac tissues eligible for transplantation obtained from Lombard donors. We used cardiovascular tissues from eight donors potentially suitable for pulmonary valve transplantation. All donor subjects involved in the study returned negative results for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA molecular tests (quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR, qRT-PCR, and chip-based digital PCR) in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). None of the eight donors included in this study revealed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome. However, evaluation of the protein content of pulmonary vein wall (PVW) tissue revealed variable levels of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein signal in all donors.

The several described techniques are based on the use of different tendons of the wrist, implying frequently a tenoplasty around flexor carpi radialis or transosseous tunnels to stabilize the articulation. The authors have been using, for many years, the technique conceived by F. Brunelli that relies on the anchorage of the volar band of the abductor pollicis longus tendon to the first intermetacarpal ligament, to obtain a suspension arthroplasty. Technical details are discussed. Sixty-seven patients in Eaton-Littler stage 2 or 3 with >4 years follow-up after surgery were evaluated. Each patient expressed a subjective evaluation relating to pain, functionality, strength, esthetic aspect, and general satisfaction. The following parameters have been considered as objective data: the angle of the first web space, the abduction and opposition of the first digit, the pinch, and the strength. X-rays were also performed to verify the distance between the scaphoid and the first metacarpal. In 84% of cases, a significant improvement was found in the considered parameters. Joint space was maintained in 76% of cases at radiologic follow-up. No patient needed surgical revision. The tenoplasty conceived by F. Brunelli presents several advantages, including the simple and reproducible execution, short surgical time, and comfortable postoperative course for the patient. After mid-term follow-up, authors believe this procedure is particularly respectful of the anatomy and physiology of the first ray and gives optimal results in most of the cases, but, in patients with severe subluxation of the 1st metacarpal (identifiable as Eaton-Littler stage 3), it is less reliable, because of the degeneration of the intermetacarpal ligament.","output":"F.

It selectivity binds to Glc(2)-N-glycan and is involved in a glycoprotein quality control mechanism. Even though malectin may play a role in immunity, its role in innate immunity is not fully known. In the present study, we identified and characterized the malectin gene from Hippocampus abdominalis (HaMLEC). We analyzed sequence features, spatial expression levels, temporal expression profiles upon immune responses, bacterial and carbohydrate binding abilities and anti-viral properties to investigate the potential role of HaMLEC in innate immunity. The molecular weight and isoelectric point (pI) were estimated to be 31.99 kDa and 5.17, respectively. The N-terminal signal peptide, malectin superfamily domain and C-terminal transmembrane region were identified from the amino acid sequence of HaMLEC. The close evolutionary relationship of HaMLEC with other teleosts was identified by phylogenetic analysis. According to quantitative PCR (qPCR) results, HaMLEC expression was observed in all the examined tissues and high expression was observed in the ovary and brain, compared to other tested tissues. Temporal expression of HaMLEC in liver and blood tissues were significant modulated upon exposure to immunogens Edwardasiella tarda, Streptococcus iniae, polyinosinic:polycytidylic and lipopolysaccharide. The presence of carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) of bacterial glycosyl hydrolases were functionally confirmed by a bacterial binding assay. Anti-viral activity significantly reduced viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) replication in cells overexpressing HaMLEC.

This study's primary objective was to compare rural versus urban time intervals among a national cohort of prehospital patients with STEMI. METHODS: The ESO Data Collaborative (Austin, TX), containing records from 1,366 emergency medical services agencies, was queried for adult 9-1-1 responses with suspected STEMI from 1/1/2018-12/31/2019. The scene address for each encounter was classified as either urban or rural using the 2010 US Census Urban Area Zip Code Tabulation Area relationship. The primary outcome was total EMS interval (9-1-1 call to hospital arrival); a key secondary outcome was the proportion of responses that had EMS intervals under 60 minutes. Generalized estimating equations were used to determine whether rural versus urban differences in interval outcomes occurred when adjusting for loaded mileage (distance from scene to hospital) and patient and clinical encounter characteristics. RESULTS: Of 15,915,027 adult 9-1-1 transports, 23,655 records with suspected STEMI were included in the analysis. Most responses (91.6%, n = 21,661) occurred in urban settings. Median EMS interval was 37.6 minutes (IQR 30.0-48.0) in urban settings compared to 57.0 minutes (IQR 46.5-70.7) in rural settings (p < 0.01). Urban responses more frequently had EMS intervals <60 minutes (89.5%, n = 19,130), compared to rural responses (55.5%, n = 1,100, p < 0.01). After adjusting for loaded mileage, age, sex, race/ethnicity, abnormal vital signs, pain assessment, aspirin administration, and IV/IO attempt, rural location was associated with a 5.8 (95%CI 4.2-7.4) minute longer EMS interval than urban, and rural location was associated with a reduced chance of achieving EMS interval <60 minutes (OR 0.40; 95%CI 0.33-0.49) as compared to urban location.

Information regarding cardiac markers for precise risk-stratification is limited. We aim to discover sensitive and reliable early-warning biomarkers for optimizing management and improving the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A total of 2954 consecutive COVID-19 patients who were receiving treatment from the Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital in China from February 4 to April 10 were included in this retrospective cohort. Serum levels of cardiac markers were collected after admission. Coronary artery disease diagnosis and survival status were recorded. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and bulk RNA-sequencing from different cohorts of non-COVID-19 were performed to analyze SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression. RESULTS: Among 2954 COVID-19 patients in the analysis, the median age was 60 years (50-68 years), 1461 (49.5%) were female, and 1515 (51.3%) were severe/critical. Compared to mild/moderate (1439, 48.7%) patients, severe/critical patients showed significantly higher levels of cardiac markers within the first week after admission. In severe/critical COVID-19 patients, those with abnormal serum levels of BNP (42 [24.6%] vs 7 [1.1%]), hs-TNI (38 [48.1%] vs 6 [1.0%]), &#945;- HBDH (55 [10.4%] vs 2 [0.2%]), CK-MB (45 [36.3%] vs 12 [0.9%]), and LDH (56 [12.5%] vs 1 [0.1%]) had a significantly higher mortality rate compared to patients with normal levels. The same trend was observed in the ICU admission rate. Severe/critical COVID-19 patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease (165/1,155 [10.9%]) had more cases of BNP (52 [46.5%] vs 119 [16.5%]), hs-TNI (24 [26.7%] vs 9.6 [%], &#945;- HBDH (86 [55.5%] vs 443 [34.4%]), CK-MB (27 [17.4%] vs 97 [7.5%]), and LDH (65 [41.9%] vs 382 [29.7%]), when compared with those without coronary artery disease. There was enhanced SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression in coronary artery disease compared with healthy controls.

Two-dimensional (2D) photogrammetry has replaced direct anthropometric method, but the reliability and accuracy of 2D photogrammetry has not been quantified. This study aimed to assess inter-rater reliability of 2D photogrammetry and to examine the reliability and accuracy of 2D photogrammetry with direct measurement. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: Malaysia. PARTICIPANTS: A subset of 96 participants aged 18 and above. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Ten facial dimensions were measured using direct measurement and 2D photogrammetry. An assessment of inter-rater reliability was performed using intra-class correlation (ICC) of the 2D images. In addition, ICC and Bland-Altman analyses were used to assess the reliability and agreement of 2D photogrammetry with direct measurement. RESULTS: Except for head breadth and bigonial breadth, which were also found to have low inter-rater reliability, there was no significant difference in the inter-rater mean value of the 2D photogrammetry. The mean measurements derived from direct measurement and 2D photogrammetry were mostly similar. However, statistical differences were noted for two facial dimensions, i.e., bizygomatic breadth and bigonial breadth, and clinically the magnitude of difference was also significant. There were no statistical differences in respect to the remaining eight facial dimensions, where the smallest mean difference was 0.3 mm and biggest mean difference was 1.0 mm. The ICC showed head breadth had poor reliability, whilst Bland-Altman analyses showed seven out of 10 facial dimensions using 2D photogrammetry were accurate, as compared to direct measurement. CONCLUSION: Only certain facial measurements can be reliably and accurately measured using 2D photogrammetry, thus it is important to conduct a reliability and validation study before the use of any measurement methods in anthropometric studies. The results of this study also suggest that 2D photogrammetry can be used to supplement direct measurement for certain facial dimensions.","output":"Reliability and Accuracy of 2D Photogrammetry: A Comparison With Direct Measurement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recognition of COVID-19 is a challenging task which consistently requires taking a gander at clinical images of patients. In this paper, the transfer learning technique has been applied to clinical images of different types of pulmonary diseases, including COVID-19. It is found that COVID-19 is very much similar to pneumonia lung disease. Further findings are made to identify the type of pneumonia similar to COVID-19. Transfer Learning makes it possible for us to find out that viral pneumonia is same as COVID-19. This shows the knowledge gained by model trained for detecting viral pneumonia can be transferred for identifying COVID-19. Transfer Learning shows significant difference in results when compared with the outcome from conventional classifications. It is obvious that we need not create separate model for classifying COVID-19 as done by conventional classifications. This makes the herculean work easier by using existing model for determining COVID-19. Second, it is difficult to detect the abnormal features from images due to the noise impedance from lesions and tissues. For this reason, texture feature extraction is accomplished using Haralick features which focus only on the area of interest to detect COVID-19 using statistical analyses. Hence, there is a need to propose a model to predict the COVID-19 cases at the earliest possible to control the spread of disease. We propose a transfer learning model to quicken the prediction process and assist the medical professionals. The proposed model outperforms the other existing models.

The second viral intermediate is a structure with hexagonal and pentagonal contours and partially Endo-H-resistant glycoproteins. Sialic acid is incorporated into the small glycoprotein of this second viral form. Growing the virus in glycosylation-deficient cells confirmed that acquisition of Endo-H resistance but not sialylation is critical for the trans-Golgi-dependent structural maturation and release of mature viruses. Conformational changes in viral glycoproteins triggered by changes in sugar composition would then induce the assembly of a compact viral particle of angular contours.

METHODS: A retrospective data analysis of an electronic medical record was performed on a random sample of eyes receiving anti-VEGF injections for nAMD, RVO or DMO. Data collected included age, sex, reason for injection, number of weeks delay if > 8 weeks from that planned, VA at baseline and follow-up and the OCT features, if delayed. For those eyes not delayed, a visual acuity at 20 weeks was recorded to provide a control group. RESULTS: A sample of 981 eyes (858 patients) were analysed. There was a delay in review of 8 weeks or more in 39.6% of patients of which 30.4% had since returned for review (28.4% nAMD, 37.6% RVO and 30.0% DMO). There was no demographic difference identified between the delayed and non-delayed patients; however, the delayed group was significantly more likely to have better vision in their non-treated eye (p = 0.0003). A statistically significant difference was found in the change in VA between the delayed and the not-delayed group for eyes with nAMD (p = 0.001) but not for RVO or DMO. For the delayed group, mean CMT increased by 33 and 100 m, respectively, for nAMD and RVO and decreased by 7.8 m for DMO.

Such attacks can be launched in scenarios where students are authenticated via identity documents containing face images that are remotely presented prior to online examinations. In this relevant scenario, students are able to fool human examination and automated face recognition by morphing their face image with that of an accomplice, e.g. fellow student. Resulting morphed face images contain biometric information of both subjects contributing to it. Consequentially, an accomplice could take part in an online examination for a student with high probability of passing an identity verification unnoticed. We assess the vulnerability of a commercial and an open-source face recognition system to said attack. To this end, a realistic dataset of morphing attacks is collected.

We explored how human behaviours have been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong, and how the transmission of other respiratory diseases (e.g. influenza) has been influenced by human behaviour. METHODS: We focused on the spread of COVID-19 and influenza infections based on reported COVID-19 cases and influenza surveillance data, and investigated the changes in human behaviour due to COVID-19 based on mass transit railway data and the data from a telephone survey. We did the simulation based on SEIR model to assess the risk reduction of influenza transmission caused by the changes in human behaviour. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of passengers fell by 52.0% compared with the same period in 2019. Residents spent 32.2% more time at home. Each person on average came into close contact with 17.6 and 7.1 people per day during the normal and pandemic periods, respectively. Students, workers, and older people reduced their daily number of close contacts by 83.0%, 48.1%, and 40.3%, respectively. The close contact rates in residences, workplaces, places of study, restaurants, shopping centres, markets, and public transport decreased by 8.3%, 30.8%, 66.0%, 38.5%, 48.6%, 41.0%, and 36.1%, respectively. Based on the simulation, these changes in human behaviours reduced the effective reproduction number of influenza by 63.1%.

The review aims to grab the attention of the researchers all over the globe, towards the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 disease. ACE2 serves as a molecular target for the SARS-CoV-2, to enter the target cell, by interacting with the viral glycoprotein spikes. However, the complexity began when numerous studies identified the protective response of ACE2 in abbreviating the harmful effects of vasoconstrictor, anti-inflammatory peptide, angiotensin 2, by mediating its conversion to angiotensin-(1-7), which exercised antagonistic actions to angiotensin 2. Furthermore, certain investigations revealed greater resistance among children as compared to the geriatrics, towards COVID-19 infection, despite the elevated expression of ACE2 in pediatric population. Based upon such evidences, the review demonstrated possible therapeutic interventions, targeting both the protective and deleterious effects of ACE2 in COVID-19 disease, primarily inhibiting ACE2-virus interactions or administering soluble ACE2. Thus, the authors aim to provide an opportunity for the researchers to consider RAAS system to be a significant element in development of suitable treatment regime for COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The dual impact of ACE2 in COVID-19 and ironical actions in geriatrics and pediatrics with possible therapeutic solutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globally distributed, soil associated Metarhizium species used in insect biological control are evidently facultatively sexual and obligately outcrossing, yet sexual morphs have not been observed for most species and corroboration they recombine in nature remains limited. Community-wide genetic diversity of Metarhizium species among 480 soil isolates from 14 states of western USA was investigated to assess the contributions of clonality and recombination in determining each species' population structure. Seven species, varying >100-fold in relative abundance, were identified by phylogenetic analysis of 5' EF1- (5TEF), including M. robertsii (n=372), M. guizhouense (n=37), M. brunneum (n=37), M. lepidiotae (n=14), M. pemphigi (n=11), M. anisopliae (n=7) and M. pingshaense (n=2). Analyses of composite multilocus genotypes integrating 5TEF sequences, multilocus microsatellites and mating type idiomorphs conducted on a subset of 239 isolates revealed that all species populations display pronounced clonal structure. Following clone-correction procedures to remove redundant clonal genotypes and collapse clonal lineages, each species' population sample was determined to be composed of a dozen or fewer genetically unique individuals. Thus, the Metarhizium community inhabiting western USA is conservatively estimated to comprise as few as 34 distinct genetic individuals, with a single, geographically ubiquitous clonal lineage of M. robertsii constituting 45% of total isolates. M. robertsii was the only population determined to be in linkage equilibrium. However, the high proportion of private alleles differentiating most M. robertsii clonal lineages argues against contemporary panmixia, thus the recombination signal detected may be historical. Nevertheless, within M. robertsii, M. brunneum and M. guizhouense there are closely related genotypes of opposite mating type, which suggests that if recombination is contemporary, it likely occurs between closely related individuals. The restricted number of genetic individuals observed throughout western North American Metarhizium species may signify these represent peripheral populations descended from limited numbers of founders among whom there has been little recombination relative to the extent of clone expansion and within-clone genetic divergence.","output":"Genetic structure of Metarhizium species in western USA: finite populations composed of divergent clonal lineages with limited evidence for recent recombination."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia worldwide, a kind of epidemic prevention robot is urgently needed in society The intelligent temperature measurement robot system mainly includes the robot's high stability multi-attitude omnidirectional movement module, robot path planning and autonomous navigation module, robot environment information acquisition and recognition module, robot remote control module, and robot system integration According to the design principle of the wheeled robot, high stability and multi attitude omni-directional mobile platform of temperature measuring robot are constructed;path planning and autonomous navigation of robot are realized based on sensor data fusion;temperature detection and remote care function are realized by thermal imaging sensor system by capturing the thermal radiation emitted by the human body, and based on open modular control system architecture Based on the existing research foundation, the intelligent temperature measurement robot system is established by integrating the robot multi attitude omni-directional mobile system, robot path planning, and autonomous navigation system, robot environment information acquisition and recognition system, and robot remote control system ?

We reviewed stroke characteristics, etiologies, and composite outcomes. We then compared our cohort with historic patients with AIS without COVID-19 admitted in the same time frame in 2019 and 2020. Results: Out of 13 patients with AIS and COVID-19, Latinos and African-Americans compromised the majority of our cohort (76.8%), with age ranging from 31C80 years. Most strokes were cortical (84.6%) and more than 50% of patients had no identifiable source, and were categorized as embolic stroke of unknown source (ESUS).

Results: 10 days after dose 1, 67.6% (48/71)/69.0% (49/71) were T-Ab/IgG positive; only 15.5% (11/71)/14.1% (10/71) were N-Ab/IgM positive. While all (100%) subjects had brisk T-Ab, IgG and N-Ab antibody responses 20 days after complete vaccination, only 79.1% (53/67) were IgM positive. At 180 days (n = 8), T-Ab/IgG/N-Ab were still reactive (lowest T-Ab 186 U/mL, IgG 617 AU/mL, N-Ab 0.39 g/mL), but IgM was negative in all samples. Spike antibody thresholds of T-Ab 74.1 U/mL (r = 0.95) and IgG 916 AU/mL (r = 0.95) corresponded to N-Ab reactivity (>0.3 g/mL). Non-linear regression analysis showed that N-Ab would decrease to 0.3 g/mL by 241 days, whereas T-Ab/IgG would need 470/163 days to reach titers of T-Ab/IgG associated with a N-Ab 0.3 g/mL (76.4 U/mL and 916 AU/mL respectively).

STUDY DESIGN: An observational study was perfomed by Italian ART centers and online forums. In this study, infertile couples candidate to ART and whose treatment was blocked due to the COVID-19 lockdown were enrolled through an online survey. The psychological impact of COVID-19 was measured by Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and by a short form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI); Self-perceived anxiety related either to pregnancy safety and to economic crisis measured by VAS scale. RESULTS: 627 patients completed the survey. The COVID-19 lock-down had a moderate/severe psychological impact on infertile patients (mean IES-R score 36.4  16.6). The mean STAI score was 49.8  15.3, with an overall incidence of STAI > 36 of 71 %. The mean VAS scale for anxiety perception was 45.3  15.3.

Here, we present the first data regarding the decline of the vaccine-induced humoral immune responses in patients with CID. METHODS: 23 patients with CID were monitored clinically and for anti-spike IgG and IgA levels, neutralization efficacy and antigen-specific CD4+ T cell responses over the first 6 months after SARS-CoV2 vaccination. 24 healthy individuals were included as controls. RESULTS: While anti-spike IgG-levels declined in CID patients and healthy controls, patients receiving anti-TNF treatment showed significantly greater declines at 6 months post second vaccination in IgG and especially neutralizing antibodies. IgA levels were generally lower in CID patients, particularly during anti-TNF therapy. No differences in SARS-CoV2 spike-specific CD4+ T-cell frequencies were detected. CONCLUSION: Although the long-term efficacy of SARS-CoV2 vaccination in CID patients undergoing disease-modifying therapy is still not known, the pronounced declines in humoral responses towards SARS-CoV2 6 months after mRNA vaccination in the context of TNF blockade should be considered when formulating booster regimens.

ISE was present in 8 (7.4%) patients (age 55.710.5 years, 6 female, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 16.13.8, 5 middle cerebral artery-M1, and 3 internal carotid artery terminus occlusions). Computed tomography angiogram revealed engorged/dilated leptomeningeal vessels obliterating the sulci within the areas of effacement, whereas computed tomography perfusion indicated normal-to-increased cerebral blood volume and prolonged Tmax in all patients. Modified treatment in cerebral ischemia (mTICI) 2b-3 reperfusion was achieved in all patients. Follow-up imaging confirmed no infarct in the ISE area in all patients, and 5 (62%) had modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2 at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS Sulcal effacement with preserved gray-white delineation is occasionally visualized in patients with proximal occlusion strokes, relates to robust leptomeningeal collaterals, and indicates preserved underlying parenchyma.

Understanding communities' responses to the forthcoming COVID-19 vaccines is important. We applied the theory of planned behavior as the theoretical framework. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the prevalence of and factors associated with behavioral intention to receive self-financed or free COVID-19 vaccinations among Chinese factory workers who resumed work during the pandemic. We examined the effects of factors including sociodemographics, perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination, exposure to information about COVID-19 vaccination through social media, and COVID-19 preventive measures implemented by individuals and factories. METHODS: Participants were full-time employees 18 years or older who worked in factories in Shenzhen. Factory workers in Shenzhen are required to receive a physical examination annually. Eligible workers attending six physical examination sites were invited to complete a survey on September 1-7, 2020. Out of 2653 eligible factory workers, 2053 (77.4%) completed the online survey. Multivariate two-level logistic regression models and ordinal logistic regression models were fitted. RESULTS: The prevalence of behavioral intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination was 66.6% (n=1368, conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and market rate) and 80.6% (n=1655, conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and free vaccines). After adjusting for significant background characteristics, positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.20, 95% CI 1.15-1.25 and AOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.19-1.30), perceived support from significant others for getting a COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.32-1.55 and AOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.25-1.50), and perceived behavioral control to get a COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.32-1.73 and AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.51) were positively associated with both dependent variables (conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and market rate or free vaccines, respectively). Regarding social media influence, higher frequency of exposure to positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a higher intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination at market rate (AOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.39-1.70) or a free vaccination (AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.35-1.71).

These measures may be associated with disruptions to other health services including for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) at risk for or living with HIV. Here, we assess the relationship between stringency of COVID-19 control measures and interruptions to HIV prevention and treatment services for MSM. SETTING Data for this study were collected between 16-Apr-2020 and 24-May-2020 as part of a COVID-19 Disparities Survey implemented by the gay social networking app, Hornet. Pandemic control measures were quantified using the Oxford Government Response Tracker Stringency Index: each country received a score (0-100) based on the number and strictness of nine indicators related to restrictions, closures, and travel bans. METHODS We used a multilevel mixed-effects generalized linear model with Poisson distribution to assess the association between stringency of pandemic control measures and access to HIV services. RESULTS A total of 10,654 MSM across 20 countries were included. 38% (3992/10396) reported perceived interruptions to in-person testing, 55% (5178/9335) interruptions to HIV self-testing, 56% (5171/9173) interruptions to PrEP, and 10% (990/9542) interruptions to condom access. For every ten-point increase in stringency, there was a 3% reduction in the prevalence of perceived access to in-person testing (aPR: 097, 95%CI: [096, 098]), a 6% reduction in access to self-testing (aPR: 094, 95%CI: [093, 095]), and a 5% reduction in access to PrEP (aPR: 095, 95% CI: [095, 097]). Among those living with HIV, 20% (218/1105) were unable to access their provider; 65% (820/1254) reported being unable to refill their treatment prescription remotely. CONCLUSION More stringent responses were associated with decreased perceived access to services. To minimize increases in HIV-related morbidity and mortality, innovative strategies are needed to minimize service interruptions to the community of gay men and other MSM during this and future waves of COVID-19.","output":"Perceived interruptions to HIV prevention and treatment services associated with COVID-19 for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men in 20 countries."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) may be at a higher risk of a fatal outcome in case of COVID-19. Current risk stratification among these patients relies on personal experience and extrapolation from patients with acquired heart disease. We aimed to provide an expert view on risk stratification while awaiting results from observational studies. METHODS: This study was an initiative of the EPOCH (European Collaboration for Prospective Outcome Research in Congenital Heart disease). Among nine European countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland), 24 experts from 23 tertiary ACHD centres participated in the survey. ACHD experts were asked to identify ACHD-specific COVID-19 risk factors from a list of potential outcome predictors and to estimate the risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes in seven commonly seen patient scenarios. RESULTS: 82% of participants did not consider all ACHD patients at risk of COVID-19 related complications. There was a consensus on pulmonary arterial hypertension, Fontan physiology and cyanotic heart disease as risk factors for adverse outcomes. Among different ACHD scenarios, a patient with Eisenmenger syndrome was considered to be at the highest risk. There was a marked variability in risk estimation among the other potential outcome predictors and ACHD scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary arterial hypertension, Fontan palliation and cyanotic heart disease were widely considered as risk factors for poor outcome in COVID-19. However, there was a marked disparity in risk estimation for other clinical scenarios.

However, aggregated case report data suffers from reporting delays and can lead to misleading inferences. Different from aggregated case report data, line list data is a table contains individual features such as dates of symptom onset and reporting for each reported case and a good source for modeling delays. Current methods for modeling reporting delays are not particularly appropriate for line list data, which typically has missing symptom onset dates that are non-ignorable for modeling reporting delays. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian approach that dynamically integrates imputation and estimation for line list data. Specifically, this Bayesian approach can accurately estimate the epidemic curve and instantaneous reproduction numbers, even with most symptom onset dates missing. The Bayesian approach is also robust to deviations from model assumptions, such as changes in the reporting delay distribution or incorrect specification of the maximum reporting delay. We apply the Bayesian approach to COVID-19 line list data in Massachusetts and find the reproduction number estimates correspond more closely to the control measures than the estimates based on the reported curve.","output":"Bayesian back-calculation and nowcasting for line list data during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronary artery disease remains one of the primary healthcare problems due to the high cost of treatment, increased number of patients, poor clinical outcomes, and lack of effective therapy. Though pharmacological and surgical treatments positively affect symptoms and arrest the disease progression, they generally exhibit a limited effect on the disease outcome. The development of alternative therapeutic approaches towards ischemic disease treatment, especially of decompensated forms, is therefore relevant. Therapeutic angiogenesis, stimulated by various cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, provides the possibility of restoring functional blood flow in ischemic tissues, thereby ensuring the regeneration of the damaged area. In the current study, based on the clinically approved plasmid vector pVax1, multigenic constructs were developed encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factors (FGF2), and the DsRed fluorescent protein, integrated via picornaviruses furin-2A peptide sequences. In vitro experiments demonstrated that genetically modified cells with engineered plasmid constructs expressed the target proteins. Overexpression of VEGF and FGF2 resulted in increased levels of the recombinant proteins. Concomitantly, these did not lead to a significant shift in the general secretory profile of modified HEK293T cells. Simultaneously, the secretome of genetically modified cells showed significant stimulating effects on the formation of capillary-like structures by HUVEC (endothelial cells) in vitro. Our results revealed that when the multicistronic multigene vectors encoding 2A peptide sequences are created, transient transgene co-expression is ensured. The results obtained indicated the mutual synergistic effects of the growth factors VEGF and FGF2 on the proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro. Thus, recombinant multicistronic multigenic constructs might serve as a promising approach for establishing safe and effective systems to treat ischemic diseases.","output":"Proangiogenic Effect of 2A-Peptide Based Multicistronic Recombinant Constructs Encoding VEGF and FGF2 Growth Factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Some pathogenetic and clinical aspects of the respiratory tract infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are discussed.

RECENT FINDINGS Recent studies on subgroups of critical care patients include data from many different countries. These new studies provide important information on the overall incidence of these disease states, but most of these international studies do not take into account the critical care resources of the countries being discussed. For an appropriate interpretation of findings the relevant baseline critical care resources, prevalence of diseases, and cultural practices, need to be quantified.

The pathophysiology and management of the COVID\\\\19 coagulopathy are likely more complex in patients with inherited bleeding diseases such as haemophilia. These individuals might indeed present with both bleeding and thrombotic complications and require simultaneous antithrombotic and haemostatic treatments. OBJECTIVE: We propose practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of COVID\\\\19 coagulopathy in persons with haemophilia. RESULTS: Continuation of regular haemostatic treatment is recommended for ambulatory patients. For patients requiring hospital admission and on replacement therapy with factors VIII or IX concentrates, prophylaxis with concentrates should be intensified according to the risk of bleeding complications and associated with prophylactic doses of LMWH. For patients on nonreplacement therapy, emicizumab should be continued and possibly combined with factor VIII and prophylactic doses of LMWH depending on the risk of bleeding and thrombosis. Dose escalation of LMWH tailored to the risk of thrombosis can be employed but not supported by evidence. CONCLUSIONS: These practical recommendations are based on the current literature on COVID\\\\19 with its impact on haemostasis, indications and modalities for thromboprophylaxis mainly in nonhaemophilic patients and how that is likely to affect persons with haemophilia in different circumstances.

Obtaining a U.S. PEDV isolate that can grow efficiently in cell culture is critical for investigating pathogenesis and developing diagnostic assays and for vaccine development. An additional objective was to determine which gene(s) of PEDV is most suitable for studying the genetic relatedness of the virus. Here we describe two PEDV isolates (ISU13-19338E and ISU13-22038) successfully obtained from the small intestines of piglets from sow farms in Indiana and Iowa, respectively. The two isolates have been serially propagated in cell culture for over 30 passages and were characterized for the first 10 passages. Virus production in cell culture was confirmed by PEDV-specific real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), immunofluorescence assays, and electron microscopy. The infectious titers of the viruses during the first 10 passages ranged from 6  10(2) to 2  10(5) 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/ml. In addition, the full-length genome sequences of six viruses (ISU13-19338E homogenate, P3, and P9; ISU13-22038 homogenate, P3, and P9) were determined. Genetically, the two PEDV isolates were relatively stable during the first 10 passages in cell culture. Sequences were also compared to those of 4 additional U.S. PEDV strains and 23 non-U.S. strains. All U.S. PEDV strains were genetically closely related to each other (99.7% nucleotide identity) and were most genetically similar to Chinese strains reported in 2011 to 2012. Phylogenetic analyses using different genes of PEDV suggested that the full-length spike gene or the S1 portion is appropriate for sequencing to study the genetic relatedness of these viruses.","output":"Isolation and characterization of porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses associated with the 2013 disease outbreak among swine in the United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is among the most important tools for the evaluation of gastrointestinal tumors and affected areas around the gastrointestinal tract.

However, time spent using electronic devices has not yet been examined in relation to the online learning experience. PURPOSE: This study assessed the online learning experiences and reported headaches associated with screen exposure time among health sciences university students. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among a convenience sample of 353 students at Saudi University. Online learning experiences, screen time exposure, and reported headache questionnaires were used to collect the data. RESULTS: Students were moderately satisfied with the online learning experience. Nevertheless, they faced many challenges with online learning that affected their communication efficacy, and they preferred that blended learning be continued. In addition, this study found a high prevalence of headache (65.72%) and a high screen exposure time among the studied students (52.69%).

While cells in the respiratory system are the initial target of SARS-CoV-2, there is mounting evidence that COVID-19 is a multi-organ disease. Still, the direct affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for cells in other organs such as the kidneys, which are often targeted in severe COVID-19, remains poorly understood. We employed a human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived model to investigate the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for kidney glomerular podocytes, and examined the expression of host factors for binding and processing of the virus. We studied cellular uptake of the live SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as a pseudotyped virus. Infection of podocytes with live SARS-CoV-2 or spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles revealed cellular uptake even at low multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. We found that direct infection of human iPS cell-derived podocytes by SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause cell death and podocyte foot process retraction, a hallmark of podocytopathies and progressive glomerular diseases including collapsing glomerulopathy observed in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. We identified BSG/CD147 and ACE2 receptors as key mediators of spike binding activity in human iPS cell-derived podocytes. These results show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect kidney glomerular podocytes in vitro via multiple binding interactions and partners, which may underlie the high affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for kidney tissues. This stem cell-derived model is potentially useful for kidney-specific antiviral drug screening and mechanistic studies of COVID-19 organotropism.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Employ BSG/CD147 and ACE2 Receptors to Directly Infect Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Kidney Podocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak remains one of the most influential events in the global economy over the recent years.

Pre-COVID, patient reviews were routinely undertaken face-to-face, led by therapeutic review radiographers with advanced practice qualifications and skills in radiotherapy symptom management, triage, referral and support services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, an alternative option has been to follow-up in the form of telephone reviews to reduce face-to-face exposure whilst continuing to manage patient radiotherapy treatment-related toxicities. The aim of the narrative review is to explore the subject of telephone reviews and how therapeutic review radiographers might need to adapt communication skills so that they can continue to effectively assess and manage radiotherapy patient treatment reactions remotely. Method and discussion: A narrative review was conducted using the SCOPUS database and 28 publications were included from 2013 to 2021. The review highlights a paucity of literature exploring specific telephone training for radiographers and other allied healthcare professionals. Experiences within medical and nursing programmes demonstrate that development and integration of training in this area is critical in preparing for patient interaction via telephone. Conclusion and implications for practice: Multiple teaching modalities including simulation are ideal for teaching telephone-specific skills and content, demonstrating improvement in student knowledge, competence and confidence. Less is known regarding whether this knowledge translates to an improved patient experience. Enhancements in education and training, guided by the Health and Care Professions Council, may be warranted to ensure that patients continue to receive the optimal quality of care in a world where remote reviews are likely to become commonplace. Patient-reported outcome measures might be utilized for future training evaluations to ensure that effective patient care is being maintained.","output":"A narrative review exploring the professional practice training requirement of therapeutic radiographers undertaking effective remote/telephone review clinics in place of face-to-face radiographer-led review clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite the rapid rise of publications pertaining to COVID-19, there is a lack of data examining patient outcomes following elective procedures performed during this pandemic. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this investigation is to: 1) examine the postoperative outcomes of patients that underwent elective procedures in an ambulatory surgery center during the COVID-19 pandemic; 2) share the preoperative screening and patient selection protocol implemented in our center. METHODS: Elective procedures performed in an ambulatory surgery center between March 1, 2020 and April 16, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The primary outcomes were occurrence of COVID-19 related postoperative complications. These complications include pneumonia, stroke, myocardial infarction, and clotting disorders. Predictive variables analyzed in this study were: age, American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) score, and specialty conducting the procedure, operating time, and the type of plastic and reconstructive surgery procedure being performed. RESULTS: A total of 300 consecutive electives cases were included in the study. The most common procedures were pain management (43.0%), gastrointestinal (26.0%), aesthetic (14.0%), orthopedic (10.3%), reconstructive (4.0%), otorhinolaryngology (2.0%), and gynecology (0.67%). The median age of the cohort was 54.6 years (range, 1-90 years) and the median procedure time was 47 minutes (range, 11-304 minutes). COVID-19 related symptoms or complications following the procedures were not observed in any of the patients nor the healthcare care personnel.

METHODS: Data from a caseCcontrol psychological autopsy (PA) study of 150 HK suicides were utilized. The reports of the PA cases from five major HK newspapers were collected and reviewed to identify whether or not there was a match in terms of the cases' profile and risk factors. RESULTS: The age, gender, and method of the suicides were largely reported correctly (> 70%) but accounts of risk factors were seldom accurate (< 46%). No significant difference was found between tabloid- and non-tabloid-type newspapers' accuracy. Media stereotyping of gender-specific suicide and charcoal-burning suicide was identified. LIMITATIONS: The study was based on a HK sample so the findings are not necessarily applicable elsewhere.

However, despite scientific evidence and promotion by health policy makers, SDM implementation in routine health care lags behind. This study aimed to evaluate an empirically and theoretically grounded implementation program for SDM in cancer care. METHODS: In a stepped wedge design, three departments of a comprehensive cancer center sequentially received the implementation program in a randomized order. It included six components: training for health care professionals (HCPs), individual coaching for physicians, patient activation intervention, patient information material/decision aids, revision of quality management documents, and reflection on multidisciplinary team meetings (MDTMs). Outcome evaluation comprised four measurement waves. The primary endpoint was patient-reported SDM uptake using the 9-item Shared Decision Making Questionnaire. Several secondary implementation outcomes were assessed. A mixed-methods process evaluation was conducted to evaluate reach and fidelity. Data were analyzed using mixed linear models, qualitative content analysis, and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 2,128 patient questionnaires, 559 questionnaires from 408 HCPs, 132 audio recordings of clinical encounters, and 842 case discussions from 66 MDTMs were evaluated. There was no statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint SDM uptake. Patients in the intervention condition were more likely to experience shared or patient-lead decision-making than in the control condition (d=0.24). HCPs in the intervention condition reported more knowledge about SDM than in the control condition (d = 0.50). In MDTMs the quality of psycho-social information was lower in the intervention than in the control condition (d = ? 0.48). Further secondary outcomes did not differ statistically significantly between conditions. All components were implemented in all departments, but reach was limited (e.g., training of 44% of eligible HCPs) and several adaptations occurred (e.g., reduced dose of coaching). CONCLUSIONS: The process evaluation provides possible explanations for the lack of statistically significant effects in the primary and most of the secondary outcomes. Low reach and adaptations, particularly in dose, may explain the results. Other or more intensive approaches are needed for successful department-wide implementation of SDM in routine cancer care.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, qualitative research study designed to investigate strategies used by health system leaders from around the world when mobilizing human resources in response to the global COVD-19 pandemic. Prospective interviewees were identified through nonprobability and purposive sampling methods from May to July 2020. The primary outcomes were the critical considerations, as perceived by health system leaders, when redeploying health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic determined through thematic analysis of transcribed notes. Redeployment was defined as reassigning personnel to a different location or retraining personnel for a different task. RESULTS: Nine hospital leaders from 9 hospitals in 8 health systems located in 5 countries (United States, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea) were interviewed. Six hospitals in 5 health systems experienced a surge of critically ill patients with COVID-19, and the remaining 3 hospitals anticipated, but did not experience, a similar surge. Seven of 8 hospitals redeployed their health care workforce, and 1 had a redeployment plan in place but did not need to use it. Thematic analysis of the interview notes identified 3 themes representing effective practices and lessons learned when preparing and executing workforce redeployment: process, leadership, and communication. Critical considerations within each theme were identified. Because of the various expertise of redeployed personnel, retraining had to be customized and a decentralized flexible strategy was implemented. There were 3 concerns regarding redeployed personnel. These included the fear of becoming infected, the concern over their skills and patient safety, and concerns regarding professional loss (such as loss of education opportunities in their chosen profession). Transparency via multiple different types of communications is important to prevent the development of doubt and rumors.

METTL3 expression is reduced and inflammatory genes are induced in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These findings will aid in the understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis and the design of future studies regulating innate immunity for COVID-19 treatment.","output":"METTL3 regulates viral m6A RNA modification and host cell innate immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Little is yet known whether pathogenesis of COVID-19 is different between young and elder patients. Our study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and provide predictors of mortality for young adults with severe COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 77 young adults with confirmed severe COVID-19 were recruited retrospectively at Tongji Hospital. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment and outcomes were obtained from electronic medical records. The prognostic effects of variables were analyzed using logistic regression model. RESULTS: In this retrospective cohort, non-survivors showed higher incidence of dyspnea and co-existing laboratory abnormalities, compared with young survivals in severe COVID-19. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that lymphopenia, elevated level of d-dimer, hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-CTnI) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were independent predictors of mortality in young adults with severe COVID-19. Further analysis showed that severely young adults with two or more factors abnormalities above would be more prone to death. The similar predictive effect of above four factors had been observed in all-age patients with severe COVID-19.

We aimed to characterise the socioeconomic barriers and facilitators of accessing TB services in Nepal to inform the design of a locally appropriate socioeconomic support intervention for TB-affected households. DESIGN: From August 2018 to July 2019, we conducted an exploratory qualitative study consisting of semistructured focus group discussions (FGDs) with purposively selected multisectoral stakeholders. The data were managed in NVivo V.12, coded by consensus and analysed thematically. SETTING: The study was conducted in four districts, Makwanpur, Chitwan, Dhanusha and Mahottari, which have a high prevalence of poverty and TB. PARTICIPANTS: Seven FGDs were conducted with 54 in-country stakeholders, grouped by stakeholders, including people with TB (n=21), community stakeholders (n=13) and multidisciplinary TB healthcare professionals (n=20) from the National TB Programme. RESULTS: The perceived socioeconomic barriers to accessing TB services were: inadequate TB knowledge and advocacy; high food and transportation costs; income loss and stigma. The perceived facilitators to accessing TB care and services were: enhanced championing and awareness-raising about TB and TB services; social protection including health insurance; cash, vouchers and/or nutritional allowance to cover food and travel costs; and psychosocial support and counselling integrated with existing adherence counselling from the National TB Programme. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that support interventions that integrate TB education, psychosocial counselling and expand on existing cash transfer schemes would be locally appropriate and could address the socioeconomic barriers to accessing and engaging with TB services faced by TB-affected households in Nepal. The findings have been used to inform the design of a socioeconomic support intervention for TB-affected households.

We assessed whether the prevalence of symptomatic infections, hospitalization, and deaths in household contacts of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases differed according to the SARS-CoV-2 PCR cycle threshold (Ct) from nasal-pharyngeal swab at diagnosis of linked index cases. Methods: Cross-sectional study on household contacts of COVID-19 cases randomly sampled from all the infections diagnosed in March at our Microbiology Laboratory (Amedeo di Savoia, Turin). Data were retrospectively collected by phone interviews and from the Piedmont regional platform for COVID-19 emergency. Index cases were classified as high (HVl) and low viral load (LVl) according to two exploratory cut-offs of RdRp gene Ct value. Secondary cases were defined as swab confirmed or symptom based likely when not tested but presenting compatible clinical picture. Results: One hundred thirty-two index cases of whom 87.9% symptomatic and 289 household contacts were included. The latter were male and Caucasian in 44.3 and 95.8% of cases, with a median age of 34 years (19C57). Seventy-four were swab confirmed and other 28 were symptom based likely secondary cases. Considering both, the contacts of HVl and LVl did not differ in the prevalence of symptomatic infections nor COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. No difference in median Ct of index cases between symptomatic and asymptomatic, hospitalized and not hospitalized, or deceased and survived secondary cases was found. Negative findings were confirmed after adjusting for differences in time between COVID-19 onset and swab collection of index cases (median 5 days) and after removing pediatric secondary cases. Conclusions: The amount of SARS-CoV-2 of the source at diagnosis does not predict clinical outcomes of linked secondary cases. Considering the impelling release of assays for SARS-CoV-2 RNA exact quantification, these negative findings should inform clinical and public health strategies on how to interpret and use the data.","output":"On the SARS-CoV-2 Variolation Hypothesis: No Association Between Viral Load of Index Cases and COVID-19 Severity of Secondary Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present paper aims to identify the main factors that influence the capacity building for the Green Deals implementation in Member States from the central EU (Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania) and the improvements that can be made in this regard.

METHODS: Hospitalized pediatric patients, 0-11 years of age, with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis code for COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1) were selected from 1 April 2020 to 30 September 2021 in the US Premier Healthcare Database Special Release (PHD SR). Patient characteristics, hospital length of stay (LOS), in-hospital mortality, hospital costs, hospital charges, and COVID-19-associated readmission outcomes were evaluated and stratified by age groups (0-4, 5-11), four COVID-19 disease progression states based on intensive care unit (ICU) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) usage, and three sequential calendar periods. Sensitivity analyses were performed using the US HealthVerity claims database and restricting the analyses to the primary discharge code. RESULTS: Among 4,573 hospitalized pediatric patients aged 0-11 years, 68.0% were 0-4 years and 32.0% were 5-11 years, with a mean (median) age of 3.2 (1) years; 56.0% were male, and 67.2% were covered by Medicaid. Among the overall study population, 25.7% had immunocompromised condition(s), 23.1% were admitted to the ICU and 7.3% received IMV. The mean (median) hospital LOS was 4.3 (2) days, hospital costs and charges were $14,760 ($6,164) and $58,418 ($21,622), respectively; in-hospital mortality was 0.5%.

In this context, it was necessary to understand the psychological reactions of patients with chronic diseases. We evaluated the psychological effects on patients with chronic respiratory conditions and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through the analysis of their spontaneous contacts with their referral centres. METHODS: Cross-sectional study was conducted from February 23 to April 27, 2020 in patients, or their parents, who contacted their multidisciplinary teams (MDT). E-mails and phone calls directed to the MDT of the centre for cystic fibrosis (CF) in Milano and for paediatric IBD in Bergamo, were categorised according to their contents as information on routine disease management, updates on the patient's health status, COVID-19 news monitoring, empathy towards health professionals, positive feedback and concern of contagion during the emergency. RESULTS: One thousand eight hundred and sixteen contacts were collected during the study period. In Milano, where the majority of patients were affected by CF, 88.7% contacted health professionals by e-mail, with paediatricians receiving the largest volume of emails and phone calls compared with other professionals (P< .001). Compared with Milano, the centre for IBD in Bergamo recorded more expression of empathy towards health professionals and thanks for their activity in the COVID-19 emergency (52.4% vs 12.7%, P< .001), as well as positive feedback (64.3% vs 2.7%, P = .003). CONCLUSION: One of the most important lessons we can learn from COVID-19 is that it is not the trauma itself that can cause psychological consequences but rather the level of balance, or imbalance, between fragility and resources.

We previously showed an elevated response to multifilament polyester (PE) versus monofilament polypropylene (PP) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) meshes, but it is unclear whether this discrepancy is due to the differences in chemical composition or filament structure. This study compares the influence of a newly available monofilament PE mesh to that of multifilament PE, monofilament PP, and monofilament PTFE on the expression of genes important in inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling in a rat model. Full thickness abdominal wall defects were corrected with onlay repair or suture repair with no mesh. Explants were harvested 7 or 90 days after repair and divided for histology and mRNA analyses using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction arrays to profile expression at the tissue-mesh interface. Monofilament PE elicited a reduced foreign body reaction compared to multifilament PE, corresponding with reduced mRNA expression of important inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Unexpectedly, monofilament PE also resulted in markedly reduced mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor and MMPs 3 and 9 compared to the widely-used monofilament PP mesh. Findings from this study revealed that both chemical composition and filament structure are important mesh characteristics that may affect a patient's wound healing response and clinical outcome, and should be considered by the surgeon when choosing a particular mesh. Although clinical studies are warranted, results in a rodent model suggest that monofilament PE may be more beneficial than the multifilament form for certain hernia repairs.","output":"Influence of a new monofilament polyester mesh on inflammation and matrix remodeling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Abstract: \\"This note discusses the impact of COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019] on employment and the policy responses that developing countries have taken, drawing from the sub-Saharan African experience The limited evidence so far suggests that the negative effect of the pandemic has been large for informal workers, who constitute the majority of the working poor in the region The policy measures enacted by governments in sub-Sahara have been varied, ranging from cash transfers for the poor to loans for small enterprise However, the precarious state of public finances in the region have limited the ability of governments in the region to implement expansionary fiscal stimulus packages It remains to be seen what the overall effect of the pandemic may be on employment and livelihoods in the region, and whether the policy responses enacted so far are enough to combat the adverse effects of the pandemic on the working poor \\"","output":"COVID-19 and Employment: Insights from the Sub-Saharan African Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper evaluates the aggregation behavior of a potential drug and gene delivery system that combines branched polyethyleneimine (PEI), a positively-charged polyelectrolyte, and elastin-like polypeptide (ELP), a recombinant polymer that exhibits lower critical solution temperature (LCST). The LCST behavior of ELP has been extensively studied, but there are no quantitative ways to control the size of aggregates formed after the phase transition. The aggregate size cannot be maintained when the temperature is lowered below the LCST, unless the system exhibits hysteresis and forms irreversible aggregates. This study shows that conjugation of ELP with PEI preserves the aggregation behavior that occurs above the LCST and achieves precise aggregate radii when the solution conditions of pH (3, 7, 10), polymer concentration (0.1, 0.15, 0.3 mg/mL), and salt concentration (none, 0.2, 1 M) are carefully controlled. K-means cluster analyses showed that salt concentration was the most critical factor controlling the hydrodynamic radius and LCST. Conjugating ELP to PEI allowed crosslinking the aggregates and achieved stable particles that maintained their size below LCST, even after removal of the harsh (high salt or pH) conditions used to create them.

A key unknown in simulating secondary breakup in turbulent multiphase jets is the inflow size distribution generated within the primary breakup zone near the nozzle exit. A mono-disperse injection inflow condition is commonly used for simplicity, but this choice is often unrealistic. In order to provide more realistic inlet conditions for LES, we develop a one dimensional (1D) parcel model to predict the evolution of the dispersed phase along the jet centerline due to the combined effects of advection, radial turbulent transport and droplet breakup due to turbulence in the regions closer to the jet nozzle that cannot be resolved using coarse LES. The model is validated with experimental data measured far from the nozzle. The 1D model is also used to generate an initial size distribution for use in a coarse-resolution LES of a turbulent jet. Number density fields for each bin of the discretized droplet size distribution are modeled using an Eulerian LES approach and scalar transport equations are solved for each bin. LES results are compared to published experimental data, with good agreement and we examine the statistics of the velocity field and the concentration of the polydisperse oil droplet plumes for two droplet Weber numbers. We find that the centerline decay rate of the concentration for different droplet sizes is modified in the breakup dominated zone. Unlike Reynolds averaged approaches, LES also allows us to quantify size distribution variability due to turbulence. We quantify the radial and axial distributions and the variability of key quantities such as the Sauter mean diameter, total surface area and droplet breakup time-scale and explore their sensitivity to the Weber number.","output":"Coupled population balance and large eddy simulation model for polydisperse droplet evolution in a turbulent round jet"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: SARS-CoV2 virus or COVID-19 has been associated with increased prothrombotic risk especially in the critical care setting, resulting in increased venous thromboembolism (VTE) related morbidity. The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of VTE among patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in the United States and whether there is a need for more aggressive prophylaxis. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive literature review of PubMed and Cochrane database from inception to September 2020 was performed for studies that evaluated the incidence of VTE, including pulmonary embolism (PE), and/or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) among COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the United States. We used (Coronavirus OR COVID-19 OR SARS-Cov-2) AND (venous thromboembolism, VTE OR deep vein thrombosis, DVT OR pulmonary embolism (PE) ). Finally, we screened reference lists from evaluated full texts. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Case reports and studies including cancer populations were excluded. Results: A total of 973 patients hospitalized in the United States were included from, 3 multicenter and 2 single-center retrospective studies. Of those, 3 retrospective studies determined the incidence of VTE in critically ill patients only. Most studies reported universal in-hospital (95.3%). The overall incidence of VTE was 16.8% and 12% despite prophylactic anticoagulation. Interestingly, subgroup analysis in critically ill patients demonstrated an incidence of VTE of 27.5% and 26.5% despite prophylactic anticoagulation. The overall incidence of DVT was 7.3% and 22.5% in critically ill patients admitted to ICU.

Control of these organisms has largely focused within individual hospitals. We examine the extent to which transfers of critically ill patients could be a vector for the wide spread of highly resistant organisms, and compare the efficiency of different approaches to targeting infection control resources. METHODS: We analyzed the network of interhospital transfers of intensive care unit patients in 2005 US Medicare data and 2004C2006 Pennsylvania all-payer data. We simulated the spread of highly resistant hospital-acquired infections by randomly choosing a single hospital to develop a highly resistant organism and following the spread of infection or colonization throughout the network under varying strategies of infection control and varying levels of infectivity. RESULTS: Critical care transfers could spread a highly resistant organism between any two US hospitals in a median of 3 years. Hospitals varied substantially in their importance to limiting potential spread. Targeting resources to a small subset of hospitals on the basis of their position in the transfer network was 16 times more efficient than distributing infection control resources uniformly. Within any set of targeted hospitals, the best strategy for infection control heavily concentrated resources at a few particularly important hospitals, regardless of level of infectivity. CONCLUSIONS: Critical care transfers provide a plausible vector for widespread dissemination of highly resistant hospital-acquired microorganisms. Infection control efforts can be made more efficient by selectively targeting hospitals most important for transmission.

METHODS: A systematic literature search articles online from studies published between 2020 and 2021 that met our inclusion criteria and were retrieved from scientific databases such as Cochrane, ProQuest, and PubMed. The primary measure was a composite bad outcome, which included mechanical ventilation, mortality. and bleeding risk. RESULTS: There were 3432 patients from seven study included in this meta-analysis for necessity of mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients that used prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulants. Prophylactic dose of anticoagulant showed no difference for the need for mechanical ventilation necessity for COVID-19 patients (RR = 0.54;95% CI = 0.20C1.48;p = 0.23). However, prophylactic anticoagulant showed more safe for bleeding incidence (RR = 0.27;95% CI = 0.18C0.39;p = <0.00001) and reduce mortality (RR = 0.52;95% CI = 0.46-0.58;p = <0.00001).

However, the extent to which they have been externally tested, and how well they generally perform has not been broadly evaluated. METHODS: A SCOPUS citation search was run on March 22, 2017 to identify external validations of cardiovascular CPMs in the Tufts Predictive Analytics and Comparative Effectiveness CPM Registry. We assessed the extent of external validation, performance heterogeneity across databases, and explored factors associated with model performance, including a global assessment of the clinical relatedness between the derivation and validation data. RESULTS: We identified 2030 external validations of 1382 CPMs. Eight hundred seven (58%) of the CPMs in the Registry have never been externally validated. On average, there were 1.5 validations per CPM (range, 0C94). The median external validation area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.73 (25thC75th percentile [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.66C0.79), representing a median percent decrease in discrimination of ?11.1% (IQR, ?32.4% to +2.7%) compared with performance on derivation data. 81% (n=1333) of validations reporting area under the receiver operating characteristic curve showed discrimination below that reported in the derivation dataset. 53% (n=983) of the validations report some measure of CPM calibration. For CPMs evaluated more than once, there was typically a large range of performance. Of 1702 validations classified by relatedness, the percent change in discrimination was ?3.7% (IQR, ?13.2 to 3.1) for closely related validations (n=123), ?9.0 (IQR, ?27.6 to 3.9) for related validations (n=862), and ?17.2% (IQR, ?42.3 to 0) for distantly related validations (n=717; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Many published cardiovascular CPMs have never been externally validated, and for those that have, apparent performance during development is often overly optimistic.

METHOD: We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and a phenomenological-hermeneutic approach, to get an understanding of the older participants' perspectives and lived experiences. Complete interviews were available for 11 patients-six men and five women, between 69 and 91 years of age. RESULTS: The participants' narratives identified several themes. Feeling isolated from and having no contact with close relatives or carers was prominent. The COVID-19 pandemic created fear and anxiety among hospitalized patients. Relationships with family members and some staff became strained. The transformation from being \\"a person\\" to being \\"a patient\\" and loss of dignity, autonomy and a \\"sense of self\\" were themes identified in the analysis. Although virtual contact can't replace the real world, the use of technology to maintain contact with family and carers, and the need for help from hospital staff in facilitating this contact was deemed important. The environment of care was a prominent theme. The attitude of staff made a difference to how patients felt and some patients expressed a loss of decision-making capability. The interviews were challenging in some cases because the interviews had to be interrupted or shortened due to ethical considerations around the individual person's needs and condition. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: Our study provided in-depth knowledge on how older patients experienced hospitalisation during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Danish hospital. The results emphasise that compassionate care includes a willingness to listen to older patients' narratives and to imagine life as depicted by them.

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional survey of infection preventionists in 60 community hospitals within the Duke Infection Control Outreach Network between April 22 and May 7, 2020 using Qualtrics. The survey included 13 questions related to resource availability, crisis capacity strategies and approaches to testing. RESULTS: We received 50 responses during the study period with a response rate of 83%. Community hospitals reported varying degrees of PPE shortages (Table 1); 80% of community hospitals were implementing strategies to extend and reuse N95 respirators, Powered Air-Purifying Respirators, face shields and face masks. Over 70% of facilities reported reprocessing N95 respirators (Figure 1). Almost all facilities reported universal masking at time of this survey with 90% performing daily employee screening at point of entry. Additionally, 8% of facilities restarted elective procedures at the time of this survey, but only 54% of facilities reported that they were performing preoperative testing for SARS-CoV-2.

The splanchnic vascular compartment is the primary source of vascular capacity and thus the primary target for preload recruitment in humans. Under normal conditions, sympathetic stimulation of these primary venous vessels promotes the shift of blood from the splanchnic to the thoracic compartment and elevates preload and cardiac output. However, in heart failure, since filling pressures may be elevated at rest due to decreased venous capacitance, incremental recruitment of preload to enhance cardiac output may exacerbate congestion and limit exercise capacity. Accordingly, recent attention has focused on therapies designed to regulate splanchnic vascular redistribution to improve cardiac filling pressures and patient-centered outcomes such as quality of life and exercise capacity in patients with heart failure. In this review, we discuss the relevance of splanchnic circulation as a venous reservoir, the contribution of stressed blood volume to heart failure pathogenesis, and the implications for pharmacological therapeutic interventions to prevent heart failure decompensation.

METHOD: Retrospective review of patients suspected of having COVID-19 pneumonia who attended our emergency department and underwent both CXR and a RT-PCR were included. Two radiologists reviewed the CXRs, blind to the RT-PCR, and classified them according to a structured reporting template with five categories (Characteristic, High Suspicion, Indeterminate, Unlikely and Normal) which we devised. For analysis of diagnostic accuracy, Characteristic and High Suspicion CXRs were considered positive and the remaining categories negative. Concordance between the two assessors was also assessed. RESULTS: Of 582 patients (51 +/- 20 years), 143/582 (24.6%) had a positive RT-PCR. The absolute concordance between the two assessors was 71.1% (414/582) with a Fleiss-Cohen-weighted Cohens  of 0.81 (95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.85).

The use of compartment models can be a worthwhile and attractive approach to address this problem. The present study proposes a model compartmentalized by sex and age groups that allows for more complete information on the evolution of the CoViD-19 pandemic in Italy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Italian public data on CoViD-19 were pre-treated with a 7-day moving average filter to reduce noise. A time-varying susceptible-infected-recovered-deceased (SIRD) model distributed by age and sex groups was then proposed. Recovered and infected individuals distributed by groups were reconstructed through the SIRD model, which was also used to simulate and identify optimal scenarios of pandemic containment by vaccination. The simulation started from realistic initial conditions based on the SIRD model parameters, estimated from filtered and reconstructed Italian data, at different pandemic times and phases. The following three objective functions, accounting for total infections, total deaths, and total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost, were minimized by optimizing the percentages of vaccinated individuals in five different age groups. RESULTS: The developed SIRD model clearly highlighted those pandemic phases in which younger people, who had more contacts and lower mortality, infected older people, characterized by a significantly higher mortality, especially in males. Optimizing vaccination strategies yielded different results depending on the cost function used. As expected, to reduce total deaths, the suggested strategy was to vaccinate the older age groups, whatever the baseline scenario. In contrast, for QALYs lost and total infections, the optimal vaccine solutions strongly depended on the initial pandemic conditions: during phases of high virus diffusion, the model suggested to vaccinate mainly younger groups with a higher contact rate. CONCLUSION: Because of the poor quality and insufficient availability of stratified public pandemic data, ad hoc information filtering and reconstruction procedures proved essential. The time-varying SIRD model, stratified by age and sex groups, provided insights and additional information on the dynamics of CoViD-19 infection in Italy, also supporting decision making for containment strategies such as vaccination.","output":"A compartment modeling approach to reconstruct and analyze gender and age-grouped CoViD-19 Italian data for decision-making strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contact tracing has been globally adopted in the fight to control the infection rate of COVID-19. Thanks to digital technologies, such as smartphones and wearable devices, contacts of COVID-19 patients can be easily traced and informed about their potential exposure to the virus. To this aim, several interesting mobile applications have been developed. However, there are ever-growing concerns over the working mechanism and performance of these applications. The literature already provides some interesting exploratory studies on the community's response to the applications by analyzing information from different sources, such as news and users' reviews of the applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing solution that automatically analyzes users' reviews and extracts the evoked sentiments. In this work, we propose a pipeline starting from manual annotation via a crowd-sourcing study and concluding on the development and training of AI models for automatic sentiment analysis of users' reviews. In total, we employ eight different methods achieving up to an average F1-Scores 94.8% indicating the feasibility of automatic sentiment analysis of users' reviews on the COVID-19 contact tracing applications. We also highlight the key advantages, drawbacks, and users' concerns over the applications. Moreover, we also collect and annotate a large-scale dataset composed of 34,534 reviews manually annotated from the contract tracing applications of 46 distinct countries.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using ascorbic acid in supplemental dose as adjunctive therapy in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Methods: : This was a multi-center, non-interventional, retrospective cohort study. All critically ill adult patients admitted to ICU with a confirmed COVID-19 between March 1st to December 31 st , 2020 were included in the final analysis. The study was conducted at two large governmental tertiary hospitals in Saudi Arabia. The purpose was to investigate the association between clinical outcomes with ascorbic acid use as an adjunctive therapy in COVID-19 after propensity score matching using baseline severity scores, systemic use of corticosteroids and study centers. Results: : A 739 patients were included in this study;296 patients were included after propensity score matching. There was no association between the administration of ascorbic acid and in-hospital mortality nor 30-day ICU mortality (OR (95%CI): 0.77 (0.476, 1.234), p-value=0.2738 and OR (95%CI): 0.73 (0.438 ,1.204), p-value=0.215 respectively).

This progress included both \\"symptomatic treatments\\" (ST - improves/reduces symptoms of the condition) and \\"disease modifying treatments\\" (DMT - attempts to delay/slow progression by addressing the underlying biology of PD), which can be categorised further based on their mechanisms of action and class of drug. OBJECTIVE: This report continues previous efforts to provide an overview of the pharmacological therapies - both ST and DMT - in clinical trials for PD during 2021- 2022, with the aim of creating greater awareness and involvement in the clinical trial process. We also hope to stimulate collaboration amongst all stakeholders, including industry, academia, advocacy organizations, and most importantly patient community. METHODS: We conducted a review of clinical trials of drug therapies for PD using trial data obtained from the ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organisation (WHO) registries, and performed a breakdown analysis of studies that were active as of January 31st 2022. We also assessed active drug development projects that had completed one clinical phase but were yet to start the next. RESULTS: There was a total of 147 clinical trials registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov website as active during the period of analysis. Of these trials, 91 (62%)were investigating STs, while 56 (38%)focused on DMTs. Approximately 1/3 of the studies (34.7%; 51 trials) were in Phase 1, while over half of the trials were in Phase 2 (50.3%; 74 trials). Only 15% (22 trials) of the studies were in Phase 3, of which only 3 trials were evaluating DMTs. Novel therapeutics (42%)were the most common type of agents being tested across all phases of testing, followed by repurposed agents (34%)and reformulations (20%). CONCLUSION: Despite significant global health constraints, the development of new drug-based therapies for PD continued in 2021. Hopefully with a shift towards a post-pandemic world in which COVID-19 is better managed, we will see an increase in the number of clinical trials focused on drug development for PD. The need for more Phase 3 studies for DMTs remains acute.","output":"Parkinson's Disease Drug Therapies in the Clinical Trial Pipeline: 2022 Update"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research aims to explore educational leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspectives of higher education students and to develop a guiding model of educational leadership for new normal with the novel emerging components.

Participants in all groups are university students studying in a higher education institution in Turkey. Written documents, personal interviews and group discussion are used for data collection. Based on analysis, a guiding model is developed which illustrates the concept of educational leadership for the new normal, which is composed of networking, enhancing educational practices, calmness & compassion, analytical & strategical thinking, and transparency. Also, the social network analysis shows that encouraging online communities, promoting social interaction, creating a safe and inclusive learning environment, providing learning resources, leading under pressure, emphasizing optimism, making data-driven decisions are cornerstones in terms of educational leadership for the new normal. In addition to those substantially noted key concepts, some higher education students also seem to be in need of some other aspects of educational leadership such as inspiration for learning, open dialogue, risk planning and leveraging capacity of community. The participants also indicate that successful educational leadership is about understanding others perspectives, rather than sticking to leaders perspective. ? 2022, Ozgen Korkmaz.

Methods: From January 13 to February 27, 2020, 166 hospitalized patients meeting our criteria were included. The scores of fibrotic patterns on follow-up CT were evaluated. Patients were designated as group 1 (with CT evidence of fibrotic pattern) and group 2 (without CT evidence of fibrotic pattern). Multivariate logistic regression was performed to explore risk factors for fibrotic change in patients with COVID-19. Results: The follow-up CTs were obtained on 56 days (median, IQR 51C63 days) after symptom onset. Of the 166 patients (mean age, 57  15 years; 69/166 male), 46% (76/166) had CT evidence of fibrotic change and 77% (127/166) were severe or critical cases. Among patients with fibrotic change on CT, 84% (64/76) got a minimal or mild score of fibrosis. The high total score on peak CT, peak eosinophils, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and advancing age were related to lung fibrotic change in patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: Forty six percentages of patients (mainly severe or critical cases) with COVID-19 showed fibrotic change on follow-up CT at early recovery phase, while the extent of fibrosis was not large. The advancing age, high total score on peak CT, peak eosinophils and ESR were associated with fibrotic change depicted by CT in patients recovering from COVID-19.

In this study, we evaluated if a variation of mini-PEG spacer length can be used for optimization of targeting properties of the NOTA-conjugated RM26. A series of analogs with different PEG-length (n = 2, 3, 4, 6) was synthesized, radiolabeled and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The IC50 values of natGa-NOTA-PEGn-RM26 (n = 2, 3, 4, 6) were 3.1  0.2, 3.9  0.3, 5.4  0.4 and 5.8  0.3 nM, respectively. In normal mice all conjugates demonstrated similar biodistribution pattern, however 68Ga-NOTA-PEG3-RM26 showed lower liver uptake. Biodistribution of 68Ga-NOTA-PEG3-RM26 was evaluated in nude mice bearing PC-3 (prostate cancer) and BT-474 (breast cancer) xenografts. High uptake in tumors (4.6  0.6%ID/g and 2.8  0.4%ID/g for PC-3 and BT-474 xenografts, respectively) and high tumor-to-background ratios (tumor/blood of 44  12 and 42  5 for PC-3 and BT-474 xenografts, respectively) were found already at 2 h p.i. of 68Ga-NOTA-PEG3-RM26.

Multiplayer video games can promote positive social interactions among players from different generations while playing. Yet, such facilitation of positive social interactions depends on specific game design. To systematically investigate the effects of game design on social interaction between seniors and their coplayers, the game Myosotis FoodPlanet was developed in this study, and the impacts of 3 different game modes on social interaction were compared in a controlled field trial. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the effects of 3 different game modes (competitive, cooperative, and creative) on social interactions (verbal and nonverbal communication) between seniors and their younger coplayers. METHODS: This study was conducted in a Swiss retirement home as a controlled field trial. Participants were residents of the retirement home (N=10; mean age 84.8 years, SD 5.9 years) and played in pairs with their caregivers. Each pair played 3 game modes in random order. This resulted in 30 game sequences of 20 minutes each. A within-subject design was applied with game mode as the within-factor and social interaction as the outcome variable. To assess the quality of social interaction, 30 video-recorded game sequences were analyzed based on an event sampling method. RESULTS: Analysis of variance for repeated measurements revealed significant effects: there was significantly more verbal communication in the creative mode than in the cooperative mode (P=.04) with a strong effect size (Cohen f=0.611). An examination of verbal communication revealed more game-related communication in the creative mode than in the cooperative mode (P=.01) and the competitive mode (P=.09) with marginally significant effects and strong effect sizes (Cohen f=0.841). In addition, significantly more biography-related communication occurred in the creative mode than in the cooperative mode (P=.03), with a strong effect size (r=0.707). Regarding nonverbal communication (eg, laughing together), analysis of variance for repeated measurements showed significant differences among the game modes (P=.02) with a strong effect size (Cohen f=0.758). Results showed that there was significantly more laughing together in the competitive mode (competitive>cooperative>creative). CONCLUSIONS: The results show that game mode can be an important factor for shaping the social interactions of players playing together. Compared with other modes, creative game modes can increase verbal communication. In contrast, competitive modes may stimulate more laughing together.

We also present an analysis of short-term outcomes in patients treated using this procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively evaluated 62 patients with CRP, who underwent a laparoscopic rectopexy via tack fixation, between 2004 and 2017. The peritoneum was widely attached near the site of peritoneal reflection, as in rectal cancer surgery. The hypogastric nerve was carefully detached from the front of the sacrum. Keeping the nerve intact, we lifted and mobilized the dissected rectum cranially towards the promontory, and the rectal peritoneum was affixed to the sacrum by applying 2 to 3 fixed tacks bilaterally, using a fixation device. RESULTS The median age of the study group was 80 (10 to 91) years. All procedures were successful without serious intraoperative complications; only 1 patient required conversion to open surgery. Median values for operative duration, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative period of hospitalization were 177 (125 to 441) minutes, 5 (0 to 275) mL, and 7 (3 to 17) days, respectively.

Research points to interleukin 6 (IL-6) as a crucial signature of the cytokine storm, and the clinical use of the IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab shows potential for treatment of COVID-19 patient. In this study, we challenged wild-type and adenovirus-5/human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-expressing BALB/c mice with a combination of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid and recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike-extracellular domain protein. High levels of TNF- and nearly 100 times increased IL-6 were detected at 6 h, but disappeared by 24 h in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) following immunostimulant challenge. Lung injury observed by histopathologic changes and magnetic resonance imaging at 24 h indicated that increased TNF- and IL-6 may initiate CSS in the lung, resulting in the continual production of inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesize that TNF- and IL-6 may contribute to the occurrence of CSS in COVID-19. We also investigated multiple monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and inhibitors for neutralizing the pro-inflammatory phenotype of COVID-19: mAbs against IL-1, IL-6, TNF-, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and inhibitors of p38 and JAK partially relieved CSS; mAbs against IL-6, TNF-, and GM-CSF, and inhibitors of p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and myeloperoxidase somewhat reduced neutrophilic alveolitis in the lung.

Among them, poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) has been highlighted as a biomaterial with tunable mechanical properties and biodegradability that allows for the fabrication of porous scaffolds with different micro/nanostructures via various approaches. In this review, we discuss the structure of PLLA, its main properties, and the most recent advances in overcoming its hydrophobic, synthetic nature, which limits biological signaling and protein absorption. With this aim, PLLA-based scaffolds can be exposed to surface modification or combined with other biomaterials, such as natural or synthetic polymers and bioceramics. Further, various fabrication technologies, such as phase separation, electrospinning, and 3D printing, of PLLA-based scaffolds are scrutinized along with the in vitro and in vivo applications employed in various tissue repair strategies. Overall, this review focuses on the properties and applications of PLLA in the TE field, finally affording an insight into future directions and challenges to address an effective improvement of scaffold properties.","output":"Poly-l-Lactic Acid (PLLA)-Based Biomaterials for Regenerative Medicine: A Review on Processing and Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to explore the relationship between psychological distress and post-traumatic stress disorder among Chinese participants as the result of COVID-19 outbreak.

We characterized the pathological findings in 72 mink from US farms with SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, localized SARS-CoV-2 and its host cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in mink respiratory tissues, and evaluated the utility of various test methods and specimens for SARS-CoV-2 detection in necropsy tissues. Of SARS-CoV-2-positive animals found dead, 74% had bronchiolitis and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Of euthanized SARS-CoV-2-positive animals, 72% had only mild interstitial pneumonia or minimal nonspecific lung changes (congestion, edema, macrophages); similar findings were seen in SARS-CoV-2-negative animals. Suppurative rhinitis, lymphocytic perivascular inflammation in the lungs, and lymphocytic infiltrates in other tissues were common in both SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative animals. In formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) upper respiratory tract (URT) specimens, conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (cRT-PCR) was more sensitive than in situ hybridization (ISH) or immunohistochemistry (IHC) for detection of SARS-CoV-2. FFPE lung specimens yielded less detection of virus than FFPE URT specimens by all test methods. By IHC and ISH, virus localized extensively to epithelial cells in the nasal turbinates, and prominently within intact epithelium; olfactory mucosa was mostly spared. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 was extensively detected by IHC within turbinate epithelium, with decreased detection in lower respiratory tract epithelium and alveolar macrophages. This study expands on the knowledge of the pathology and pathogenesis of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in mink and supports their further investigation as a potential animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.","output":"Histopathology and localization of SARS-CoV-2 and its host cell entry receptor ACE2 in tissues from naturally infected US-farmed mink (Neovison vison)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Three types of immunochromatographic assays (ICAs) were designed to detect anti-feline coronavirus (FCoV) antibodies.

The aim of our study was the rating of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in connection with selected demographic, social, and organizational factors, as well as the identification of key elements determining the safety of HCWs and patients of the University Hospital in Krakow. Methods: This was a non-interventional, uncontrolled, open, single-center, cross-sectional online survey on the preparedness for the COVID-19 epidemic and the seroprevalence of medical and non-medical HCWs and students. Serum specimens from 1221 persons were tested using an immunoassay analyzer based on the ECLIA technique for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies IgM + IgG. Results: The total seroprevalence was 42.7%. In medical students it was 25.2%, while in physicians it was 43.4% and in nurses/midwives it was 48.1%. Of those who tested positive, 21.5% did not know their serological status. The use of personal protective equipment did not have any significant impact on the result of testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The risk of developing the disease was not influenced by sex, professional work experience, workplace, or intensity of contact with the patient. Among the studied elements, only care of COVID-19 patients significantly increased the risk. The protective factor was starting work between the waves of the epidemic (JuneCSeptember 2020). Conclusions: PPE is only one element of infection prevention and controlwithout other components, such as hand hygiene, it can be dangerous and contribute to self-infection. It is also very important to test healthcare workers.

Generic antiviral drug remdesivir has been found to reduce time to clinical recovery but with insignificant clinical benefits and the antimalarial drug, hydroxychloroquine has been red flagged by USFDA for use as a prophylactic measure due to its cardiotoxicity. There is an acute requirement for a drug candidate that has significant clinical benefit with minimal to no side effects. With restricted access to wet laboratory techniques, an alternative approach is to engage in computational screening of lead molecules that could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at different stages of its infectious cycle. Several in silico studies on natural derivatives, especially that present in daily refreshments (tea and fruit juices), staple food (black rice, red onions, soy beans etc) and traditional medicines (extracts of herbs, leaves and flowers) have been identified as potential drug candidates that bind efficiently with the key viral proteins.

METHODS: A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted between January 18 and March 20, 2020, including people with confirmed COVID-19 from 56 hospitals officially designated in 3 Chinese regions; data were extracted from medical records. New-onset neurologic events as assessed by neurology consultants based on manifestations, clinical examination, and investigations were noted, in which critical events included disorders of consciousness, stroke, CNS infection, seizures, and status epilepticus. RESULTS: We enrolled 917 people with average age 48.7 years and 55% were male. The frequency of new-onset critical neurologic events was 3.5% (32/917) overall and 9.4% (30/319) among those with severe or critical COVID-19. These were impaired consciousness (n = 25) or stroke (n = 10). The risk of critical neurologic events was highly associated with age above 60 years and previous history of neurologic conditions. Noncritical events were seen in fewer than 1% (7/917), including muscle cramp, unexplained headache, occipital neuralgia, tic, and tremor. Brain CT in 28 people led to new findings in 9. Findings from lumbar puncture in 3 with suspected CNS infection, unexplained headache, or severe occipital neuralgia were unremarkable. CONCLUSIONS: People with COVID-19 aged over 60 and with neurologic comorbidities were at higher risk of developing critical neurologic impairment, mainly impaired consciousness and cerebrovascular accidents. Brain CT should be considered when new-onset brain injury is suspected, especially in people under sedation or showing an unexplained decline in consciousness.

There are limited data on other infectious disease comorbidities in patients with PN. OBJECTIVE: To characterize infectious disease hospitalizations among patients with PN and the associated cost burden. METHODS: We searched the 2016-2017 National Inpatient Sample, a cross-sectional sample of 20% of all U.S. hospitalizations, for infectious disease hospitalizations among patients with PN. Associations of PN with infections and related costs were determined using multivariable logistic and linear regression adjusting for age, race, sex, and insurance type. RESULTS: PN was associated with any infection overall (OR 2.98, 95% CI: 2.49 - 3.56), as well as sepsis, HIV, cutaneous, hepatobiliary, CNS, bacterial, viral, and fungal/parasitic infections. PN patients had a higher mean cost of care ($11,667 vs. $8,893, P<0.001) and length of stay (5.5 days vs. 4.2 days, P<0.001) for any infection overall and 7 of 13 other infections. Adjusting for age, race, sex, and insurance coverage, PN was associated with higher cost (+30%, 95% CI: +17% - +44%) and higher length of stay (+30%, 95% CI: +18% - +44%) for any infection overall, as well as several other infections.

The results show that the genome of QY16 consists of 27,670 nucleotides, excluding poly (A) tail, and that its genome organization is 5 UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3 UTR-poly (A) tail. Sequence comparison among QY16 and other IBV strains was conducted and its results demonstrate that the S1 gene of QY16 has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with that of 4/91, and the other part of its genome is highly similar to that of YX10. The results of the phylogenic analysis show that the entire genome of QY16 and most of the QY16 genes are located in the same cluster as those of YX10, except for the S1 gene which is located in the same cluster with that of 4/91. It has been further confirmed by the RDP and SimPlot analysis that QY16 is a recombinant strain deriving from YX10 (as the major parental sequence) and 4/91 (as the minor parental sequence), and that the recombination occurs in a region which includes the 3-terminal 1b sequence (85 nt) and the 5-terminal S1 protein gene sequence (1,466 nt). The results of the vaccination-challenge test suggest that QY16 is a nephropathogenic strain of IBV and that the vaccine strainsCH120 and 4/91cannot provide effective protection against it. These results indicate that the continuing evolution of IBV strains by genetic drift and genetic recombination may lead to IBV outbreaks even among the vaccinated chickens in China.","output":"Molecular characteristic and pathogenicity analysis of a virulent recombinant avain infectious bronchitis virus isolated in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from Wuhan, China, in 2019, causing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and creating a global pandemic affecting millions of people worldwide. Though COVID-19 primarily affects the pulmonary structures, deleterious effects can also occur in the cardiac system. We present a case of a patient with recurrent pericardial effusions secondary to COVID-19 infection, an unusual cardiovascular manifestation of this disease. A 47-year-old man presented with altered mental status and tested positive for COVID-19. He left against medical advice and later presented two weeks later with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. His symptoms were attributed to a moderate- to large-sized pericardial effusion, without evidence of tamponade, as confirmed by echocardiography. The fluid was removed by pericardiocentesis;analysis was negative for malignant cells, inflammatory markers, or microbiologic studies. Reaccumulation of the fluid necessitated placement of a pericardial window, resulting in the resolution of his symptoms. There are limited case reports demonstrating the association of pericardial effusion with COVID-19 infection. The effusion is likely secondary to the inflammatory response leading to capillary leakage, resulting in pericardial fluid traversing the serous pericardium. In addition to other demonstrated cardiovascular effects, COVID-19 appears to be associated with recurrent pericardial effusion. Due to the rise in COVID-19 cases, it is essential to consider pericardial effusion as a rare but potential complication of this virus.

Plans and policies for responding to public health emergencies are generally framed at higher levels of governance, but developing, improving and sustaining the capacities necessary for implementing these policies is a direct function of local-level authorities. Evaluating local-level public health capacities is an important process for identifying strengths and weaknesses that can impact the preparedness for, detection of and response to health security threats. However, while various evaluations and assessments exist for evaluating capacities at other levels, currently, there are no readily available health security assessments for the local-level. In this paper, we describe a tool-the Rapid Urban Health Security Assessment (RUHSA) Tool-that is based on a variety of other relevant assessments and guidance documents. Assessing capacities allow for local-level authorities to identify the strengths and weaknesses of their local health security systems, create multiyear action plans and prioritise opportunities for improving capacities, effectively engage with development partners to target resources effectively and develop compelling narratives and a legacy of leadership. While the RUHSA Tool was not designed to be used in the midst of a public health emergency, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it may also be adapted to inform a checklist for prioritising what capacities and activities a city needs to rapidly develop or to help focus requests for assistance.","output":"Rapid urban health security assessment tool: a new resource for evaluating local-level public health preparedness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the COVID-19 pandemic has adverse effects on the state of mental health of the individuals, no attention has been paid so far in the academia whether there is an association between students' inattentiveness to study and their psychological conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, the study was intended to find out the association between students' inattentiveness to study and their psychological conditions during this pandemic. Primary data for this study were collected from a total of 157 samples chosen from the undergraduate students of 18 academic departments of the Noakhali Science and Technology University (NSTU), Bangladesh on the basis of snowball sampling. The study reveals that most of the respondents were much inattentive to study during the COVID-19 pandemic and they were much anxious, depressed, tensed, restless, bored and frightened, and thereby their mental health and well-being were affected. The study shows that there is a strong positive association between the students' inattentiveness to study and their psychological conditions which involve anxiety, depression, tension, restlessness, boredom and fear/panic. The study indicates that the association between the students' inattentiveness to study and their psychological conditions is statistically significant. Finally, the study suggests that the Government and the authority concerned should undertake proper measures to mitigate the adverse psychological conditions of the NSTU students by means of motivations and psychosocial counselling, and thereby keeping up their attentiveness to study during the pandemic or any other critical situation.

Tracing the path to this point illuminates the tasks that the institutions created during this transformation must be designed to do.

Setting Mail survey of randomly selected stratified cross-sectional samples of MDs and NPs drawn from national lists of clinicians in eligible specialties working in emergency, trauma, intensive and critical care units in the United States. Participants 814 clinicians (351 NPs and 463 MDs) recruited from national by postal mail survey. Our initial sample included n=2063 clinicians, n=1031 NPs and n=1032 MDs in eligible specialties. Of these, 63.5% of NPs and 70.1% of MDs completed and returned the survey excluding those who were ineligible due to lack of current practice in a relevant specialty Results NPs in ICU/CCU are more likely to be female and report working fewer hours than do MDs and provide direct care to more patients. 55% of NPs and 82% of MDs agree that their individual role in their unit is clear (p<.001); 34% of MDs and 42% of NPs agree that their unit is an example of excellent team work among professionals (p=0.021); 41% of MD and 37% of NP clinicians (p=0.061) agree that their teams are prepared to provide outstanding care in a crisis or disaster. Perceived role clarity was significantly associated with increased perceptions of excellent teamwork and disaster preparedness. Conclusion and Relevance Leaders of health organizations need to engage with one another and with their professional teams to assure that roles and responsibilities are clear and that teams are both prepared to provide the highest quality and efficient care in critical care and in disaster.","output":"Physician and Nurse Practitioner Roles in Emergency, Trauma, Critical and Intensive Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is increasing concern that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic could harm psychological health and exacerbate suicide risk. Here, based on month-level records of suicides covering the entire Japanese population in 1,848 administrative units, we assessed whether suicide mortality changed during the pandemic. Using difference-in-difference estimation, we found that monthly suicide rates declined by 14% during the first 5 months of the pandemic (February to June 2020). This could be due to a number of complex reasons, including the government's generous subsidies, reduced working hours and school closure. By contrast, monthly suicide rates increased by 16% during the second wave (July to October 2020), with a larger increase among females (37%) and children and adolescents (49%). Although adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may remain in the long term, its modifiers (such as government subsidies) may not be sustained. Thus, effective suicide prevention-particularly among vulnerable populations-should be an important public health consideration.","output":"Increase in suicide following an initial decline during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Economic shocks due to Covid-19 were exceptional in their severity, suddenness and heterogeneity across industries. To study the upstream and downstream propagation of these industry-specific demand and supply shocks, we build a dynamic input-output model inspired by previous work on the economic response to natural disasters. We argue that standard production functions, at least in their most parsimonious parametrizations, are not adequate to model input substitutability in the context of Covid-19 shocks. We use a survey of industry analysts to evaluate, for each industry, which inputs were absolutely necessary for production over a short time period. We calibrate our model on the UK economy and study the economic effects of the lockdown that was imposed at the end of March and gradually released in May. Looking back at predictions that we released in May, we show that the model predicted aggregate dynamics very well, and sectoral dynamics to a large extent. We discuss the relative extent to which the model's dynamics and performance was due to the choice of the production function or the choice of an exogenous shock scenario. To further explore the behavior of the model, we use simpler scenarios with only demand or supply shocks, and find that popular metrics used to predict a priori the impact of shocks, such as output multipliers, are only mildly useful.","output":"In and out of lockdown: Propagation of supply and demand shocks in a dynamic input-output model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examined US parent and youth perceptions of how life events, both positive and negative, associated with COVID-19 resulted in changes in family and youth functioning.

Evidence shows severe acute respiratory syndrome is closely related to the induced cytokine storm. Interleukin-6 is a key player;its role in systemic inflammation is well known. AIM: To evaluate the effect of tocilizumab (TCZ), an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, on the outcomes for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, MedRxiv, Science Direct, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to 9th June 2020 for observational or prospective studies reporting results of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 infection treated with TCZ. Effect sizes were reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and an OR less than 1 was associated with a better outcome in those treated with TCZ. RESULTS: Overall 13476 patients (33 studies;n = 3264 received TCZ) with COVID-19 pneumonia and various degree of severity were included. Outcome was improved with TCZ. In the primary analysis (n = 19 studies reporting data), mortality was reduced in patients treated with TCZ (OR = 0.64, 95%CI: 0.47-0.87;P &lt; 0.01).

Within this, some instructors managed well, while others struggled. To elucidate interindividual differences in online teaching and learn-ing during this unexpected circumstance, we focus on faculty members attitudes towards this shift and examine their associations with underlying motivations as well as burnout/engagement and student learning. We analyzed longitudinal data of 80 faculty members achievement goals during the semester prior to shifting to online teaching, and their attitudes and burn-out/engagement during the first semester with enforced online teaching. Additionally, we used 703 student ratings of these faculty members teaching quality in terms of student learning. Re-sults indicated that learning approach goals of faculty were positively associated with perceiving the shift to online teaching as a positive challenge and as useful for their own competence de-velopment. Conversely, performance (appearance) avoidance goals and work avoidance goals went along with perceiving this change as threatening, which, in turn, was related to increased burnout levels and students reporting their learning to be worse. Taken together, these findings point to the relevance of faculty goals and attitudes for successful online teaching and learning.","output":"Shifting from Face-to-Face to Online Teaching During COVID-19: The Role of University Faculty Achievement Goals for Attitudes Towards This Sudden Change, and Their Relevance for Burnout/Engagement and Student Evaluations of Teaching Quality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genetic variability across the three major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes (human leukocyte antigen [HLA] A, B, and C) may affect susceptibility to many diseases such as cancer, auto-immune or infectious diseases.

The shape of a staple that is formed by a stapling device is one industry-accepted indicator of device performance; typically a B-shaped staple is considered the gold standard for staple formation. This B shape allows blood flow through the tissue, which is one important factor in the healing events that take place clinically after stapling. With the use of an animal model, this ex vivo study investigated staple formation when thick tissue endoscopic staplers were used on challenging and variable tissue. The setting was a corporate institution in the United States. METHODS Two 60-mm linear endoscopic thick tissue reloads, a varied-height stapler (VHS), and a single-height stapler (SHS) were fired on 7 different regions of porcine stomach. Resultant staple formation was assessed per region of the stomach and evaluated for proper B-shaped staple formation and staple malformation. RESULTS The VHS reload had significantly better B-shaped formation (P<.001) for all regions of the stomach and reduced occurrence of malformed staples in 5 of the 7 regions compared with the SHS reload, wherein the remaining 2 regions exhibited comparable malform occurrence.

Methods: We conducted an observational study on consecutive HF outpatients. The follow up period was 12 months, starting from the beginning of the COVID-19 Italy lockdown. According to the follow up modality, and after the propensity matching score, patients were divided into two groups: those in G1 (n = 92) were managed with traditional in-person visits and those in G2 (n = 92) were managed with telephone consultation. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were the primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints were overall mortality, cardiovascular death, cardiovascular hospitalization, and hospitalization due to HF. Results: No significant differences between G1 and G2 have been observed regarding MACE (p = 0.65), cardiovascular death (p = 0.39), overall mortality (p = 0.85), hospitalization due to acute HF (p = 0.07), and cardiovascular hospitalization (p = 0.4).

The COVID-19 pandemic poses a great threat to the world and has shown that preventing the disease escalation in prisons integrates the novel corona virus clash in society in general. Up to this moment, the most effective known measure to curb the disease spread is social isolation. Nevertheless, in penal institutions, often overcrowded, social isolation becomes difficult to carry out and, when it happens, it takes the enclosed population to overisolation, with consequences to their mental health. Besides, prisoners suffer with clogged up environment, lack of materials for personal hygiene, poor basic sanitary conditions and difficulties in accessing health services. In order to reduce the disease spread, several countries are taking measures such as definite or temporary release of prisoners and visiting restrictions. This paper deals with a narrative review on the pandemic effects in prisons and how government and civil society have organized themselves in order to reduce the disease consequences at those places.

Specifically, the basic reproduction number R0 is also determined from formulae where it is related to the parameters of such models. The observations show that the start of infectivity of an individual appears nearly at the same time as the onset of symptoms, while the distribution of the incubation period is not an exponential. MethodsWe propose a method for estimation of R0 for COVID-19 based on the empirical incubation period distribution and assumed very short infectivity period that lasts only few days around the onset of symptoms. It is tested on daily new cases in six major countries in Europe, in the first wave of epidemic in spring, 2020. ResultsThe calculations show that even if the infectivity starts two days before the onset of symptoms and stops immediately when they appear, the value of R0 is larger than that from the classical, Markovian approach. For more realistic cases, when only individuals with mild symptoms spread the virus for few days after onset of symptoms, the respective values are even larger. ConclusionsThe calculations of R0 and other characteristics of spreading of COVID-19 based on the classical, Markovian approaches should be taken very cautiously. Instead, non-Markovian models with general distribution functions of transition between compartments should be considered as more appropriate.

Its causes have not been investigated yet. OBJECTIVE We hypothesized that pulmonary capillary leakage affects the severity of respiratory failure, causing a shift of fluids and proteins through the epithelial-endothelial barrier. METHODS One hundred seventy-four COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms, 92 admitted to the intermediate medicine ward (IMW) and 82 to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan, were studied. RESULTS Baseline characteristics at admission were considered. Proteins, interleukin 8 (IL-8) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analysed in 26 ICU patients. In addition, ten autopsy ultrastructural lung studies were performed in patients with COVID-19 and compared with postmortem findings in a control group (bacterial pneumonia-ARDS and H1N1-ARDS). ICU patients had lower serum albumin than IMW patients [20 (18-23) vs 28 (24-33) g L-1 , P < 0.001]. Serum albumin was lower in more compromised groups (lower PaO2 -to-FiO2 ratio and worst chest X-ray findings) and was associated with 30 days of probability of survival. Protein concentration was correlated with IL-8 and IL-10 levels in BALF. Electron microscopy examinations of eight out of ten COVID-19 lung tissues showed loosening of junctional complexes, quantitatively more pronounced than in controls, and direct viral infection of type 2 pneumocytes and endothelial cells. CONCLUSION Hypoalbuminaemia may serve as severity marker of epithelial-endothelial damage in patients with COVID-19. There are clues that pulmonary capillary leak syndrome plays a key role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and might be a potential therapeutic target.","output":"Hypoalbuminemia in COVID-19: assessing the hypothesis for underlying pulmonary capillary leakage."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Community service serves as a major aspect of pharmacy education; however, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represented a significant disruption to student involvement. The College of Pharmacy student council, which serves as the local student government organization for the University of Florida College of Pharmacy, Jacksonville campus, developed a community service initiative to offer more consistent opportunities for students to participate in community service events, while adapting to COVID-19 restrictions. A retrospective, qualitative review of this initiative demonstrates the potential value of this model. Prior to this initiative, students relied on individual student organizations to provide service opportunities to their members. This excluded portions of the student body and led to sparse and inconsistent events, with limited variation in the types of service events available. Furthermore, de-centralized planning of service opportunities increased the difficulty of ensuring that COVID-19 safety restrictions were followed appropriately. This initiative resulted in 39 students logging over 200 service hours through nine events in the first seven months after its development.

However, not all groups of people have been equally impacted. We report results from a pre-registered study of mental health and cognitive function of over 1000 online gig workers collected before and during the COVID19 pandemic. Methods: We used a browser-based survey and task battery to collect data on mood and cognition from N=1000+ adults age 18-75. Results: Surprisingly, we found no change in self-reported depression or anxiety in the pre-pandemic vs. pandemic-era sample. However, there were significant disparities in mental health outcomes based on group demographics, with the youngest and most highly educated participants reporting the highest depression and anxiety symptoms (p>.001). These symptoms negatively impacted cognitive performance on a visual attention task. Computational modeling of latent cognitive parameters revealed a fast and inaccurate pattern associated with anxiety, and a slow and noisy pattern associated with depression (p>.001). Exploratory analyses identified interactions between age, mental health, and cognition, whereby younger participants reported clinically supra-threshold mental health symptoms that negatively impacted cognition;whereas older adults reported sub-threshold symptoms which were positively correlated with cognitive performance (p>.001). An interaction was observed between education levels, age, and mental health symptoms: the most highly educated younger adults in the sample reported the most mental health symptoms(p>.001).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a descriptive analysis and content analysis based on an online survey among clinicians, researchers, and organizations. Our data were extracted from multiple\\\\choice questions on access to SRHR services and risk of SRHR violations, and written responses to open\\\\ended questions on threats to access and required response. RESULTS: The survey was answered by 51 people representing 29 countries. Eighty\\\\six percent reported that access to contraceptive services was less or much less because of COVID\\\\19, corresponding figures for surgical and medical abortion were 62% and 46%. The increased risk of gender\\\\based and sexual violence was assessed as moderate or severe by 79%. Among countries with mildly restrictive abortion policies, 69% had implemented changes to facilitate access to abortion during the pandemic, compared with none among countries with severe restrictions (P < .001), 87.5% compared with 46% had implemented changes to facilitate access to contraception (P = .023). The content analysis showed that (a) prioritizations in health service delivery at the expense of SRHR, (b) lack of political will, (c) the detrimental effect of lockdown, and (d) the suspension of sexual education, were threats to SRHR access (theme 1). Requirements to mitigate these threats (theme 2) were (a) political will and support of universal access to SRH services, (b) the sensitization of providers, (c) free public transport, and (d) physical protective equipment. A contrasting third theme was the state of exception of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic as a window of opportunity to push forward women's health and rights. CONCLUSIONS: Many countries have seen decreased access to and increased violations of SRHR during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Countries with severe restrictions on abortion seem less likely to have implemented changes to SRHR delivery to mitigate this impact. Political will to support the advancement of SRHR is often lacking, which is fundamental to ensuring both continued access and, in a minority of cases, the solidification of gains made to SRHR during the pandemic.","output":"How the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is impacting sexual and reproductive health and rights and response: Results from a global survey of providers, researchers, and policy\\\\makers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiovascular complications in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have been associated with poor prognosis Myocarditis, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, and arrhythmia have been reported We present a case of a 55-year-old female patient with no significant past medical history who was admitted due to COVID-19 induced acute hypoxemic respiratory failure She developed multiple asymptomatic episodes of long sinus pauses as her oxygen requirements increased These resolved without atropine and pacing as her respiratory status improved Hypoxemia, cytokine storm, dysautonomia, direct viral infiltration, and surrounding myocardial inflammation are thought to be responsible for bradyarrhythmias associated with COVID-19 Both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases have been reported Hospitalized COVID-19 patients should be monitored closely on telemetry in order to promptly recognize any arrhythmia;hence preventing an unexplained rapid decline in cardiopulmonary status by intensifying care and managing the arrhythmia in a timely manner Follow-up studies would be needed to determine the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 patients who developed bradyarrhythmias","output":"Multiple Sinus Pauses in a Patient With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continuing to spread around the globe, there is an unprecedented need to develop different approaches to containing the pandemic from spreading further.

A multimodal approach incorporating chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy followed by extended surgery may improve resectability and outcomes for patients with advanced TETs. Surgical debulking is also reportedly acceptable for invasive thymoma because of its potential for achieving favorable outcomes.

Case description/methods: A 66-year-old female with a history of diverticulitis requiring sigmoid colectomy was referred to outpatient gastroenterology within one week after her first dose of the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine. Colonoscopy showed friable mucosa and a loss of vascular markings and histology was consistent with UC. She was treated with budesonide and mesalamine and symptoms resolved. The second dose was administered 4 weeks later, after which she immediately developed severe hematochezia and anorexia requiring hospital admission. Laboratory data was notable for c-reactive protein of 202 mg/L. Symptoms persisted despite 2 weeks of intravenous and rectal corticosteroids. Repeat colonoscopy revealed severe pancolitis. Infliximab was initiated and re-dosed after 48 hours due to concern for protein-losing enteropathy. Despite the addition of a biologic agent, a third colonoscopy showed minimal improvement. The patient underwent a total colectomy and was discharged in stable condition. Discussion: This is a clear case of a patient with UC unmasked by the hyper-inflammatory state following the mRNA-1273 vaccine, with subsequent severe flare following the second dose requiring colectomy. A safety and efficacy study reported no safety concerns amongst 15,000 volunteers and millions more have been vaccinated worldwide. Patients without specific contraindications should continue to receive vaccination against COVID-19, however following an adverse event, clinicians should think carefully about administration of the second dose. While the importance of vaccination and herd immunity cannot be understated, cases such as this are important to report, especially with regard to advice on administration of the second dose of the vaccine when an adverse event was noted following the first dose.

Shifting between the poles of the constitutional guarantee of private property on the one hand and a potentiality of democratic contestation of the property order on the other, it is made clear that the concept of expropriation highlights the aporias of the democratic rule of law.

Most agreed that staff needed additional training (89%), the available technology was not adequate (66%) and health professionals were hesitant to provide online consultations (46%). They had positive attitudes towards digitalisation, improving service quality and cost-effectiveness but were concerned about exacerbating health inequalities. DISCUSSION: The study identifies a need for clear guidelines and training around the use of digital tools as well as a demand for investment in hardware and software required for the provision of remote services. Future research needs to explore the acceptability, safety and effectiveness of various digital tools to narrow health inequalities in sexual health service users.","output":"Sexual healthcare professionals' views on the rapid provision of remote services at the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic: A mixed-methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late December 2019, a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the 2019 novel coronavirus#, emerged from Wuhan, China, and resulted in a formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanded globally, including Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, United States, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our country (as of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries). The disease is officially named as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19, by WHO on February 11, 2020). It is also named as Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens on January 15, 2019 by the Taiwan CDC, the Ministry of Health and is a notifiable communicable disease of the fifth category. COVID-19 is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate (estimated 2%C5%) mortality rate. Person-to-person transmission may occur through droplet or contact transmission and if there is a lack of stringent infection control or if no proper personal protective equipment available, it may jeopardize the first-line healthcare workers. Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 although some drugs are under investigation. To promptly identify patients and prevent further spreading, physicians should be aware of the travel or contact history of the patient with compatible symptoms.","output":"The outbreak of COVID-19: An overview"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The role of coagulation dysfunction in Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is inconsistent. We aimed to explore the impact of coagulation dysfunction amongst patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Cochrane and Embase databases from December 1, 2019 to April 27, 2020 following Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Data about coagulation (Platelets, PT, APTT, fibrin, fibrinogen degradation products, D-dimer), prevalence of coagulation dysfunction and mortality were extracted. Meta regression was used to explore the heterogeneity. RESULTS: Sixteen observational studies were included, comprising 2, 139 patients with confirmed COVID-19. More severe COVID-19 cases tended to have higher mean D-dimer (SMD 0.78, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.03, P < .001). The similar pattern occurred with PT and fibrin, with a contrary trend for PLTs. Coagulation dysfunction was more frequent in severe cases compared to less severe (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.67, P < .001). Higher mortality was associated with COVID-19-related coagulopathy (RR 10.86, 2.86 to 41.24, P < .001). Prevalence of ARDS was increased in more severe patients than less severe cases (RR 16.52, 11.27 to 24.22, P < .001). PT, fibrin and D-dimer levels elevated significantly in non-survivors during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Presence of coagulation dysfunction might be associated with COVID-19 severity, and coagulopathy might be associated with mortality. Coagulation markers including PT, fibrin and D-dimer may imply the progression of COVID-19. This illuminates the necessity of effectively monitoring coagulation function for preventing COVID-19-related coagulopathy, especially in severe patients. For the obvious heterogeneity, the quality of the evidence is compromised. Future rigorous randomized controlled trials that assess the correlation between coagulation and COVID-19 are needed.

Recent developments in induction module cavity ring-down spectroscopy (IM-CRDS) have made it possible to rapidly complete isotope analyses, and to combust co-extracted organic compounds at the same time. However, the agreement between IM-CRDS and isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) analyses has generally been poor and was primarily attributable to spectral interference of IM-CRDS. Here we evaluated the impacts of organic contamination on the isotope ratios using IM-CRDS with two different methods. No spectral interference was observed for solid samples measured directly by IM-CRDS, whereas clear organic contamination occurred in isotope analyses for pre-extracted plant stem and leaf samples. Our results demonstrate that IM-CRDS can fully combust co-extracted organic compounds by in-line oxidation in the direct measurement of solid samples, although this may not guarantee that the IM-CRDS can obtain better isotopic data than IRMS. It may be risky to evaluate the performance of IM-CRDS by measuring pre-extracted water samples because cryogenic vacuum distillation is likely to introduce extra organic compounds, which may not be fully removed during subsequent IM-CRDS measurement. In addition, spectral variables are useful for post-processing corrections.","output":"Organic contamination in online laser-based plant stem and leaf water isotope measurements for pre-extracted samples."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To identify, systematically evaluate and summarise the best available evidence on the frequency of long COVID\\\\19 (post\\\\acute COVID\\\\19 syndrome), its clinical manifestations, and the criteria used for diagnosis.

However, it is imperative that instructors realize that the challenge is greater than simply converting paper-based assignments into a digital format. There has been very little research done examining the cognitive effects of writing on a smartphone, compared to writing on paper. The current study therefore sought to examine how recollection of content differed depending on the medium used for notetaking. A population of 138 Japanese university students of English-as-a-Foreign-Language (EFL) were asked to transcribe a short text, either by paper or by smartphone, and then quizzed on the content immediately afterwards. Students who wrote the text by hand were found to have significantly greater recollection of the content compared to those who had 'tapped' on smartphones.

Nevertheless, the cause of many infectious diseases in pigs remains unclear, largely because commonly used diagnostic tools fail to capture the full diversity of potential pathogens and because pathogen co-infection is common. RESULTS: We used a meta-transcriptomic approach to systematically characterize the pathogens in 136 clinical cases representing different disease syndromes in pigs, as well as in 12 non-diseased controls. This enabled us to simultaneously determine the diversity, abundance, genomic information, and detailed epidemiological history of a wide range of potential pathogens. We identified 34 species of RNA viruses, nine species of DNA viruses, seven species of bacteria, and three species of fungi, including two novel divergent members of the genus Pneumocystis. While most of these pathogens were only apparent in diseased animals or were at higher abundance in diseased animals than in healthy animals, others were present in healthy controls, suggesting opportunistic infections. Importantly, most of the cases examined here were characterized by co-infection with more than two species of viral, bacterial, or fungal pathogens, some with highly correlated occurrence and abundance levels. Examination of clinical signs and necropsy results in the context of relevant pathogens revealed that a multiple-pathogen model was better associated with the data than a single-pathogen model was. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that most of the pig diseases examined were better explained by the presence of multiple rather than single pathogens and that infection with one pathogen can facilitate infection or increase the prevalence/abundance of another. Consequently, it is generally preferable to consider the cause of a disease based on a panel of co-infecting pathogens rather than on individual infectious agents.

So, in this study, we aimed to examine Turkish final year medical students' knowledge level and perceptions toward the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The present descriptive multicentered study was conducted with the medical students in the final year of six medical schools located in six geographic regions of Turkey. After ethical approval, data were gathered using an online questionnaire through Google forms between 10 April 2020, and 20 April 2020. RESULTS: In this national survey study, 860 volunteers answered the questions thoroughly. The median age was 24 (22-38) years. A total of 55.3% of the participants were female. The median knowledge level score was 69.0 (0-93.1). The knowledge level was moderate. A total of 34.2% of the participants had a high level of knowledge. A total of 48.7% of participants stated that they felt the most competent about performing CPR. Updates about COVID-19 were followed regularly by 84.5% of the participants.

Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AlloSCT) is the only therapeutic option which may offer the chance of long-term remission and cures in a subset of patients. We sought to investigate the outcomes of transplantation in one of the largest cohorts in North America. Methods: A retrospective chart review study was conducted using the North-American ATLL and the Hematopoietic Precursor Cell transplantation databases at Montefiore Medical Center from 2011 to 2020. Variables collected include age, sex, ethnicity, ATLL subtype, molecular profile, previous treatments, conditioning regimens, type of transplant, immunosuppressive regimen, progression free survival (PFS) post-transplant and overall survival (OS) post-transplant. Results: Fourteen patients with ATLL who received an AlloSCT from 2011-2020 were identified. Fifty-seven percent (8/14) of patients were male. Seventy-one percent (10/14) of patients were African American and twenty-nine percent (4/14) were Hispanic. Median age was 51 years. Sixty-four percent (9/14) of patients had Stage IV disease at the time of diagnosis. Forty-three percent (6/14) patients had acute and fifty-seven percent (8/14) had lymphomatous ATLL. Almost all patients (92%) were treated initially with EPOCH combination chemotherapy. Twenty-eight percent (4/14) of patients received interferon/zidovudine as bridge-to-transplant. Fifty-seven percent (8/14) of patients achieved complete remission (CR) prior to AlloSCT, 7% (1/14) were in partial remission, and 28% (4/14) were relapsed or refractory. Forty-three percent (6/14) of patients received SCT from a matched-related donor (MRD), 36% (5/14) from a haplo-identical donor and 21% (3/14) from a matched-unrelated donor (MUD). Ninety-three percent (13/14) of patients received a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen pre-transplantation. Seven percent (1/14) received a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen. RIC regimens consisted of fludarabine with melphalan +/- anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) or fludarabine with cyclophosphamide with total-body irradiation in doses less than 500 cGy. Patients receiving haplo-identical SCT also received post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) for prevention of graft vs host disease (GVHD). The MAC regimen used included busulfan with cyclophosphamide at myeloablative doses. Twenty-eight percent (4/14) of patients relapsed post-alloSCT with a median relapse-free survival of 6 months (range 4-18 months). The median OS of the whole cohort was 27 months (8-82 months). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) developed in 28% (4/14) percent of patients. The most common manifestation was skin GVHD. Fifty-percent (7/14) of the patients are surviving to-date. Transplant-related mortality (TRM) at day 100 was 21% (3/14) of patients. Causes of death were complex and included several diagnoses in certain patients. The most frequent diagnoses associated with death were infection (28%), graft failure (14%), GVHD (14%), veno-occlusive disease of the liver (VOD) (7%), disease progression (14%) and unknown due to patient lost to follow-up (14%). The main infectious events included fungal (2), bacterial (1), and COVID-19 (1) infection. Forty-three percent (6/14) of patients remain in complete remission to date. Conclusions: Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation offers long-term survival with a TRM of 21% in a disease with an inherently dismal prognosis. AlloSCT using several graft sources, is thus, a safe and well tolerated treatment modality and offers long term remissions.

Of 232 patients, 74 (31.9 %) showed exacerbation of preexisting neurological symptoms of dementia (55/92; 59.5 %), Parkinson's disease (10/17; 58.8 %), epilepsy (1/1; 100 %), and unspecified neurological disorders (8/106; 7.5 %). Of 2168 patients, 478 (22.0 %) showed severe COVID-19 course. These included patients with cerebrovascular disease (86/445; 19.3 %), dementia (70/316; 22.2 %), Parkinson's disease (25/214; 11.7 %), multiple sclerosis (28/71; 39.4 %), spinal cord injury (5/7; 71.4 %), epilepsy (10/98; 10.2 %) and unspecified neurological disorders (254/1011; 25 %). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with preexisting neurological disorders and COVID-19 may develop exacerbation of neurological symptoms and severe COVID-19. Clinicians should be aware of the risk of symptom exacerbation and severe COVID-19 in patients with preexisting neurological disease and should focus on the prevention and early care of COVID-19.","output":"Exacerbation of neurological symptoms and COVID-19 severity in patients with preexisting neurological disorders and COVID-19: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tradable green certificate (TGC) scheme promotes the development of renewable energy industry which currently has a dual effect on economy and environment.

These occur most commonly after the second dose, with the highest incidence among young male recipients. This complication has not been observed among adenoviral vector vaccine receivers, and its clinical, laboratory and imaging features resemble those of other common causes of acute myocarditis. The pathogenesis of mRNA-vaccine associated myocarditis has not yet been elucidated, although a number of mechanisms have been proposed, typically implicating the administered S-protein mRNA and likely mediated through an autoimmune mechanism. Nonetheless, other mechanisms may be implicated given the fact that myocarditis cases are very rarely observed among recipients of non mRNA vaccines. The recent observation of a similar adverse event in a recipient of the non-mRNA, peptide-based NVX-CoV2373 in the frame of a phase III clinical trial with 7020 participants in the active treatment arm raises the question whether the lipid nanoparticle sheath, which is a common structural component of these platforms could be implicated in the pathogenesis of vaccine-induced myocarditis.","output":"Potential implications of lipid nanoparticles in the pathogenesis of myocarditis associated with the use of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Members of the genus Defluviicoccus occur often at high abundances in activated sludge wastewater treatment plants designed to remove phosphorus, where biomass is subjected to alternating anaerobic feed/aerobic famine conditions, believed to favor the proliferation of organisms like Ca. Accumulibacter and other phosphate-accumulating organisms (PAO), and Defluviicoccus. All have a capacity to assimilate readily metabolizable substrates and store them intracellularly during the anaerobic feed stage so that under the subsequent famine aerobic stage, these can be used to synthesize polyphosphate reserves by the PAO and glycogen by Defluviicoccus. Consequently, Defluviicoccus is described as a glycogen-accumulating organism or GAO. Because they share a similar anaerobic phenotype, it has been proposed that at high Defluviicoccus abundance, the PAO are out-competed for assimilable metabolites anaerobically, and hence aerobic P removal capacity is reduced. Several Defluviicoccus whole genome sequences have been published (Ca. Defluviicoccus tetraformis, Defluviicoccus GAO-HK, and Ca. Defluviicoccus seviourii). The available genomic data of these suggest marked metabolic differences between them, some of which have ecophysiological implications. Here, we describe the whole genome sequence of the type strain Defluviicoccus vanusT , the only cultured member of this genus, and a detailed comparative re-examination of all extant Defluviicoccus genomes. Each, with one exception, which appears not to be a member of this genus, contains the genes expected of GAO members, in possessing multiple copies of those for glycogen biosynthesis and catabolism, and anaerobic polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthesis. Both 16S rRNA and genome sequence data suggest that the current recognition of four clades is insufficient to embrace their phylogenetic biodiversity, but do not support the view that they should be re-classified into families other than their existing location in the Rhodospirillaceae. As expected, considerable variations were seen in the presence and numbers of genes encoding properties associated with key substrate assimilation and metabolic pathways. Two genomes also carried the pit gene for synthesis of the low-affinity phosphate transport protein, pit, considered by many to distinguish all PAO from GAO. The data re-emphasize the risks associated with extrapolating the data generated from a single Defluviicoccus population to embrace all members of that genus.","output":"Comparative Genomics of Members of the Genus Defluviicoccus With Insights Into Their Ecophysiological Importance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To develop a radiomics nomogram based on computed tomography (CT) images that can help differentiate lung adenocarcinomas and granulomatous lesions appearing as sub-centimeter solid nodules (SCSNs) MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 214 consecutive patients with SCSNs that were surgically resected and histologically confirmed as lung adenocarcinomas (n = 112) and granulomatous lesions (n = 102) from 2 medical institutions between October 2011 and June 2019 were retrospectively analyzed Patients from center 1 ware enrolled as training cohort (n = 150) and patients from center 2 were included as external validation cohort (n = 64), respectively Radiomics features were extracted from non-contrast chest CT images preoperatively The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used for radiomics feature extraction and radiomics signature construction Clinical characteristics, subjective CT findings, and radiomics signature were used to develop a predictive radiomics nomogram The performance was examined by assessment of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) RESULTS: Lung adenocarcinoma was significantly associated with an irregular margin and lobulated shape in the training set (p = 0 001, &lt;0 001) and external validation set (p = 0 016, = 0 018), respectively The radiomics signature consisting of 22 features was significantly associated with lung adenocarcinomas of SCSNs (p &lt;0 001) The radiomics nomogram incorporated the radiomics signature, gender and lobulated shape The AUCs of combined model in the training and external validation dataset were 0 885 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0 823-0 931), 0 808 (95% CI: 0 690-0 896), respectively Decision curve analysis (DCA) demonstrated that the radiomics nomogram was clinically useful CONCLUSION: A radiomics signature based on non-enhanced CT has the potential to differentiate between lung adenocarcinomas and granulomatous lesions The radiomics nomogram incorporating the radiomics signature and subjective findings may facilitate the individualized, preoperative treatment in patients with SCSNs","output":"A CT-based radiomics nomogram for prediction of lung adenocarcinomas and granulomatous lesions in patient with solitary sub-centimeter solid nodules"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly created devastating damage on world economics and public health.

Secondly, the study explores the reasons for using the contact tracing app. Thirdly, it examines the relationship between usage behaviour of the NZ-COVID Tracer app with age, the user's perceived health, attitude towards COVID-19, whether family or friends are infected by COVID-19, trust in maintaining social distancing, trust in data privacy, smartphone usage and the media's role in motivating people to use this app. Consequently, understanding these issues and challenges could help improve the usage of this contact tracing app, which in turn would contribute to better public health outcomes in disease management and containment. Findings of the study reveals that age, smartphone usage behaviour, and trust in privacy data protection from the app provider has a statistically significant relationship on usage behaviour of the NZ COVID Tracer app. Self-perceived health status and attitudes towards the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a significant relationship on NZ COVID Tracer app usage behaviour.

METHODS: Two-hundred-fifty-one patients with respiratory symptoms underwent CT few days after hospitalization. Aerated (AV), consolidated (CV) and intermediate (IV) lung sub-volumes were quantified by an operator-independent method based on individual HU maximum gradient recognition. AV, CV, IV, CV/AV, IV/AV, and HU of the first peak position were extracted. Relevant clinical parameters were prospectively collected. The population was composed by training (n = 166) and validation (n = 85) consecutive cohorts, and backward multi-variate logistic regression was applied on the training group to build a CT_model. Similarly, models including only clinical parameters (CLIN_model) and both CT/clinical parameters (COMB_model) were developed. Models performances were assessed by goodness-of-fit (H&L-test), calibration and discrimination. Models performances were tested in the validation group. RESULTS: Forty-three patients died (25/18 in training/validation). CT_model included AVmax (i.e. maximum AV between lungs), CV and CV/AE, while CLIN_model included random glycemia, C-reactive protein and biological drugs (protective). Goodness-of-fit and discrimination were similar (H&L:0.70 vs 0.80; AUC:0.80 vs 0.80). COMB_model including AVmax, CV, CV/AE, random glycemia, biological drugs and active cancer, outperformed both models (H&L:0.91; AUC:0.89, 95%CI:0.82C0.93). All models showed good calibration (R(2):0.77C0.97).

The radiological literature mainly focuses on CT findings. The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of chest radiographs (CXR) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at presentation. METHODS: We retrospectively identified consecutive reverse transcription polymerase reaction-confirmed COVID-19 patients (n = 104, 75% men) and patients (n = 75, 51% men) with repeated negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests. Two radiologists blindly and independently reviewed the CXRs, documented findings, assigned radiographic assessment of lung edema (RALE) scores, and predicted the patients COVID-19 status. We calculated interobserver reliability. The score use for diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: The overall RALE score failed to identify COVID-19 patients at presentation. However, the score was inversely correlated with a COVID-19 diagnosis within 2 days, and a positive correlation was found six days after symptom onset.Interobserver agreement with regard to separating normal from abnormal CXRs was moderate (k = 0.408) with low specificity (25% and 27%). Definite pleural effusion had almost perfect agreement (k = 0.833) and substantially reduced the odds of a COVID-19 diagnosis. Disease distribution and experts opinion on COVID-19 status had only fair interobserver agreement. The RALE score interobserver reliability was moderate to good (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.745). A high RALE score predicted a poor outcome (intensive care unit hospitalization, intubation, or death) in COVID-19 patients; a score of 5 substantially increased the odds of having a poor outcome. CONCLUSION: Chest radiography was found not to be a valid diagnostic tool for COVID-19, as normal or near-normal CXRs are more likely early in the disease course. Pleural effusions at presentation suggest a diagnosis other than COVID-19. More extensive lung opacities at presentation are associated with poor outcome in COVID-19 patients. Thus, patients with more than minimal opacities should be monitored closely for clinical deterioration.

METHODS: A cohort of Reddit users posting within the /r/covid19positive subforum (N=15,821) was leveraged to analyze instantaneous risk of transition to a state of suicidal ideation or depression using Cox proportional-hazards models. Risk transition was defined by posts made in suicide- or depression-related forums, or mentions of relevant phrases with and without mention of anosmia/ageusia in /r/covid19positive. Self-diagnosis of COVID-19 was also modeled as a separate and simultaneous predictor of mental health risk. RESULTS: Mention of anosmia/ageusia was significantly associated with transition to a risk state. Users with a history of anosmia/ageusia-related posts and who self-identified as COVID-19 positive had 30% higher instantaneous risk relative to others. The highest increase in instantaneous risk of suicidal ideation or depression occurred more than 100 days after first posting in /r/covid19positive. LIMITATIONS: Use of self-diagnosed disease as well as a broad array of anosmia/ageusia-related terminology may entail both information bias and overestimates of symptom incidence.

We examine these challenges and propose interventions to protect healthcare workers on the continent, drawing on articles identified on Medline (Pubmed) in a search on 24 March 2020. Global jostling means that supplies of personal protective equipment are limited in Africa. Even low-cost interventions such as facemasks for patients with a cough and water supplies for handwashing may be challenging, as is 'physical distancing' in overcrowded primary health care clinics. Without adequate protection, COVID-19 mortality may be high among healthcare workers and their family in Africa given limited critical care beds and difficulties in transporting ill healthcare workers from rural to urban care centres. Much can be done to protect healthcare workers, however. The continent has learnt invaluable lessons from Ebola and HIV control. HIV counselors and community healthcare workers are key resources, and could promote social distancing and related interventions, dispel myths, support healthcare workers, perform symptom screening and trace contacts. Staff motivation and retention may be enhanced through carefully managed risk 'allowances' or compensation. International support with personnel and protective equipment, especially from China, could turn the pandemic's trajectory in Africa around. Telemedicine holds promise as it rationalises human resources and reduces patient contact and thus infection risks. Importantly, healthcare workers, using their authoritative voice, can promote effective COVID-19 policies and prioritization of their safety. Prioritizing healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 testing, hospital beds and targeted research, as well as ensuring that public figures and the population acknowledge the commitment of healthcare workers may help to maintain morale.

INTRODUCTION: Lung Ultrasound is an accessible, low-cost technique that has demonstrated its usefulness in the prognostic stratification of COVID-19 patients. In addition, according to previous studies, it can guide us towards the potential aetiology, especially in epidemic situations such as the current one. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 40 patients were prospectively recruited, 30 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and 10 with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patients included underwent both a chest X-ray and ultrasound. RESULTS: There were no differences in the 2 groups in terms of clinical and laboratory characteristics. The main ultrasound findings in the SARS-CoV-2 group were the presence of confluent B lines and subpleural consolidations and hepatinization in the CAP group. Pleural effusion was more frequent in the CAP group. There were no normal lung ultrasound exams. Analysis of the area under the curve (AUC) curves showed an area under the curve for Lung Ultrasound of 89.2% (95% CI: 75.0-100%, p <.001) in the identification of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

We first describe our Bhutanese refugee population and the critical mental health issues that, for many, originated during political persecution and violent ethnic cleansing initiatives, or while living in refugee camps prior to resettlement to the USA. We present a social justice framework emerging from an extensive literature review and incorporating core social determinants specific to mental health in the age of COVID-19, which are guided by the social determinants of economic stability; neighborhoods and physical environment; education; nutrition and exercise; community and social context; healthcare system; and legal system.

The Kidskin Young Adult Myopia Study (KYAMS) was a follow-up of the Kidskin Study, a sun exposure-intervention study of 1776 children aged 6-12 years. Myopia status was assessed in 303 (17.6%) KYAMS participants (aged 25-30 years) and several subjective and objective measures of time spent outdoors were collected in childhood (8-12 years) and adulthood.

METHODS: Content analysis was conducted to scrutinize the official (national and provincial) public health agencies Weibo posts (n = 4396) to identify features of information sources and message features (structure, style content). The Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) model was adopted to analyze the association between these features and the frequency of the retweeted messages. RESULTS: Results indicated that features of source and health information, such as structure, style, and content, were correlated to retweeting. The results of IRR further suggested that compared to provincial accounts, messages from national health authorities accounts gained more retweeting. Regarding the information features, messages with hashtags#, picture, video have been retweeted more often than messages without any of these features respectively, while messages with hyperlinks received fewer retweets than messages without hyperlinks. In terms of the information structure, messages with the sentiment (!) have been retweeted more frequently than messages without sentiment. Concerning content, messages containing severity, reassurance, efficacy, and action frame have been retweeted with higher frequency, while messages with uncertainty frames have been retweeted less often. CONCLUSIONS: Health organizations and medical professionals should pay close attention to the features of health information sources, structures, style, and content to satisfy the publics information needs and preferences to promote the public's health engagement. Designing suitable information systems and promoting health communication strategies during different pandemic stages may improve public awareness of the COVID-19, alleviate negative emotions, and promote preventive measures to curb the spread of the virus.","output":"Identifying features of source and message that influence the retweeting of health information on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Overwhelming anthropogenic activities lead to deterioration of natural resources and the environment.

These signatures and subtypes provide crucial genomic information in COVID-19 diagnosis (including ICU patients), research focuses, and treatment methods. Unlike existing approaches focused on gene fold-changes and pathways, gene-gene nonlinear and competing interactions are the driving forces in finding the signature patterns and subtypes. Furthermore, the method leads to high accuracy with hospitalized patients, showing biological and mathematical equivalences between COVID-19 status and the signature patterns and a methodological advantage over other methods that cannot lead to high accuracy. As a result, as new biomarkers, the new findings and genomic clues can be much more informative than other findings for interpreting biological mechanisms, developing the second (third) generation of vaccines, antiviral drugs, and treatment methods, and eventually bringing new hopes of an end to the pandemic.","output":"The Existence of at Least Three Genomic Signature Patterns and at Least Seven Subtypes of COVID-19 and the End of the Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper will analyze differential treatment of developing countries in international law. Differential treatment for developing countries is a core concept for addressing inequalities between developed and developing countries in a broad range of international agreements. Differential treatment often involves calls for developed countries to provide financial support to developing countries to help them overcome capacity constraints regarding trade, climate change, and global pandemics. It also involves adapting global rules to local contexts, in order to take into account the economic, technological, and institutional constraints that developing countries face. A lack of financial and institutional capacity in developing countries hampers their ability to address global risks from pandemics and climate change, which in turn increases these risks for developed countries. Sustainable globalization requires bridging the disparities between developed and developing countries in their capacities to address matters of global concern. However, it also requires taking into account, in the case of climate change, historical responsibility for emissions and ecological capacity to absorb emissions and to adapt to the effects of the changing climate. This paper will focus on three areas of international law: climate law, trade law, and health law. International climate law uses the concept of common but differentiated responsibilities with respect to developing countries, based on differential historical responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions and differential institutional and financial capacity to address climate change. WTO law uses a concept of special and differential treatment for developing countries, based on differential capacity to engage in and to benefit from the multilateral trade system, for example regarding access to essential medicines. International health law encourages developed countries to provide financial and other support for developing countries to build, strengthen and maintain their public health capacities. There is relatively little comparative literature on this concept and significant debates over how to make differential treatment rules more effective. This paper will argue that a more coherent framework of differential treatment is essential to enhance the capacities of all countries to address the increasing risks from global pandemics and climate change, while taking into account the cognitive and cultural diversity that influences the multilateral formulation and local application of global norms.","output":"Differential Treatment in International Law & Global Risks from Pandemics and Climate Change (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A complex community of bacteria, viruses, fungi, protists, and other microorganisms inhabit the gastrointestinal tract of calves and play important roles in gut health and disease.

Methods: A literature search of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Ovid databases was performed for articles from the dates of their inception to August 2020 using the following keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV2, seminal, semen, and sperm. After excluding non-human studies and articles that were not in the English language, we identified 19 relevant studies. The full text of the articles were reviewed and a total of eight articles remained after applying our selection criteria. Results: After reviewing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the eight different studies using semen samples, only one reported the presence of the virus. Six out of 160 total semen samples with SARS-CoV-2 positive demonstrated the presence of viral RNA, of which 2 were from males in the recovery phase and 4 from the acute phase of the infection. Conclusion: The novel nature of SARS-CoV-2 has limited the number and size of studies on semen. Nevertheless, the current literature, while limited, has confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen in one out of the eight reported studies and totaling 4.3% of the population screened.

We included all adults present in the shelters or who died of a proven SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first wave (March-May). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in serum samples using the SARS-CoV-2 IgG Architect (Abbott) test. Any participant with a positive PCR or serology was defined as a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case. RESULTS: We included 100 residents and 83 staff members. The confirmed SARS-CoV-2 rate by PCR or serology was 72/100 (72.0%) for residents and 17/83 (20.5%) for staff members. Women accommodated in the dormitory had the highest infection attack rate (90.6%). Hospitalization rate in residents was 17/72 (23.6%) and the death rate 4/72 (5.6%).

The sensitivity (1192%) was about 10 times higher than that under dark condition, and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.17 ppb. In contrast, when sensing ammonia (NH3), higher sensitivity and selectivity were obtained in darkness rather than in light, with sensitivity and LOD of 11% and 0.2 ppm. Furthermore, the sensor possesses decent stability, repeatability, and anti-interference ability. The tunable sensing behavior with light modulation has been clearly studied with the help of density functional theory. A new principle called \\"carrier storage box\\" of Au nanoparticles was proposed to explain the change in surface state of InSe under light modulation. Finally, the prepared sensor has been successfully applied to construct a fully integrated wearable device to measure NH3 and NO2 in ambient environment. In all, this work provides a highly competitive gas detection method and paves the way for designing 2D materials-based optoelectronic devices with tunable and multifunctional features.","output":"A Fully Integrated Flexible Tunable Chemical Sensor Based on Gold-Modified Indium Selenide Nanosheets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The present study aims to compare the long-term efficacy and safety results of intravitreal ranibizumab (RAN), dexamethasone intravitreal implant (DEX) and intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) injections in macular edema due to branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). Methods: In this retrospective study, one eye each of 43 patients who were treated with intravitreal injections for macular edema secondary to BRVO was recruited into one of the study groups: RAN group (n=17), DEX group (n=16) and IVTA group (n=10). All patients were followed-up for 12 months. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) and intraocular pressure (IOP) at month 1, 3, 6, and 12 were compared with baseline. Results: The BCVA increased significantly in the RAN and DEX groups at all visits (all p<0.05). BCVA increase in the IVTA group was significant only at month 1 and 6. CMT decreased significantly in all groups at the end of one year of follow-up (p=0.007; p=0.001; p=0.044, respectively). SFCT significantly decreased in all groups at month 1 (all p<0.05). IOP significantly increased in none, 18.8%, 30% of the patients in the RAN, DEX and IVTA groups, respectively. Cataract surgery was performed in none of the patients, 6.3%, and 30% of the patients in the RAN, DEX, and IVTA groups, respectively. Conclusion: BCVA increase was more prominent in both of the RAN and DEX groups than in the IVTA group.

Previous research on medical students' motivation mostly overlooked an important concept, namely, mastery-avoidance goals. The mastery-avoidance goal is defined as engaging in a task to avoid losing knowledge or skills that have already been acquired. We aimed to explore the role of mastery-avoidance goals in changes occurring in low frustration tolerance (LFT) levels over a span of one academic year. This approach enables us to understand which type of motivational orientation is expected to explain most adaptive educational outcomes. Methods. First year medical students (n = 241) participating in a physician-patient communication course completed the surveys of motivational orientations and LFT at the beginning and at the end of the academic year. A confirmatory factor analysis supported the construct validity of the motivational orientations structure. Results. Cross-lagged analysis using structural equation modelling revealed that the mastery-approach goal was negatively related to the progression of LFT while mastery-avoidance goal was positively related. Conclusions. The findings suggest that what matters is not merely the level of motivation, but rather the type of motivational orientations that students pursue. Encouraging students to improve their current skills, while discouraging competitiveness and reducing fear of losing competence, may enhance the effectiveness of medical training programmes.","output":"Mastery avoidance: An overlooked aspect of medical students' motivation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to determine the demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases that are highly susceptible to COVID-19 infection, with longer hospitalization and at higher risk of mortality and to provide insights that may be useful to assess the vaccination priority program and allocate hospital resources.

Remdesivir showed promising results in early randomised trials but subsequently a large publicly funded trial has shown less favourable results and the evidence is interpreted differently in clinical guidelines. Systematic reviews of remdesivir have been published, but none have systematically searched for unpublished data, including regulatory documents, and assessed the risk of bias due to missing evidence. METHODS: We will conduct a systematic review of randomised trials comparing remdesivir to placebo or standard of care in any setting. We will include trials regardless of the severity of disease and we will include trials examining remdesivir for indications other than Covid-19 for harms analyses. We will search websites of regulatory agencies, trial registries, bibliographic databases, preprint servers and contact trial sponsors to obtain all available data, including unpublished clinical data, for all eligible trials. Our primary outcomes will be all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes will be length of hospital stay, time to death, severe disease, and adverse events. We will assess the risk of bias using the Cochranes Risk of Bias 2 tool and the risk of bias due to missing evidence (e.g. publication bias, selective reporting bias) using the ROB-ME tool. Where appropriate we will synthesise study results by conducting random-effects meta-analysis. We will present our findings in a Summary of Findings table and rate the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

As the pandemic spread, creating undue pressure on health care workers (HCWs), there was an urgent need for the development of appropriate interventions to protect their mental health. This study aims to study the effect of COVID-19 on the mental health of anaesthesiologists in India and factors that influence their coping behaviour.MethodThe study was designed as a semi-structured, descriptive, cross-sectional, online open survey and conducted on Google forms between 21st May and 20th June 2020, among practicing anaesthesiologists across India. The participants were recruited by sending messages to their emails and through social media platforms. It created a small number of international respondents, who were also included (India = 301, rest = 23). The self-designed questionnaire had 30 questions in the form of multiple choices, checkboxes, linear scales and short comments. Informed consent was recorded at the outset. Details such as demographic characteristics, place and nature of work, pandemic related changes in duration or pattern of work, psychological symptoms during and after working hours, fears about quarantine, were collected in the survey. Statistical Analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Statistics for Mac Version 21.0 IBM Corp., USA)ResultAmong the 324 participating anaesthesiologists, a prevalence rate of 64.8% for stress, 51.2% for anxiety and 65.7% for depression was noted, which was double the rate from pre-pandemic studies. Those between the ages of 30 and 50 (p = 0.010 OR:2.191) and working in government run (p = 0.045 OR:2.564) COVID-19 hospitals in India (p = 0.002 OR:2.018), were particularly stressed (33.3%) and anxious (38%) than the rest. Increased workload, contracting the virus and becoming an infectious source to their family (88.6%) were their prime concern. Formulating standard operating procedures (SOP) (66.7%) and procuring personal protective equipment (PPE) (56.2%) were some of the challenges faced at work. Most of them recommended a congenial workplace (68.8%) and family support (60.8%) to help them work through their anxiety and fear, while a few reported considering leaving their career (34.8%) from fear of monetary loss and burn out (53.8%).ConclusionCOVID-19 has changed the professional and personal life of anaesthesiologists in India. Irrespective of their workplace, their fears and challenges remain universal. Early identification of anxiety and depression and providing appropriate psychological support will prevent deep and enduring damages to the lives of these professionals.","output":"Coping with a modern pandemic-an online survey of Anesthesiologists in India during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer is the deadliest disease among all the diseases and the main cause of human mortality. Several types of cancer sicken the human body and affect organs. Among all the types of cancer, stomach cancer is the most dangerous disease that spreads rapidly and needs to be diagnosed at an early stage. The early diagnosis of stomach cancer is essential to reduce the mortality rate. The manual diagnosis process is time-consuming, requires many tests, and the availability of an expert doctor. Therefore, automated techniques are required to diagnose stomach infections from endoscopic images. Many computerized techniques have been introduced in the literature but due to a few challenges (i.e., high similarity among the healthy and infected regions, irrelevant features extraction, and so on), there is much room to improve the accuracy and reduce the computational time. In this paper, a deep-learning-based stomach disease classification method employing deep feature extraction, fusion, and optimization using WCE images is proposed. The proposed method comprises several phases: data augmentation performed to increase the dataset images, deep transfer learning adopted for deep features extraction, feature fusion performed on deep extracted features, fused feature matrix optimized with a modified dragonfly optimization method, and final classification of the stomach disease was performed. The features extraction phase employed two pre-trained deep CNN models (Inception v3 and DenseNet-201) performing activation on feature derivation layers. Later, the parallel concatenation was performed on deep-derived features and optimized using the meta-heuristic method named the dragonfly algorithm. The optimized feature matrix was classified by employing machine-learning algorithms and achieved an accuracy of 99.8% on the combined stomach disease dataset. A comparison has been conducted with state-of-the-art techniques and shows improved accuracy.","output":"Deep Feature Fusion and Optimization-Based Approach for Stomach Disease Classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: iSupport is an online program developed by the World Health Organization to provide education, skills training, and social support to informal carers of persons with dementia. This pilot study examines the feasibility of the protocol for a main effectiveness trial of iSupport-Portugal and explores how the intervention and control arms compare over time on well-being outcomes. METHODS: A mixed-methods experimental parallel between-group design with two arms is followed. Participants were recruited nationwide, by referral or advertising, through the National Alzheimers Association. Inclusion criteria are being Portuguese adults, providing e-consent, providing unpaid care to someone with dementia for at least 6 months, experiencing relevant scores on burden ( 21 on ZBI) or depression or anxiety ( 8 on HADS), and using webpages autonomously. Participants were consecutively randomized to receive iSupport-Portugal or an education-only e-book and were not blinded to group assignment. Data were collected online with self-administered instruments, at baseline, 3 and 6 months after. Outcomes comprise caregiver burden, depression, anxiety, QoL, positive aspects of caregiving, and self-efficacy. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate group, time, and group-by-time effects. Intervention engagement data were extracted from iSupports platform. Semi-structured interviews were conducted. RESULTS: Forty-two participants were allocated to the intervention (N = 21) and control (N = 21) arms. Participation (78.1%) and retention rates (73.8%) were fair. More carers in the control arm completed the study (N = 20, 95.2%) than in the intervention arm (N = 11; 52.4%) ((2) = 9.98, p = .002). Non-completers were younger, spent less time caring, and scored higher on anxiety. Among carers in the intervention arm, the average attendance rate was of 53.7%. At post-test 38.9% of participants still used iSupport; the remainder participants interrupted use within 2 weeks (Mdn). For per-protocol analyses, significant group-by-time interaction effects favouring the intervention were found for anxiety (Wald 2 = 6.17, p = .046) and for environmental QoL (Wald (2) = 7.06, p = .029). Those effects were not observed in intention-to-treat analyses adjusted for age. Interviewees from the intervention arm (N = 12) reported positive results of iSupport on knowledge and on experiencing positive feelings. No adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides information for a forthcoming full-scale effectiveness trial, as on the acceptability and potential results of iSupport-Portugal. iSupport is suggested as a relevant resource for Portuguese carers.

Data were analysed using a framework approach.Results Three themes emerged to unpack participants views on COVID-19 booster and flu vaccinations: (1) Booster intentions correspond with decisions around initial vaccination (2) Mixed views on booster and flu vaccines (3) Mixed views on whether to get COVID-19 booster and flu vaccines together or separately.

METHODS: We compared the number of JIA reactivations in the period March-July 2020 to the same months of 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: A total of 10 JIA reactivations have been documented on 58 patients (17%) visited in the period March-July 2018; 10 reactivations on 61 patients (16%) in the period March-July 2019; and 19 reactivations on 39 patients (49%) in the period March-July 2020, with a statistically significant increase (p <0.001). The other 19 patients who should have been visited during the same period, contacted by phone, indicated remission. Therefore, we hypothesize that the effective number of reactivations in the period March-July 2020 would be 19/58 patients (33%) which remains significantly greater than in the previous 2 years (p < 0.05). Among the 19 JIA patients reactivated in 2020, 3 spontaneously stopped the basic treatment due to parents' choice for fear of serious complications in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 4 had poor compliance with underlying treatment. In addition, 14/19 reactivated JIA patients did not perform the scheduled check according to the follow-up. In fact, the mean time interval between two follow-up visits was significantly greater in 2020 (157  53 days, p < 0.0001) vs 2018 (108  68 days) and 2019 (107  40 days). CONCLUSIONS: We have found a significant increase in JIA reactivations in the period March-July 2020 compared to the same interval of 2018 and 2019. This increase may have been caused by poor compliance with background treatment, as documented in 7/19 JIA patients reactivated, and by a greater interval in follow-up checks. Therefore, it is necessary, in occasion of a new pandemic and lockdown, to implement greater controls using more appropriate telemedicine tools. Key Points a? COVID-19 pandemic lockdown had a negative effect on the follow-up of JIA patients. a? A significant increase in JIA reactivations was found during the lockdown. a? Poor therapeutic compliance and follow-up checks have been proven during the lockdown. a? It is necessary to improve telemedicine tools and scientific information during a pandemic and lockdown.","output":"Negative effect of lockdown on juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Motions in biomolecules are critical for biochemical reactions.

We present a case of ARDS due to HGA, highlighting the importance of maintaining a broad differential and thorough history taking even in the midst of a pandemic. Case: A 43 year-old man with a history of alcohol and tobacco use presented in late November 2020 in the midst of a regional COVID-19 surge with two weeks of progressive shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers, and altered mental status. Admission labs were notable for hepatocellular injury, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia with absolute lymphopenia, and elevated creatinine. The patient's hypoxemia progressed to the point of requiring mechanical ventilation despite broad spectrum antibiotics. SARS-CoV-2 PCR x3, blood, viral, and fungal cultures were negative. Patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio of &lt;200, extensive bilateral infiltrates, and low suspicion for heart failure was consistent with ARDS (Figure). Given continued hypoxia, the patient underwent the prone positioning protocol. A peripheral smear was obtained for thrombocytopenia/leukopenia and demonstrated inclusions within the neutrophils consistent with Anaplasma. Upon further history taking, the spouse confirmed that the patient had recently found several ticks on his body after returning from a hunting trip in northern Minnesota. Anaplasma was confirmed with PCR testing. The rarity of ARDS due to anaplasmosis limits insight into therapeutic options aside from antibiotics. However, in addition to receiving doxycycline, the patient was started on dexamethasone, which has demonstrated possible symptomatic benefit through small case studies. The dosage of Dexamethasone administered ranged from 4-20 mg, totaling 5 doses. The patient improved and was discharged home. Discussion: Human granulocytic anaplasmosis is caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Ticks are the main vectors for this zoonotic disease, specifically the Ixodes tick. Like other tick-borne infections, it presents most commonly as a febrile illness. Our patient had several classic manifestations including leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated transaminases. Pulmonary symptoms are infrequently described aside from some reports of interstitial pneumonia and, rarely, ARDS. Doxycycline is the gold standard treatment for HGA. A few case reports have demonstrated clinical improvement with the addition of steroids when ARDS was present. Our patient saw improvement with the combination of corticosteroids, doxycycline, and ARDS evidencebased practices (i.e. pronation and low tidal volume ventilation). Similar management should be considered in other patients presenting with severe ARDS caused by HGA. Finally, although an atypical season for ticks, this case highlights the importance of a thorough social history and broad differentials, especially in patients presenting with severe illness.","output":"COVID anticks: Not all infiltrates are COVID related"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (Covid-19) is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to the labor market.

The objective of this study was to analyze the impact that Covid-19 pandemic perception and psychological need satisfaction have on university students and their self-employment intention. In addition, we also analyzed the role of moderation played by psychological aspects. These psychological factors (i.e., Optimism and Proactiveness) can also improve young peoples mental health and well-being. Methods: An explorative study (online survey) was conducted in March 2020 934 university students from Latin America. Regression analysis models were built to examine the relationships between Covid-19 pandemic perception, personality variables, and entrepreneurial intention. Mediation models, through the bootstrapping method, were performed to analyze the mediating role of proactiveness and optimism. Results: Results indicate that students perception of Covid-19 and psychological need satisfaction are associated with entrepreneurial intention. Additionally, the present study argues that proactiveness and optimism mediate these relationships. Conclusions: This study identifies psychological factors associated with a lower level of Covid-19 impact and that can be used for psychological interventions that result in an improvement in the mental health of these vulnerable groups during and after the Covid-19 pandemic.

Thus, 600 MHz (1)H solvent-suppressed single-pulse, spin-echo, and 2D J-resolved spectra were collected on plasma recorded from SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR-positive patients (n = 15, with multiple sampling timepoints) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 34, confirmed rRT-PCR negative), together with patients with COVID-19/influenza-like clinical symptoms who tested SARS-CoV-2 negative (n = 35). We compared the single-pulse NMR spectral data with in vitro diagnostic research (IVDr) information on quantitative lipoprotein profiles (112 parameters) extracted from the raw 1D NMR data. All NMR methods gave highly significant discrimination of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from controls and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients with individual NMR methods, giving different diagnostic information windows on disease-induced phenoconversion. Longitudinal trajectory analysis in selected patients indicated that metabolic recovery was incomplete in individuals without detectable virus in the recovery phase. We observed four plasma cytokine clusters that expressed complex differential statistical relationships with multiple lipoproteins and metabolites. These included the following: cluster 1, comprising MIP-1, SDF-1, IL-22, and IL-1, which correlated with multiple increased LDL and VLDL subfractions; cluster 2, including IL-10 and IL-17A, which was only weakly linked to the lipoprotein profile; cluster 3, which included IL-8 and MCP-1 and were inversely correlated with multiple lipoproteins. IL-18, IL-6, and IFN- together with IP-10 and RANTES exhibited strong positive correlations with LDL1C4 subfractions and negative correlations with multiple HDL subfractions. Collectively, these data show a distinct pattern indicative of a multilevel cellular immune response to SARS CoV-2 infection interacting with the plasma lipoproteome giving a strong and characteristic immunometabolic phenotype of the disease. We observed that some patients in the respiratory recovery phase and testing virus-free were still metabolically highly abnormal, which indicates a new role for these technologies in assessing full systemic recovery.","output":"NMR Spectroscopic Windows on the Systemic Effects of SARS-CoV-2 Infection on Plasma Lipoproteins and Metabolites in Relation to Circulating Cytokines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sick building syndrome (SBS) and building-related illnesses are omnipresent in modern high-rise buildings. The SBS is a complex spectrum of ill health symptoms, such as mucous membrane irritation, asthma, neurotoxic effects, gastrointestinal disturbance, skin dryness, sensitivity to odours that may appear among occupants in office and public buildings, schools and hospitals. Studies on large office buildings from USA, UK, Sweden, Finland, Japan, Germany, Canada, China, India, Netherlands, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Thailand, substantiate the occurrence of SBS phenomena. The accumulated effects of a multitude of factors, such as the indoor environmental quality, building characteristics, building dampness, and activities of occupants attribute to SBS. A building occupant manifests at least one symptom of SBS, the onset of two or more symptoms at least twice, and rapid resolution of symptoms following moving away from the workstation or building may be defined as having SBS.

Some predisposing genetic backgrounds can hence potentially explain the broad inter-individual variation of disease susceptibility and/or severity. It has been now clearly established that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19, infects the host cell through biding and being internalized with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a surface protein expressed in a noticeable number of human cells, especially in those of upper and lower respiratory tracts, heart, kidney, testis, adipose tissue, gastrointestinal system and in lymphocytes. Accumulating evidence now suggests that genetic polymorphisms in the ACE2 gene may modulate intermolecular interactions with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and/or contribute to pulmonary and systemic injury by fostering vasoconstriction, inflammation, oxidation and fibrosis. We hence argue that the development of genetic tests aimed at specifically identifying specific COVID-19-susceptible or -protective ACE2 variants in the general population may be a reasonable strategy for stratifying the risk of infection and/or unfavorable disease progression.","output":"Do genetic polymorphisms in angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene play a role in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present an approach to extend the endemic-epidemic (EE) modelling framework for the analysis of infectious disease data. In its spatiotemporal formulation, spatial dependencies have originally been captured by static neighbourhood matrices. We propose to adjust these weight matrices over time to reflect changes in spatial connectivity between geographical units. We illustrate this extension by modelling the spread of COVID-19 disease between Swiss and bordering Italian regions in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We adjust the spatial weights with data describing the daily changes in population mobility patterns, and indicators of border closures describing the state of travel restrictions since the beginning of the pandemic. We use these time-dependent weights to fit an EE model to the region- stratified time series of new COVID-19 cases. We then adjust the weight matrices to reflect two counterfactual scenarios of border closures and draw counterfactual predictions based on these, to retrospectively assess the usefulness of border closures. Predictions based on a scenario where no closure of the Swiss-Italian border occurred increased the number of cumulative cases in Switzerland by a factor of 2.7 (10th to 90th percentile: 2.2 to 3.6) over the study period. Conversely, a closure of the Swiss-Italian border two weeks earlier than implemented would have resulted in only a 10% (20% to 10%) decrease in the number of cases and merely delayed the epidemic spread by a couple of weeks.

AB stent(s) based on 54 cases of saccular aneurysms and 14 of acute symptomatic dissecting aneurysms. METHODS Fifty-eight consecutive patients (M/F = 28/30; median age, 53 years) harbouring 68 aneurysms (ruptured/unruptured = 12/56) underwent treatment with Solitaire? AB stent(s) implantation between April 2010 and August 2011 in our institution. The data were retrospectively reviewed and analysed. RESULTS The technical success rate of Solitaire? AB stenting was 100%. The rates of the overall and the treatment-related adverse events were 9% (6/68) and 6% (4/68), respectively, and the recurrent rate was 1% (1/68). All of the adverse events (n = 6) occurred in tiny (n = 1, 3 mm) or small (n = 5, >3 to 10 mm) aneurysms. The majority (75%, 3/4) of thromboembolic events (thrombus, n = 2; infarction, n = 2) occurred in ruptured lesions, and 2 intraprocedural aneurysm ruptures occurred in the course of coiling when the stent(s) was/were applied within 6 months. Subarachnoid haemorrhages (SAH, p<0.05) and immediate occlusion grades (p<0.05) were predictors for overall adverse events by univariate analysis. Compared with the immediate post-treatment angiographic results, the follow-up angiographic imaging (mean, 13 months; range, 6-25 months) revealed that stent(s) implantation enhanced the rate of class I occlusion from 34% (23/68) to 93% (63/68). SAH was the only predictor for unfavourable outcomes (the modified Rankin Scale score [mRS], 2-6) during the mean 19-month (range, 12-27 months) of clinical follow-ups (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Although the complete obliteration of tiny and small aneurysms without complications remains a challenge, stent(s) implantation could lead to further occlusion of incompletely coiled aneurysms. SAH and the occlusion grade were the primary predictors for adverse events.

Besides this, COVID-19 related central and peripheral nervous system manifestations are emerging. OBJECTIVES: This study summarises the demographics, clinical profile, laboratory findings, management strategies, and outcomes in a large number of patients with COVID-19 related GBS and its variants. We also compared its clinical profile with Zika and dengue virus-related GBS. METHODS: Authors carried out a literature search up to Dec 31, 2020, in MEDLINE, PubMed, SCOPUS, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar for all published articles. RESULTS: The study identified 54 different types of articles consisting of 70 cases from 17 countries worldwide. Maximum cases 15 (21.4%) were identified from Italy, followed by USA 12 (17.1%), Spain 11 (15.7%), and Iran 10 (14.3%). The age group more than 60 years had most cases with 32 (45.7%) cases followed by age group 40-60 with cases 25 (35.7%) with male and female ratio 2. Maximum cases were treated with IVIG infusion 58 (82.9%), followed by Plasma exchange 13 (18.6%) cases. Out of 70 cases, 7 (10%) cases were manifested as Miller-Fisher syndrome. The most predominant electrodiagnostic variant was demyelinating neuropathy in 41 (73.21%) cases. The outcome reported in 67 cases was survival in 63 (90%) cases and the death of 4 (5.7%) cases.

However, the effectiveness of any vaccine is dictated by the proportion of the population willing to be vaccinated. In this observational population-based study we examined intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 over the course of the pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of 7,547 US adults enrolled in the Understanding America Study (UAS). Participants reporting being willing, undecided and unwilling to get vaccinated against coronavirus across 13 assessments conducted from April-October, 2020. Public attitudes to vaccination against the coronavirus were also assessed. RESULTS: Willingness to vaccinate declined from 71% in April to 53.6% in October. This was explained by an increase in the percentage of participants undecided about vaccinating (from 10.5% to 14.4%) and the portion of the sample unwilling to vaccinate (from 18.5% to 32%). The population subgroups most likely to be undecided/unwilling to vaccinate were those without a degree (undecided: RRR=2.47, 95% CI: 2.04-3.00; unwilling: RRR=1.92, 95% CI: 1.67-2.20), Black participants (undecided: RRR=2.18, 95% CI: 1.73-2.74; unwilling: RRR=1.98, 95% CI: 1.63-2.42), and females (undecided: RRR=1.41, 95% CI: 1.20-1.65; unwilling: RRR=1.29, 95% CI: 1.14-1.46). Those aged 65+, those on high incomes, and other race/ethnicity participants were least likely to be undecided or unwilling to vaccinate.

Failure to address the mental health issues stemming from the pandemic is likely to prolong its impact. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a significant global challenge and, in lower-income countries, even a disruption of mental health services. Given our experience with previous pandemics, the present COVID-19 crisis can be expected to cause psychological trauma, and steps are needed to address this issue proactively. A focus on the long-term mental health consequences may be at least as important as the measures currently seeking to mitigate the short-term effects of COVID-19 and to save lives. The implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for mental health call for a greater focus on the needs of those with mental disorders and on mental health issues affecting health care workers and the general public. Timely preventive and therapeutic mental health care is essential in addressing the psychosocial needs of populations exposed to the pandemic.

Although not considered the frontline specialty in managing COVID-19 patients, neurosurgical service and training were also significantly affected. This article focuses on the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak at a low- and/or middle-income country (LMIC) academic tertiary referral hospital, the university and hospital policies and actions for the neurosurgical service and training program during the outbreak, and the contingency plan for future reference on preparedness for service and education. METHODS The authors collected data from several official databases, including the Indonesian Ministry of Health database, East Java provincial government database, hospital database, and neurosurgery operative case log. Policies and regulations information was obtained from stakeholders, including the Indonesian Society of Neurological Surgeons, the hospital board of directors, and the dean's office. RESULTS The curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Indonesia had not flattened by the 2nd week of June 2020. Surabaya, the second-largest city in Indonesia, became the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in Indonesia. The neurosurgical service experienced a significant drop in cases (50% of cases from normal days) along all lines (outpatient clinic, emergency room, and surgical ward). Despite a strict preadmission screening, postoperative COVID-19 infection cases were detected during the treatment course of neurosurgical patients, and those with a positive COVID-19 infection had a high mortality rate. The reduction in the overall number of cases treated in the neurosurgical service had an impact on the educational and training program. The digital environment found popularity in the educational term; however, digital resources could not replace direct exposure to real patients. The education stakeholders adjusted the undergraduate students' clinical postings and residents' working schemes for safety reasons. CONCLUSIONS The neurosurgery service at an academic tertiary referral hospital in an LMIC experienced a significant reduction in cases. The university and program directors had to adapt to an off-campus and off-hospital policy for neurosurgical residents and undergraduate students. The hospital instituted a reorganization of residents for service.

In this study, we present results from the largest nationwide wastewater monitoring system in the United States reported to date. We profile 55 locations with at least six months of sampling and highlight their wastewater data from April 2020 through May 2021.

The aim of this study is to characterize risk factors and clinical features of COVID-19 disease in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A retrospective, chart-review, case-control study was conducted at King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory data on patients diagnosed between March 18 and May 18, 2020 were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: We reviewed medical records on 297 suspected cases of COVID-19. Of these, 175 (59%) tested positive for COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and considered as cases, while 122 (41%) tested negative and considered as control. COVID-19 positive cases were more likely to be males, and non-health care providers. Hypertension (15%), diabetes (10%) and two or more concurrent comorbidities (54.4%) were more prevalent among COVID-19 patients. Patients presented with fever, cough, and loss of taste/smell were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 (P = 0.001, 0.008, 0.008; respectively). Radiological evidence of pneumonia was associated with confirmed COVID-19 disease (P = 0.001). Shortness of breath and gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with the risk of COVID-19 at presentation.

Moreover, the efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines appears lower in immunocompromised patients, including recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT). In this population, data are scarce regarding factors predicting the response to mRNA vaccines. Methods This retrospective study aimed to decipher which factors, including immune status at time of vaccine and recipient/donor blood groups, might influence the antibody response after two injections (V1 and V2) of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine in a cohort of allografted patients with no previous symptomatic nor asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. Possible previous asymptomatic COVID-19 infection was investigated in pre-V1 samples by testing for anti-nucleocapsid (N) antibodies (anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay, Roche Elecsys?, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Antibody response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain was tested post-V2 (Roche Elecsys?). As recommended by the manufacturer, titers 0.8 U/mL were considered positive, the highest value being >250 U/mL. Blood samples were also collected before V1 and at distance from V2 to evaluate, by flow cytometry, total lymphocyte (Ly) counts and quantitative Ly subsets (CD3, CD4 and CD8 T cells, B and NK cells). Statistical analyses were performed on R (version 4.0.3). Patient characteristics were compared by using the 2 test for discrete variables and the Wilcoxon test for continuous variables. Generalized linear models were used to conduct multivariate analyses. Results Samples were available from 117 Allo-HSCT patients who had been vaccinated between January 20 and April 17, 2021. Patient characteristics are provided in Table 1. The average interval from Allo-HSCT day 0 (D0) to V1 (D0-V1) was 654 (IQR: 372-1367) days (d). S-antibody response rate post-V2 was 82.9% for the entire cohort. Non-humoral responders (NHR) post-V2 (n = 20) had a lower D0-V1 interval (median 271 vs 914 d, p <10 -5) and a lower pre-V1 median total Ly count (0.62 vs 1.61x10 9/L, p < 10 -4). Lymphocyte subsets possibly predictive of antibody response were then investigated. NHR were associated with lower median CD3 (0.39 vs 0.97 x10 9/L, p = 0.01), CD4 (0.13 vs 0.35 x10 9/L, p=<10 -3), and B-cell (0.00 vs 0.28 G/L, p <10 -6) counts. NK and T CD8 counts were not statistically different between NHR and HR (respectively p=0.14 and p=0.06). No influence either was observed when considering the age of donors (p=0.39) or recipients (p=0.55), underlying disease (p=1), Allo-HSCT conditioning (p=0.11), blood groups (donor, p=0.55; receiver, p=0.39) or a previous history of graft versus host disease (GVHD; 83.1 vs 83.6%, p=1). Conversely, ongoing immunosuppressive (IS)/chemotherapy treatment and a haploidentical source of graft were associated with lower responses to vaccination (respectively 62.5 vs 90.5%, p<10 -3, and 69.4 vs 88.6% for patients with matched donors, p=0.02). In multivariate analysis (Fig.1) also including D0-V1 interval, donor source, current IS/chemotherapy treatment and TCD4 Ly count, only B cell aplasia remained statistically associated with lack of antibody response after two vaccine injections (OR 0.01, 95%CI [0.00 - 0.10], p <10 -3). The possible modification in terms of lymphocyte counts between pre-V1 and post-V2 times has been also investigated showing that only CD4 lymphocytes counts improved significantly (0.31 vs 0.34 x10 9/L, p=0.01) between this interval. Conclusion B cell aplasia appears as a major predictor of anti SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine failure after Allo-HSCT. It may be suggested from this result that a close immune monitoring should be proposed after allotransplant to propose the vaccine at the most appropriate time, meaning after of B cell detection, regardless of the delay from Allo-SCT or the presence of an IS/chemotherapy treatment. The possibility for these patients to have mounted a cellular response should also be considered, which was not investigated here.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to effectively prioritize patients who are symptomatic for testing to assist early COVID-19 detection in Brazil, addressing problems related to inefficient testing and control strategies. METHODS: Raw data from 55,676 Brazilians were preprocessed, and the chi-square test was used to confirm the relevance of the following features: gender, health professional, fever, sore throat, dyspnea, olfactory disorders, cough, coryza, taste disorders, and headache. Classification models were implemented relying on preprocessed data sets; supervised learning; and the algorithms multilayer perceptron (MLP), gradient boosting machine (GBM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR). The models' performances were analyzed using 10-fold cross-validation, classification metrics, and the Friedman and Nemenyi statistical tests. The permutation feature importance method was applied for ranking the features used by the classification models with the highest performances. RESULTS: Gender, fever, and dyspnea were among the highest-ranked features used by the classification models. The comparative analysis presents MLP, GBM, DT, RF, XGBoost, and SVM as the highest performance models with similar results. KNN and LR were outperformed by the other algorithms.

METHODS: This was a prospective study carried out during the first pandemic wave in the intensive care units (ICUs) of two referral University Hospitals in Lombardy, Italy. Two hundred twenty-two consecutive mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients were evaluated during the ICU stay. In addition to major demographic and clinical data, we recorded information on the route and amount of nutritional support provided on a daily basis. RESULTS: Among patients still in the ICUs and alive on day 4 (N = 198), 129 (65.2%) and 72 (36.4%) reached a satisfactory caloric and protein intake, respectively, mainly by enteral route. In multivariable analysis, a satisfactory caloric intake on day 4 was associated with lower mortality (HR = 0.46 [95%CI, 0.42-0.50], P < 0.001). Mild obesity (body mass index [BMI] &#8805;30 and < 35 kg/m2) was associated with higher mortality (HR = 1.99 [95%CI, 1.07-3.68], P = 0.029), while patients with moderate-severe obesity (BMI&#8805;35 kg/m2) were less likely to be weaned from invasive mechanical ventilation (HR = 0.71 [95%CI, 0.62-0.82], P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the negative prognostic and clinical role of obesity in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients and suggested that early caloric deficit may independently contribute to worsen survival in this patients' population.

We tested 47 SOTRs for clinical and research anti-spike IgG, pseudoneutralization (ACE2 blocking), and live-virus neutralization (nAb) against VOCs before and after a third SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose (70% mRNA, 30% Ad26.COV2.S) with comparison to 15 healthy controls after two mRNA vaccine doses. We used correlation analysis to compare anti-spike IgG assays and focused on thresholds associated with neutralization. A third SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose increased median total anti-spike (1.6-fold), pseudoneutralization against VOCs (2.5-fold vs. Delta), and neutralizing antibodies (1.4-fold against Delta). However, neutralization activity was significantly lower than healthy controls (p < .001); 32% of SOTRs had zero detectable nAb against Delta after third vaccination compared to 100% for controls. Correlation with nAb was seen at anti-spike IgG >4 Log10 (AU/ml) on the Euroimmun ELISA and >4 Log10 (AU/ml) on the MSD research assay.

In computer science, this represents a typical problem of machine learning over incomplete or limited data in early epidemic Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC) simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability distributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested cases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and the correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development is experimented. Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a MC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction of fuzzy rule induction techniques. As a result, decision makers are benefited from a better fitted MC outputs complemented by minCmax rules that foretell about the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the epidemic.","output":"Composite Monte Carlo decision making under high uncertainty of novel coronavirus epidemic using hybridized deep learning and fuzzy rule induction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A twin-column Multicolumn Countercurrent Solvent Gradient Purification (MCSGP) process has been developed for the purification of a therapeutic peptide, glucagon, from a crude synthetic mixture. This semi-continuous process uses two identical columns operating either in interconnected or in batch mode, thus enabling the internal recycle of the portions of the eluting stream which do not comply with purity specifications. Because of this feature, which actually results in the simulated countercurrent movement of the stationary phase with respect to the mobile one, the yield-purity trade-off typical of traditional batch preparative chromatography can be alleviated. Moreover, the purification process can be completely automatized. Aim of this work is to present a simple procedure for the development of the MCSGP process based on a single batch experiment, in the case of a therapeutic peptide of industrial relevance. This allowed to recover roughly 90% of the injected glucagon in a purified pool with a purity of about 90%. A comparison between the performance of the MCSGP process and the classical single column batch process indicates that percentage increase in the recovery of target product is +23% when transferring the method from batch conditions to MCSGP, with an unchanged purity of around 89%.

Given many new DL models have been being developed for this purpose, the objective of this study is to investigate the fine tuning of pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the classification of COVID-19 using chest X-rays. If fine-tuned pre-trained CNNs can provide equivalent or better classification results than other more sophisticated CNNs, then the deployment of AI-based tools for detecting COVID-19 using chest X-ray data can be more rapid and cost-effective. METHODS: Three pretrained CNNs, which are AlexNet, GoogleNet, and SqueezeNet, were selected and fine-tuned without data augmentation to carry out 2-class and 3-class classification tasks using 3 public chest X-ray databases. RESULTS: In comparison with other recently developed DL models, the 3 pretrained CNNs achieved very high classification results in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, [Formula: see text] score, and area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve. CONCLUSION: AlexNet, GoogleNet, and SqueezeNet require the least training time among pretrained DL models, but with suitable selection of training parameters, excellent classification results can be achieved without data augmentation by these networks.

Thrombi were in different stages of organization, consistent with an ongoing, endogenous thrombotic process. In all the analyzed samples, in situ RNA hybridization showed that pneumocytes and vascular endothelial cells had massive presence of viral RNA even at the later stages of the disease. An additional feature of the disease was the presence, in the vast majority of patients, of a large number of dysmorphic pneumocytes, often forming large syncytial elements, a consequence of the fusogenic activity of the viral Spike protein, detected with specific antibodies. Despite occasional presence of virus-positive cells in the heart, no overt signs of viral infection were detected in other organs, which showed common alterations compatible with prolonged hypoxia, multifocal organ disease or previous comorbidities. In summary, COVID-19 is a unique interstitial pneumonia with extensive lung thrombosis, long-term persistence of viral replication in pneumocytes and endothelial cells, along with the presence of infected cellular syncytia in the lung.

We collected 972 samples from hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), their health care providers, and hospital surfaces before, during, and after admission. We screened for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR, characterized microbial communities using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and contextualized the massive microbial diversity in this dataset through meta-analysis of over 20,000 samples. Sixteen percent of surfaces from COVID-19 patient rooms were positive, with the highest prevalence in floor samples next to patient beds (39%) and directly outside their rooms (29%). Although bed rail samples increasingly resembled the patient microbiome over time, SARS-CoV-2 was detected less there (11%). Despite viral surface contamination in almost all patient rooms, no health care workers contracted the disease, suggesting that personal protective equipment was effective in preventing transmissions. SARS-CoV-2 positive samples had higher bacterial phylogenetic diversity across human and surface samples, and higher biomass in floor samples. 16S microbial community profiles allowed for high SARS-CoV-2 classifier accuracy in not only nares, but also forehead, stool, and floor samples. Across distinct microbial profiles, a single amplicon sequence variant from the genus Rothia was highly predictive of SARS-CoV-2 across sample types and had higher prevalence in positive surface and human samples, even compared to samples from patients in another intensive care unit prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. These results suggest that bacterial communities may contribute to viral prevalence both in the host and hospital environment.","output":"Microbial context predicts SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in patients and the hospital built environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2 that causes COVID-19 has resulted in the death of more than 2.31 million people within the last year and yet no cure exists. Whereas passive immunization with COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) provides a safe and viable option, selection of optimal units for therapy and lack of clear therapeutic benefit from transfusion remain as barriers to the use of CCP. Study design and methods: To identify plasma that is expected to benefit recipients, we measured anti-SARS-CoV2 antibody levels using clinically available serological assays and correlated with the neutralizing activity of CCP from donors. Neutralizing titer of plasma samples was measured by assaying infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped retrovirus particles in the presence of dilutions of plasma samples. We also used this assay to identify evidence of passive transfusion of neutralizing activity in CCP recipients. Results: Viral neutralization and anti-spike protein antibodies in 109 samples from 87 plasma donors were highly varied but modestly correlated with each other. Recipients who died of COVID-19 were found to have been transfused with units with lower anti-spike antibody levels and neutralizing activity. Passive transfer of neutralization activity was documented in 62% of antibody naive plasma recipients. Conclusions: Since viral neutralization is the goal of CCP transfusion, our observations not only support the use of anti-spike SARS-CoV2 serology tests to identify beneficial CCP units, but also support the therapeutic value of convalescent plasma with high titers of anti-spike antibodies.","output":"Donor Anti-Spike Immunity is Related to Recipient Recovery and Can Predict the Efficacy of Convalescent Plasma Units."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The trend in recent years of wanting to perfect strategies and tactical approaches has led football to evolve into new approaches that allow for much deeper and more rigorous strategic plans to be analyzed and developed For this, methods such as the game model have been established, which aims to establish the key game patterns of a team in order to develop a structure that identifies and defines the characteristics of a team The objective of this work is to carry out a case study that analyzes the game model of a professional soccer team in Germany by visualizing all its league games (n = 25) before COVID-19 and using a descriptive methodology, establishing 2 criteria and 4 elements of analysis The results indicate, in general terms, that the team analyzed is a team marked by a combinative pattern of offensive play, which tries to unbalance the rival by progression through the central area of the field and which, at a defensive level, is defined as a team that tries to recover the ball as soon as possible, covering the interior corridors, being able to conclude how through a case study we can analyze and study the characteristics of a soccer team ?

This is seen both in terms of systemic metabolism, as well as at the cellular level with clear mitochondrial dysfunction. More recently, the importance of cellular metabolism in immune cells, or immunometabolism, has been highlighted as a major modifier of immune cell function. Indeed, T cell activation, differentiation, and effector function partly depend on alterations in metabolic pathways with different cell types and functionality favoring either glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation. While immune system dysfunction with aging is well described, what remains less elucidated is how the integral networks that control immune cell metabolism are specifically affected by age. In recent years, this significant gap has been identified and work has begun to investigate the various ways immunometabolism could be impacted by both chronological age and age-associated symptoms, such as the systemic accumulation of senescent cells. Here, in this mini-review, we will examine immunometabolism with a focus on T cells, aging, and interventions, such as mTOR modulators and senolytics.

Recently the Ddimer test has been used as a marker of inflammation in COVID-19 pneumonia and has been shown to correlate with worse outcomes. An understanding of trajectories and relation to clot burden and outcomes of this novel use of serial measurements of D-dimer in COVID-19 ICU patients remains to be explored. Methods: We reviewed patients who were admitted to the Northwestern Hospital COVID ICUs from 3/1/20 to 7/31/20. We obtained demographics, d-dimer lab values, venous duplex studies from upper and lower extremities (UE/LE dopplers), CT-angiogram (CTA) reports, and mortality outcomes from our electronic medical record database. Reports were processed using string analysis with manual physician validation. Analysis was done in R with nonparametric numeric variables being compared by two-tailed Mann Whitney tests. Results: We had 370 patients in our cohort, with median (interquartile range (IQR)) age being 60 (49-69), 229/370 (62%) male, 128 (35%) of Hispanic ethnicity, 117 (32%) of African-American ethnicity, and 135 (36%) of Caucasian descent. 70 patients died (19%). The total number of VTE imaging tests included: 87 CTAs, 102 UE dopplers, and 232 LE dopplers. Clot was discovered in 43/102 (42%) UE dopplers, 62/232 (27%) of LE dopplers, and 25/87 (29%) of CTAs. Patients underwent a median of 2 (1-3) imaging studies, and 10 (4-20) d-dimer measurements. 79 unique patients (21%) had VTE detected. There was no statistically significant difference in age between the clot vs noclot groups: 57(45-68) vs 61(49-59) years, p=0.34, or BMI: 30.5(25.6-34.8) in clot vs 29(25.4-34.5) kg/m2 in no-clot group (p=0.55). Mortality was significantly higher at 36% in the clot group vs 15% in the group without clot (p&lt;0.005). Hospital length of stay in the group with clot was significantly longer at 30.5(20.3-43.5) days vs no-clot 14(7.9-18.5) days (p&lt;0.0001). The clot group had higher initial d-dimer values 2,236(752-3,654) ng/ml than the no-clot group 757(395-1,940) (p&lt;0.0001), and also higher peak d-dimer values 9,476(3,353-16,595) vs 2,113(686-3,689) ng/ml (p&lt;0.0001).

Accidental factors often lead to short-term sharp fluctuations in stock markets, deviating from the original normal trend. The short-term fluctuation of stock price has high noise, which is not conducive to the prediction of stock trends. Therefore, we used discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-based denoising to denoise stock data. Denoising the stock data assisted us to eliminate the influences of short-term random events on the continuous trend of the stock. The denoised data showed more stable trend characteristics and smoothness. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is one of the effective training algorithms for fully connected single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs), which possesses the advantages of fast convergence, unique results, and it does not converge to a local minimum. Therefore, this paper proposed a combination of ELM- and DWT-based denoising to predict the trend of stocks. The proposed method was used to predict the trend of 400 stocks in China. The prediction results of the proposed method are a good proof of the efficacy of DWT-based denoising for stock trends, and showed an excellent performance compared to 12 machine learning algorithms (e.g., recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM)).","output":"A Hybrid Method Based on Extreme Learning Machine and Wavelet Transform Denoising for Stock Prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has to date affected over 5 million people worldwide and caused in excess of 300000 deaths.

However, women, ethnic and cultural minorities, as well as individuals with disabilities, are systematically discriminated against or even excluded from promotions, publications, and general visibility. A more diverse workforce is more productive, and thus discrimination has a negative impact on science and the wider society, as well as on the education, careers, and well-being of individuals who are discriminated against. Moreover, the lack of diversity at scientific gatherings can lead to micro-aggressions or harassment, making such meetings unpleasant, or even unsafe environments for early career and underrepresented scientists. At the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM), we recognized the need for promoting underrepresented scientists and creating diverse role models in the field of neuroimaging. To foster this, the OHBM has created a Diversity and Inclusivity Committee (DIC). In this article, we review the composition and activities of the DIC that have promoted diversity within OHBM, in order to inspire other organizations to implement similar initiatives. Activities of the committee over the past four years have included (a) creating a code of conduct, (b) providing diversity and inclusivity education for OHBM members, (c) organizing interviews and symposia on diversity issues, and (d) organizing family-friendly activities and providing childcare grants during the OHBM annual meetings. We strongly believe that these activities have brought positive change within the wider OHBM community, improving inclusivity and fostering diversity while promoting rigorous, ground-breaking science. These positive changes could not have been so rapidly implemented without the enthusiastic support from the leadership, including OHBM Council and Program Committee, and the OHBM Special Interest Groups (SIGs), namely the Open Science, Student and Postdoc, and Brain-Art SIGs. Nevertheless, there remains ample room for improvement, in all areas, and even more so in the area of targeted attempts to increase inclusivity for women, individuals with disabilities, members of the LGBTQ+ community, racial/ethnic minorities, and individuals of lower socioeconomic status or from low and middle-income countries. Here, we present an overview of the DIC's composition, its activities, future directions and challenges. Our goal is to share our experiences with a wider audience to provide information to other organizations and institutions wishing to implement similar comprehensive diversity initiatives.

METHODS Data from the Japanese subpopulation in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial were analyzed (data cutoff, February 25, 2017). Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR). RESULTS Among the overall study population of 493 patients, 226 (nivolumab 152; placebo 74) were enrolled from 28 sites in Japan. In the Japanese subset, median OS was longer with nivolumab versus placebo (5.4 months, 95% CI 4.6-7.4 versus 3.6 months, 95% CI 2.8-5.0). The risk of death was lower in the nivolumab versus placebo group (hazard ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.42-0.78; p = 0.0002). Incidences of serious adverse events were 23% (35/152) and 25% (18/72) in the nivolumab and placebo groups, respectively.

METHODS: A 6-member Research Agenda Task Force selected potential research priorities based on a literature search of neuroscience nursing research. Using a 2-round, modified Delphi methodology, electronic surveys were distributed to 53 neuroscience nursing experts to gain consensus on the research priorities for neuroscience nursing. Survey data included demographics, agreement with selected gaps in neuroscience nursing research, and impact of selected neuroscience nursing research topics on the field. RESULTS: Twenty-six of 53 experts (49% response rate) participated in round 1, and 30 of 53 experts (57% response rate) participated in round 2. In round 1, the Research Agenda Task Force members revised the list of gaps in neuroscience nursing research to include only the top 39 ranked topics with greater than or equal to 73% agreement, created a new category \\"Professional Practice Issues,\\" and added 1 additional topic.

BACKGROUND Toronto's severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis resulted in trauma-like effects at hospitals hardest hit by the disease. A systematic examination of the impact on staff working in hospitals that saw relatively few cases, while maintaining the precautions associated with elevated alert levels, has not been undertaken. METHODS A questionnaire was distributed for 1 month commencing 17 April 2003 and 300 completed responses were obtained (approximately one in six staff members). The data collected included demographic and occupational information, in addition to perceptions of SARS' impact on patient care, factors contributing to adverse impacts on patient care, working conditions, decision-making, communication and relations, sources of support, and the impact on workers' lives outside work. Items for these sections were developed by a multi-disciplinary team of health care workers and hospital administrators. RESULTS In the absence of pre-SARS normative data for the survey, demographic and occupational variables were used to look for patterns of differences between relevant subgroups of respondents. Statistically significant differences were found for gender (73.9% women), nurses (24.7%) vs. others, doctors (20.3%) vs. others, older (40 years or older, 60.0%) vs. younger persons, emergency or intensive care unit workers (8.0%) vs. others, and those employed fewer years at the hospital (less than 5 years: 46.2%) vs. five or more years. These differences varied across the following domains: factors adversely affecting patients, communications, support, working conditions, decision-making and, to a lesser extent, impact on life outside work. While all groups found SARS stressful, nurses reported a greater impact on morale and job satisfaction. Nurses relied more on peer support than doctors, felt less informed and less involved in decision-making than doctors felt, and were more likely to report that infection control procedures were not strict enough. CONCLUSIONS The between-group differences and the pattern of these differences clearly illustrate the polarizing and stressful impact SARS had at a hospital with only a small number of probable or suspect cases. The clear differences between groups defined by demographics, professions and clinical roles suggest a subtle and pervasive secondary impact of the SARS outbreak, with repercussions health care facilities must contend with while maintaining increased levels of vigilance in the wake of SARS.","output":"SARS: coping with the impact at a community hospital."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergencies often occur irregularly, such as infectious diseases, earthquakes, wars, floods, the diffusion and leakage of chemically toxic and harmful substances, etc. These emergencies can bring huge disasters to people, even worse, the time left for people to make critical decisions is usually very limited. When an emergency occurs, the most important thing for people is to make reasonable decisions as soon as possible to deal with the current problems, otherwise, the situation may deteriorate further. The paper proposes an emergency decision-making algorithm under the constraints of the limited time and incomplete information, the research is mainly carried out from the following aspects, firstly, we use the data structure of the hesitant fuzzy probabilistic linguistic set to collect the basic data after careful comparison, which has three advantages, (1) considering the hesitation in the decision-making process, each evaluation information is allowed to contain multiple values instead of just one value; (2) each evaluation value is followed by a probability value, which further describes the details of the evaluation information; (3) the data structure allows some probability information to be unknown, which effectively expands the application scope of the algorithm. Secondly, the maximization gap model is proposed to calculate unknown parameters, the model can distinguish alternatives with small differences. Thirdly, all the evaluation information will be aggregated by the dynamic hesitant probability fuzzy weighted arithmetic operator. Subsequently, an instance is given to illustrate the effectiveness and the accuracy of the algorithm proposed in the paper. Finally, the advantages of the proposed algorithm are further demonstrated by comparing it with other outstanding algorithms.

Participants included individuals who were seen at a participating health system in Minnesota. EXPOSURES: Individuals were considered fully vaccinated in the second week after receipt of a second dose of a BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine or a single dose of an Ad26.COV.2.S vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A completed vaccination series and vaccine breakthrough, defined as either a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test or a hospital admission the same week or within the 3 weeks following a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. A test-negative design and incident rate ratio were used to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness separately for the BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and Ad26.COV.2.S vaccines. Rurality and social vulnerability index were assessed at the area level. RESULTS: This study included 4 431 190 unique individuals at participating health systems, and 3 013 704 (68%) of the individuals were fully vaccinated. Vaccination rates were lowest among Minnesotans who identified as Hispanic (116 422 of 217 019 [54%]), multiracial (30 066 of 57 412 [52%]), American Indian or Alaska Native (22 190 of 41 437 [54%]), and Black or African American (158 860 of 326 595 [49%]) compared with Minnesotans who identified as Asian or Pacific Islander (159 999 of 210 994 [76%]) or White (2 402 928 of 3 391 747 [71%]). Among individuals aged 19 to 64 years, vaccination rates were lower in rural areas (196 479 of 308 047 [64%]) compared with urban areas (151 541 of 1 951 265 [77%]) and areas with high social vulnerability (544 433 of 774 952 [70%]) compared with areas with low social vulnerability (571 613 of 724 369 [79%]).

The quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe extraction method (QuEChERS) was applied to the medicinal plants while the dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction procedure (DLLME) was applied to their infusions, and the mycotoxins were determined by liquid chromatography coupled to ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS-IT). The results revealed that ZEA, ENNB, ENNB1, AFB2, AFG1 and AFG2 were detected in the beverages with incidences of &#8804;6% and at concentrations from less than the limit of quantification (LOQ) to 82.2 g/L. Mycotoxins reduction ranged from 74 to 100% after the infusion process. The risk assessment revealed that the estimated daily intakes (EDIs) obtained for ZEA, ENNB and ENNB1 were far below the tolerable daily intakes (TDIs) established.","output":"Risk Assessment and Mitigation of the Mycotoxin Content in Medicinal Plants by the Infusion Process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Artificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly adopted in medical research and applications.

Our results show that, despite numerous vaccinations in the past, further vaccinations are necessary to immunize the population and to keep the number of severe and critical cases low in the coming months. Considering that not all people can or want to receive vaccination, we compare different age-specific vaccination approaches. Applied MethodsWe use the agent-based epidemiological simulator Covasim for discussing the impact of different vaccination strategies. We calibrate it to reproduce the historical course of the COVID-19 pandemic in the city of Aschaffenburg, Germany; for this, we model and integrate numerous public health interventions imposed on the local population. As for some of the political actions rigorous quantification is currently not available, we fit those unknown (free) model parameters to published data on the measured epidemiological dynamics. Then we calculate the state of immunization of the population, gained through infections and vaccinations, at any time in the past, including models for time-dependent immunity decay that have been made available in Covasim. Finally, we define and compare scenarios of different vaccination regimes, especially with regard to vaccinating adolescents and providing booster vaccinations to the elderly. Key messageWithout further vaccinations, we expect a strong increase in severe and critical cases. In order to restrict their growth our simulations suggest that in all considered cases vaccinations of unvaccinated people is more effective than booster vaccinations for already fully vaccinated people. This applies even to vaccinations of young people who are not themselves at high risk of developing severe or critical illness. We attribute this observation to the fact that immunization of adolescents indirectly protects vulnerable age groups by preventing the spread of the virus more effectively than further immunizing other age groups. This indicates that with the pandemic ongoing, strategies focussed on minimizing individual health risks by vaccinations may no longer coincide with those needed to minimize the number of severe and critical cases.","output":"COVID-19 scenarios for comparing the effectiveness of age-specific vaccination regimes, exemplified for the city of Aschaffenburg (Germany)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article presents a new model to predict the evolution of infective diseases under uncertainty or low-quality information, just as it has happened in the initial scenario during the CoVid-19 spread in China and Europe.

Exposure to these ecologically relevant toxicants is prominent in Northern Canadian populations. Previous work focused on toxicant exposure during pregnancy as a threat to fetal neurodevelopment. However, little is known about the individual and combined effects of these toxicants on maternal health during pregnancy and post-partum. Methods: A scoping review was conducted to synthesize the current knowledge regarding individual and combined effects of methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, and organochlorine pesticides on maternal behaviour and the maternal brain. Relevant studies were identified through the PubMed, Embase, and Toxline databases. Literature involving animal models and one human cohort were included in the review. Results: Research findings indicate that exposures to these environmental toxicants are associated with neurochemical changes in rodent models. Animal models provided the majority of information on toxicant-induced alterations in maternal care behaviours. Molecular and hormonal changes hypothesized to underlie these alterations were also addressed, although studies assessing toxicant co-exposure were limited. Conclusion: This review speaks to the limited knowledge regarding effects of these persistent organic pollutants on the maternal brain and related behavioural outcomes. Further research is required to better comprehend any such effects on maternal brain and behaviour, as maternal care is an important contributor to offspring neurodevelopment.","output":"Canadian Arctic Contaminants and Their Effects on the Maternal Brain and Behaviour: A Scoping Review of the Animal Literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral spillover from animal reservoirs can trigger public health crises and cripple the world economy.

The ACE2 protein from R. alcyone engaged all known clade 3 and clade 1 receptor binding domains. We observed little use of Rhinolophus ACE2 orthologs by the clade 2 viruses, supporting the likely use of a separate, unknown receptor.

To evaluate the effects of cryopreservation, the tissue is mechanically characterised in uniaxial tension and the mechanical properties, failure mechanics, and tissue dimensions are compared fresh and following cryopreservation. The mechanical response of the tissue is altered following cryopreservation, yet the elastic modulus from the high stress, linear region of the Cauchy stress - stretch curves is unaffected by the freezing process. To further investigate the change in mechanical response following cryopreservation, the stretch at different tensile stress values was evaluated, which revealed that storage at -20 C is the only protocol that does not significantly alter the mechanical properties of the tissue compared to the fresh samples. Conversely, the ultimate tensile strength and the stretch at failure were relatively unaffected by the freezing process, regardless of the cryopreservation protocol. However, there were alterations to the tissue dimensions following cryopreservation that were significantly different from the fresh samples for the tissue stored at -80 C. Therefore, any study intent on preserving the mechanical, failure, and geometric properties of urethral tissue during cryopreservation should do so by freezing samples at -20 C, as storage at -80 C is shown here to significantly alter the tissue properties.","output":"Cryopreservation of porcine urethral tissue: Storage at -20C preserves the mechanical, failure and geometrical properties."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the current COVID-19 pandemic, we are required to comply with health protocols, especially by reducing activities outside the home or office while there are some activities that are impossible to do in the WFH (work from home) style. as a result we are required to leave the house with some personal protective and safety equipment such as masks and virus hand sanitizers, such as vehicle doors, city bus handles (handlebis) and even elevator buttons, in this study I tried to offer a solution to the spread of Covid through To reduce the use of IoT (Internet technology of Things) which is implemented in the form of Health-based Home Automation & Office Automation, with the help of this technology, all manual devices that must be operated with a touch-based system change.

Diet-induced obese rats were subjected to RYGB, VSG or sham surgical procedures. All animals were assessed for food intake, body-weight, fasting blood, metabolites and hormones profiling, as well as insulin and glucose tolerance tests before and up to 5 weeks post-surgery. Remodeling of gastric tissues was analyzed by routine histology and immunohistochemistry studies, and qRT-PCR analyses of ghrelin and gastrin mRNA levels. In obese rats with impaired glucose tolerance, VSG and RYGB caused substantial weight loss and rats greatly improved their oral glucose tolerance.

Though investigations have reported a strong association with vitamin E acetate (VEA), evidence from reported EVALI cases is not sufficient to rule out the contribution of other chemicals of concern, including chemicals in either THC or non-THC products. This study characterized chemicals evolved when diluent oils were heated to temperatures that mimic e-cigarette, or vaping, products (EVPs) to investigate production of potentially toxic chemicals that might have caused lung injury. VEA, vitamin E, coconut, and medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil were each diluted with ethanol and then tested for constituents and impurities using a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC/MS). Undiluted oils were heated at 25C (control), 150C, and 250C in an inert chamber to mimic a range of temperatures indicative of aerosolization from EVPs. Volatilized chemicals were collected using thermal desorption tubes, analyzed using a GC/MS, and identified. Presence of identified chemicals was confirmed using retention time and ion spectra matching with analytic standards. Direct analysis of oils, as received, revealed that VEA and vitamin E were the main constituents of their oils, and coconut and MCT oils were nearly identical having two main constituents: glycerol tricaprylate and 2-(decanoyloxy) propane-1,3-diyl dioctanoate. More chemicals were measured and with greater intensities when diluent oils were heated at 250C compared to 150C and 25C. Vitamin E and coconut/MCT oils produced different chemical emissions.

The device incorporated LED lights, vibration, a text screen, and an image screen to provide feedback to the worker. All feedback was provided by an administrator who was able to send commands to the respective feedback methods as needed. Early conclusions in the pilot show a difference in the assembly time depending on both the feedback mechanism used and the complexity of the assembled model.

Results showed that 48% of participants reported increased food intake in response to the COVID-19 lockdown. There was large individual variability in reported changes and lower craving control was the strongest predictor of increased HED sweet and savoury food intake. Low cognitive restraint also predicted greater increases in HED sweet snacks and HED savoury meal foods. Food responsiveness, enjoyment of food, emotional undereating, emotional overeating and satiety responsiveness were not significant predictors of changes to HED sweet and savoury food intake. High scores on acceptance coping responses attenuated the conditional effects of craving control on HED sweet snack intake.

However, because the mobile health applications (mHealth) have only been developed recently, the level of evidence supporting the use of mHealth in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) is currently unclear. Therefore, this review aims to list and describe the different mHealth available for rehabilitation and self-assessment of pwMS and to define the level of evidence supporting these interventions for functioning problems categorized within the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). In total, 36 studies, performed with 22 different mHealth, were included in this review, 30 about rehabilitation and six for self-assessment, representing 3091 patients. For rehabilitation, most of the studies were focusing on cognitive function and fatigue. Concerning the efficacy, we found a small but significant effect of the use of mHealth for cognitive training (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) = 0.28 [0.12; 0.45]) and moderate effect for fatigue (SMD = 0.61 [0.47; 0.76]). mHealth is a promising tool in pwMS but more studies are needed to validate these solutions in the other ICF categories.

Dopamine modulates NMDA receptor activity via dopamine D1 and D2 receptor subtypes. It is hypothesized that dopamine focuses on long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity, i.e. reduces diffuse widespread but enhances locally restricted plasticity via a D2 receptor-dependent NMDA receptor activity reduction. Here, we explored NMDA receptor-dependent mechanisms underlying dopaminergic modulation of LTP-like plasticity induced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Eleven healthy, right-handed volunteers received anodal tDCS (1 mA, 13 min) over the left motor cortex combined with dopaminergic agents (the D2 receptor agonist bromocriptine, levodopa for general dopamine enhancement, or placebo) and the partial NMDA receptor agonist D-cycloserine (dosages of 50, 100, and 200 mg, or placebo). Cortical excitability was monitored by transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced motor-evoked potentials. We found that LTP-like plasticity was abolished or converted into LTD-like plasticity via dopaminergic activation, but reestablished under medium-dose D-cycloserine. These results suggest that diffuse LTP-like plasticity is counteracted upon via D2 receptor-dependent reduction of NMDA receptor activity.","output":"NMDA receptor-related mechanisms of dopaminergic modulation of tDCS-induced neuroplasticity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sudden breakout of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) rapidly spread across the globe, leaving no country behind in being affected by the global pandemic in the year 2019C20 As COVID-19 commenced, within months two major Asian giants initiated the norms of social distancing and lockdowns in their societies The indiscriminate nature of the current pandemic has not only impacted the health and quality of life of people but has also disrupted the global economy, supply chains, and countries all over the world In food and beverage manufacturing industries, the unanticipated disruption has encumbered its lock on the global food supply chain and service sector as major cities shut down for several months in China and India Human existence is dependent upon food, which renders energy for activity, growth, and all functions of the body Although both China and India have shown eminent response to tackle the ongoing pandemic, the food supply chain remains vastly exposed to significant COVID-19 risks This research primarily investigates the ongoing COVID-19 scenario in two major economies (China and India), delivering insight into the pandemics impact within the food and beverage manufacturing sectors, and explores the policies adopted and strategies undertaken for sustainability in food supply chains","output":"Investigation of COVID-19 Impact on the Food and Beverages Industry: China and India Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, COVID-19 has spread to almost every corner of the world. In theory, tocilizumab and favipiravir are considered to be reliable drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 with elevated IL-6. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab combined with favipiravir in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a multicenter trial in adults with COVID-19. Patients were randomly assigned (3:1:1) to a 14-day combination of favipiravir combined with tocilizumab (combination group), favipiravir, and tocilizumab. The primary outcome was the cumulative lung lesion remission rate (lung CT examination indicated absorption of lung inflammation). RESULTS: Between Feb 2 and March 15, 2020, 26 patients were recruited; 14 were randomly assigned to the combination group, 7 were assigned to the favipiravir group and 5 were assigned to the tocilizumab group. The cumulative lung lesion remission rate at day 14 was significantly higher in combination group as compared with favipiravir group (P = 0.019, HR 2.66 95% CI [1.08 to 6.53]). And there was also a significant difference between tocilizumab and favipivavir (P = 0.034, HR 3.16, 95% CI 0.62 to 16.10). In addition, there was no significant difference between the combination group and the tocilizumab group (P = 0.575, HR 1.28 95%CI 0.39 to 4.23). Furthermore, combined therapy can also significantly relieve clinical symptoms and help blood routine to return to normal. No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab combined with or without favipiravir can effectively improve the pulmonary inflammation of COVID-19 patients and inhibit the deterioration of the disease.","output":"Tocilizumab combined with favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19: A multicenter trial in a small sample size"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To develop a protocol to ensure the quality of respiratory protective devices for healthcare workers nursing and treating patients with possible or confirmed COVID-19 in the Catharina hospital. BACKGROUND: Due to the COVID-19 outbreak a shortage of respirators is occurring worldwide; more specifically, CE-certified FFP2 respirators. This has resulted in an increased supply to hospitals of alternative respirators of uncertain quality. Nevertheless, the quality of the respirators used by our healthcare workers must be ensured. METHOD: A protocol and criteria based on applicable standards was developed to ensure the quality of respirators. The protocol has been implemented at the Catharina hospital and includes verification of the documents accompanying the respirator, visual inspection of the respirator and a test for total inward leak of particles into respirators. FINDINGS: 67% of the respirators brands and types received in the Catharina hospital did not meet quality criteria. CONCLUSION: With a simple verification protocol the quality of the respirators can be checked and guaranteed while there is a shortage of the CE approved respirators which are normally used. With this in-hospital protocol health care workers can be equipped with safe-to-use respirators.","output":"In hospital verification of non CE-marked respiratory protective devices to ensure safety of healthcare staff during the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM Little information is available on the effect of drilling speed on surrounding bone during the removal of an abutment screw fragment. PURPOSE The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare, in vitro, the peak temperature increase during the removal of fractured abutment screws from implants placed in a porcine mandible, using drilling speeds of 600 or 2000 rpm. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty 4.313-mm dental implants were placed in 10 dissected porcine mandibles: 2 implants per mandible, 1 on each side. Localized defects were created in 20 surface-treated abutment screws, which were then tightened into each implant until a reproducible fracture occurred in each screw. The fractured screws were removed with a handpiece removal kit and irrigated with room-temperature water at either 600 or 2000 rpm. The temperature rise at the implant surface was measured at 3 levels with 3 type-K thermocouples. Repeated measure ANOVA was performed with the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test for mean pair-wise comparisons (=.05 for all tests). RESULTS Mean peak temperatures were significantly higher at 2000 rpm than at 600 rpm in the mid-body (P<.001) and crestal (P=.003) regions but not in the apical (P=.225) implant locations. No significant differences in mean peak temperatures were found among the 3 locations using 600 rpm (P=.179). In the 2000-rpm group, mean peak temperature in the mid-body area was consistently higher than that in the apical (P<.001) area, and more instances of temperature rise above 56C and 60C were observed. In 1 implant from this group, the estimated peak temperature exceeded the bone damage threshold value (50C for 30 seconds). CONCLUSIONS A drilling speed of 2000 rpm during the removal of abutment screw fragments caused overheating of the outer surface of the implant which may damage the surrounding bone; a speed of 600 rpm appears to be safe.","output":"Heat generation during removal of an abutment screw fragment from dental implants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic initiated a period of new and difficult challenges for nursing students.

ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL are coexpressed in specific subsets of respiratory epithelial cells in the nasal passages, airways and alveoli, and in cells from other organs associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission or pathology. We performed a meta-analysis of 31 lung single-cell RNA-sequencing studies with 1,320,896 cells from 377 nasal, airway and lung parenchyma samples from 228 individuals.

Chronic inflammation increases the risk of cancer occurrence and can also drive inflammatory mediators into the tumor microenvironment enhancing tumor growth and survival. The p38 MAPK pathway is activated both acutely and chronically by stress, inflammatory chemokines, chronic inflammatory conditions, and cancer. These properties have led to extensive efforts to find effective drugs targeting p38, which have been unsuccessful. The immediate downstream serine/threonine kinase and substrate of p38 MAPK, mitogen-activated-protein-kinase-activated-protein-kinase-2 (MK2) protects cells against stressors by regulating the DNA damage response, transcription, protein and messenger RNA stability, and motility. The phosphorylation of downstream substrates by MK2 increases inflammatory cytokine production, drives an immune response, and contributes to wound healing. By binding directly to p38 MAPK, MK2 is responsible for the export of p38 MAPK from the nucleus which gives MK2 properties that make it unique among the large number of p38 MAPK substrates. Many of the substrates of both p38 MAPK and MK2 are separated between the cytosol and nucleus and interfering with MK2 and altering this intracellular translocation has implications for the actions of both p38 MAPK and MK2. The inhibition of MK2 has shown promise in combination with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy as a method for controlling cancer growth and metastasis in a variety of cancers. Whereas the current data are encouraging the field requires the development of selective and well tolerated drugs to target MK2 and a better understanding of its effects for effective clinical use.","output":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (MK2) and its role in cell survival, inflammatory signaling, and migration in promoting cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR TKIs) greatly improved clinical outcomes of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Unfortunately, primary and acquired resistance limits their clinical benefits. To overcome such resistance, new generations of EGFR TKIs have been developed by targeting newly identified mutations in EGFR. However, much less effort has been put into alternative strategies, such as targeting the intrinsic protective responses to EGFR TKIs. In this study, we found that EGFR TKIs, including gefitinib and AZD9291, impaired lysosome-dependent degradation of SQSTM1, thus compromising their anti-cancer efficiency. By accumulating in the lysosome lumen, gefitinib and AZD9291 attenuated lysosomal acidification and impaired autolysosomal degradation of SQSTM1 owing to their intrinsic alkalinity. As a result, SQSTM1 protein was stabilized in response to gefitinib and AZD9291 treatment and conferred EGFR TKI resistance. Depleting SQSTM1 significantly increased the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to gefitinib and AZD9291 both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, a chemically modified gefitinib analog lacking alkalinity displayed stronger inhibitory effects on NSCLC cells. Therefore, targeting accumulated SQSTM1 or chemically modified EGFR TKIs may represent new strategies to increase the effectiveness of EGFR targeted therapy.","output":"EGFR TKIs impair lysosome-dependent degradation of SQSTM1 to compromise the effectiveness in lung cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microbes are the most prevalent form of life yet also the least well-understood in terms of their diversity. Due to a greater appreciation of their role in modulating host physiology, microbes have come to the forefront of biological investigation of human health and disease. Despite this, capturing the heterogeneity of microbes, and that of the host responses they induce, has been challenging due to the bulk methods of nucleic acid and cellular analysis. One of the greatest recent advancements in our understanding of complex organisms has happened in the field of single-cell analysis through genomics, transcriptomics, and spatial resolution. While significantly advancing our understanding of host biology, these techniques have only recently been applied to microbial systems to shed light on their diversity as well as interactions with host cells in both commensal and pathogenic contexts.

Furthermore, inflammatory biomarkers have been demonstrated to predict the incidence of cardiovascular events. In spite of this, and with the exception of acetylsalicylic acid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are unable to decrease the incidence of cardiovascular events and may even be harmful to the cardiovascular system.

The upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) were uniformly doped with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) prepolymer and moulded to prepare a flexible upconversion-luminescence substrate, which was further modified with pararosaniline (PRA) dye based on the typical carbodiimide coupling procedure. The principle of the work was based on the inner filter effect (IFE) mechanism between PRA dye and UCNPs. In the presence of target sulfite ions, it selectively binds to PRA moieties fixed on the surface of the flexible sensor, resulting in its bleaching and restoration of the upconversion fluorescence. Under the optimized conditions, a linear response for sulfite concentration in the range of 10-100 nM was obtained. The limit of detection was calculated as 2.24 nM, and the proposed sensor was successfully regenerated and recycled six times.

To date no evidence confirmed COVID-19 vertical transmission from infected pregnant mother to their fetus. However it is well known that an infected mother can transmit the COVID-19 virus through respiratory droplets during breastfeeding or intimate contact. Thus, the mothers with known or suspected COVID-19 should adhere to standard and contact precautions during breastfeeding. Woman Study Group of AMD, after reviewing current knowledge about COVID-19 vertical transmission and the compatibility of breastfeeding in COVID-19 mother, the available recommendations from Health Care Organizations and main experts opinions, issued the following suggestions on breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic, addressed both to mothers with and without diabetes It should be considered that following suggestions may change in the future when more evidence is acquired regarding SARS-Cov2 infection.","output":"Breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic: suggestions on behalf of Woman Study Group of AMD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several seroprevalence studies have been or are currently conducted in order to estimate the infection fatality rate (IFR) of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The IFR is one of the most discussed figures in the context of this pandemic. In contrast to the case fatality rate (CFR), the IFR depends on the total number of infected individuals - not just on the number of confirmed cases. As the mortality of COVID-19 largely increases with age, it is important to take the age distribution of infected individuals into account. Based on the example of Germany, this study illustrates the time-dependent evolution of effective IFR over the course of the pandemic, by combining age-group specific IFR estimates from multiple recent studies worldwide with publicly available German surveillance data. Three different methods for estimating (effective) IFRs are presented: (a) population-averaged IFRs based on the assumption that the infection risk is independent of age and time, (b) effective IFRs based on the assumption that the age distribution of confirmed cases approximately reflects the age distribution of infected individuals, and (c) effective IFRs accounting for age- and time-dependent dark figures of infections. Results for Germany show that effective IFRs are estimated to vary largely over time. A comparison of estimated IFRs with observed CFRs indicates that a substantial fraction of the time-dependent variability in observed mortality can be explained by the evolving age distribution of infections. In addition, the vanishing gap between estimated effective IFR and observed CFR is discussed in light of the assumptions of the analysis. Further research is warranted to obtain timely age-stratified IFR estimates for Germany.","output":"Estimating the evolution of effective infection fatality rates during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The virus which belongs to the family of the coronavirus was seen first in Wuhan city of China. As it spreads so quickly and fastly, now all over countries in the world are suffering from this. The world health organization has considered and declared it a pandemic. In this presented research, we have picked up the existing mathematical model of corona virus which has six ordinary differential equations involving fractional derivative with non-singular kernel and Mittag-Leffler law. Another new thing is that we study this model in a fuzzy environment. We will discuss why we need a fuzzy environment for this model. First of all, we find out the approximate value of ABC fractional derivative of simple polynomial function ( t - a ) n . By using this approximation we will derive and developed the Legendre operational matrix of fractional differentiation for the Mittag-Leffler kernel fractional derivative on a larger interval [ 0 , b ] , b a 1 , b &#8712; N . For the numerical investigation of the fuzzy mathematical model, we use the collocation method with the addition of this newly developed operational matrix. For the feasibility and validity of our method we pick up a particular case of our model and plot the graph between the exact and numerical solutions. We see that our results have good accuracy and our method is valid for the fuzzy system of fractional ODEs.

We describe here the analytical and clinical performance of Vidas SARS-CoV-2 IgM and Vidas SARS-CoV-2 IgG, two CE-marked, emergency use authorization (EUA)-authorized, automated, qualitative assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG, respectively. Both assays showed high within-run and within-laboratory precision (coefficients of variation < 11.0%) and very low cross-reactivity toward sera of patients with a past common coronavirus or respiratory virus infection. Clinical specificity determined on up to 989 prepandemic healthy donors was 99% with a narrow 95% confidence interval for both IgM and IgG assays. Clinical sensitivity was determined on up to 232 samples from 130 reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients. The positive percent agreement (PPA) with SARS-CoV-2 PCR reached 100% at 16 days (Vidas SARS-CoV-2 IgM) and 32 days (Vidas SARS-CoV-2 IgG) of symptom onset. Combined IgM/IgG test results improved the PPA compared to each test alone. SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion followed closely that of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and remained stable over time, while SARS-CoV-2 IgM levels rapidly declined. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG responses were significantly higher in COVID-19 hospitalized versus nonhospitalized patients.

Parosmia is the triggered perception of distorted odours whereas phantosmia is the perception of odours in the absence of a trigger. Both can arise from post-infectious anosmia and have increased substantially since the outbreak of COVID-19. Methodology/Principal: Thematic analysis of a social media support group for parosmia and phantosmia was used to articulate the perspectives and concerns of those affected by these debilitating olfactory disorders. Results: A novel symptom (olfactory perseveration) was identified where a triggered, identifiable, and usually unpleasant olfactory percept persisted in the absence of an ongoing stimulus. Fluctuations in intensity and duration of perseveration, parosmia and phantosmia were observed. Coffee, meat, onion, and toothpaste were identified as common triggers of these disorders, but people struggled to describe the distortions, using words associated with disgust and revulsion. Common strategies to avoid triggers may result in a diet lacking in both nutrition and reward. The emotional aspect of living with qualitative olfactory dysfunction was evident and highlighted the detrimental impact on mental health.

During the month of December 2020, a post-holiday surge of cases led to peak daily average case rates of over 50 cases per 100,000. COVID-19 cases and deaths have since declined substantially following the rollout of COVID-19 vaccine delivery. As of June 8, 2021, about 1,831,588 Dallas County residents have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose and 910,067 are fully vaccinated. Recent county integration of immunization and case databases enabled identification and analysis of COVID-19 breakthrough infections. Methods A COVID-19 breakthrough infection was defined as a positive test (PCR or antigen) collected from an individual  14 days after receiving the full series of an FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine. Nationally, 10,262 vaccine breakthrough infections had been reported from 46 US states and territories, through April 2021. Vaccine breakthrough cases were reviewed and medical records ed to collect demographic information, clinical characteristics, and medical conditions. Data analysis was performed using R, version 4.0.2 (2020). Results Of the 700 vaccine breakthrough cases reported in Dallas County residents as of June 8, 2021, 304 (43%) were male and 396 (57%) female, with an average age of 53 years. The majority of the vaccine breakthrough cases were White (42%);25% were Hispanic/Latino;and 20% were Black. Almost all breakthrough cases were confirmed with PCR testing, with 451 (64%) cases receiving the Pfizer vaccine. Of breakthrough cases, 49% were symptomatic;52% (358) had underlying conditions including: tobacco use, obesity, or immunocompromised state;68 (10%) were hospitalized;and 11 (1.6%) died. Whole genome sequencing was performed on 51 cases, with 14 (27.5%) variants identified, including: eight B.1.1.7, two B.1.429 and one P.1 variants. Conclusion Despite the high levels of vaccine efficacy documented in US vaccine trials, COVID-19 breakthrough infections, though currently uncommon, do occur and are important to investigate.

To establish I/R rat models, the left anterior descending artery (LAD) was ligated for 30 min and re-perfused for 1 h in Lut-pretreated or nude rats. Comparisons between infarct area, cardiac dysfunction, and myocardial cell death and inflammatory reaction were performed in I/R-induced rats. Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) cell models were established by stimulating H9c2 cells with 95% nitrogen and 5% carbon dioxide. Simultaneously, H/R-related cell death and inflammatory reactions were investigated following Lut treatment. The target protein of Lut was identified using western blotting. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were also measured in serum or Lut-pretreated cell culture medium. The results revealed that compared with the I/R group, Lut treatment could significantly decrease myocardial infarction (MI) area, increase left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and decrease cell death and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum. Decreased apoptosis and inflammatory cytokines were also observed in H/R cells after Lut treatment. Lut treatment downregulated SHP-1 expression and subsequently upregulated STAT3 phosphorylation in both I/R rat heart tissue and H9c2 cells. The findings of the current study suggest that Lut can protect the heart and reduce MI area, cell apoptosis rate, and inflammatory level in I/R models.","output":"SHP-1/STAT3 Interaction Is Related to Luteolin-Induced Myocardial Ischemia Protection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, asking how long it might last Focusing on Bahrain, which has a finite population of 1 7M, it aimed to predict the size and duration of the pandemic, which is key information for administering public health policy We compare the predictions made by numerical solutions of variations of the Kermack-McKendrick SIR epidemic model and Tsallis-Tirnakli model with the curve-fitting solution of the Bass model of product adoption The results reiterate the complex and difficult nature of estimating parameters, and how this can lead to initial predictions that are far from reality The Tsallis-Tirnakli and Bass models yield more realistic results using data-driven approaches but greatly differ in their predictions The study discusses possible sources for predictive inaccuracies, as identified during our predictions for Bahrain, the United States, and the world We conclude that additional factors such as variations in social network structure, public health policy, and differences in population and population density are major sources of inaccuracies in estimating size and duration ?

Recently, technology has become available to wirelessly monitor patients on regular surgical wards with continuous pulse oximetry and wireless clinician notification with alarms. When a patient's SpO2 falls below a set threshold, the clinician is notified via a pager and may intervene earlier to prevent further clinical deterioration. To date, the technology has not been evaluated with a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods We designed a parallel-group unblinded pilot RCT of a wireless monitoring system on two surgical wards in an academic teaching hospital. Postsurgical patients with an anticipated length of stay of at least 1 day were included and randomized to standard care or standard care plus wireless respiratory monitoring for up to a 72-h period. The primary outcomes were feasibility outcomes: average patients recruited per week and tolerability of the system by patients. Secondary outcomes included (1) respiratory events (naloxone administration for respiratory depression, ICU transfers, and cardiac arrest team activation) and (2) system alarm types and details. The analysis of the outcomes was based on descriptive statistics and estimates reported using point (95% confidence intervals). Criteria for success of feasibility were recruitment of an average of 15 patients/week and 90% of the patients tolerating the system. Results The pilot trial enrolled 250 of the 335 patients screened for eligibility, with 126 and 124 patients entering the standard monitoring and wireless groups, respectively. Baseline demographics were similar between groups, except for slightly more women in the wireless group. Average patient recruitment per week was 14 95% CI [12, 16] patients. The wireless monitoring was quite tolerable with 86.6% (95% CI 78.2-92.7%) of patients completing the full course, and there were no other adverse events directly attributable to the monitoring. With regard to secondary outcomes, the respiratory event rate was low with only 1 event in the wireless group and none in the control group. The average number of alarms per week was 4.0 (95% CI, 1.6-6.4). Conclusions This pilot study demonstrated adequate patient recruitment and high tolerability of the wireless monitoring system.

However, most MSCs instead of the cell-matrix are cultured in 2 D plates, resulting in degeneration of some key functions along with a limited understanding of the immune response in tissue repairing. Herein, we obtained the human umbilical cord MSCs grown on microcarriers in 3 D suspension culture (3 D hUCMSCs) that proved more appreciative than 2 D hUCMSCs for the ALI therapy. Methods hUCMSCs were isolated and respectively cultured in 2 D plates and 3 D microcarriers in vitro , and acute liver injury model in mice was used to evaluate tissue repairing ability of the transplanted hUCMSCs. Nitric oxide production, cell proliferation and the relative protein expression level were comprehensively evaluated. Besides, the cytokine expression level in the of serum mice was detected by quantitative RT-PCR and cytokine antibody chip. Results When transplanted with 3 D hUCMSCs in ALI mice, the injured liver tissues have a significantly-increased histological scores and enhanced animals body/liver weight, superior to the 2 D hUCMSCs and control group. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1, IL-17, IL-22 and TNF-), apoptosis promoter IFN-g, and NO production declined when transplanted with 3D hUCMSCs compared to the control group. Besides, anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) was up-regulated. Conclusion Both the 3 D hUCMSCs and the conditioned medium were more favorable for the therapy of acute liver injury (ALI). Triple regulatory roles of the 3 D hUCMSCs include the effective promotion of M1/M2 macrophage switch through increased secreting of anti-inflammatory cytokines, ameliorating proliferation and NO downregulation of macrophage. A balance of these cytokines in the conditioned medium of 3 D hUCMSCs played a key role in ALI repairing. It was proven that the 3 D hUCMSCs could trigger the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and STAT3 signaling pathways.

On the other hand, clinical studies have clarified that the COVID-19 clinical burden is mostly due to over-inflammation and immune-mediated multiorgan injury. This has led to downsizing the role of immunosuppression as a determinant of outcome, and early reports confirm the hypothesis that patients undergoing immunosuppressive treatments do not have an increased risk of severe COVID-19 with respect to the general population. Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 natural reservoirs, such as bats and mice, have evolved mechanisms of tolerance involving selection of genes optimizing viral clearance through interferon type I and III responses and also dampening inflammasome response and cytokine expression. Children exhibit resistance to COVID-19 severe manifestations, and age-related features in innate and adaptive response possibly explaining this difference are discussed.

This is in addition to the great need (M = 7.75) among respondents (p <0.05) of the awareness that the tourism sector can contribute to the economic recovery in Algeria after the confinement period. About 75.86% of respondents demand the cleanliness of tourist sites, while 69.95% recommend improving safety because of the size of tourist sites in the Algerian territory and also measures related to social distancing. The results show that 53.69% of respondents preferred the month of August to go on vacation, 29.06% chose the month of September, and 17.25% would prefer the months of October, November and December since they expect a reduction in the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the tourism needs of the Algerian population, which has become increasingly aware of the consequences of the pandemic in relation to their health and on the country's economy. These results can help the authorities of the tourism sector to better understand and identify the tourism needs of this population in the current period and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak on the Tourism Needs of Algerian Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Detection of vascular areas using B-mode ultrasound is required for automated applications such as registration and navigation in medical operations The limitations of Ultrasound imaging are the requirement of sonographers skills, expertise, and also knowledge when making data acquisition It also influences the quality of the images Carotid atherosclerosis can be treated with carotid artery stenting The starting point of needle injection cannot be determined with certainty The position of the arteries is in the body, therefore, determining the starting point of needle injection is done by estimation only and cannot be certainly determined To be able to determine it, the first step needed is to determine the location of the carotid artery We propose a 3D reconstruction of carotid artery using a modified template matching based on ellipse feature to determine it It is processed using the procedure of data acquisition, preprocessing, segmentation, outlier selection of ellipse parameter fitting, visualisation The proposed procedure with preprocessing produces the highest accuracy compared to the template matching method and the Hough Circle method with an accuracy value of 99 41% and has the smallest standard deviation value of 1 05 The best polynomial fitting results for all data is the polynomial equation on 22nd order with the mean error value of 0 26303 ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","output":"3D reconstruction of carotid artery in B-mode ultrasound image using modified template matching based on ellipse feature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Deputy Incidence Manager of the Ebola Crisis Emergency Center in Lagos, Dr Olukayode Oguntimehin (actor uncredited), describes the \\"894 contacts identified and monitored, [the estimated] 18,500 face-to-face visits [ ] to assess Ebola symptom development, [ and the ] massive social mobilization campaign\\" to contain and treat Ebola patients The point of emphasis becomes the number of empty beds in the Yaba facility The number of living surpasses the number of dead, but only because of the responsibility taken by the individuals being remembered at the funeral and by the national and international agencies that supported their efforts Author Biography Allen H Redmon is Professor of English and Film Studies in the Department of Humanities at Texas A & M University Central Texas, where he teaches classes in film studies and adaptation","output":"Just 93 Days, and the Sacrifice, Courage, and Hope that filled those Days"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the government in Kuwait implemented public health measures to control the spread of the virus. However, despite the importance of these restrictions, normal activities related to purchasing of groceries, concerns related to food safety, and overall uncertainty may have influenced food behaviors and food consumption. Hence, the study investigates the impact of COVID-19 on food purchasing behaviors, eating behaviors, and the perception of food safety and security among residents in Kuwait. A cross-sectional study was carried out using self-administered questionnaires between 28 July 2020 and 31 August 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kuwait. A total of 841 respondents participated in the study. The study identified several changes in food purchasing behaviors, eating behaviors, food consumption, and consumers perceptions on food safety during the pandemic. The closures, restrictions, and changes in food purchasing evidently influenced individuals eating behaviors. Largely, participants were found to (i) change their food purchasing behavior (74%);(ii) opt for online food delivery services (42.8%);(iii) purchase long-shelf-life foods (e.g., canned food and dry staples) (76%);(iv) consume more meals at home (76%);and (v) follow public health measures to reduce the spread of the virus and ensure their safety (98%). This study indicates that individuals during times of uncertainty and stress change their food purchasing behaviors, food consumption habits, and follow guidelines and recommendations. These findings may help public health initiatives to focus on raising awareness about the importance of health, wellbeing, and nutrition during times of crises.","output":"The Impact of Coronavirus COVID-19 Pandemic on Food Purchasing, Eating Behavior, and Perception of Food Safety in Kuwait"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of respiratory viral infections (RVI) in persons living with HIV (PLH) admitted with a respiratory complaint using real\\\\time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and primer\\\\independent next\\\\generation sequencing (NGS).

Disease threats to wild snow leopards have not been investigated.Methods and Results: Between 2008 and 2015, twenty snow leopards in the South Gobi desert of Mongolia were captured and immobilised for health screening and radio-collaring. Blood samples and external parasites were collected for pathogen analyses using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), microscopic agglutination test (MAT), and next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques. The animals showed no clinical signs of disease, however, serum antibodies to significant zoonotic pathogens were detected. These pathogens included, Coxiella burnetii, (25% prevalence), Leptospira spp., (20%), and Toxoplasma gondii (20%). Ticks collected from snow leopards contained potentially zoonotic bacteria from the genera Bacillus, Bacteroides, Campylobacter, Coxiella, Rickettsia, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus.Conclusions: The zoonotic pathogens identified in this study, in the short-term did not appear to cause illness in the snow leopards, but have caused illness in other wild felids. Therefore, surveillance for pathogens should be implemented to monitor for potential longer- term disease impacts on this snow leopard population.","output":"Health and zoonotic Infections of snow leopards Panthera unica in the South Gobi desert of Mongolia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Initial reports in May 2009 of the novel influenza strain H1N1pdm estimated a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.6%, similar to that of seasonal influenza. In July 2009, however, Argentina reported 3056 cases with 137 deaths, representing a CFR of 4.5%. Potential explanations for increased CFR included virus reassortment or genetic drift, or infection of a more vulnerable population. Virus genomic sequencing of 26 Argentinian samples representing both severe and mild disease indicated no evidence of reassortment, mutations associated with resistance to antiviral drugs, or genetic drift that might contribute to virulence. Furthermore, no evidence was found for increased frequency of risk factors for H1N1pdm disease. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined nasopharyngeal swab samples (NPS) from 199 cases of H1N1pdm infection from Argentina with MassTag PCR, testing for 33 additional microbial agents. The study population consisted of 199 H1N1pdm-infected subjects sampled between 23 June and 4 July 2009. Thirty-nine had severe disease defined as death (n = 20) or hospitalization (n = 19); 160 had mild disease. At least one additional agent of potential pathogenic importance was identified in 152 samples (76%), including Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 62); Haemophilus influenzae (n = 104); human respiratory syncytial virus A (n = 11) and B (n = 1); human rhinovirus A (n = 1) and B (n = 4); human coronaviruses 229E (n = 1) and OC43 (n = 2); Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2); Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2); Serratia marcescens (n = 1); and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 35) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, n = 6). The presence of S. pneumoniae was strongly correlated with severe disease. S. pneumoniae was present in 56.4% of severe cases versus 25% of mild cases; more than one-third of H1N1pdm NPS with S. pneumoniae were from subjects with severe disease (22 of 62 S. pneumoniae-positive NPS, p = 0.0004). In subjects 6 to 55 years of age, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of severe disease in the presence of S. pneumoniae was 125.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.95, 928.72; p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The association of S. pneumoniae with morbidity and mortality is established in the current and previous influenza pandemics. However, this study is the first to demonstrate the prognostic significance of non-invasive antemortem diagnosis of S. pneumoniae infection and may provide insights into clinical management.","output":"Streptococcus pneumoniae Coinfection Is Correlated with the Severity of H1N1 Pandemic Influenza"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare clinical outcomes following single fraction versus fractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for spinal metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multi-institutional registry was queried for patients with spinal metastases treated with single-fraction or fractionated SBRT. Potential predictive factors of local control (LC) and overall survival were evaluated. Pretreatment and posttreatment Visual Analog Scale scores were analyzed to examine initial and durable pain responses and complete response (CR) rates. Logistic regression was utilized to assess potential correlations between pain response, biologically effective dose (BED), and fractionation. RESULTS: Four hundred sixty-six patients with 514 lesions treated with SBRT were identified; 209 and 104 lesions had information on LC and pain, respectively. The median pain score of patients with symptoms was 6 (range: 3 to 10). The median follow-up was 8.9 months (range: 0.4 to 125.5 mo). Utilizing Karnofsky Performance Score, age, and primary site (lung and/or nonbreast), 1-year overall survival rates were 76.1%, 59.1%, 54.9%, 37.2%, and 23.5% for patients with 0 to 4 of these factors, respectively (P<0.0001). One- and 2-year LC rates were 79.9% and 73.6%, respectively. Eighty-six patients (82.7%) had an initial pain response with a median decline of 3.5 and a CR rate of 47.1%. Sixty-five patients (62.5%) had a durable pain response with a median decline of 2 and a CR rate of 20.2%. Higher initial CR rates were observed with BED1051 Gy10(58.7% vs. 37.9%;P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Following SBRT, encouraging palliative responses with >80% and 60% of patients having initial and durable pain responses, respectively.

The circular cp genome was 154,611 bp long and has a large single-copy region of 88,182 bp and a small single-copy region of 18,713 bp, with the two parts separated by two inverted repeat (IR) regions (23,858 bp each). A total of 131 genes were annotated, including 8 ribosomal RNAs, 39 transfer RNAs, and 84 protein-coding genes (PCGs). In addition, 49 repeat sequences and 55 simple sequence repeat loci of 18 types were also detected. Codon usage analysis demonstrated that the Leu codon is preferential for the A/U ending. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis using 22 Caprifoliaceae species revealed that L. ruprechtiana was closely related to Lonicera insularis. Comparison of IR regions revealed that the cp genome of L. ruprechtiana was largely conserved with that of congeneric species. Moreover, synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) substitution rate analysis showed that most genes were under purifying selection pressure; ycf3, and some genes associated with subunits of NADH dehydrogenase, subunits of the cytochrome b/f complex, and subunits of the photosystem had been subjected to strong purifying selection pressure (Ka/Ks < 0.1).

COVID-19 can present with a variety of different symptoms leading to manifestation of disease ranging from mild cases to a life-threatening condition requiring critical care-level support. At present, a rapid prediction of disease severity and critical care requirement in COVID-19 patients, in early stages of disease, remains an unmet challenge. Therefore, we assessed whether parameters from a routine clinical hematology workup, at the time of hospital admission, can be valuable predictors of COVID-19 severity and the requirement for critical care. Hematological data from the day of hospital admission (day of positive COVID-19 test) for patients with severe COVID-19 disease (requiring critical care during illness) and patients with non-severe disease (not requiring critical care) were acquired. The data were amalgamated and cleaned and modeling was performed. Using a decision tree model, we demonstrated that routine clinical hematology parameters are important predictors of COVID-19 severity. This proof-of-concept study shows that a combination of activated partial thromboplastin time, white cell count-to-neutrophil ratio, and platelet count can predict subsequent severity of COVID-19 with high sensitivity and specificity (area under ROC 0.9956) at the time of the patient's hospital admission. These data, pending further validation, indicate that a decision tree model with hematological parameters could potentially form the basis for a rapid risk stratification tool that predicts COVID-19 severity in hospitalized patients.","output":"Routine Hematological Parameters May Be Predictors of COVID-19 Severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) being a major health crisis in the current times, only a few studies have addressed its potential direct effect on mental health, especially among COVID-19 patients.

Deleterious effect of cytotoxic therapy, related to its immunosuppressive effect, may also be hypothesised. However, postponing or cancelling oncologic treatment, especially in younger patients with advanced and more aggressive tumors may worsen the prognosis. The case of a 39-year-old female patient is presented, who was diagnosed with loco-regionally advanced breast cancer during the pandemic. Primary systemic chemotherapy was started. The patient presented with acute respiratory tract symptoms during the fifth cycle and subsequently SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed. Chemotherapy was cancelled. Symptoms resolved in three days after diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 PCR remained positive up to day 43. Antihormonal therapy was introduced on day 19 and she underwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection on day 51. Chemotherapy was reset postoperatively on day 82 with prophylactic G-CSF protection. No adverse event was observed throughout the treatment. Cytotoxic chemotherapy and surgery can be successfully delivered in breast cancer patients with prolonged asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity, even without negative swab result. Individual optimisation of the therapy may require deviations from standard protocols. Closer multidisciplinary cooperation may contribute to the minimisation of both oncologic and infectious risks.

Scholars have taken two main approaches to explaining outcomes for platform work-precarity, which focuses on employment classification and insecure labor, and technological control via algorithms. Both predict that workers will have relatively common experiences. On the basis of 112 in-depth interviews with workers on seven platforms (Airbnb, TaskRabbit, Turo, Uber, Lyft, Postmates, and Favor) we find heterogeneity of experiences across and within platforms. We argue that because platform labor is weakly institutionalized, worker satisfaction, autonomy, and earnings vary significantly across and within platforms, suggesting dominant interpretations are insufficient. We find that the extent to which workers are dependent on platform income to pay basic expenses rather than working for supplemental income explains the variation in outcomes, with supplemental earners being more satisfied and higher-earning.

To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in the non-Wuhan areas of Hubei Province in China have not been described. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and treatment progress of 91 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Jingzhou Central Hospital. RESULTS: Of the 91 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 30 cases (33.0%) were severe and two patients (2.2%) died. The severe disease group tended to be older (50.5 vs. 42.0 years; p = 0.049) and have more chronic disease (40% vs. 14.8%; p = 0.009) relative to mild disease group. Only 73.6% of the patients were quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-positive on their first tests, while typical chest computed tomography images were obtained for each patient. The most common complaints were cough (n = 75; 82.4%), fever (n = 59; 64.8%), fatigue (n = 35; 38.5%), and diarrhea (n = 14; 15.4%). Non-respiratory injury was identified by elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (n = 18; 19.8%), creatinine (n = 5; 5.5%), and creatine kinase (n = 14; 15.4%) in laboratory tests. Twenty-eight cases (30.8%) suffered non-respiratory injury, including 50% of the critically ill patients and 21.3% of the mild patients. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the mortality rate of patients in Jingzhou was lower than that of Wuhan. Importantly, we found liver, kidney, digestive tract, and heart injuries in COVID-19 cases besides respiratory problems. Combining chest computed tomography images with the qPCR analysis of throat swab samples can improve the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis.","output":"Clinical characteristics of patients with 2019 coronavirus disease in a non-Wuhan area of Hubei Province, China: a retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are crucial in many cellular processes, yet relatively few have been shown to regulate human cardiomyocyte differentiation. Here, we demonstrate an essential role of GATA6 antisense RNA 1 (GATA6-AS1) in cardiomyocyte differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). GATA6-AS1 is adjacent to cardiac transcription factor GATA6. We found that GATA6-AS1 was nuclear-localized and transiently upregulated along with GATA6 during the early stage of cardiomyocyte differentiation. The knockdown of GATA6-AS1 did not affect undifferentiated cell pluripotency but inhibited cardiomyocyte differentiation, as indicated by no or few beating cardiomyocytes and reduced expression of cardiomyocyte-specific proteins. Upon cardiac induction, the knockdown of GATA6-AS1 decreased GATA6 expression, altered Wnt-signaling gene expression, and reduced mesoderm development. Further characterization of the intergenic region between genomic regions of GATA6-AS1 and GATA6 indicated that the expression of GATA6-AS1 and GATA6 were regulated by a bidirectional promoter within the intergenic region. Consistently, GATA6-AS1 and GATA6 were co-expressed in several human tissues including the heart, similar to the mirror expression pattern of GATA6-AS1 and GATA6 during cardiomyocyte differentiation. Overall, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized and functional role of lncRNA GATA6-AS1 in controlling human cardiomyocyte differentiation.","output":"A long non-coding RNA GATA6-AS1 adjacent to GATA6 is required for cardiomyocyte differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients are at high risk for developing severe conditions if other comorbidities are present, such as advanced cancer. Although the regulation of immune response is thought to play an important role in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), physicians often have difficulties in selecting the most appropriate treatment. Furthermore, the impact that interrupting breast cancer treatment due to a COVID-19 infection has on patient outcomes is still unknown. Herein we report a case of advanced breast cancer in a patient whose COVID-19 acute respiratory failure was successfully treated with minimal interruption to their anticancer therapy for recurrent breast cancer. CASE PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old woman developed carcinomatous pleurisy after curative surgery for breast cancer. One month after the initiation of targeted therapy with palbociclib and fulvestrant, the pleural effusion decreased, but soon after she developed a COVID-19 infection. Dexamethasone (8 mg/day) was administered due to a prolonged fever, but her respiratory symptoms got worse and pneumonia appeared on a computed tomography (CT) scan 7 days after hospitalization. Thus, steroid pulse therapy (methylprednisolone 1000 mg/day) was administered for 3 days. Her respiratory condition rapidly improved. Two weeks after hospital discharge, complete regression of pneumonia was confirmed on CT scan, and her targeted therapy was resumed at the same dose and strength. More than 6 months later, her metastatic disease remains stable while on the same treatment. Retrospective analysis of the patient's neutralizing antibodies found the neutralizing activity was low in the early stages of infection, but became high after recovery. This suggests the patient acquired an immunity to SARS-CoV-2 through the infection, despite having a mild myelosuppression due to treatment for recurrent breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Steroid pulse therapy is available worldwide, and may have an important role in cancer patients who develop severe pneumonia from SARS-CoV-2, by enabling them to avoid any long-term disruption to anticancer therapy. Moreover, it might also be useful when antiviral therapies lose their efficacy due to mutations of the virus, such as the Omicron variant. A critical element in cases such as this one is that treatment decisions are made by a team of specialists, including pulmonologists.","output":"Successful treatment with steroid pulse therapy for a COVID-19 case with progressive respiratory failure during treatment for pleural metastasis of breast cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current understanding of airborne pathogen spread in relation to the new methods of suppressing exhaled bioaerosols using safe surface-active materials, such as isotonic saline, is reviewed here.

Vitamin D status can be assessed by measuring serum 25(OH)-vitamin D level with standardized assays. There is a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (25(OH)D < 50 nmol/l (i.e., 20 ng/mL)) or deficiency (25(OH)D < 25 nmol/l (i.e., 10 ng/mL)) in patients with fragility fractures and especially in those with a hip fracture. The evidence on the effects of vitamin D deficiency and/or vitamin D supplementation on fracture healing and material osseointegration is still limited. However, it appears that vitamin D have a rather positive influence on these processes. The fracture liaison service (FLS) model can help to inform orthopedic surgeons, all caregivers, and fractured patients about the importance of optimal vitamin D status in the management of patients with fragility fractures. Therefore, vitamin D status should be included in Capture the Fracture? program as an outcome of FLS in addition to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and specific antiosteoporosis medication. Vitamin D plays a significant role in the pathophysiology and healing of fragility fractures and in rehabilitation after fracture.

The vaccine expresses both the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins using an hAd5 platform with E1, E2b, and E3 sequences deleted (hAd5[E1-, E2b-, E3-]) that is effective even in the presence of hAd5 immunity. In the vaccine, S is modified (S-Fusion) for enhanced cell-surface display to elicit humoral responses and N is modified with an Enhanced T-cell Stimulation Domain (N-ETSD) to direct N to the endosomal/lysosomal pathway to increase MHC I and II presentation. Initial studies using subcutaneous (SC) prime and SC boost vaccination of CD-1 mice demonstrated that the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine elicits T-helper cell 1 (Th1) dominant T-cell and humoral responses to both S and N. We then compared SC to IN prime vaccination with either an SC or IN boost post-SC prime and an IN boost after IN prime. These studies reveal that IN prime/IN boost is as effective at generating Th1 dominant humoral responses to both S and N as the other combinations, but that the SC prime with either an IN or SC boost elicits greater T cell responses. In a third study to assess the power of the two routes of delivery when used together, we used a combined SC plus IN prime with or without a boost and found the combined prime alone to be as effective as the combined prime with either an SC or IN boost in generating both humoral and T-cell responses. The findings here in CD-1 mice demonstrate that combined SC and IN prime-only delivery has the potential to provide broad immunity C including mucosal immunity C against SARS-CoV-2 and supports further testing of this delivery approach in additional animal models and clinical trials.","output":"The Dual-Antigen Ad5 COVID-19 Vaccine Delivered as an Intranasal Plus Subcutaneous Prime Elicits Th1 Dominant T-Cell and Humoral Responses in CD-1 Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: trauma is the leading cause of mortality in individuals less than 45 years. The principles of Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) which is used around the world in resuscitation of trauma patients have been considered to be safe. However, the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected the processes and characteristics of acute trauma patients seen around the world. This study is intended to determine the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the acute trauma patients seen in a Nigerian trauma centre. METHODS: this is a cross-sectional observational study of trauma patients seen in the resuscitation room of the National Hospital trauma centre in Abuja, Nigeria, from 24(th) February,2020 to 3(rd) May, 2020. The participants were consecutive acute trauma patients who were grouped into two: five weeks preceding total lockdown and five weeks of total lockdown. Statistical analysis was done using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 24.0 while results were presented in tables and a figure. RESULTS: a total of 229 patients were recruited into the study with age range 1 to 62 years, mean age of 28  13 and male to female ratio of 3.87. The patient volume reduced by 41.31% during the lockdown. Though motor vehicular crash (MVC) was the predominant mechanism of injury in both groups making up 37.65% and 23.88% respectively, penetrating assault was more during the lockdown period (17.91% versus 6.17%). The lockdown was further associated with more delayed presentation (52.24% versus 48.15%), more referrals (53.73% versus 32.72%), less severe injury score (29.6% versus 56.7%) and no death in the resuscitation room (0% versus 1.85%). CONCLUSION: despite the reduction in the volume of trauma presentations by 41.31%, patients got the required care with less mortality.

It is unknown if measures put in place to reduce the spread of the virus SARS-CoV-2, including the delay of non-urgent patient assessments, resulted in deleterious outcomes for patients with IBD. Therefore, we aimed to determine if delays in endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with an increased risk of adverse IBD outcomes (emergency room, ER presentation, hospitalization, surgery, or escalation of drug therapy). Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed in patients with IBD scheduled for outpatient endoscopies between March and August 2019 and 2020 at two tertiary care centers affiliated with Western University, London, Canada. Data pertaining to endoscopy timing, IBD drug prescription, ER attendance, hospitalization, and surgery were collected. Results A total of 1160 endoscopies (2019, n = 718;2020, n = 442) occurred during the study periods in 669 (2019) and 414 (2020) patients with IBD, respectively. More endoscopies were delayed in 2020 than 2019 (26.7% vs. 9.7%, respectively, P < 0.0001). Endoscopy delay was not associated with an increased risk of an adverse IBD outcome (OR = 1.23, 95%CI = 0.89C1.34, P = 0.20). Fewer adverse IBD outcomes were seen in the 2020 cohort who had endoscopy delays (n = 33/115, 28.7%) versus those without delay (n = 176/299, 58.9%, P < 0.0001). Conclusion More endoscopy delays occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic;however, delays in general were not associated with adverse IBD outcomes, and in particular, endoscopy delays during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with fewer deleterious IBD outcomes, suggesting that patients with IBD in need of urgent endoscopy were appropriately identified.","output":"Short-Term COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Endoscopy Delays Did Not Translate to Deleterious Outcomes for Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter begins by examining the steps that have been taken since the epidemic to safeguard the blood supply.

Furthermore, the costs of collection, processing, and distribution of blood for transfusion should be borne by the public, not individual patients. Another recommendation is to establish an Office for the Control of Pharmaceutical Prices (COPP) within the Department of Health and Human Services to set caps on the prices of blood products, essential drugs, and medical devices.

The vaccination campaign in this specific population could be difficult due to uncertainty about the adverse events following vaccination. We aimed to assessed the COVID-19 vaccination rate, factors associated with unvaccinated status, and the adverse events following vaccination in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. METHODS: This is a retrospective study from Ruijin Hospial (Shanghai, China) on an ongoing prospective cohort designed for long-term survival analysis of decompensated cirrhotic patients who recovered from decompensating events or acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) between 2016 and 2018. We assessed the COVID-19 vaccination rate, the number of doses, type of vaccine, safety data, patient-reported reasons for remaining unvaccinated, factors associated with unvaccinated status, and the adverse events of COVID-19 vaccine. Binary logistic regression was used for identifying factors associated with unvaccinated status. RESULTS: A total of 229 patients with decompensated cirrhosis without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection participated (mean age, 56  12.2 years, 75% male, 65% viral-related cirrhosis). Mode of decompensation were grade II?III ascites (82.5%), gastroesophageal varices bleeding (7.9%), hepatic encephalopathy (7.9%). Eighty-five participants (37.1%) received at least one dose of vaccination (1 dose: n = 1, 2 doses: n = 65, 3 doses: n = 19) while 62.9% remained unvaccinated. Patient-reported reasons for remaining unvaccinated were mainly fear of adverse events (37.5%) and lack of positive advice from healthcare providers (52.1%). The experience of hepatic encephalopathy (OR = 5.61, 95% CI: 1.24C25.4) or ACLF (OR = 3.13, 95% CI: 1.12C8.69) and post-liver transplantation status (OR = 2.47, 95% CI: 1.06C5.76) were risk factors of remaining unvaccinated independent of residential areas. The safety analysis demonstrated that 75.3% had no adverse events, 23.6% had non-severe reactions (20% injection-site pain, 1.2% fatigue, 2.4% rash) and 1.2% had a severe event (development of acute decompensation requiring hospitalization). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with decompensated cirrhosis in eastern China are largely remained at unvaccinated status, particularly those with previous episodes of ACLF or hepatic encephalopathy and liver transplantation recipients. Vaccination against COVID-19 in this population is safe.
