Although it is well established that fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) are an integral component of the immune-stimulating infrastructure of classical secondary lymphoid organs, the role of FRCs in FALC-dependent peritoneal immunity remains unclear. Using FRC-specific gene targeting, we found that FRCs play an essential role in FALC-driven immune responses. Specifically, we report that initiation of peritoneal immunity was governed through FRC activation in a myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88)-dependent manner. FRC-specific ablation of MYD88 blocked recruitment of inflammatory monocytes into FALCs and subsequent CD4+ T cell-dependent B-cell activation and IgG class switching. Moreover, containment of Salmonella infection was compromised in mice lacking MYD88 expression in FRCs, indicating that FRCs in FALCs function as an initial checkpoint in the orchestration of protective immune responses in the peritoneal cavity.","output":"Fibroblastic reticular cells initiate immune responses in visceral adipose tissues and secure peritoneal immunity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has drastically altered our lives in an unprecedented manner, shuttering industries and leaving most of the country in isolation as we adapt to the evolving crisis Orthopedic surgery has not been spared from these effects, with the postponement of elective procedures in an attempt to mitigate disease transmission and preserve hospital resources as the pandemic continues to expand During these turbulent times, it is crucial to understand that although patients' and care-providers' safety is paramount, canceling or postponing essential surgical care is not without consequences and may be irreversibly detrimental to patients' health and quality of life in some cases The optimal solution to how to balance effectively the resumption of standard surgical care while doing everything possible to limit the spread of COVID-19 is undetermined and could include such strategies as social distancing, screening forms and tests, including temperature screening, segregation of inpatient and outpatient teams, proper use of protective gear, and the use of ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) to provide elective, yet ultimately essential, surgical care while conserving resources and protecting the health of patients and health care providers Of importance, these recommendations do not and should not supersede evolving United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and relevant federal, state and local public health guidelines Level of Evidence: Level V Copyright ? 2020 Arthroscopy Association of North America","output":"Recommendations to Optimize the Safety of Elective Surgical Care While Limiting the Spread of COVID-19: Primum Non Nocere"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 presents an existential challenge for millions of people and a generational challenge for the globe.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective, longitudinal cohort study used electronic health records and linked hospital administrative data in England. COPD patients with an AECOPD between July 2012 and May 2016 (index), and who subsequently started MITT within 180 days were eligible. Patients with an AECOPD 6 months prior to index were excluded. HCRU, direct healthcare costs, and AECOPDs were assessed in the following 24-month period for early (30 days) and delayed (31C180 days) MITT initiators. RESULTS: A total of 934 patients were included in the analysis and categorized as early (n=367, 39%) or delayed (n=567, 61%) MITT initiators. Mean patient age was 68.5 years and 53.2% were male. A significantly higher proportion of delayed MITT initiators required 1 outpatient appointment (all-cause) compared with early MITT initiators (87% vs 79%; p=0.0016). A significantly higher proportion of delayed MITT initiators required 1 COPD?related inpatient stay versus early MITT initiators (47% vs 40%; p=0.0262). Over the 24-month follow-up, mean all-cause and COPD-related total healthcare costs were significantly higher in delayed MITT initiators compared with early MITT initiators (all?cause: 11,348 vs 8126; p=0.0011; COPD-related: 7307 vs 4535; p=0.0009).

Flow cytometry was performed to measure the cell pyroptosis. The protein expression levels of syndecan-1 (SDC-1), NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), Caspase-1, and the N-terminal fragment of gasdermin D (GSDMD-N) were measured using Western blotting. Interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- levels in cells were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification was analyzed using the methylated RNA immunoprecipitation assay. NLRP3 activator, nigericin, was used to overexpress NLRP3. LPS treatment significantly enhanced the pyroptosis in 1321N1 cells, increased the levels of TNF-, IL-1?, and IL-6, and decreased the levels of IL-10. The protein expression levels of NLRP3, SDC-1, GSDMD-N, and Caspase-1 were also increased. Emodin treatment decreased the levels of TNF-, IL-1?, IL-6, NLRP3, SDC-1, GSDMD-N, and Caspase-1, while increasing the levels of IL-10 in LPS-treated 1321N1 cells. Nigericin reversed the effects of emodin. Furthermore, emodin upregulated m6A levels in NLRP3 by increasing the expression of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3). Meanwhile, knockdown of METTL3 reversed the effects of emodin on the mRNA expression and stability of NLRP3. Therefore, emodin inhibits the inflammation and pyroptosis of LPS-treated 1321N1 cells by inactivating METTL3-mediated NLRP3 expression.","output":"Emodin relieves the inflammation and pyroptosis of lipopolysaccharide-treated 1321N1 cells by regulating methyltransferase-like 3 -mediated NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter presents a conceptual framework and setting for the book.

The device was evaluated against the Betacoronavirus mouse hepatitis virus-3 strain, and its virucidal capacity was probed as a function of different applied UV-C doses versus different situations concerning irradiation distances. Background: UV-C LEDs are light emitters that offer advantages over low-pressure mercury lamps, such as quasimonochromaticity, lower electrical power consumption, instant on/off with the instant full-power operation, unlimited on/off cycles for disinfection schemes, and a much longer lifetime operation, in addition to portability aspects, as well as UV-C LEDs do not contain heavy metal in its composition such as mercury, found in ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) lamps. Results: This novel device reached a 99.999% elimination rate at a distance of 9 cm at all the tested irradiation times (dose dependence), demonstrating that it took only 30 sec to achieve this inactivation rate. Its virucidal effectivity in rapid virus inactivation was demonstrated. Conclusions: We conclude that the HHUVCS cluster device (p = 280 nm) provides a rapid virucidal effect against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

This article systematically reviews interventions aiming to address gendered stereotypes and norms across several outcomes of gender inequality such as violence against women and sexual and reproductive health, to draw out common theory and practice and identify success factors. Three databases were searched; ProQuest Central, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Articles were included if they used established public health interventions types (direct participation programs, community mobilisation or strengthening, organisational or workforce development, communications, social marketing and social media, advocacy, legislative or policy reform) to shift attitudes and/or behaviour in relation to rigid gender stereotypes and norms. A total of 71 studies were included addressing norms and/or stereotypes across a range of intervention types and gender inequality outcomes, 55 of which reported statistically significant or mixed outcomes. The implicit theory of change in most studies was to change participants' attitudes by increasing their knowledge/awareness of gendered stereotypes or norms. Five additional strategies were identified that appear to strengthen intervention impact; peer engagement, addressing multiple levels of the ecological framework, developing agents of change, modelling/role models and co-design of interventions with participants or target populations. Consideration of cohort sex, length of intervention (multi-session vs single-session) and need for follow up data collection were all identified as factors influencing success. When it comes to engaging men and boys in particular, interventions with greater success include interactive learning, co-design and peer leadership. Several recommendations are made for program design, including that practitioners need to be cognisant of breaking down stereotypes amongst men (not just between genders) and the avoidance of reinforcing outdated stereotypes and norms inadvertently.","output":"Gendered stereotypes and norms: A systematic review of interventions designed to shift attitudes and behaviour."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic poses challenges to healthcare capacity and infrastructure.

Patients have been treated with intravenous immunoglobulins and/or steroids except for 4 patients, which resulted in a significant improvement within 1-8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The increasing number of patients with a similar symptomatology shows a significant relationship between COVID-19 infection and ataxia-myoclonus syndrome. The subacute onset of neurological symptoms after a resolved COVID-19 infection and prominent response to immunotherapy may suggest that the neurological manifestations are immune-mediated. Although recovery is highly possible, it may take several weeks/months, and clinicians should be aware of this diagnosis and the beneficial effects of immunological treatment administered as soon as possible.","output":"Two COVID-19-related video-accompanied cases of severe ataxia-myoclonus syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nephrogenic systemic sibrosis is a progressive disorder occurring in some renal insufficiency patients exposed to gadolinium-based contrast agents (GdBCA). Previous studies demonstrated that the GdBCA Omniscan upregulated several innate immunity pathways in normal differentiated human macrophages, induced rapid nuclear localization of the transcription factor NF-B, and increased the expression and production of numerous profibrotic/proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. To further examine GdBCA stimulation of the innate immune system, cultured human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing one of seven different human TLRs or one of two human nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors were exposed in vitro for 24 h to various GdBCA. The signaling activity of each compound was evaluated by its ability to activate an NF-B-inducible reporter gene. Omniscan and gadodiamide induced strong TLR4- and TLR7-mediated reporter gene activation. The other Gd compounds examined failed to induce reporter gene activation. TLR pathway inhibition using chloroquine or an inhibitor of IL-1R-associated kinases 1 and 4 in normal differentiated human macrophages abrogated Omniscan-induced gene expression. Omniscan and gadodiamide signaling via TLRs 4 and 7 resulted in increased production and expression of numerous proinflammatory/profibrotic cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, including CXCL10, CCL2, CCL8, CXCL12, IL-4, IL-6, TGF-, and vascular endothelial growth factor. These observations suggest that TLR activation by environmental stimuli may participate in the pathogenesis of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and of other fibrotic disorders including systemic sclerosis.","output":"Gadolinium compounds signaling through TLR4 and TLR7 in normal human macrophages: establishment of a proinflammatory phenotype and implications for the pathogenesis of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the wide use of Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism, the first virus naturally infecting this organism was not discovered until six years ago. The Orsay virus and its related nematode viruses have a positive-sense RNA genome, encoding three proteins: CP, RdRP, and a novel  protein that shares no homology with any other proteins.  can be expressed either as a free  or a CP- fusion protein by ribosomal frameshift, but the structure and function of both  and CP- remain unknown. Using a combination of electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, computational and biophysical analyses, here we show that the Orsay  protein forms a ~420-? long, pentameric fiber with an N-terminal -helical bundle, a -stranded filament in the middle, and a C-terminal head domain. The pentameric nature of the  fiber has been independently confirmed by both mass spectrometry and analytical ultracentrifugation. Recombinant Orsay capsid containing CP- shows protruding long fibers with globular heads at the distal end. Mutant viruses with disrupted CP- fibers were generated by organism-based reverse genetics. These viruses were found to be either non-viable or with poor infectivity according to phenotypic and qRT-PCR analyses. Furthermore, addition of purified  proteins to worm culture greatly reduced Orsay infectivity in a sequence-specific manner. Based on the structure resemblance between the Orsay CP- fiber and the fibers from reovirus and adenovirus, we propose that CP- functions as a cell attachment protein to mediate Orsay entry into worm intestine cells.","output":"Structure of a pentameric virion-associated fiber with a potential role in Orsay virus entry to host cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we investigate the impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic on PM2 5 levels in the national capital city Delhi, India PM2 5 and meteorological data from 35 ground-based monitoring stations over Delhi city are utilized for the present study Geographic Information System-based spatial interpolation method was employed to analyse the spatial pattern of PM2 5 from January to April 2020 and compared with that of preceding years (2018C19) The findings indicate that the PM2 5 level has reduced significantly during the lockdown period About 40% of reduction in PM2 5 concentrations is observed when compared to the prelockdown phase Exclusively between 25 March and 30 April, about 94 44% of days were within the NAAQS 24-h standard limit of 60 g/m3 The significant role of meteorology in the dispersal of PM2 5 over Delhi is clear from the correlation analysis A strong negative correlation (r = C0 546) between the Temp and PM2 5 indicates the better dispersion of air pollutants during high-temperature conditions A higher reduction in PM2 5 has been observed in Central, Northern and Eastern parts of the megacity The present study provides insights to policymakers to prepare and implement future policy measures for controlling air pollution levels in the megacity [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Current Science (00113891) is the property of Indian Academy of Sciences and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Ambient fine particulate matter pollution over the megacity Delhi, India: an impact of COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As we live and die through the continuing pandemic, one particular affect that relates us globally is of the dead awaiting their funerary repose Assessing the pandemic, Arif (2020) in an early reflection proposes that we might benefit in our assessment of the ?bio-social? of the pandemic by admitting to the sovereignty of the virus Borrowing this premise, I suggest further that the sovereignty of the virus is acutely manifested in the commingled presence of the living and unreposed dead in the temporary, improvised morgues Although the continuing pandemic is quite unprecedented, it can be partially recognised in knowledges gained in mourning that register how disasters force a ?descent?

Subsequently, data were collated from 508 consumers through an online survey questionnaire in Singapore that was conducted during the early stage of the pandemic, before the onset of the circuit breaker in April 2020. Next, an analysis of the results was done through structural equation modeling. It showed that the effect of the health belief model dimensions (i.e., perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, outcome expectation, cues to action, and self-efficacy) on panic buying is partially mediated by the consumers' perceived scarcity of products.

This systematic review aimed to identify tools to assess physical literacy and its physical, cognitive and affective domains within children aged 7-11.9 years, and to examine the measurement properties, feasibility and elements of physical literacy assessed within each tool. METHODS Six databases (EBSCO host platform, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, Education Research Complete, SPORTDiscus) were searched up to 10th September 2020. Studies were included if they sampled children aged between 7 and 11.9 years, employed field-based assessments of physical literacy and/or related affective, physical or cognitive domains, reported measurement properties (quantitative) or theoretical development (qualitative), and were published in English in peer-reviewed journals. The methodological quality and measurement properties of studies and assessment tools were appraised using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments risk of bias checklist. The feasibility of each assessment was considered using a utility matrix and elements of physical literacy element were recorded using a descriptive checklist. RESULTS The search strategy resulted in a total of 11467 initial results. After full text screening, 11 studies (3 assessments) related to explicit physical literacy assessments. Forty-four studies (32 assessments) were relevant to the affective domain, 31 studies (15 assessments) were relevant to the physical domain and 2 studies (2 assessments) were included within the cognitive domain. Methodological quality and reporting of measurement properties within the included studies were mixed. The Canadian Assessment of Physical Literacy-2 and the Passport For Life had evidence of acceptable measurement properties from studies of very good methodological quality and assessed a wide range of physical literacy elements. Feasibility results indicated that many tools would be suitable for a primary PE setting, though some require a level of expertise to administer and score that would require training. CONCLUSIONS This review has identified a number of existing assessments that could be useful in a physical literacy assessment approach within PE and provides further information to empower researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions when selecting the most appropriate assessment for their needs, purpose and context. The review indicates that researchers and tool developers should aim to improve the methodological quality and reporting of measurement properties of assessments to better inform the field.

Using computational modelling, we examined whether lung injury may be exacerbated in early COVID-19 by assessing the impact of conventional oxygen therapy (COT), high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNOT), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV). METHODS: Using an established multi-compartmental cardiopulmonary simulator, we first modelled COT at a fixed FiO(2) (0.6) with elevated respiratory effort for 30 minutes in 120 spontaneously breathing patients, before initiating HFNOT, CPAP or NIV. Respiratory effort was then reduced progressively over 30 minute intervals. Oxygenation, respiratory effort and lung stress/strain were quantified. Lung-protective mechanical ventilation was also simulated in the same cohort. RESULTS: HFNOT, CPAP, and NIV improved oxygenation compared with conventional therapy, but also initially increased total lung stress and strain. Improved oxygenation with CPAP reduced respiratory effort but lung stress/strain remained elevated for CPAP >5cmH(2)O. With reduced respiratory effort, HFNOT maintained better oxygenation and reduced total lung stress, with no increase in total lung strain. Compared to 10cmH(2)O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), 4cmH(2)O PEEP in NIV reduced total lung stress, but high total lung strain persisted even with less respiratory effort. Lung-protective mechanical ventilation improved oxygenation while minimising lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: The failure of non-invasive ventilatory support to reduce respiratory effort may exacerbate pulmonary injury in patients with early Covid-19 pneumonia. HFNOT reduces lung strain but achieves similar oxygenation to CPAP/NIV. Invasive mechanical ventilation may be less injurious than non-invasive support in patients with high respiratory effort.","output":"Optimising respiratory support for early COVID-19 pneumonia: a computational modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Emergency departments face unforeseen surges in patients classified as low acuity during pandemics such as the coronavirus disease pandemic. Streamlining patient flow using telemedicine in an alternative care area can reduce crowding and promote physical distancing between patients and clinicians, thus limiting personal protective equipment use. This quality improvement project describes critical elements and processes in the operationalization of a telemedicine-enabled drive-through and walk-in garage care system to improve ED throughput and conserve personal protective equipment during 3 coronavirus disease surges in 2020. METHODS: Standardized workflows were established for the operationalization of the telemedicine-enabled drive-through and walk-in garage care system for patients presenting with respiratory illness as quality improvement during disaster. Statistical control charts present interrupted time series data on the ED length of stay and personal protective equipment use in the week before and after deployment in March, July, and November 2020. RESULTS: Physical space, technology infrastructure, equipment, and staff workflows were critical to the operationalization of the telemedicine-enabled drive-through and walk-in garage care system. On average, the ED length of stay decreased 17%, from 4.24 hours during the week before opening to 3.54 hours during the telemedicine-enabled drive-through and walk-in garage care system operation. There was an estimated 25% to 41% reduction in personal protective equipment use during this time.

To monitor for temporal fluctuations in density and abundance, we used a systematic survey design in the southern portion of the Park where jaguars were more recorded when using the random approach. We then conducted two surveys in 2017/18 and 2020. Our 2016/17 random survey revealed that jaguar density (0.11  SE 0.28 individuals/100 km(2)) was the lowest obtained for the species across the Atlantic Forest. We noticed that jaguar density increased three times from 2017/18 (0.55  SE 0.45 individuals/100 km(2)) to 2020 (1.61  SE 0.6 individuals/100 km(2)). Jaguar occupancy and detection probability were 0.40 and 0.08, respectively. The low jaguar occupancy probability was positively associated with smaller distances from lakes and records of potential prey.

Beside the specific pathogenic effect of SARS-CoV-2, incompletely understood deleterious and aberrant host immune responses play critical roles in severe disease. Our objective was to summarise the available information on the pathophysiology of COVID-19. METHODS: Two reviewers independently identified eligible studies according to the following PICO framework: P (population): patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection; I (intervention): any intervention/no intervention; C (comparator): any comparator; O (outcome) any clinical or serological outcome including but not limited to immune cell phenotype and function and serum cytokine concentration. RESULTS: Of the 55 496 records yielded, 84 articles were eligible for inclusion according to question-specific research criteria. Proinflammatory cytokine expression, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), was increased, especially in severe COVID-19, although not as high as other states with severe systemic inflammation. The myeloid and lymphoid compartments were differentially affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection depending on disease phenotype.

Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection showed a high variability across individuals and disease spectrum. Multiparametric algorithms showed variable diagnostic performances in predicting survival, hospitalisation, disease progression or severity, and mortality.

METHOD: This was a single-center, retrospective, cohort study of 1,014 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at the Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China, between February 17 and April 12, 2020. RESULTS: The overall incidence of RM was 2.2%. Compared with patients without RM, those with RM tended to have a higher risk of deterioration. Patients with RM also constituted a greater percentage of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (90.9% vs. 5.3%, P < 0.001) and a greater percentage of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation (86.4% vs. 2.7% P < 0.001). Moreover, patients with RM had laboratory test abnormalities, including the presence of markers of inflammation, activation of coagulation, and kidney injury. Patients with RM also had a higher risk of in-hospital death (P < 0.001). Cox's proportional hazard regression model analysis confirmed that RM indicators, including peak creatine kinase levels > 1,000 IU/L (HR = 6.46, 95% CI: 3.02C13.86) and peak serum myoglobin concentrations > 1,000 ng/mL (HR = 9.85, 95% CI: 5.04C19.28), were independent risk factors for in-hospital death.

Governments are looking for evidence to balance the demand of their citizens to ease some of the restriction, against the fear of a new peak in infections. In this study, we wanted to quantify the relative contribution of mobility restrictions, and that of behavioral changes that occurred already before the lockdowns, on the reduction of transmission during lockdowns in Western countries in early 2020. METHODS: Incidence data of cases and deaths from the first wave of infections for 35 Western countries (32 European, plus Israel, USA and Canada) were analyzed using epidemiological compartment models in a Bayesian framework. Mobility data was used to estimate the timing of changes associated with a lockdown, and was correlated with estimated reductions of Rt. RESULTS: Across all countries, the initial median estimate for Rt was 3.6 (95% IQR 2.4-5.2), and it was reduced to 0.78 (95% IQR 0.58-1.01) during lockdown. 48% (18-65%) of the reduction occurred already in the week before lockdown, with lockdown itself causing the remaining drop in transmission. A lower Rt during lockdown was independently associated with an increased time spent at home (0.21 per 10% more time, p < 0.007), and decreased mobility related to retail and recreation (0.07 per 10% less mobility, p < 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: In a Western population unaware of the risk, SARS-CoV-2 can be highly contagious with a reproduction number R0 > 5. Our results are consistent with evidence that recreational activities (including restaurant and bar visits) enable super-spreading events.

MEASUREMENT AND MAINS RESULTS: Tricuspid annular displacement (TAD) parameters (TAD-septal, TAD-lateral and RV longitudinal shortening fraction [RV-LSF]), RV global longitudinal strain (RV-GLS) and RV free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) were measured using transesophageal echocardiography with a dedicated software and compared to classical RV systolic parameters (RV-FAC, S wave and TAPSE). RV systolic dysfunction was defined as RV-FAC <35%. Twenty-nine consecutive patients with moderate to severe CARDS were included. ACP was diagnosed in 12 patients (41%). 2D-STE parameters were markedly altered in the ACP group, while no significant difference was found between patients with and without ACP for classical RV parameters (RV-FAC, S wave and TAPSE). In the ACP group, RV-LSF (17[14-22]%) had the best correlation with RV-FAC (r=0.79,p<0.001 vs r=0.27, p=0.39 for RVGLS and r=0.28,p=0.39 for RVFWLS). A RV-LSF cut-off value of 17% had a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 86% to identify RV systolic dysfunction.

We performed a secondary analysis on girls and stratified them by age <13 and 13 years old. RESULTS There were 790 patients who made 833 visits for CSA. Victims were predominantly girls (747, 94.8%) and perpetrators were predominantly men (763, 96.6%). The abuse first occurred before the age of 13 years in 315 victims (39.9%). For 468 (59.2%), more than one incident occurred before presentation. Compared to girls 13 years old, girls <13 years old were more frequently abused by a family member (47.7% versus 8.0%, P<0.001) and abused in their own home (55.7% vs 21.0%, P<0.001).

METHODS: All SOT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. Their demographic and clinical data were recorded from the hospital electronic system. Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 stages of disease severity: A= asymptomatic, B=mild, C=moderate, and D=severe. RESULTS: Of the 3052 SOT recipients, 67 were diagnosed with COVID-19. The mean age was 52 years and 69% were male. There were approximately 25% patients in stage A, 28% in stage B, 34% in stage C and 12% in stage D.

These categories were presented to 246 young (18-39 years), middle (40-59 years), and older (60 years and older) English-speaking adults living in the United States who were asked to generate as many category exemplars as possible for each of the 70 categories. In order to understand differences in normative responses, we analyzed these responses a) between age groups within the current sample and b) in comparison to three previously published sets of norms. Experimental studies using such norms typically assume invariance of normative likelihoods across age and historical time. We replicate previous findings such that exemplar frequency correlations suggest moderate stability in generated category members between age groups and cohorts for many, but not all, categories. Further, analyses of rank-order correlations highlight that the traditional measure of typicality may not capture all aspects of typicality, namely that for some categories there is high consistency in the frequency of exemplars across age groups and/or norms, but the ordering of those exemplars differs significantly. We include a cluster analysis to aid in grouping categories based on relative stability across time, cohort, and age groups. These results emphasize the importance of maintaining and updating age-differentiated category norms.","output":"Category norms with a cross-sectional sample of adults in the United States: Consideration of cohort, age, and historical effects on semantic categories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) high contagiousness, it is crucial to identify and promptly isolate COVID-19 patients.

Considering the need to reduce, as much as possible, hospital admission of patients with suspected or confirmed infection, the use of mobile x-ray equipment could represent a safe approach. We picture a potential sequence of events, involving a team composed by a radiographer and a nurse, going to patient's home to perform CXR, nasopharyngeal swab (and, if needed, also a blood sample), with fast radiologist tele-reporting, and resulting patient management approach (home isolation or emergency room admission, when needed).

Methods: : To clarify the relation between antibody measurements and immune protection, we monitored 124 individuals before, during and six months after vaccination with Spikevax (Moderna). Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S1) protein receptor binding domain (S1-AB) and against nucleocapsid antigen were measured by chemiluminescent immunoassay (Roche). Virus-neutralizing activities were determined by surrogate assays (NeutraLISA, Euroimmune;cPass, GenScript). Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture (full virus NT) served as ex-vivo correlate for humoral immunity. Results: : Vaccination responses varied considerably. Six months after 2 nd vaccination, participants still positive for full virus NT were safely discriminated by S1-AB levels 1000 U/ml. The full virus NT-positive fraction of participants with S1-AB levels <1000 U/ml was discriminated by virus-neutralizing activities >70 % as determined by surrogate assays (NeutraLISA or cPas). Participants that were full virus NT-negative and therefore presumably insufficiently immune protected could be identified by the above procedure with a sensitivity of >83 % and a specificity of >95 %. Conclusion: In summary, the described diagnostic tool strategy enables individualized (re-)vaccination schedules based on simple and rapid measurement of serum-based SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Our data apply only to WUHAN-type SARS-CoV-2 virus and the current version of mRNA vaccine from Moderna. Adaptation to other vaccines and more recent SARS-CoV-2 strains will require modification of cut-offs and re-evaluation of sensitivity/specificity.

Emerging evidence suggests that pandemic situations and associated lockdowns have an adverse impact on sleep and mental health. However, prediction of sleep health from sociodemographic characteristics and the publics worry during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic has not been extensively explored so far. Its also unclear whether sleep outcomes mediate the association between worry and mental health during pandemic situations. A web-survey (N = 391) on sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 related worry, sleep health (insomnia and daytime sleepiness), and depression was conducted during the initial 21-days of the COVID-19 stringent lockdown in India. Multiple regression analyses showed that variables, including sex, age, income level, and worry score, contributed to the significant regression equation for insomnia but not for daytime sleepiness. Specifically, the female, younger, lower income, and highly worried populations contributed significantly more than the male, elderly, higher income, and less worried populations, respectively, to the prediction of insomnia. Mediation analyses showed that insomnia, but not daytime sleepiness, fully mediated the relationship between worry score and severity of depressive symptoms. We provide evidence that the female, younger, lower income, and worried populations may be at higher risk for insomnia during pandemic situations. Current evidence gives hope that improving sleep may reduce depressive symptoms during a pandemic situation.

METHODS: We performed genome-wide association analyses within 15 subgroups of breast cancer patients based on prognostic factors, including hormone receptors, tumor grade, age, and type of systemic treatment. Analyses were based on 91,686 female patients of European ancestry from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium, including 7531 breast cancer-specific deaths over a median follow-up of 8.1 years. Cox regression was used to assess associations of common germline variants with 15-year and 5-year breast cancer-specific survival. We assessed the probability of these associations being true positives via the Bayesian false discovery probability (BFDP < 0.15). RESULTS: Evidence of associations with breast cancer-specific survival was observed in three patient subgroups, with variant rs5934618 in patients with grade 3 tumors (15-year-hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] 1.32 [1.20, 1.45], P = 1.4E-08, BFDP = 0.01, per G allele); variant rs4679741 in patients with ER-positive tumors treated with endocrine therapy (15-year-HR [95% CI] 1.18 [1.11, 1.26], P = 1.6E-07, BFDP = 0.09, per G allele); variants rs1106333 (15-year-HR [95% CI] 1.68 [1.39,2.03], P = 5.6E-08, BFDP = 0.12, per A allele) and rs78754389 (5-year-HR [95% CI] 1.79 [1.46,2.20], P = 1.7E-08, BFDP = 0.07, per A allele), in patients with ER-negative tumors treated with chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence of four loci associated with breast cancer-specific survival within three patient subgroups. There was limited evidence for the existence of associations in other patient subgroups. However, the power for many subgroups is limited due to the low number of events. Even so, our results suggest that the impact of common germline genetic variants on breast cancer-specific survival might be limited.","output":"Association of germline genetic variants with breast cancer-specific survival in patient subgroups defined by clinic-pathological variables related to tumor biology and type of systemic treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The electric power grid is a critical societal resource connecting multiple infrastructural domains such as agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing. The electrical grid as an infrastructure is shaped by human activity and public policy in terms of demand and supply requirements. Further, the grid is subject to changes and stresses due to diverse factors including solar weather, climate, hydrology, and ecology. The emerging interconnected and complex network dependencies make such interactions increasingly dynamic, posing novel risks, and presenting new challenges to manage the coupled humanCnatural system. This paper provides a survey of models and methods that seek to explore the significant interconnected impact of the electric power grid and interdependent domains. We also provide relevant critical risk indicators (CRIs) across diverse domains that may be used to assess risks to electric grid reliability, including climate, ecology, hydrology, finance, space weather, and agriculture. We discuss the convergence of indicators from individual domains to explore possible systemic risk, i.e., holistic risk arising from cross-domain interconnections. Further, we propose a compositional approach to risk assessment that incorporates diverse domain expertise and information, data science, and computer science to identify domain-specific CRIs and their union in systemic risk indicators.

METHODS Weekly time-series data of suicide counts for 354 communities in 12 countries during 1986-2016 were analysed. Two-stage analysis was performed. In the first stage, a generalised linear model, including cyclic splines, was used to estimate seasonal patterns of suicide for each community. In the second stage, the community-specific seasonal patterns were combined for each country using meta-regression. In addition, the community-specific seasonal patterns were regressed onto community-level socioeconomic, demographic and environmental indicators using meta-regression. RESULTS We observed seasonal patterns in suicide, with the counts peaking in spring and declining to a trough in winter in most of the countries. However, the shape of seasonal patterns varied among countries from bimodal to unimodal seasonality. The amplitude of seasonal patterns (i.e. the peak/trough relative risk) also varied from 1.47 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33-1.62) to 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01-1.1) among 12 countries. The subgroup difference in the seasonal pattern also varied over countries. In some countries, larger amplitude was shown for females and for the elderly population (65 years of age) than for males and for younger people, respectively. The subperiod difference also varied; some countries showed increasing seasonality while others showed a decrease or little change. Finally, the amplitude was larger for communities with colder climates, higher proportions of elderly people and lower unemployment rates (p-values < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Despite the common features of a spring peak and a winter trough, seasonal suicide patterns were largely heterogeneous in shape, amplitude, subgroup differences and temporal changes among different populations, as influenced by climate, demographic and socioeconomic conditions. Our findings may help elucidate the underlying mechanisms of seasonal suicide patterns and aid in improving the design of population-specific suicide prevention programmes based on these patterns.","output":"Seasonality of suicide: a multi-country multi-community observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of depressive symptom and the factors associated with this condition among urban, semi-urban and rural adolescents in the Dhaka district of Bangladesh.

Several patients with severe COVID-19 infection can develop a coagulopathy according to the ISTH criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) with fulminant activation of coagulation, resulting in widespread microvascular thrombosis and consumption of coagulation factors. We conducted a meta-analysis in order to explore differences in coagulopathy indices in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. An electronic search was performed within PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus electronic databases between December 2019 (first confirmed Covid-19 case) up to April 6th, 2020. The primary endpoint was the difference of D-dimer values between Non-Severe vs Severe disease and Survivors vs Non-Survivors. Furthermore, results on additional coagulation parameters (platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time) were also analyzed. The primary analysis showed that mean d-dimer was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients with non-severe disease than in those with severe (SMD ? 2.15 [? 2.73 to ? 1.56], I(2) 98%, P < 0.0001). Similarly, we found a lower mean d-dimer in Survivors compared to Non-Survivors (SMD ? 2.91 [? 3.87 to ? 1.96], I(2) 98%, P < 0.0001). Additional analysis of platelet count showed higher levels of mean PLT in Non-Severe patients than those observed in the Severe group (SMD 0.77 [0.32 to 1.22], I(2) 96%, P < 0.001). Of note, a similar result was observed even when Survivors were compared to Non-Survivors (SMD 1.84 [1.16 to 2.53], I(2) 97%, P < 0.0001).

It is disappointing that there are no specific drugs until now. The combination of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and western medication seems to be the current more effective treatment strategy for COVID-19 patients in China. In this review, we mainly discussed the relationship between COVID-19 and gut microbiota (GM), as well as the possible impact of TCM combined with western medication on GM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, aiming to provide references for the possible role of GM in TCM against COVID-19. The available data suggest that GM dysbiosis did occur in COVID-19 patients, and the intervention of GM could ameliorate the clinical condition of COVID-19 patients. In addition, TCMs (e.g., Jinhua Qinggan granule, Lianhua Qingwen capsule, Qingfei Paidu decoction, Shufeng Jiedu capsule, Qingjin Jianghuo decoction, Toujie Quwen granules, and MaxingShigan) have been proven to be safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19 in Chinese clinic. Among them, Ephedra sinica, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Bupleurum chinense, Lonicera japonica,Scutellaria baicalensi, and Astragalus membranaceus are common herbs and have a certain regulation on GM, immunity, and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Notably, Qingfei Paidu decoction and MaxingShigan have been demonstrated to modulate GM. Finally, the hypothesis of GM-mediated TCM treatment of COVID-19 is proposed, and more clinical trials and basic experiments need to be initiated to confirm this hypothesis.","output":"Potential Role of Gut Microbiota in Traditional Chinese Medicine against COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first documented case of COVID-19 in the United States occurred on January 30th, 2020.

We report here that NS5A of HCV-1a is cleaved at multiple sites by caspase proteases in transfected cells. Two cleavage sites at positions Asp154 and 248DXXD251 were mapped. Cleavage at Asp154 has been previously recognized as one of the caspase cleavage sites for the NS5A protein of HCV genotype 1b (1, 2) and results in the production of a 17-kDa fragment. The sequence 248DXXD251 is a novel caspase recognition motif for NS5A and is responsible for the production of a 31-kDa fragment. Furthermore, we show that Arg217 is implicated in the production of the previously described 24-kDa product, whose accumulation is affected by both calpain and caspase inhibitors. We also showed that caspase-mediated cleavage occurs in the absence of exogenous proapoptotic stimuli and is not related to the accumulation of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. Interestingly, our data indicate that NS5A is targeted by at least two different caspases and suggest that caspase 6 is implicated in the production of the 17-kDa fragment. Most importantly, we report that, all the detectable NS5A fragments following caspase-mediated cleavage are C-terminal-truncated forms of NS5A and are mainly localized in the cytosol. Thus, in sharp contrast to the current view we found no evidence supporting a role for caspase-mediated cleavage in the transport of the NS5A protein to the nucleus, which could lead to transcriptional activation.","output":"The NS5A protein of the hepatitis C virus genotype 1a is cleaved by caspases to produce C-terminal-truncated forms of the protein that reside mainly in the cytosol."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak caused short-term disruptions in the supply chain of fresh agricultural products (FAPs), which exposed the vulnerability of the existing FAP supply chain. With pandemic control being widely coordinated, the supply chain of FAPs was gradually optimized and improved. However, after the outbreak of COVID-19, achieving an effective supply of FAPs in future pandemics has become a key issue. The present work therefore aimed to construct a three-level supply chain based on the Stackelberg game model, consisting of suppliers, third-party logistics (TPL), and retailers, to guarantee the supply of FAPs. COVID-19 pandemic factors such as virus infection coefficients and pandemic prevention efforts were fully integrated into the model. RESULTS: Compared with the wholesale prices of FAPs, preservation efforts and pandemic prevention efforts have huge impacts on the retail prices of FAPs. When suppliers are in the leading position, the quality assurance effort level is positively correlated with the optimal profit. Compared with this situation, when FAP retailers are in the leading position, TPL providers show higher levels of pandemic prevention effort and FAP preservation effort. With an increase in consumer preference for pandemic prevention, the profits of supply-chain members when FAP retailers are in the leading position will gradually increase. CONCLUSION: This study reveals an effective supply mechanism for FAPs in metropolitan areas during the COVID-19 pandemic and describes the authors' experience of guaranteeing the quality and safety of FAPs for future pandemic cases. ? 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.","output":"Prevention schemes for future fresh agricultural products (FAPs) supply chain: mathematical model and experience of guaranteeing the supply of FAPs during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS To evaluate the effect of a novel method of practical oxygen therapy on physiological parameters related to survival, weaning weight and preweaning mortality of neonatal piglets under commercial farm conditions. METHODS Piglets from hyperprolific sows born with signs of asphyxia, (n=109; <6 on a score of respiration, meconium staining and activity) or very low birth weight (VLBW; n=112; <1.05 kg) were selected for the study. Approximately half of each group (n=55 VLBW piglets and n= 57 piglets with asphyxia) received 100% oxygen immediately after birth using a specially designed facemask for 45 seconds (VLBW) or 1 minute (asphyxiated). Physiological parameters (peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) blood glucose concentration and rectal temperature) were measured before oxygen treatment 5 minutes after birth (SpO2) and 24 hours later (SpO2, blood glucose concentration, temperature). Weight at birth, at 24 hours and at 21 days of age, preweaning mortality, and estimated colostrum intake were also recorded. RESULTS A significant treatment effect on SpO2 was observed (p=0.013 and p<0.001 for VLBW and asphyxiated piglets respectively). VLBW and asphyxiated piglets that received oxygen treatment had higher SpO2 after treatment (measured 5 minutes after birth, 97.7 and 97.8% respectively) compared to immediately after birth (93.3 and 86.8% respectively) while untreated piglets showed no variation. Blood glucose concentrations increased in all piglets between birth and 24 hours of age (p=0.003 and p<0.001 for asphyxiated and VLBW piglets respectively) and this was higher in asphyxiated piglets that received oxygen than those that did not (5.6 (SE 0.2) mmol/L; p<0.05). Estimated colostrum intake was higher in asphyxiated (401.6 (SD 24.4) g/kg) and VLBW (374.9 (SE 23.4 g/kg) piglets that received oxygen than those that did not (273.2 (SE 24.1) g/kg; p<0.001 and 249.0 (SE 22.5) g/kg; p<0.001 respectively). Similarly weight at weaning was higher in asphyxiated (5.8 (SE 0.2) kg) and VLBW (4.9 (SE 0.2) kg) piglets that received oxygen therapy than control animals (4.9 (SE 0.2) kg;=0.005 and 4.1 (SE 0.2) kg; p=0.008 respectively). Furthermore, oxygen treatment markedly reduced preweaning mortality from 9/52 (17%) untreated to 1/57 (1.7%) oxygen-treated piglets suffering asphyxia at birth (p=0.006).

This review article is focused on recent advances in the mechanism, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of hantavirus induced HFRS. The importance of interactions between viral and host factors in the design of therapeutic strategies is discussed. Hantavirus induced HFRS is characterized by thrombocytopenia and proteinuria of varying severities. The mechanism of kidney injury appears immunopathological with characteristic deterioration of endothelial cell function and compromised barrier functions of the vasculature. Although multidisciplinary research efforts have provided insights about the loss of cellular contact in the endothelium leading to increased permeability, the details of the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The epidemiology of hantavirus induced renal failure is associated with viral species and the geographical location of the natural host of the virus. The development of vaccine and antiviral therapeutics is necessary to avoid potentially severe outbreaks of this zoonotic illness in the future. The recent groundbreaking approach to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine has revolutionized the general field of vaccinology and has provided new directions for the use of this promising platform for widespread vaccine development, including the development of hantavirus mRNA vaccine.

Late school start times and remote learning are associated with longer sleep durations. We leveraged a highly variable school schedule adopted after the first SARS-CoV-2 wave in Uruguay to study the influence of a hybrid mode of instruction (in-person/remote) with irregular school start times on adolescents' sleep. METHODS Objective sleep on school nights (120 observations) was determined using accelerometry recordings of 15 high-school students (3 males 15-17 years old). We used mixed-effects regressions to explore the influence of the mode of instruction (in-person/remote) and school start time on adolescents' sleep patterns (onset, end, and duration). RESULTS An irregular individual regime of 2-6 school days per week, either in-person or remote, and with irregular start times (range: 07:30-12:00) were observed during the studied period. Remote learning delayed sleep end by 48  9 min and increased sleep duration by 36  12 min. In addition, 1 h delay in school start time delayed sleep end in 36  4 min and increased sleep duration in 34  5 min. CONCLUSIONS A strong linear association of the mode of instruction and the school start time with participants' sleep was observed: Only waking time was associated with both school start time and mode of instruction, and sleep duration increased when students were taught remotely and when school started later.

In this study, we evaluated the impact of fundoplication on esophageal transit and gastric emptying using scintigraphy studies and related these functional findings to symptomatic outcomes. METHODS A total of 106 consecutive patients (37 women, 69 men) with both preoperative and 6-month postoperative nuclear scintigraphy studies undergoing partial (Toupet) fundoplication at a single institution were analyzed. Primary variables included alterations in esophageal transit and gastric emptying times after fundoplication (1 = rapid; 2 = normal; 3 = mild delay; 4 = severe delay). Symptomatic variables included heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, pulmonary symptoms, and bloating. RESULTS Mean age was 57.2 years. Symptomatic improvement was achieved in 91.5% of patients. Significant reduction of all symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation, pulmonary symptoms, and dysphagia) was noted after fundoplication, except gas bloating (4.7 vs. 20.8%). There were no significant differences in preoperative and postoperative esophageal transit (2.53 vs. 2.52) and gastric emptying (2.13 vs. 2.06) scores after fundoplication. Interestingly, 17% of esophageal transit times and 18% of gastric emptying times improved after fundoplication. However, worsening scores were seen in 16 and 12%, respectively. There was no significant postoperative dysphagia, even in patients with impaired transit times. CONCLUSIONS Nuclear scintigraphic assessment of esophageal transit and gastric emptying are valuable, user-friendly tools to identify and avoid functional motility problems in the setting of fundoplication. These studies seem to be a reasonable alternative to manometry in assessing esophageal function before surgery in this setting. Postoperative symptoms may be related to objective changes in esophageal transit or gastric emptying. The causes may be iatrogenic in nature or related to vagal denervation with associated changes in esophagogastric compliance. Awareness of these physiologic changes may prompt further technical precautions at the time of surgery to avoid vagal injury and also may facilitate postoperative medical management.","output":"The use of esophageal transit and gastric emptying studies in the evaluation of patients undergoing laparoscopic fundoplication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protein side chains are vitally important to many biological processes such as protein-protein interaction.

Resulting uncertainty is reflected in very different decisions on school closures and reopenings across countries. The aim of this longitudinal cohort study is to assess the extent and patterns of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in school-attending children repeatedly. It will examine risk factors for infection, relationship between seropositivity and symptoms, and temporal persistence of antibodies. Additionally, it will include testing of school personnel and parents. Methods and analysis The study (Ciao Corona) will enroll a regionally representative, random sample of schools in the canton of Zurich, where 18% of the Swiss population live. Children aged 5 to 16 years, attending classes in primary and secondary schools are invited. Venous blood and saliva samples are collected for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing after the first wave of infections (June/July 2020), in fall (October/November 2020), and after winter (March/April 2021). Venous blood is also collected for serological testing of parents and school personnel. Bi-monthly questionnaires to children, parents and school personnel cover SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and tests, health, preventive behavior, lifestyle and quality of life information. Total seroprevalence and cumulative incidence will be calculated. Hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression models will account for sensitivity and specificity of the serological test in the analyses and for the complex sampling structure, i.e., clustering within classes and schools. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland (2020-01336). The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and will be made available to study participants and participating schools, the Federal Office of Public Health, and the Educational Department of the canton of Zurich.

Several economists (including some Nobel laureates) have seen these reactions as evidence that stock markets are not fully efficient, while others have emphasized the difficulty of assessing the dramatic flow of information about the pandemic and its economic consequences. In this paper, we assess how stock markets have integrated public information about the COVID-19, the subsequent lockdowns and the policy reactions. Although the COVID-19 shock has been global, not all countries have been impacted in the same way, and they have not reacted in the same way. We take advantage of this strong heterogeneity. We consider a panel of 74 countries with daily information about the health and economic crisis, from January to April 2020. Stock market reaction can be summarized as follows. 1) Stock markets initially ignored the pandemic (until Feb. 21), before reacted strongly to the growing number of infected people (Feb. 23 to Mar. 20), while volatility surged and concerns about the pandemic arose;following the intervention of central banks (Mar. 23 to Apr. 30), however, shareholders no longer seemed troubled by news of the health crisis, and prices rebound all around the world. 2) Country-specific characteristics appear to have had no influence on stock market response. 3) Investors were sensitive to the number of COVID-19 cases in neighbouring but mostly wealthy countries. 4) Credit facilities and government guarantees, lower policy interest rates, and lockdown measures mitigated the decline in domestic stock prices. Overall, these results suggest that stock markets have been less sensitive to each country macroeconomic fundamentals prior the crisis, than to their short-term reaction during the crisis. However, our selected variables explain only a small part of the stock market variations, so it is hard to deny that the link between stock price movements and fundamentals have been anything other than loose.","output":"The Stock Market Is not the Economy?

We performed basal lung analysis and naphthalene exposure studies using wild type (WT), Alkbh8def and Cyp2abfgs-null mice, the latter of which lack the cytochrome P450 enzymes required for naphthalene bioactivation. Under basal conditions, lungs from Alkbh8def mice have increased markers of oxidative stress and decreased thioredoxin reductase protein levels, and have reprogrammed gene expression to differentially regulate stress response transcripts. Alkbh8def mice are more sensitive to naphthalene induced death than WT, showing higher susceptibility to lung damage at the cellular and molecular levels. Further, WT mice develop a tolerance to naphthalene after 3 days, defined as resistance to a high challenging dose after repeated exposures, which is absent in Alkbh8def mice.

While arrhythmias and non-specific ECG alterations are a frequent finding in COVID-19, an analysis of J-wave incidence in acute COVID-19 is lacking. METHODS: A total of 386 patients consecutively, hospitalized due to acute COVID-19 pneumonia were included in this retrospective analysis. Admission ECGs were analyzed, screened for J-waves and correlated to clinical characteristics and 28-day mortality. RESULTS: J-waves were present in 12.2% of patients. Factors associated with the presence of J-waves were old age, female sex, a history of stroke and/or heart failure, high CRP levels as well as a high BMI. Mortality rates were significantly higher in patients with J-waves in the admission ECG compared to the non-J-wave cohort (J-wave: 14.9% vs. non-J-wave 3.8%, p = 0.001). After adjusting for confounders using a multivariable cox regression model, the incidence of J-waves was an independent predictor of mortality at 28-days (OR 2.76 95% CI: 1.15C6.63; p = 0.023).

This can be done by pooling individual samples (in groups, and only test those groups for the presence of a pathogen. The rationale is that if prevalence is low, many of these groups will ideally test negative, clearing all all individuals from such groups, whereas individuals appearing in (ideally few) positive groups will require further screening. Forming those groups in order to minimize testing costs while maintaining good detection is the goal of group testing algorithms. We propose a new framework to form such groups that takes into account various constraints of the testing environment, and which can easily incorporate individualized infection priors. Our solution solves a Bayesian sequential experimental design problem: Given previous group test results, we sample the posterior distribution of infection status vectors using sequential Monte Carlo samplers; these samples are then fed to an optimizer, which seeks to form groups that maximize an information gain if those future tests were to be known. To output marginal probabilities of infection, we use loopy belief propagation as a decoder.

Methods: We used surveillance data on confirmed COVID-19 cases at the level of dissemination area. Gini (co-Gini) coefficients were calculated by CMA based on the proportion of the population in ranks of diagnosed cases and each social determinant using census data (income, education, visible minority, recent immigration, suitable housing, and essential workers) and the corresponding share of cases. Heterogeneity was visualized using Lorenz (concentration) curves. Results: Geographic concentration was observed in all CMAs (half of the cumulative cases were concentrated among 21-35% of each city's population): with the greatest geographic heterogeneity in Ontario CMAs (Gini coefficients, 0.32-0.47), followed by British Columbia (0.23-0.36), Manitoba (0.32), and Quebec (0.28-0.37). Cases were disproportionately concentrated in areas with lower income, education attainment, and suitable housing; and higher proportion of visible minorities, recent immigrants, and essential workers. Although a consistent feature across CMAs was concentration by proportion visible minorities, the magnitude of concentration by social determinants varied across CMAs.

Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and meta-regression was performed. RESULTS: In total, 42 studies enrolling 8,932 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The quality of most included studies was moderate to high. Compared with patients without previously diagnosed CKD, those with CKD had a significantly increased risk of progressing to a severe condition (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.64C3.24) or death (OR 5.11, 95% CI 3.36C7.77). Similarly, compared with patients without AKI, those with AKI had a significantly increased risk of progressing to a severe condition (OR 11.88, 95% CI 9.29C15.19) or death (OR 30.46, 95% CI 18.33C50.59). Compared with patients with previously diagnosed CKD, those with AKI were more likely to progress to a severe condition (pgroup < 0.001, I(2) = 98.3%) and even to death (pgroup < 0.001, I(2) = 96.5%). Age had a significant impact on the association between CKD and disease severity (p = 0.001) but had no impact on the associations between AKI and disease severity (p = 0.80), between CKD and mortality (p = 0.51), or between AKI and mortality (p = 0.86).

During the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, LUS was propagated as a useful instrument in triage and monitoring. We evaluated LUS as a rapid diagnostic triage tool for the management of patients with suspected COVID-19 in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: The study retrospectively enrolled patients with suspected COVID-19, who were admitted from 1st April to 25th of April 2020 to the ED of a tertiary care center in Germany. During clinical work-up, patients underwent LUS and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2. The recorded ultrasound findings were analyzed and judged regarding typical signs of viral pneumonia, blinded for clinical information of the patients. The results were compared with PCR test and chest computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: 2236 patients were treated in the ED during the study period. 203 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using PCR, 135 (66.5%) underwent LUS and 39 (28.9%) of the patients were examined by chest CT scan. 39 (28.9%) of the 135 patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with PCR. In 52 (38.5%) COVID-19 was suspected from the finding of the LUS, resulting in a sensitivity of 76.9% and a specificity of 77.1% compared with PCR results. The negative predictive value reached 89.2%. The findings of the LUS had - compared to a positive chest CT scan for COVID-19 - a sensitivity of 70.6% and a specificity of 72.7%.

People with COVID-19 report a wide range of symptoms, some of which are similar to those of common flu, such as sore throat and rhinorrhea. Additionally, COVID-19 shares many clinical symptoms with severe pneumonia, including fever, fatigue, dry cough, and respiratory distress. Several diagnostic strategies, such as the real-time polymerase chain reaction technique and computed tomography imaging, which are more costly than chest radiography, are employed as diagnostic tools. The purpose of this paper is to describe the role of the d-summable information dimension of X-ray images in differentiating several lesions and lung illnesses better than both fractal and information dimensions. The statistical analysis shows that the d-summable information dimension model better describes the information obtained from the X-ray images. Therefore, it is a more precise measure of complexity than the information and box-counting dimension. The results also show that the X-ray images of COVID-19 pneumonia reveal greater damage than those of tuberculosis, pneumonia, and various lung lesions, where the damage is minor or much focused. Because the d-summable information dimension increases as the image complexity decreases, it could pave the way to formulate a new measure to quantify the lung damage and assist the clinical diagnosis based on the area under the d-summable information model. In addition, the physical meaning of the  parameter in the d-summable information dimension is given. ? 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.","output":"The role of D-summable information dimension in differentiating covid-19 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study was carried out to determine the burnout levels and sleep quality of nurses in the coronavirus disease-2019 process.

Parents had to re-arrange their work, childcare and household obligations. METHODS: We conducted 17 email interviews with mothers having at least one child aged < =6 years. Topics included adjustments to the pandemic situation, views on motherhood and wellbeing. We analysed data through content analysis. RESULTS: We found differing consequences on the wellbeing of the interviewees. One group articulated a deceleration of daily life and increased satisfaction due to doing more justice to their role as mother. Another group felt highly stressed and overloaded. Some expressed having shaky hands and heart palpitations, others felt mentally exhausted. The idea of not being a good mother' was expressed by many, provoking guilt and self-doubt. Most interviewees referred to ideological myths of motherhood, picturing mothers as caring and sacrificial, yet well-organized managers of the family. Norms imposed on working mothers' require their full effort and an ability to manage employers' demands. These conflicting norms reveal tensions between the roles mothers find themselves in, potentially leading to adverse (mental) health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows that myths of good motherhood' act as a perpetuation mechanism of traditional gender roles and increase the social burden many mothers are expected to carry, adding to the challenges the global pandemic brought on families. Negative consequences on (mental) health require mitigation strategies, putting mothers at the centre of Covid-19 response policies.

METHODS: A total of 634 individuals (355 female; median age, 37 years; range, 9-87) were enrolled. Two nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from household (n = 338) and non-household contacts (n = 296) of COVID-19 cases. RAD testing was carried out at the point of care. The RT-PCR test used was the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). RESULTS: Household contacts were tested at a median of 2 days (range, 1-7) after diagnosis of the index case, whereas non-household contacts (n = 296) were tested at a median of 6 days (range, 1-7) after exposure. In total, 79 individuals (12.4%) tested positive by RT-PCR, of whom 38 (48.1%) yielded positive RAD results. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the RAD test was 48.1% (95% CI 37.4-58.9) and 100% (95% CI 99.3-100), respectively.

METHODS: We enrolled all the two thousand KTR followed up in our center in Kuwait and collected the data of all COVID-19-positive KTR (104) from the start of the outbreak till the end of July 2020 and have reported the clinical features, management details, and both patient and graft outcomes. RESULTS: Out of the one hundred and four cases reported, most of them were males aged 49.3  14.7 years. Eighty-two of them needed hospitalization, of which thirty-one were managed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Main comorbidities among these patients were hypertension in 64.4%, diabetes in 51%, and ischemic heart disease in 20.2%. Management strategies included anticoagulation in 56.7%, withdrawal of antimetabolites in 54.8%, calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) withdrawal in 33.7%, the addition of antibiotics in 57.7%, Tocilizumab in 8.7%, and antivirals in 16.3%.

The optimal stent porosity to achieve aneurysm obliteration would allow clinicians to treat aneurysms more effectively. We sought to determine the optimal porosity threshold in an in vitro flow model that would lead to stagnation of flow in an aneurysm. METHODS Using a 3-dimensional (3-D) sidewall aneurysm glass model and a 2-dimensional (2-D) cavity model, we measured the total kinetic energy (TKE) in the cavity and aneurysm using digital particle image velocimetry by adjusting for the surface area of a metal mesh across the cavity. Additionally, we assessed how a gap between the mesh and 2-D cavity impacted circulatory patterns within a cavity. RESULTS In the 3-D aneurysm model, we noted a 90.4% reduction in TKE after placement of a stent. In the 2-D cavity model, we adjusted the porosity between 39.1% and 64.8% and noted a reduction in the TKE by 99.75% and 93.9%, respectively. When there was a gap between the mesh and entry into the cavity, unfavorable circulatory conditions occurred with the development of counterclockwise flow that had increased TKE within the cavity.

KEY MESSAGE The arsenal of regenerative medicine and nephrology consisting of organ transplantation, use of stem cells, cell-free approaches, cell reprogramming strategies, and organ engineering has been enriched by the reconditioning strategy. The latter is based on the recognition of two facts that (a) impairment of diverse cellular organelles contributes to pathogenesis of kidney disease and (b) individual organelles are functionally interactively coupled, which explains the \\"domino effect\\" leading to their dysfunction.

The vast proliferation of wearable devices, such as smartwatches, containing acceleration, rotation, magnetic field sensors, etc., together with the modern technologies of artificial intelligence, such as machine learning and more recently deep-learning, allow the development of accurate applications for recognition and classification of human activities such as: walking, climbing stairs, running, clapping, sitting, sleeping, etc. In this work we evaluate the feasibility of an automatic system, based on current smartwatches, which is able to recognize when a subject is washing or rubbing its hands, in order to monitor parameters such as frequency and duration, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the gesture. Our preliminary results show a classification accuracy of about 95% and of about 94% for respectively deep and standard learning techniques.","output":"Automatic Unstructured Handwashing Recognition using Smartwatch to Reduce Contact Transmission of Pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a new mathematical model to investigate the recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Patients are often extremely frail with multiple comorbidities and so are at high risk of death should they contract COVID-19. This study aims to quantify the effects of COVID-19 on patients presenting with hip fractures to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (NNUH). METHODS: This is a single centre, prospective, observational cohort study of patients over the age of sixty admitted with a hip fracture to NNUH between March 24th and April 22nd, 2020 and comparing them retrospectively with controls in April 2019. Patients were followed up for 30 days; data collected includes demographics, COVID-19 PCR results, date/cause of death and other prognostic indicators. RESULTS: 66 consecutive patients managed for hip fractures were included in the study. 30-day mortality increased from 8.5% in April 2019 to 18.2% in April 2020. The 30-day mortality rate was 80% for those patients who test positive for COVID-19 as an inpatient, and was 13.8% for patients COVID-19 negative and for those who were untested. Those admitted from a healthcare institution were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 and had a higher 30-day mortality (p = 0.04 & p = 0.006, respectively). Suspected COVID-19-positive patients at time of admission had a delayed time to theatre, 46.7 h versus 27.1 h (p = 0.007), however this had no significant effect on mortality (p = 0.7).

In South Korea, there is a training program for mass casualty incidents (MCI) and backup by legal regulations by the Framework Act on the Management of Disasters and Safety. However, there is no program focusing on chemical disasters. Thus, the authors newly created a program, the Chemical-Mass Casualty Incident Response Education Module (C-MCIREM) in September 2019. This was a pilot study to verify the educational effect of the program. Method A pre/post study was conducted of a chemical MCI training program based on simulation. A total of 25 representative and qualified participants were recruited from fire departments, administrative staff of public health centers, and healthcare workers of hospitals in the Gyeonggi-do province of South Korea. They participated in a one-day training program. A knowledge test and confidence survey were provided to participants just before training, and again immediately following the training online. The authors compared improvements of pre/post-test results. In the tabletop drill exercise, quantified qualitative analyses were used to measure the educational effect on the participants. Results In the knowledge test, the mean (standard deviation) scores for all 25 participants at baseline and after training were 41.72 (15.186) and 77.96 (11.227), respectively (p < 0.001). In the confidence survey for chemical MCI response for all 25 participants, all the sub-items concerning personal protective equipment selection, antidote selection, antidote stockpiling and passing on knowledge to colleagues, zone setup and decontamination, and chemical triage were improved compared to the baseline score (p < 0.001). The tabletop exercise represented a prehospital setting and had 11 participants. The self-efficacy qualitative survey showed pre- and post-exercise scores of 64/100 and 84/100 respectively. For a hospital setting exercise, it had 14 participants. The survey showed pre/post-exercise scores of 26/100 and 73/100 respectively. Twenty-two (88%) participants responded to the final satisfaction survey, and their overall mean scores regarding willingness to recommend this training program to others, overall satisfaction with theoretical education, overall satisfaction with tabletop drill simulation, and opinion about whether policymakers need this training were all over 8 out of 10 respectively. Conclusion C-MCIREM, the newly created chemical MCI program, provided effective education to the selected 25 participants among Korean chemical MCI responders in terms of both knowledge and practice at a single pilot trial. Participants were highly satisfied with the educational material and their confidence in disaster preparedness was clearly improved. In order to prove the universal educational effect of this C-MCIREM in the future, more education is needed.","output":"Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Chemical-Mass Casualty Incident Response Education Module (C-MCIREM): A Pilot Simulation Study With a Before and After Design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies, on the airborne transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 and the new CDC guidelines confirming the aerosol transmission of the virus, make immediate attention to the airflow in elevators imperative. While several versions have been thought of for contactless rides, there is little that has been considered for lessening the anticipated viral load in the elevator car.In this paper, a two-step approach is used. The first is the risk assessment, and the second is the risk mitigation through an improved lift car ventilation design. The risk is assessed by computing the probable viral load during the journey in a lift car. It is seen that the ventilation typically provided as per the minimum permissible requirements by codes is inadequate to handle the current situation.The computations show that one-minute exposure, to a coughing high emitter in the lift car, creates a viral load to dangerous levels well above the possible acceptable level of 10,000 virus copies/m3. To come up with the risk mitigation strategies, the required ventilation in the car was computed. The main recommendation suggests the use of forced ventilation using pressure fans and 3 to 6 air changes per minute depending on the operating environment. Such a design will help us achieve our objective of bringing the density of virus copies in the lift car to an acceptable level. A properly designed ventilation system for the elevator car will benefit in both pandemic situations as well as non-pandemic situations.","output":"Elevator (Lift) Car Ventilation Design to Mitigate the Risk of Spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Using an age and gender matched-pair case-control study, we aimed to estimate the long-term prevalence of psychophysical olfactory, gustatory , and chemesthesis impairment at least one year after SARS-CoV-2 infection considering the background of chemosensory dysfunction in non-COVID-19 population. METHODOLOGY: This case-controlled study included 100 patients who were home-isolated for mildly symptomatic COVID-19 between March and April 2020. One control regularly tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection and always tested negative was matched to each case according to gender and age. Chemosensory function was investigated by a comprehensive psychophysical evaluation including ortho- and retronasal olfaction and an extensive assessment of gustatory function. Differences in chemosensory parameters were evaluated through either Fisher's exact test or Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: The psychophysical assessment of chemosensory function took place after a median of 401 days from the first SARS-CoV-2 positive swab. The evaluation of orthonasal smell identified 46% and 10% of cases and controls, respectively, having olfactory dysfunction, with 7% of COVID-19 cases being functionally anosmic. Testing of gustatory function revealed a 27% of cases versus 10% of controls showing a gustatory impairment. Nasal trigeminal sensitivity was significantly lower in cases compared to controls.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis the evidence was evaluated for primary prevention of any viral respiratory tract infection (RTI) such as SARS-CoV-2, through supplementation of nutrients with a recognized role in immune function: multiple micronutrients, vitamin A, folic acid, vitamin B12, C, D, E, beta-carotene, zinc, iron and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. The search produced 15,163 records of which 93 papers (based on 115 studies) met the inclusion criteria, resulting in 199,055 subjects (191,636 children and 7,419 adults) from 37 countries. Sixty-three studies were included in the meta-analyses, which was performed for children and adults separately. By stratifying the meta-analysis by world regions, only studies performed in Asia showed a significant, but heterogeneous protective effect of zinc supplementation on RTIs (RR 0.86, 95%CI 0.7-0.96, I2=79.1%, p=0.000). Vitamin D supplementation in adults significantly decreased the incidence of RTI (RR 0.89, 95%CI 0.79-0.99, p=0.272), particularly in North America (RR 0.82 95%CI 0.68-0.97), but not in Europe or Oceania. Supplementation of nutrients in the general population has either no, or at most a very limited effect on prevention of RTIs. Zinc supplementation appears protective for children in Asia, while vitamin D may protect adults in the USA and Canada.

However, the role of MARC2 in tumor immune microenvironment modification had not previously been investigated. In this study, we found that downregulation of MARC2 was associated with the differentiation of CD4+T cells into regulatory T cells (Tregs). Furthermore, restoring the expression of MARC2 could increase the expression of HLA-C and B2M via PPARA-related lipid metabolism signaling pathways, which could facilitate tumor antigen presentation to the tumor-infiltrating T cells. Additionally, MARC2 expression negatively correlated with several immune checkpoints. The immune checkpoint burden was generated based on 28 MARC2-related immune checkpoints. Patients with a higher immune checkpoint burden were predicted to have a poorer prognosis and a lower level of activated CD8+ T cells. The results showed that expression of the NRES is a prognostic indicator of hepatocellular carcinoma and MARC2 contributes significantly to predict the prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the role that stakeholders involved in COVID-19Crelated data played in managing the pandemic in North Carolina. The study investigated the processes used by organizations throughout the state in using, collecting, and reporting COVID-19 data. METHODS: We used an exploratory qualitative study design to investigate North Carolinas COVID-19 data collection efforts. To better understand these processes, key informant interviews were conducted with employees from organizations that collected COVID-19 data across the state. We developed an interview guide, and open-ended semistructured interviews were conducted during the period from June through November 2020. Interviews lasted between 30 and 45 minutes and were conducted by data scientists by videoconference. Data were subsequently analyzed using qualitative data analysis software. RESULTS: Results indicated that electronic health records were primary sources of COVID-19 data. Often, data were also used to create dashboards to inform the public or other health professionals, to aid in decision-making, or for reporting purposes. Cross-sector collaboration was cited as a major success. Consistency among metrics and data definitions, data collection processes, and contact tracing were cited as challenges.

However, early in the pandemic, those working in frontline public health and clinical care had insufficient time to parse the rapidly evolving evidence and use it for decision-making. Academics in public health and medicine were well-placed to translate the evidence for use by frontline clinicians and public health practitioners. The Novel Coronavirus Research Compendium (NCRC), a group of >60 faculty and trainees across the United States, formed in March 2020 with the goal to quickly triage and review the large volume of preprints and peer-reviewed publications on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and summarize the most important, novel evidence to inform pandemic response. From April 6 through December 31, 2020, NCRC teams screened 54 192 peer-reviewed articles and preprints, of which 527 were selected for review and uploaded to the NCRC website for public consumption. Most articles were peer-reviewed publications (n = 395, 75.0%), published in 102 journals; 25.1% (n = 132) of articles reviewed were preprints. The NCRC is a successful model of how academics translate scientific knowledge for practitioners and help build capacity for this work among students.

Five interdisciplinary case studies addressed zoonotic diseases in African settings: Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Kenya, human African trypanosomiasis in Zambia and Zimbabwe, Lassa fever in Sierra Leone and henipaviruses in Ghana. Each explored how ecological changes and humanCecosystem interactions affect pathogen dynamics and hence the likelihood of zoonotic spillover and transmission, and how socially differentiated peoples interactions with ecosystems and animals affect their exposure to disease. Cross-case analysis highlights how these dynamics vary by ecosystem type, across a range from humid forest to semi-arid savannah; the significance of interacting temporal and spatial scales; and the importance of mosaic and patch dynamics. Ecosystem interactions and services central to different people's livelihoods and well-being include pastoralism and agro-pastoralism, commercial and subsistence crop farming, hunting, collecting food, fuelwood and medicines, and cultural practices. There are synergies, but also tensions and trade-offs, between ecosystem changes that benefit livelihoods and affect disease. Understanding these can inform One Health approaches towards managing ecosystems in ways that reduce disease risks and burdens.

The United States (U.S.) leads the world with 30,291,863 confirmed reported cases and 549,664 deaths as of March 29, 2021 compared to globally confirmed cases at 127,442,926 and 2,787,915 deaths as of March 29, 2021. The U.S. federal government primarily left the response to the virus to individual states, and each implemented varying measures designed to protect health of citizens and the states economic well-being. Unintended consequences of the virus and measures to stop its spread may include decreased physical activity and exercise, shifting access and consumption of food, and lower quality-of-life. Therefore, our primary goal was to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on health and well-being by measuring changes in physical activity, mental health-quality of life, food security and nutrition in adults ages 40 and older. We believed shifts in health behaviors would be more prevalent in minorities, less educated, lower socio-economic status, older adults, and those with underlying health conditions, so a secondary goal was to determine the impact of COVID-19 on these sub-populations. METHODS: We conducted an online survey with 9969 adults 40 years and older between 9 August and 15 September 2020 in urban areas across the four U.S. census regions. The survey included questions about demographic variables, pre-existing health conditions, physical activity, access to food, quality-of-life, and nutritional food status and asked participants to respond with information from pre-pandemic and pandemic conditions. We used paired-sample t-tests to detect changes in variables after the start of the pandemic and Cohens d to determine effect sizes. RESULTS: Our main findings showed a decrease in physical activity since the onset of COVID-19 for minorities and non-minorities. Food security also slightly increased for minorities during the pandemic, but we found no other changes in food security, quality-of-life indicators, or nutritional status of those who responded to this survey. CONCLUSIONS: It is concerning that physical activity declined. Such activity helps maintain physical and mental health, and it is also an important time to socialize for many older adults. In many ways, our data indicate that the older adult population in U.S. cities may be more resilient than expected during the pandemic. However, the pandemic could have negative impacts that we did not detect, either due to the survey instrument or the timing of our survey, so the health and well-being of older adults should continue to be monitored in order to mitigate potential negative impacts.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic-related changes in wellness behavior among older Americans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As eager as many college student\\\\athletes, coaches, staff, and fans may be for the return to competition, it can't happen unless sports officials also return to their highly critical roles.","output":"Sports officials prepare to return to officiating during pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The sign test is one of the most popular nonparametric tests for location problems and allows testing for any quantile of a population However, the common sign test has serious drawbacks such as loss of information by considering solely signs of observations but not their magnitudes, various problems related to handling of ties in the data, and the lack of embedding uncertainty regarding the fraction of underlying quantile To address these issues, we present an extended sign test based on fuzzy categories and fuzzy formulated hypotheses that improves the generality, versatility, and practicability of the common sign test This generalized test procedure is neat in theory and practice and avoids disadvantages that are often associated with fuzzy tests (e g , a considerably higher complexity of the underlying model, a fuzzy test decision, and a possibilistic instead of a probabilistic interpretation of test results) In addition, we perform a comprehensive case study on COVID-19 in HIV-infected individuals with a focus on human body temperature and related measurement problems The results of the study clearly indicate that fuzzy categories and fuzzy hypotheses improve the performance of the sign test","output":"Nonparametric fuzzy hypothesis testing for quantiles applied to clinical characteristics of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is defined as a fever higher than 38.3oC for at least three weeks.

In medicine, cases are identified as those who become ill. During this pandemic, cases have been identified as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test, including approximately 70% who were asymptomatic-this has caused unnecessary anxiety. Individuals more than 65 years old, those affected by obesity, diabetes, asthma, or are immune-depressed owing to cancer and other conditions, are at a higher risk of hospitalization and of dying of COVID-19. Healthy individuals younger than 40 years very rarely die of COVID-19. Estimates of the COVID-19 mortality rate vary because the definition of COVID-19-related deaths varies. Belgium has the highest death rate at 154.9 per 100,000 persons, because it includes anyone who died with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, even those never tested for SARS-CoV-2.

In Accra, some landfill sites are 100 meters from neighborhoods. The aim of this study was to assess the microbial air quality and associated environmental health hazards of landfill sites in selected districts in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. A random sampling method was employed to select sampling sites across the dry and wet seasons from landfills and their corresponding neighborhoods. Results obtained showed a higher total count (CFU/m(3)) of bacteria and fungi in the air at the landfill sites than neighborhoods. Statistically significant variation (p < 0.05) in bacterial and fungal concentrations over two seasons was found for both landfills and neighborhoods. However, bacterial concentrations were significantly higher than fungal concentrations (p < 0.05) across seasons for all locations. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the highest (15.6 %) occurring microbe at both landfill sites and neighborhoods. This was followed by Staphylococcus aureus (12.7%).

In this study, we used the new Quadrature-based model of Respiratory Aerosol and Droplets (QuaRAD) to quantify the efficacy of controls across thousands of scenarios that represent the wide variability in factors governing airborne transmission. We show that, while the efficacy of any individual control was highly variable among scenarios, the combination of universal mask-wearing and distancing of at least 1~m reduced the median risk of initial infection in the susceptible person by 99\\\\% relative to a close (0.5~m), unmasked conversation. Increasing ventilation rates by 4~air changes per hour led to further reductions in the median risk of infection by more than 70\\\\% if the two people were distanced by 2~m or more. The combination of face masks, distancing, and increased ventilation reduced the risk of infection by more than 98\\\\% in more than 95\\\\% of scenarios. These findings suggest that layering controls is highly effective for reducing transmission of airborne pathogens and will be critical for curbing outbreaks of novel viruses in the future.","output":"High efficacy of layered controls for reducing transmission of airborne pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The demographics of the UK population are changing and so is the need for health care. In this Health Policy, we explore the current health of the population, the changing health needs, and future threats to health. Relative to other high-income countries, the UK is lagging on many health outcomes, such as life expectancy and infant mortality, and there is a growing burden of mental illness. Successes exist, such as the striking improvements in oral health, but inequalities in health persist as well. The growth of the ageing population relative to the working-age population, the rise of multimorbidity, and persistent health inequalities, particularly for preventable illness, are all issues that the National Health Service (NHS) will face in the years to come. Meeting the challenges of the future will require an increased focus on health promotion and disease prevention, involving a more concerted effort to understand and tackle the multiple social, environmental, and economic factors that lie at the heart of health inequalities. The immediate priority of the NHS will be to mitigate the wider and long-term health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it must also strengthen its resilience to reduce the impact of other threats to health, such as the UK leaving the EU, climate change, and antimicrobial resistance.","output":"The changing health needs of the UK population."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Due to a high prevalence of chronic non-degenerative diseases, it is suspected that COVID 19 poses a high risk of fatal complications for the Mexican population. The present study aims to estimate the risk factors for hospitalization and death in the Mexican population infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used the publicly available data released by the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Diseases of the Mexican Ministry of Health (Secretara de Salud, SSA). All records of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases were included. Two multiple logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the association between hospitalization and mortality, with other covariables. Data on 10,544 individuals (57.68% men), with mean age 46.4715.62, were analyzed. Men were about 1.54 times more likely to be hospitalized than women (p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.37-1.74); individuals aged 50-74 and &#8805;74 were more likely to be hospitalized than people aged 25-49 (OR 2.05, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.81-2.32, and OR 3.84, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 2.90-5.15, respectively). People with hypertension, obesity, and diabetes were more likely to be hospitalized than people without these comorbidities (p<0.01). Men had more risk of death in comparison to women (OR = 1.53, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.30-1.81) and individuals aged 50-74 and &#8805;75 were more likely to die than people aged 25-49 (OR 1.96, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.63-2.34, and OR 3.74, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 2.80-4.98, respectively). Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes presented in combination conveyed a higher risk of dying in comparison to not having these diseases (OR = 2.10; p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.50-2.93). Hospitalization, intubation and pneumonia entail a higher risk of dying (OR 5.02, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 3.88-6.50; OR 4.27, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 3.26-5.59, and OR = 2.57; p<0.001, 95% C.I. 2.11-3.13, respectively). Our study's main limitation is the lack of information on mild (asymptomatic) or moderate cases of COVID-19.

Secured medical image transmission requires adequate techniques for protecting patient privacy. This study aims at encrypting Coronavirus (COVID-19) images of Computed Tomography (CT) chest scan into cipherimages for secure real-world data transmission of infected patients. Provably safe pseudo-random generators are used for the production of a \\"key-stream\\" to achieve high privacy of patient data. The Blum Blum Shub (BBS) generator is a powerful generator of pseudo-random bit-strings. In this article, a hashing version of BBS, namely Hash-BBS (HBBS) generator, is presented to exploit the benefits of a hash function to reinforce the integrity of extracted binary sequences for creating multiple key-streams. The NIST-test-suite has been used to analyze and verify the statistical properties of resulted key bit-strings of all tested operations. The obtained bit-strings showed good randomness properties; consequently, uniform distributed binary sequence was achieved over the key length. Based on the obtained key-streams, an encryption scheme of four COVID-19 CT-images is proposed and designed to attain a high grade of confidentiality and integrity in transmission of medical data. In addition, a comprehensive performance analysis was done using different evaluation metrics. The evaluation results of this study demonstrated that the proposed key-stream generator outperforms the other security methods of previous studies.

It is unclear if these responses can be further enhanced or sustained with reboosting strategies. Furthermore, despite the challenges involved in MVA manufacture dose de-escalation has not been performed in humans. In this study, healthy volunteers received chimpanzee-derived adenovirus-3 and MVA vaccines encoding the non-structural region of hepatitis C virus (ChAd3-NSmut/MVA-NSmut) 8 weeks apart. Volunteers were then reboosted with a second round of ChAd3-NSmut/MVA-NSmut or MVA-NSmut vaccines 8 weeks or 1-year later. We also determined the capacity of reduced doses of MVA-NSmut to boost ChAd3-NSmut primed T cells. Reboosting was safe, with no enhanced reactogenicity. Reboosting after an 8-week interval led to minimal re-expansion of transgene-specific T cells. However, after a longer interval, T cell responses expanded efficiently and memory responses were enhanced. The 8-week interval regimen induced a higher percentage of terminally differentiated and effector memory T cells. Reboosting with MVA-NSmut alone was as effective as with ChAd3-NSmut/MVA-NSmut. A ten-fold lower dose of MVA (2  10(7)pfu) induced high-magnitude, sustained, broad, and functional Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific T cell responses, equivalent to standard doses (2  10(8) pfu). Overall, we show that following Ad/MVA prime-boost vaccination reboosting is most effective after a prolonged interval and is productive with MVA alone.

A network of confirmed cases can be described as a rooted tree that has a weight of infectious intensity for each edge. Upgrading edges (nodes) can reduce the infectious intensity with contacts by taking prevention measures such as disinfection (treating the confirmed cases, isolating their close contacts or vaccinating the uninfected people). We take the sum of root-leaf distance on a rooted tree as the whole infectious intensity of the tree. Hence, we consider the sum of root-leaf distance interdiction problem by upgrading edges/nodes on trees (SDIPT-UE/N). The problem (SDIPT-UE) aims to minimize the sum of root-leaf distance by reducing the weights of some critical edges such that the upgrade cost under some measurement is upper-bounded by a given value. Different from the problem (SDIPT-UE), the problem (SDIPT-UN) aims to upgrade a set of critical nodes to reduce the weights of the edges adjacent to the nodes. The relevant minimum cost problem (MCSDIPT-UE/N) aims to minimize the upgrade cost on the premise that the sum of root-leaf distance is upper-bounded by a given value. We develop different norms to measure the upgrade cost. Under weighted Hamming distance, we show the problems (SDIPT-UE/N) and (MCSDIPT-UE/N) are NP-hard by showing the equivalence of the two problems and the 0C1 knapsack problem. Under weighted [Formula: see text] norm, we solve the problems (SDIPT-UE) and (MCSDIPT-UE) in O(n) time by transforimg them into continuous knapsack problems. We propose two linear time greedy algorithms to solve the problem (SDIPT-UE) under unit Hamming distance and the problem (SDIPT-UN) with unit cost, respectively. Furthermore, for the the minimum cost problem (MCSDIPT-UE) under unit Hamming distance and the problem (MCSDIPT-UN) with unit cost, we provide two [Formula: see text] time algorithms by the binary search methods.

Amidst a dearth of such data and guided by evidence that nurses in ICUs experience personal, professional and existential issues in similar conditions, a systematic scoping review (SSR) is proposed to evaluate prevailing accounts of physicians facing dying patients in ICUs through the lens of Personhood. Such data would enhance understanding and guide the provision of better support for ICU physicians. METHODS: An SSR adopts the Systematic Evidenced Based Approach (SEBA) to map prevailing accounts of caring for dying patients in ICUs. To enhance the transparency and reproducibility of this process, concurrent and independent use of tabulated summaries, thematic analysis and directed content analysis (Split Approach) is adopted. RESULTS: Eight thousand three hundred fifty-eight abstracts were reviewed from four databases, 474 full-text articles were evaluated, 58 articles were included, and the Split Approach revealed six categories/themes centered around the Innate, Individual, Relational and Societal Rings of Personhood, conflicts in providing end of life care and coping mechanisms employed. CONCLUSION: This SSR suggests that caring for dying patients in ICU impacts how physicians view their personhood. To resolve conflicts within individual concepts of personhood, physicians use prioritization, reframing and rely on accessible, personalized support from colleagues to steer coping strategies.

In this study, we extend the methodology of our novel quantitative framework, the Energy Price Index (EPIC) that represents the average price of energy in the US, to the design, optimization and assessment of energy-intelligent tax policies. The non-availability of actual energy demand and price data for the recent months is addressed with the introduction of a rolling horizon methodology that demonstrates excellent forecasting ability over a testing period of 181 months. The mean absolute percentage error of the initial and the 2nd adjusted EPIC are just 2.71% and 1.02% respectively over this period, with the forecasting framework demonstrating excellent robustness even during the unprecedented pandemic of COVID-19. The same framework can be used to forecast the energy demands for the next four years. Two case studies for energy-intelligent tax policies are presented, investigating parametrically the effects that a gasoline tax hike and a carbon tax could have retrospectively and prospectively. A hypothetical gasoline tax hike of 15 cents per gallon would increase EPIC by 1.6%, with the greatest increase of 3.67% being associated with the transportation sector (TEPIC). This policy would result in an estimated annual average revenue of $20.253 billion. Likewise, a hypothetical incremental carbon tax hike over the next 10 years would lead in substantial reductions in CO2 emissions, while the average price of energy would increase by just $1.5/MMBtu, generating though more than $110 billion in annual revenue. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd","output":"A novel quantitative forecasting framework in energy with applications in designing energy-intelligent tax policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is currently a global health threat attributed to negatively affecting the mental health and well-being of people globally.

Beneficial effects were observed on growth performance in BST compared to SNE broilers. BST treatment alleviated intestinal lesions and increased the villus height/crypt depth ratio. Further, BST broilers showed increased maltase activity in the duodenum compared with SNE chicks, and a significantly decreased caspase-3 protein expression in the jejunum mucosa. Moreover, an increased abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Bifidobacterium beneficial gut bacteria and an altered gut metabolome were observed. Taken together, we demonstrate that the manipulation of microbial gut composition using probiotics may be a promising prevention strategy for SNE by improving the composition and metabolism of the intestinal microbiota, intestinal structure, and reducing inflammation and apoptosis.

In the development cohort (n=3729), we tried to identify factors associated with overall survival and develop a scoring system to predict the overall survival rate by using parameters identified by the Cox proportional hazard regression model with bootstrapping methods. In the validation cohort (n=1865), we evaluated the prediction accuracy using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The score of each variable in the COPS system was rounded off following the log-scaled conversion of the adjusted hazard ratio. RESULTS: Among the 5594 patients included in this analysis, 234 (4.2%) died after receiving a COVID-19 diagnosis. In the development cohort, six parameters were significantly related to poor overall survival: older age, dementia, chronic renal failure, dyspnea, mental disturbance, and absolute lymphocyte count <1000/mm(3). The following risk groups were formed: low-risk (score 0-2), intermediate-risk (score 3), high-risk (score 4), and very high-risk (score 5-7) groups. The COPS system yielded an area under the curve value of 0.918 for predicting the 14-day survival rate and 0.896 for predicting the 28-day survival rate in the validation cohort. Using the COPS system, 28-day survival rates were discriminatively estimated at 99.8%, 95.4%, 82.3%, and 55.1% in the low-risk, intermediate-risk, high-risk, and very high-risk groups, respectively, of the total cohort (P<.001). The length of hospital stay and disease severity were directly associated with overall survival (P<.001), and the hospital stay duration was significantly longer among survivors (mean 26.1, SD 10.7 days) than among nonsurvivors (mean 15.6, SD 13.3 days). CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed predictive COPS system may assist in making risk-adapted decisions for the allocation of medical resources, including intensive care, during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Prognosis Score System to Predict Survival for COVID-19 Cases: a Korean Nationwide Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we present a new method for successfully simulating the dynamics of COVID-19, experimentally focusing on the third wave.

According to this method, accurate simulation of the dynamics of the COVID-19 infected population evolution is accomplished by considering not the total data for the infected population, but successive segments of it. By changing the initial conditions with which each segment of the simulation is produced, we achieve close and detailed monitoring of the evolution of the pandemic, providing a tool for evaluating the overall situation and the fine-tuning of the restrictive measures.

COVID-19 pandemic has favoured the selection of these microorganisms because of the excessive and prolonged use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and the outbreaks related to patient transfer between hospitals and inadequate use of personal protective equipment. Therefore, detection is considered essential for their control. Our aim was to compare conventional phenotypic synergy tests and two lateral flow immunoassays for detecting carbapenemases in Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa. METHODS: We analysed 100 carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli isolates, 80 Enterobacterales and 20 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, (86 isolates producing KPC, NDM, OXA-48, IMP and VIM carbapenemases and 14 non-carbapenemase-producing isolates). We performed a modified Hodge test, boronic acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) synergy tests, and two lateral flow immunoassays: RESIST-4 O.K.N.V (Coris Bioconcept?) and NG Test Carba 5? (NG Biotech?). RESULTS: In total, 76 KPC, 7 VIM, 1 NDM, 1 OXA-48 and 1 isolate coproducing KPC + NDM enzymes were included. The concordance of different methods estimated by Kappa index was 0.432 (Standard error: 0.117), thus showing a high variability with the synergy tests with boronic acid and EDTA and reporting 16 false negatives that were detected by the two immunochromatographic methods.

Invasive mechanical ventilation IMV can support gas exchange in patients failing non-invasive ventilation, but its reported outcome is highly variable between countries. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on IMV for COVID-associated ARDS to study its outcome among different countries. METHODS: CENTRAL, MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were systematically searched up to August 8, 2020. Studies reporting five or more patients with end point outcome for severe COVID 19 infection treated with IMV were included. The main outcome assessed was mortality. Baseline, procedural, outcome, and validity data were systematically appraised and pooled with random-effect methods. Subgroup analysis for different countries was performed. Meta-regression for the effect of study timing and patient age and were tested. Publication bias was examined. This trial was registered with PROSPERO under registration number CRD42020190365. FINDINGS: Our electronic search retrieved 4770 citations, 103 of which were selected for full-text review. Twenty-one studies with a combined population of 37359 patients with COVID-19 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. From this population, 5800 patients were treated by invasive mechanical ventilation. Out of those, 3301 patients reached an endpoint of ICU discharge or death after invasive mechanical ventilation while the rest were still in the ICU. Mortality from IMV was highly variable among the included studies ranging between 21% and 100%. Random-effect pooled estimates suggested an overall in-hospital mortality risk ratio of 0.70 (95% confidence interval 0.608 to 0.797; I2 = 98%). Subgroup analysis according to country of origin showed homogeneity in the 8 Chinese studies with high pooled mortality risk ratio of 0.97 (I2 = 24%, p = 0.23) (95% CI = 0.94C1.00), similar to Italy with a low pooled mortality risk ratio of 0.26 (95% CI 0.08C0.43) with homogeneity (p = 0.86) while the later larger studies coming from the USA showed pooled estimate mortality risk ratio of 0.60 (95% CI 0.43C0.76) with persistent heterogeneity (I2 = 98%, p<0.001). Meta-regression showed that outcome from IMV improved with time (p<0.001). Age had no statistically significant effect on mortality (p = 0.102). Publication bias was excluded by visualizing the funnel plot of standard error, Eggers test with p = 0.714 and Begg&Mazumdar test with p = 0.334. INTERPRETATION: The study included the largest number of patients with outcome findings of IMV in this current pandemic. Our findings showed that the use of IMV for selected COVID 19 patients with severe ARDS carries a high mortality, but outcome has improved over the last few months and in more recent studies. The results should encourage physicians to use this facility when indicated for severely ill COVID-19 patients.","output":"Variation in outcome of invasive mechanical ventilation between different countries for patients with severe COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug discovery campaigns against COVID-19 are beginning to target the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome.

But there is much work to be done in food safety and much more to achieve. It is imperative that while addressing food-safety issues, we should understand the role that the environmental microbiology, public health epidemiology, aerobiology, molecular microbial ecology, occupational health, industrial processes, municipal water quality, and animal health have on food safety. Although it is a difficult task, a concerted effort by industry, academic, and governmental researchers can accomplish the goal. Here we discuss the future directions and applications in the distribution and spread of foodborne hazards, methods for microbial detection and differentiation, intervention strategies for farm pathogen reduction, targeting waste at animal production sites, considerations on antimicrobial resistance, food-safety storage and preparation strategies, food irradiation, new and emerging food-safety hazards, and quantitative microbial food-safety risk assessment. Although this does not comprise an exhaustive list of food-safety issues, these are the areas that, we think, require considerable attention by researchers. Not only we need to strive to improve food safety through new strategies, processes, and applications, but we also need to be flexible and observant to readily handle the new and emerging food-safety problems, whether they are within our borders or global.

Studies indicate that gutClung axis maintains host homeostasis and disease development with the association of immune system, and gut microbiota is involved in the COVID-19 severity in patients with extrapulmonary conditions. Gut microbiota dysbiosis impairs the gut permeability resulting in translocation of gut microbes and their metabolites into the circulatory system and induce systemic inflammation which, in turn, can affect distal organs such as the brain. Moreover, gut microbiota maintains the availability of tryptophan for kynurenine pathway, which is important for both central nervous and gastrointestinal system in regulating inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 infection disturbs the gut microbiota and leads to immune dysfunction with generalized inflammation. It has been known that cytokines and microbial products crossing the blood-brain barrier induce the neuroinflammation, which contributes to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases including neuropathies. Therefore, we believe that both gutClung and gutCbrain axes are involved in COVID-19 severity and extrapulmonary complications. Furthermore, gut microbial dysbiosis could be the reason of the neurologic complications seen in severe COVID-19 patients with the association of dysbiosis-related neuroinflammation.

FINDINGS: The most important critical response was brought from the philosopher and cultural theorist Giorgio Agamben who in the book entitled Where are we now? Epidemic as politics evoked again, known from his previous writings, the figure of bare life. The epidemic restrictions have shown, that humanity no longer believes in anything but bare existence, to be preserved as such at any cost. There were no reliable risk-benefit analysis that took into account all other aspects of human condition except statistical data on positive test results or asymptomatic illness. The concepts of another Italian philosopher Roberto Esposito became more than relevant during pandemic. In his book entitled Immmunitas: the Protection and Negation of Life he assumes that the more we feel at risk of being infiltrated and infected by foreign elements, the more the life of the individual and society closes off within its protective boundaries, reminding us of the situations during lockdowns.

Exposure to role models who lived a zero-waste lifestyle had a self-deflating effect, as this behavior was viewed as less attainable by participants. Regardless of difficulty framing, exposure to role models who reduced their waste enhanced participants perceptions of goal attainability, motivation, and intentions. No interaction effects were found between levels of success and achievement difficulty. Considering covariates, individuals who reported enhanced food waste awareness due to COVID-19 reported higher goal setting intentions. Hence, times of perceived food scarcity may provide an ideal opportunity for promoting food waste reduction and conservation strategies. Results from this study provide guidance for how role model stories can best inspire waste reduction without hindering attainability and motivation.

METHODS: A comprehensive search of peer-review articles was completed using PubMed, GoogleScholar, Scopus, and Web of Science. The search was completed using many key terms including voice, hoarseness, dysphonia, aphonia, cough, singers, and public speakers. The bibliography from each article found was searched to find additional articles. The search process revealed 56 peer-reviewed articles, 18 primary articles, ranging from the years 2019 to 2020. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has had a major impact on singers and other musicians worldwide. It can affect the voice and can lead to paresis/paralysis of laryngeal nerves to long-term changes in respiratory function. There is a risk from aerosolization/droplet formation transmission with singing, and with playing wind and brass instruments that can be mitigated by following COVID-19 guidelines. Ways to reduce possible transmission during singing and instrument play include virtual rehearsals or performances, mask-wearing, instrument covers, smaller choirs, performing outside, excellent ventilation being socially distanced, shorter rehearsals, regularly cleaning commonly touched surfaces and washing hands, avoiding contact with others, and temperature screening.","output":"COVID-19: Impact on the Musician and Returning to Singing; A Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Policies for tourism recovery are highly instrumental in achieving tourism development after the outbreak of COVID-19.

Nidoviruses employ a complex RNA-synthesizing machinery comprising a variety of non-structural proteins (nsps). One of the postulated drivers of the expansion of nidovirus genomes is the presence of a proofreading 3-to-5 exoribonuclease (ExoN) belonging to the DEDDh family. ExoN may enhance the fidelity of RNA synthesis by correcting nucleotide incorporation errors made by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Here, we review our current understanding of ExoN evolution, structure, and function. Most experimental data are derived from studies of the ExoN domain of coronaviruses (CoVs), which were triggered by the bioinformatics-based identification of ExoN in the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and its relatives in 2003. Although convincing data supporting the proofreading hypothesis have been obtained, from biochemical assays and studies with CoV mutants lacking ExoN functionality, the features of ExoN from most other nidovirus families remain to be characterized. Remarkably, viable ExoN knockout mutants were obtained only for two CoVs, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV, whose RNA synthesis and replication kinetics were mildly affected by the lack of ExoN function. In several other CoV species, ExoN inactivation was not tolerated, and knockout mutants could not be rescued when launched using a reverse genetics system. This suggests that ExoN is also critical for primary viral RNA synthesis, a property that poorly matches the profile of an enzyme that would merely boost long-term replication fidelity. In CoVs, ExoN resides in a bifunctional replicase subunit (nsp14) whose C-terminal part has (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase activity. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp14 has shed light on the interplay between these two domains, and on nsp14s interactions with nsp10, a co-factor that strongly enhances ExoN activity in vitro assays. Further elucidation of the structure-function relationships of ExoN and its interactions with other (viral and/or host) members of the CoV replication machinery will be key to understanding the enzymes role in viral RNA synthesis and pathogenesis, and may contribute to the design of new approaches to combat emerging nidoviruses.","output":"The Curious Case of the Nidovirus Exoribonuclease: Its Role in RNA Synthesis and Replication Fidelity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Genomics Education Partnership (GEP) is a community of practice focused on integrating genomics research experiences into undergraduate curriculum and supporting faculty in this endeavor Founded in 2006, GEP has grown to over 100 participating two-year and four-year institutions and introduced thousands of students to eukaryotic gene structure, comparative genomics, and genome evolution GEP members contribute their expertise and enthusiasm to the community through four committees: science and IT, curriculum development, assessment, and professional development and mentoring Digital communication tools facilitate collaboration in this geographically distributed community while regional nodes enable the development of local initiatives Our education research is focused on student experiences, attitudes, and learning gains in the CURE setting An important dimension of CUREs that distinguishes them from the traditional laboratory classroom is iteration: students have opportunities to make mistakes and re-do (Auchincloss et al, 2014) The scaling of undergraduate research from an apprentice model to the classroom, however, poses a major challenge for faculty, creating the need to provide feedback to a large number of inexperienced student researchers We find that custom bioinformatics tools provide rapid feedback to GEP students and allow for iterative revisions of student projects Student surveys and focus groups reveal that bioinformatics CUREs foster ?formative frustration,? whereby students can safely fail in their original analysis, adjust, recover, and succeed;students value this experience During the COVID pandemic, GEP has provided an authentic research experience that can be delivered remotely Bioinformatics resources are available online, as are GEP virtual tutors Thus, GEP is a viable option for undergraduate research projects even for online learning We are expanding our repertoire of scientific projects GEP has partnered with Galaxy to develop G-OnRamp, an open-source platform for constructing UCSC Assembly Hubs and JBrowse/Apollo genome browsers to facilitate collaborative annotation of eukaryotic genomes These tools allow us to include investigations of the evolution of venom in parasitoid wasps and an investigation of the evolution of genes in Drosophila biochemical pathways We seek to grow our network of faculty and to increase the diversity of our community by making a variety of training opportunities available, including online mentoring via the QUBES platform and regional node workshops We have created a supportive community of faculty and welcome new colleagues (no experience necessary!) eager for the challenge of bringing genomics research to undergraduate students at all levels Faculty interested in joining the GEP can contact us at http://gep wustl edu/contact_us","output":"Growing and Sustaining a Nationwide Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE): Genomics Education Partnership Enhances Research Opportunities at Diverse Institutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Housing instability is a constant fact of life for many people in the United States a a fact which is made more urgent and salient during periods of economic disruption such as that caused by the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.

To avoid retention, a PillCam patency capsule (PC) is used in patients with suspected intestinal stenosis. However, a relatively low positive predictive value of the PC examination has been reported previously. The aims of this study were to clarify the accuracy of PC examination and to evaluate clinical factors related to cases of false-positive detection. METHODS We performed a retrospective single-center study of 282 consecutive patients referred for PC examination. Patients in which the PC could not pass through the small bowel within 33 h were classified into the 'no patency' group. The 'no patency' group was investigated for evidence of significant stenosis upon further examinations, including CE, double-balloon endoscopy, and small bowel follow-through after PC examination. Clinical factors related to small bowel patency and false-positive cases were evaluated. RESULTS We included 161 male (57.1%) and 121 female (42.9%) patients with a mean age of 47.5  17.7 years. Of the 282 patients enrolled, 27 patients exhibited 'no patency' upon PC examination. Multivariate analysis showed that clinical factors related to 'no patency' included Crohn's disease, abdominal symptoms, stenosis upon imaging, and previous abdominal surgery. Upon further examination, nine cases in the 'no patency' group had significant stenosis. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of PC examination for detecting small bowel stenosis were 93.8%, 96.6%, 99.6%, and 62.5%, respectively, and the only clinical factor related to false-positive cases was constipation (p < 0.05).

Long-term and strict isolation policies are widely used to ensure social distancing, which may cause excessive smartphone use and increase the risk of smartphone addiction. Previous researchers have identified that some factors that affect smartphone addiction, but there was little research conducted during COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aims to examine the effect of peer phubbing on smartphone addiction, how boredom proneness may mediate this effect, and lastly how refusal self-efficacy may moderate the indirect and direct pathways during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A total of 1396 college students (mean age=20.48, SD=1.08) were surveyed and completed four scales (Peer Phubbing Scale, Refusal Self-efficacy Scale, Smartphone Addiction Index Scale, Boredom Proneness Scale). The statistical analyses were conducted by SPSS 22.0 and SPSS PROCESS macro. RESULTS: This study found that peer phubbing was positively associated with smartphone addiction. Boredom proneness mediated the effect of peer phubbing and smartphone addiction. Furthermore, refusal self-efficacy moderated the relationship between peer phubbing and smartphone addiction as well as boredom proneness and smartphone addiction. Specifically, peer phubbing had a greater impact on smartphone addiction for college students with higher levels of refusal self-efficacy, and the boredom proneness on smartphone addiction was stronger for college students with low levels of refusal self-efficacy. CONCLUSION: This study is important in investigating how peer phubbing is related to the smartphone addiction of Chinese college students during COVID-19 pandemic. The results suggest that college students boredom proneness and refusal self-efficacy may be prime targets for prevention and intervention programs. Thus, this study explored how and when peer phubbing may enhance college students smartphone addiction during COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Peer Phubbing and Chinese College Students Smartphone Addiction During COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Role of Boredom Proneness and the Moderating Role of Refusal Self-Efficacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has heightened the awareness of aerosol generation by human expiratory events and their potential role in viral respiratory disease transmission. Concerns over high severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral burden of mucosal surfaces has raised questions about the aerosol-generating potential and dangers of many otorhinolaryngologic procedures. However, the risks of aerosol generation and associated viral transmission by droplet or airborne routes for many otorhinolaryngology procedures are largely unknown. Indoor aerosol and droplet viral respiratory transmission risk is influenced by 4 factors: (1) aerosol or droplet properties; (2) indoor airflow; (3) virus-specific factors; and (4) host-specific factors. Herein we elaborate on known aerosol vs droplet properties, indoor airflow, and aerosol-generating events to provide context for risks of aerosol infectious transmission. We also provide simple but typically effective measures for mitigating the spread and inhalation of viral aerosols in indoor settings. Understanding principles of infectious transmission, aerosol and droplet generation, as well as concepts of indoor airflow, will assist in the integration of new data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and activities that can generate aerosol to best inform on the need for escalation or de-escalation from current societal and institutional guidelines for protection during aerosol-generating procedures.","output":"Review of indoor aerosol generation, transport, and control in the context of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We were greatly interested in the cross-sectional study by Gerner T et al.

Several reproduction numbers were calculated and used to determine the impact of both control measures and projected benefits of social distancing, treatments and vaccination. We investigate and compare the possible impact of social distancing incorporating different levels of vaccination, with vaccination programme incorporating different levels of treatment. Using the officially published South African COVID-19 data, the numerical simulation shows that the community reproduction threshold will be 30 when there is no social distancing but will drastically reduce to 5 (about 83% reduction) when social distancing is enforced. Furthermore, when there is vaccination with perfect efficacy, the community reproduction threshold will be 4 which increases to 12 (about 67% increment) without vaccination.

RVs are difficult to treat. They rapidly evolve resistance and are genetically diverse. Here, we provide insight into RV drug resistance mechanisms against chemical compounds neutralizing low pH in endolysosomes. Serial passaging of RV-A16 in the presence of the vacuolar proton ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) or the endolysosomotropic agent ammonium chloride (NH(4)Cl) promoted the emergence of resistant virus populations. We found two reproducible point mutations in viral proteins 1 and 3 (VP1 and VP3), A2526G (serine 66 to asparagine [S66N]), and G2274U (cysteine 220 to phenylalanine [C220F]), respectively. Both mutations conferred cross-resistance to BafA1, NH(4)Cl, and the protonophore niclosamide, as identified by massive parallel sequencing and reverse genetics, but not the double mutation, which we could not rescue. Both VP1-S66 and VP3-C220 locate at the interprotomeric face, and their mutations increase the sensitivity of virions to low pH, elevated temperature, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 receptor. These results indicate that the ability of RV to uncoat at low endosomal pH confers virion resistance to extracellular stress. The data endorse endosomal acidification inhibitors as a viable strategy against RVs, especially if inhibitors are directly applied to the airways. IMPORTANCE Rhinoviruses (RVs) are the predominant agents causing the common cold. Anti-RV drugs and vaccines are not available, largely due to rapid evolutionary adaptation of RVs giving rise to resistant mutants and an immense diversity of antigens in more than 160 different RV types. In this study, we obtained insight into the cell biology of RVs by harnessing the ability of RVs to evolve resistance against host-targeting small chemical compounds neutralizing endosomal pH, an important cue for uncoating of normal RVs. We show that RVs grown in cells treated with inhibitors of endolysosomal acidification evolved capsid mutations yielding reduced virion stability against elevated temperature, low pH, and incubation with recombinant soluble receptor fragments. This fitness cost makes it unlikely that RV mutants adapted to neutral pH become prevalent in nature. The data support the concept of host-directed drug development against respiratory viruses in general, notably at low risk of gain-of-function mutations.","output":"Chemical Evolution of Rhinovirus Identifies Capsid-Destabilizing Mutations Driving Low-pH-Independent Genome Uncoating"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coccidioidomycosis, a fungal infection endemic in the southwestern United States, can cause life-threatening infections in immunosuppressed patients.

In comparison with the traditional likelihood-based learning methods, this imitation learning framework does not need to prespecify an intensity function, which alleviates the model-misspecification. Moreover, the adversarial learning procedure bypasses the difficult-to-evaluate integral involved in the likelihood evaluation, which makes the model inference more scalable with the data and variables.

The newborns rely on innate immune responses against invading pathogens because of lacking adaptive immunity. However, how PEDV disables the innate immunity of newborns towards severe infection remains unknown. We found that PEDV infection led to reduced expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs), especially HDAC1 in porcine IPEC-J2 cells. HDACs are considered as important regulators of innate immunity. We hypothesized that PEDV might interact with certain host factors to regulate HDAC1 expression in favor of its replication. We show that HDAC1 acted as a negative regulator of PEDV replication in IPEC-J2 cells, as shown by chemical inhibition, gene knockout and overexpression. A GC-box (GCCCCACCCCC) within the HDAC1 promoter region was identified for Sp1 binding in IPEC-J2 cells. Treatment of the cells with Sp1 inhibitor, mithramycin A, inhibited HDAC1 expression, indicating direct regulation of HDAC1 expression by Sp1. Of the viral proteins that were overexpressed in IPEC-J2 cells, the N protein was found to be present in the nuclei and more inhibitory to HDAC1 transcription. The putative NLS 261PKKNKSR267 contributed to its nuclear localization. The N protein interacted with Sp1 and interfered with its binding to the promoter region, thereby inhibiting its transcriptional activity for HDAC1 expression. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of PEDV evasion of the host responses, offering implications for studying the infection processes of other coronaviruses. Importance The enteric coronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes fatal acute intestinal infection in neonatal pigs that rely on innate immune responses. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play important roles in innate immune regulation. Our study found PEDV suppresses HDAC1 expression via the interaction of its N protein and porcine Sp1, which identified a novel mechanism of PEDV evasion of the host responses to benefit its replication. This study suggests that other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, may also make use of their N proteins to intercept the host immune responses in favor of their infection.","output":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus inhibits HDAC1 expression to facilitate its replication via binding of its nucleocapsid protein to host transcription factor Sp1."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The purpose of this study is to gain a deeper understanding on if and how hotel senior managers (HSMs) in four-star chain hotels in London and Stockholm implemented crisis management techniques (CMTs) as a response to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative questionnaires were sent to 30 HSMs in London and Stockholm. From the feedback, this paper assesses, using thematic analysis, differences in CMTs used, past and present, alluding to COVID-19's economic impacts on hotels. Findings Results determined that crises broadly economically impacted destinations similarly through loss of travellers and thus revenue. However, with a more intricate and specific assessment, destinations are impacted differently;thus, CMTs must alter. Findings show many CMTs can be implemented to reduce crises' economic impacts. The literature review and empirical results allude to many previous and current CMTs, although these must be relevant and specific to the crisis, hotel and/or destination. Practical implications This paper has theoretical implications for academics on, among other things, theory building. Practically, it supports hotels in developing and determining CMTs to reduce the economic impacts of crises, to be better prepared when another pandemic emerges and contributes to the tourism and hospitality industry's knowledge of management strategy within crises.

In secondary forms of HLH (sHLH), the primary goal is treating the triggering factors such as SARS-CoV-2-19 infection. The link between the cytokine storm related to SARS-CoV-2-19infection and development of sHLH has already been reported since the onset of pandemic (1), but little is known about clinical manifestations of HLH which develop after patients recovery from SARS-CoV-2-19 infection. Case presentation A 56-year-old caucasian female was diagnosed with sHLH according to HLH-2004 criteria, after recovery from a mild symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-19 infection and received immunosuppressive treatment (high-dose steroids, IVIG, low dose Ruxolitinib and Etoposide. Antiviral (acyclovir), antibiotic (sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim) and heparin prophylaxes were administered. Colchicine therapy was added considering the pericarditis. Improvement in patient symptoms and normalization of blood count as well as fibrinogen and ferritin values was observed. Conclusion: Our report suggests that HLH-like syndrome might be secondary to SARS CoV-2-19 infection, even after the patient completely recovered from the mildly symptomatic viral infection.

This study aimed to present the experience of the Polish Medical Air Rescue Service during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to protect patients, medical staff, and air crew from SARS-CoV-2 infection. MATERIAL/METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of missions completed by the Polish Medical Air Rescue crews with respect to confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases. We analyzed data from the medical records of the Polish Medical Air Rescue Service, which included flights to accidents and emergencies, and air patient transport missions, where medical assistance was provided to patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first year of the pandemic in Poland.

Due to osmotic forces, MPT is paralleled by a massive influx of water into the mitochondrial matrix, eventually leading to the structural collapse of the organelle. Thus, MPT can initiate outer-mitochondrial-membrane permeabilization (MOMP), promoting the activation of the apoptotic caspase cascade and caspase-independent cell-death mechanisms. The induction of MPT is mostly dependent on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca(2+), but is also dependent on the metabolic stage of the affected cell and signaling events. Therefore, since its discovery in the late 1970s, the role of MPT in human pathology has been heavily investigated. Here, we summarize the most significant findings corroborating a role for MPT in the etiology of a spectrum of human diseases, including diseases characterized by acute or chronic loss of adult cells and those characterized by neoplastic initiation.","output":"Physiopathology of the Permeability Transition Pore: Molecular Mechanisms in Human Pathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Retinal fundus photographs can be used to detect a range of retinal conditions.

Recent studies suggest that sugar-binding proteins galectin-4 and galectin-8 bind microbes expressing blood group antigens. However, the binding profile and potential antimicrobial activity of other galectins, particularly galectin-9 (Gal-9), has remained incompletely defined. Here, we demonstrate that while Gal-9 possesses strong binding preference for ABO(H) blood group antigens, each domain exhibits distinct binding patterns, with the C-terminal domain (Gal-9C) exhibiting higher binding to blood group B than the N-terminal domain (Gal-9N). Despite this binding preference, Gal-9 readily killed blood group BCpositive Escherichia coli, whereas Gal-9N displayed higher killing activity against this microbe than Gal-9C. Utilization of microarrays populated with blood group O antigens from a diverse array of microbes revealed that Gal-9 can bind various microbial glycans, whereas Gal-9N and Gal-9C displayed distinct and overlapping binding preferences. Flow cytometric examination of intact microbes corroborated the microbial glycan microarray findings, demonstrating that Gal-9, Gal-9N, and Gal-9C also possess the capacity to recognize distinct strains of Providencia alcalifaciens and Klebsiella pneumoniae that express mammalian blood groupClike antigens while failing to bind related strains that do not express mammalian-like glycans.

It has long been known that atoms on a metallic surface have biased diffusion if electric fields are applied and that microscopic tips may be sharpened using fields, but the exact mechanisms have not been well understood. Our Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation model uses a recently developed theory for how the migration barriers are affected by the presence of an electric field. All parameters of the model are physically motivated and no fitting parameters are used. The model has been validated by reproducing characteristic faceting patterns of tungsten surfaces that have in previous experiments been observed to only appear in the presence of strong electric fields.

Requirements for decreased person-to-person contacts during the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated adoption of tele-neuro-ophthalmology. This review highlights the challenges and opportunities with tele-neuro-ophthalmology. RECENT FINDINGS: Tele-neuro-ophthalmology programs can be used for triage, diagnostic consultation, and long-term treatment monitoring. Formats include telephone appointments, interprofessional collaborations, remote data interpretation, online asynchronous patient communication, and video visits. Barriers to long-term implementation of tele-neuro-ophthalmology arise from data quality, patient engagement, workflow integration, state and federal regulations, and reimbursement. General neurologists may collaborate with local eye care providers for ophthalmic examination, imaging, and testing to facilitate efficient and effective tele-neuro-ophthalmology consultation.

Effectivity of the learning process or students academic performance is often affected by these factors. Students enrolled in higher education institutions today belong to a generation cohort whose learning and communication behavior is dependent on interactive technology and are not always comfortable with traditional information transfer. In addressing these problems, the study implemented action research on the use of Blended Learning (BL) approach, utilizing different modalities such as web-based learning management systems, recorded video lectures, games, and face-to-face lectures, to deliver selected Development Communication subjects for 2nd semester of A.Y. 2019-2020. The approach integrated synchronous traditional classroom meetings with asynchronous online activities/assessments which lets students learn at their own pace and choose what requirements they want to do first. Before the second half of the academic semester when the action research was implemented, the COVID-19 pandemic forced educational institutions in the Philippines to wrap up early. The objectives of the study were then modified to include determining alternative teaching and learning strategies for DevCom students given the new normal.

The aim of this study was to gain insight into the experiences of volunteers from the European Union who worked in deployable laboratories in West Africa during the outbreak. This study is part of the EMERGE project. We assessed the experiences of 251 volunteers with a 19-item online questionnaire. The questions asked about positive aspects of volunteering such as learning new skills, establishing a new path in life, and changing life values. Other questionnaire subjects were the compliance to follow-up measures, the extent to which volunteers felt these measures restricted their daily activities, the fear of stigmatization, and worries about becoming infected or infecting their families. The volunteers reported positive effects that reached far beyond their daily work, such as changes in life priorities and a greater appreciation of the value of their own lives. Although the volunteers did not feel that temperature monitoring restricted their daily activities, full compliance to temperature monitoring and reporting it to the authorities was low. The volunteers did not fear Ebola infection for themselves or their families and were not afraid of stigmatization. With respect to the burden on the families, 50% reported that their family members were worried that the volunteer would be infected with Ebola virus. Altogether, the positive experiences of the volunteers in this study far outweigh the negative implications and constitute an important argument for inspiring people who intend to join such missions and for motivating the hesitant ones.","output":"Positive experiences of volunteers working in deployable laboratories in West Africa during the Ebola outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autism-Assistance Dogs (AADs) are highly-skilled service animals trained primarily to ensure the safety of an autistic child by preventing elopement and mitigating meltdowns.

RECENT FINDINGS: Dapagliflozin was recently approved for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), irrespective of the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) based on the findings of the pivotal DAPA-HF trial. All SGLT-2 inhibitors are once daily medications with minimal drug-drug interactions and do not require titration (for HF treatment) unlike other HF medications. SGLT-2 inhibitors offer modest weight loss and blood pressure reduction without major adverse effects of hyperkalemia, making it ideal for near-simultaneous initiation with other HF medications, and use in high-risk populations (including older adults). Moreover, SGLT-2 inhibitors appear to afford long-term kidney protection in diverse populations.

In the study group, fibrin glue was used to reinforce the staple-line. The rats were sacrificed 7 days after surgery. The stomach was resected, submerged in saline and exposed to excess pressure to obtain a burst pressure value. The gastric staple line was evaluated histopathologically according to the Ehrlich Hunt scale. The results of the two groups were compared. RESULTS The mean Ehrlich-Hunt scores for inflammation, fibroblastic activity and neo-angiogenesis were similar between the groups (p>0.05). Collagen deposition was significantly higher in study group (3.420.53) when compared with control group (2.570.78) (p=0.035). The mean burst pressure was 137.88.5 mmHg for control group and 135.08.1 mmHg for study group (p=0.536).

Nevertheless, the necessary type of research input is not structurally and sufficiently available within the European research landscape. Description of the problem COVID-19 has clearly shown that a structured European mechanism to organize and share accurate information between countries is urgently needed, especially in the area of population health, to inform decision-makers, researchers and the public.

This study aims to describe the changes in attendance at a single ED and corresponding patient visit characteristics before and during the COVID-19 period. Methods: In a single-centre retrospective cohort study, we used descriptive statistics to compare ED attendance, patient demographics and visit characteristics during the COVID-19 period (1 JanuaryC28 June 2020) and its corresponding historical period in 2019 (2 JanuaryC30 June 2019). Results: The mean ED attendance decreased from 342 visits/day in the pre-COVID-19 period to 297 visits/day in the COVID-19 period. This was accompanied by a decline in presentations in nearly every ICD-10-CM diagnosis category except for respiratory-related diseases. Notably, we observed reductions in visits by critically ill patients and severe disease presentations during the COVID-19 period. We also noted a shift in the ED patient case-mix from 'Non-fevercases to 'Fevercases, likely giving rise to two distinct trough-to-peak visit patterns during the pre-Circuit Breaker and Circuit Breaker period. Conclusions: This descriptive study revealed distinct ED visit trends across different time periods. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a reduction in ED attendances amongst patients with low-acuity conditions and those with highest priority for emergency care. This raises concern about treatment-seeking delays and the possible impact on health outcomes.

According to WBE-theory suggested by West, Brown, and Enquist, E should be in the range from -0.6 to -0.7 eV. However, there are many examples of significant deviations of E from the predictions of the theory. Now we have conducted a study of this value using rats in different types of pharmacological hypothermia: 1. Short-term (for several hours) hypothermia induced by anesthetic xylazine; 2. Daily torpor-like state induced by the pharmacological composition developed in our previous study. It has been found that in pharmacological daily hypothermia E = -0.56  0.03 eV, which was close to that in daily heterotherms found in literature, E = -0.57  0.04 eV. In short-term hypothermia E was substantially lower, E = -0.17  0.071 eV. Our analysis revealed that in short-term hypothermia, changes in body temperature may lag behind changes in metabolic rate for a period &#916;t, affecting E. We propose an approach for estimating &#916;t and obtaining an adjusted E = -0.68  0.17 eV, which corresponds to theoretical predictions. We assume that a similar consideration of &#916;t should be done when calculating E of daily heterotherms. We assume that in ectotherms, when the ambient temperature changes rapidly, changes in metabolic rate may lag behind changes in body temperature for a period (-) &#916;t, that should also be considered in E calculations. The proposed approach may contribute to the further development of the metabolic theory of evolution and may be useful in comparing artificial and natural hypothermia, as well as in studying the energy transformations in ecosystems.","output":"Comparison of natural and pharmacological hypothermia in animals: Determination of activation energy of metabolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"International Patient Summary (IPS) Standards represent a collaborative effort among Standards Development Organizations i.e. HL7, CEN, ISO, IHE to extract a snapshot of key information from Electronic Health Records including key conditions, allergies, medications, as well as immunization information.

Unfortunately, no effective vaccines and antiviral therapeutics against many Mononegavirales are currently available. Viral polymerases have been attractive and major antiviral therapeutic targets. Therefore, Mononegavirales polymerases have been extensively investigated for their structures and functions. Mononegavirales mimic RNA synthesis of their eukaryotic counterparts by utilizing multifunctional RNA polymerases to replicate entire viral genomes and transcribe viral mRNAs from individual viral genes as well as synthesize 5 methylated cap and 3 poly(A) tail of the transcribed viral mRNAs. The catalytic subunit large protein (L) and cofactor phosphoprotein (P) constitute the Mononegavirales polymerases. In this review, we discuss the shared and unique features of RNA synthesis, the monomeric multifunctional enzyme L, and the oligomeric multimodular adapter P of Mononegavirales.

These products, 12-()-hydroxy-LA, 11-(-1)-hydroxy-LA, and a novel metabolite, 10-(-2)-hydroxy-LA, were isolated by HPLC and identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In the presence of NADPH, the formation of all three metabolites was linear with time and microsomal protein concentration. Hydrogen peroxide also supported the microsomal metabolism of LA, although the ratio of metabolites was substantially different than that produced by NADPH-supported microsomes. Several biochemical probes (metyrapone, -naphthoflavone, 2-diethylaminoethyl-2,2-diphenylvalerate hydrochloride, and 10-undecynoic acid) were used to dissociate the three LA hydroxylase activities.

Therefore, health systems should make strategic shifts to ensure that limited resources provide the highest benefit for COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the risk factors associated with poor in-hospital outcomes to help clinicians make better patient care decisions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study enrolled 176 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Demographic characteristics, clinical data, lymphocyte count, CT imaging findings on admission, and clinical outcomes were collected and compared. Two radiologists evaluated the distribution and CT features of the lesions and also scored the extent of lung involvement. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the optimum cutoff point for possible effective variables on patients' outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the risk factors associated with ICU admission and in-hospital death. RESULT: Thirty-eight (21.5%) patients were either died or admitted to ICU from a total of 176 enrolled ones. The mean age of the patients was 57.5  16.1 years (males: 61%). The best cutoff point for predicting poor outcomes based on age, CT score, and O2 saturation was 60 years (sensitivity: 71%, specificity: 62%), 10.5 (sensitivity: 73%, specificity: 58%), and 90.5% (sensitivity: 73%, specificity: 59%), respectively. CT score cutoff point was rounded to 11 since this score contains only integer numbers. Multivariable-adjusted regression models revealed that ages of &#8805; 60 years, CT score of &#8805; 11, and O2 saturation of &#8804; 90.5% were associated with higher worse outcomes among study population (odds ratio (OR): 3.62, 95%CI: 1.35-9.67, P = 0.019; OR: 4.38, 95%CI: 1.69-11.35, P = 0.002; and OR: 2.78, 95%CI: 1.03-7.47, P = 0.042, respectively).

In cases with leakage, a refractory fistula (RF) is sometimes recognized after esophagectomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for RF after esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction. METHODS This study enrolled 244 consecutive esophageal cancer patients who had undergone esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction. RF was defined as a noncurative anastomotic site-cutaneous fistula that had been present for more than 2 months. We evaluated the risk factors for RF. RESULTS AL occurred in 30 patients (12.3%). There was one mortality case (0.4%) due to mediastinitis caused by AL in the present series. A multivariate analysis revealed that the subcutaneous route was an independent risk factor for AL (OR 4.42, 95% CI 1.42-13.8, p = 0.01), and that the subcutaneous route was an independent risk factor for RF (OR 13.30, 95% CI 2.50-71.30, p = 0.0024). CONCLUSION The results of this retrospective study suggest that subcutaneous route was associated with an increased risk of RF after esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction.

Chorioamnionitis, an inflammatory condition affecting the placenta and fluid surrounding the developing fetus, affects 25 to 40% of preterm births. Severe chorioamnionitis with preterm birth is associated with significantly increased risk of pulmonary disease and secondary infections in childhood, suggesting that fetal inflammation may markedly alter the development of the lung. Here, we used intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge to induce experimental chorioamnionitis in a prenatal rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) model that mirrors structural and temporal aspects of human lung development. Inflammatory injury directly disrupted the developing gas exchange surface of the primate lung, with extensive damage to alveolar structure, particularly the close association and coordinated differentiation of alveolar type 1 pneumocytes and specialized alveolar capillary endothelium. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis defined a multicellular alveolar signaling niche driving alveologenesis that was extensively disrupted by perinatal inflammation, leading to a loss of gas exchange surface and alveolar simplification, with notable resemblance to chronic lung disease in newborns. Blockade of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor- ameliorated LPS-induced inflammatory lung injury by blunting stromal responses to inflammation and modulating innate immune activation in myeloid cells, restoring structural integrity and key signaling networks in the developing alveolus. These data provide new insight into the pathophysiology of developmental lung injury and suggest that modulating inflammation is a promising therapeutic approach to prevent fetal consequences of chorioamnionitis.","output":"Inflammatory blockade prevents injury to the developing pulmonary gas exchange surface in preterm primates."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to report a rare case of a rapidly progressive isolated unilateral orbital compression syndrome in a male with homozygous sickle cell disease, who presented with proptosis and optic nerve dysfunction.

Data pertaining to 2340 dangerous goods accidents in the process of highway transportation in China from 2013 to 2019 are obtained with webpage crawling software. In this paper, the number of monthly highway transportation accidents involving dangerous goods from 2013 to 2019 is determined, and the time series of transportation accidents and an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) prediction model are established. The prediction accuracy of the model is evaluated based on the actual number of dangerous goods highway transportation accidents in China from 2017 to 2019. The results indicate that the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the actual and predicted values of dangerous goods highway transportation accidents from 2017 to 2019 is 0.147, 0.315 and 0.29. Therefore, the model meets the prediction accuracy requirements.

Our objective was to assess stress and coping during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS During the pandemic in New York City, patients taking disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs answered open-ended questions about the pandemic's effects on daily life and their rheumatic condition. Themes of stress and coping were discerned from volunteered responses. Patients also completed the standard Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale/PROMIS Anxiety surveys. Anxiety scores were independent variables in multivariable analyses with stress and coping themes as combined dependent variables. RESULTS Of the 112 patients interviewed (86% women; mean age, 50 years), 72 volunteered COVID-19-related stress on their rheumatic condition, home, work, and finances. Patients volunteering stress were younger, had disease longer, were taking more than 1 medication, had worse GAD-7 scores and a positive anxiety screen, and had worse PROMIS scores that were significantly worse than population norms (all comparisons, p  0.01; all variables remained associated in multivariable analyses). Fourty-one patients volunteered coping mechanisms including support from others, engaging in activities, and resilience already establish in dealing with rheumatic diseases. Of these, 18 volunteered both coping and stress and 23 volunteered coping and no stress. Patients in the latter (coping-only) group were more likely to be older, taking only 1 medication, and had better GAD-7 and PROMIS scores (all comparisons, p  0.02). In multivariable analysis, older age (p = 0.02) and lower GAD-7 (p = 0.03) or PROMIS scores (p = 0.03) remained associated.

Understanding the proportion of the population at risk of severe infection, including among those with heart disease, could assist current vaccine strategy efforts. Methods: Using data from the 2015-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we estimated the weighted prevalence of any of eight of eleven increased-risk conditions (including age &#8805;65) in U.S. adults aged &#8805;18 (N=10,581) and extrapolated these results to a population of 233.8 million U.S. adults &#8805;18, and subgroups from the overall population defined by race/ethnicity, education, income and history of heart disease. Results: An estimated 176.1 million individuals representing 75.4% of U.S. adults had at least one increased-risk condition, 40.3% &#8805;2 and, 18.5% &#8805;3 conditions. Approximately 129 million adults aged <65 (69.2%) were also estimated to be at increased-risk. Compared to Whites, similar proportions of Blacks in the overall population (78.0 vs. 75.6%, p>0.05) and Hispanics in the younger population (70.8 vs 68.4%) were estimated to be at increased-risk. Conversely, a greater proportion of individuals with lower education and income levels were estimated to be at increased-risk both in the overall and younger population. In addition, an estimated 6.2 million individuals (14.5%) had heart disease. Among these, virtually all had at least one additional CDC risk factor (97.9%) and most had &#8805;2 or &#8805;3 risk factors (83.8% and 58.5%, respectively). Conclusions: As vaccination strategies are being explored, these results demonstrate that >75% of adults in the U.S. would be considered at increased-risk for severe COVID-19 infection by CDC criteria.

Our proposed research will determine if telephone consultations for EMA (the most common method of abortion in the UK) is non-inferior to standard face-to-face consultations with regard to the efficacy of EMA. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will be conducted as an RCT. The recruitment target is 1222 participants. The primary outcome is success of EMA (complete abortion rate). This will be determined based on a negative low-sensitivity urine pregnancy test result (2 weeks after misoprostol use) and absence of surgical intervention or diagnosis of ongoing pregnancy (within 6 weeks of misoprostol). Secondary outcomes include total time spent at a clinic appointment to receive EMA, self-reported preparedness for EMA, level of satisfaction with consultation and effective contraception uptake compared with when women attend for a face-to-face consultation.

Such circumstances can trigger locomotor deterioration and impairment, which is known as locomotive syndrome. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of locomotive syndrome in the pandemic and to identify its risk factors. Methods: This was a multicenter questionnaire survey performed between 1 November 2020 and 31 December 2020 in Japan. Patients who visited the orthopedics clinic were asked to answer a questionnaire about their symptoms, exercise habits, and locomotor function at two time points, namely, pre-pandemic and post-second wave (current). The incidence of locomotive syndrome in the COVID-19 pandemic was investigated. Additionally, multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors for developing locomotive syndrome during the pandemic. Results: A total of 2829 patients were enrolled in this study (average age: 61.1  17.1 years; 1532 women). The prevalence of locomotive syndrome was 30% pre-pandemic, which increased significantly to 50% intra-pandemic. Among the patients with no symptoms of locomotive syndrome, 30% developed it in the wake of the pandemic. In the multinomial logistic regression analysis, older age, deteriorated or newly occurring symptoms of musculoskeletal disorders, complaints about the spine or hip/knee joints, and no or decreased exercise habits were independent risk factors for developing locomotive syndrome. Conclusions: The prevalence of locomotive syndrome in patients with musculoskeletal disorders has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to age, locomotor symptoms, especially spine or hip/knee joint complaints, and exercise habits were associated with the development of locomotive syndrome.

RESULTS The mean IES score in the participants showed a moderate stressful impact, with the mean IES score of females being significantly higher than that of males (29 vs. 19) with p<0.001. More than half of the participants had an IES score 26. With the onset of the pandemic, 71.5% of all medical students reported feeling increased stress from commitments. CONCLUSIONS the pandemic had stressful impact on the mental health of medical students and it was significantly more stressful for women and students in the preclinical years of study. The COVID-19 pandemic had no impact on social and family support, however a positive impact on the lifestyle of medical students was found.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health of Medical Students at the University of Mostar."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) changed the context of schooling for both parents and their children Learning at home presents new challenges for parents of young children and particularly for parents of children with behavior difficulties, such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity The current study examined changes to parent and child behavior due to COVID-19 among 4- and 5-year-old children and their parents Changes in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and levels of parental involvement in childrens learning were examined ADHD symptoms were also examined as a moderator of changes in parent involvement Data were collected prior to COVID-19 and several months after school closures Results indicated that parents ratings of their childrens ADHD symptoms increased from prior to COVID-19 to during COVID-19 There were few changes to parents educational involvement;however, parents beliefs about their responsibility to be involved in their childrens learning changed differentially according to child gender ? 2020 National Association of School Psychologists","output":"The Association Between Child ADHD Symptoms and Changes in Parental Involvement in Kindergarten Childrens Learning During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is characterized by transient regional systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle (LV) and mimics myocardial infarction.

The cons argued that PSBB was ineffective because of the impossibility to limit peoples movements. The pros, on the other hand, viewed PSBB as a training facility to increase peoples awareness about the pandemic. Our research aims at evaluating the effectiveness of PSBB by using the Kermack-McKendrick SIR pandemic model and the NLSUR non-linear least square estimation. Using daily data published by the COVID-19 task force, we found that PSBB had a positive impact on flattening the curve. Assuming that vulnerable people were around 30% of the population, PSBB has reduced the rate of spread of COVID-19 from around 2 persons to less than 1 person for every infected. We also found that the economic consequences of PSBB on commodities varied by their demand and supply characteristics. We, therefore, suggest that policy interventions related to price control and subsidy should consider these characteristics. For future research, as data more available, the effect of PSBB on broader economic variables such as poverty and growth in the province needs to be examined.

Penelitian kami mengevaluasi efektivitas PSBB dengan menggunakan model matematika standar Kermack-McKendrick SIR dan menggunakan estimasi kuadrat terkecil non-linier NLSUR. Dengan menggunakan data harian yang diterbitkan oleh satuan tugas COVID-19, kami menemukan bahwa PSBB secara signifikan berdampak positif dalam menurunkan laju penyebaran virus. Dengan asumsi penduduk rentan sekitar 30% dari populasi, PSBB telah menurunkan angka penyebaran COVID-19 dari sekitar 2 orang menjadi kurang dari 1 orang untuk setiap kasus terkonfirmasi positif. Kami juga menemukan bahwa konsekuensi ekonomi dari penerapan PSBB terhadap komoditi bergantung kepada karakteristik permintaan dan penawarannya. Karena itu kami merekomendasikan kebijakan harga dan subsidi mesti berpedoman kepada karakteristik tersebut.

K., and Hemphill, M. L., Virology 164, 22C29, 1988). In this study, these DI RNAs were characterized by molecular cloning, hybridization with probes of defined sequence, and primer extension. The 7000-nt DI RNA species were found to be authentic DI RNAs which contain a single 2500- to 2700-nt deletion in the structural protein open reading frame (ORF) region of the genome. The 800-nt RNAs were found to be subgenomic DI RNAs synthesized from the large DI RNA templates. Analysis of the extent of the deletions using a reverse-transcription-PCR protocol revealed that the 3 end of the deletions did not extend beyond the 3 terminal 244 nts of the genome. The 5 end of the deletions did not extend into the nonstructural protein ORF; however, DI RNAs in which the subgenomic start site was deleted were present. Following serial undiluted passage of seven independent stocks of RUB, this was the only pattern of DI RNAs generated. DI RNAs of 2000 to 3000 nt in length were the majority DI RNA species in a persistently infected line of Vero cells, showing that other types of RUB DI RNAs can be generated and selected. However, when supernatant from the persistently infected cells was passaged, the only DI RNAs present after two passages were 7000 nts in length, indicating that this species has a selective advantage over other types of DI RNAs during serial passage.","output":"Characterization of defective-interfering RNAs of rubella virusgenerated during serial undiluted passage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To see the implementation of designed strategy for uninterrupted supply of HIV treatment at time of COVID-19 Pandemic along with the knowledge and preventive practices regarding COVID-19 among HIV positive patients to have baseline data for future interventions to control HIV-COVID-19 syndemic.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of the pandemic on HCWs, and the relationship between HCW mental health and demographics, occupational factors, and COVID-19 concerns. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey in an urban medical center (SeptemberCNovember 2020) in Baltimore, MD, in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 605 HCWs (physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, physician assistants, patient care technicians, respiratory therapists, social workers, mental health therapists, and case managers). MAIN MEASURES: Measures of mental health (Patient Health Questionnaire-2, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, PROMIS Sleep Disturbance 4a, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Maslach Burnout Inventory-2 item, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-2 item), demographics, occupational factors, and COVID-19 related concerns. KEY RESULTS: Fifty-two percent of 1198 HCWs responded to the survey and 14.2% reported depression, 43.1% mild or higher anxiety, 31.6% sleep disturbance, 22.3% posttraumatic stress symptoms, 21.6% depersonalization, 46.0% emotional exhaustion, and 23.1% lower resilience. Relative to HCWs providing in-person care to COVID-19 infected patients none of their working days, those doing so all or most days were more likely to experience worse depression (adjusted odds ratio, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.3C11.7), anxiety (aOR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.4C6.3), possible PTSD symptoms (aOR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1C5.8), and higher burnout (aOR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1C6.0). Worse mental health in several domains was associated with higher health fear (aORs ranged from 2.2 to 5.0), job stressors (aORs ranged from 1.9 to 4.0), perceived social stigma/avoidance (aORs ranged from 1.8 to 2.9), and workplace safety concerns (aORs ranged from 1.8 to 2.8). CONCLUSIONS: US HCWs experienced significant mental health symptoms eight months into the pandemic. More time spent providing in-person care to COVID-19-infected patients and greater COVID-19-related concerns were consistently associated with worse mental health.

The identification of factors that enhance cardiac repair by the restoration of the vascular network is, therefore, of great significance. Here, we show that the transcription factor Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) is increased in stressed cardiomyocytes and induces a cardioprotective cross-talk between cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells to enhance angiogenesis after ischemia. Single-cell sequencing indicates ZEB2 to be enriched in injured cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of ZEB2 results in impaired cardiac contractility and infarct healing post-myocardial infarction (post-MI), while cardiomyocyte-specific ZEB2 overexpression improves cardiomyocyte survival and cardiac function. We identified Thymosin ?4 (TMSB4) and Prothymosin &#945; (PTMA) as main paracrine factors released from cardiomyocytes to stimulate angiogenesis by enhancing endothelial cell migration, and whose regulation is validated in our in vivo models. Therapeutic delivery of ZEB2 to cardiomyocytes in the infarcted heart induces the expression of TMSB4 and PTMA, which enhances angiogenesis and prevents cardiac dysfunction. These findings reveal ZEB2 as a beneficial factor during ischemic injury, which may hold promise for the identification of new therapies.","output":"Cardiomyocytes stimulate angiogenesis after ischemic injury in a ZEB2-dependent manner"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main objective of this study is to assess the consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid\\\\19) on the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in Organisation for Economic Co\\\\operation and Development (OECD) countries.

Furthermore, curative attempts to treat ruptured AVM patients have not been questioned so far, and there is a lack of prospective data on clinical results according to treatment modality. Endovascular treatment is often used aiming to improve the safety or efficacy of surgery or radiation therapy, but benefits have never been documented in a trial. A care trial context is needed to evaluate interventions at the same time they are practised. METHODS/TRIAL DESIGN TOBAS is a pragmatic, prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial and registry which offers a care trial context for brain AVM patients, including surgical resection, radiosurgery or endovascular embolization, alone or combined. The study includes two RCTs and a multimodality prospective registry. The objectives of the proposed study are to assess whether preventive interventions (surgery, embolization, radiation therapy, alone or combined), selected by the local treatment team and performed as locally practiced, randomly allocated and compared with conservative management, in unruptured brain AVM patients eligible for active or conservative management, can improve the proportion of patients having an independent outcome (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) < 3, as assessed by a standardized questionnaire administered by non-masked care personnel) at 10 years. All patients judged ineligible for randomized allocation are to be entered in a multimodal registry. The objective of a nested trial in patients with ruptured or unruptured AVMs to be treated by surgery or radiation therapy, is to assess whether pre-surgical or pre-radiation embolization, randomly allocated and compared with no embolization, can improve the proportion of patients with complete eradication of the AVM, as locally adjudicated, combined with a good clinical outcome (mRS < 3).

Emulsion adjuvants allow for antigen dose sparing, more rapid immune responses, and enhanced quality and quantity of adaptive immune responses. The mechanisms of enhancement of immune responses are well defined and typically characterized by the creation of an immunocompetent environment at the site of injection, followed by the induction of strong and long-lasting germinal center responses in the draining lymph nodes. As a result, emulsion adjuvants induce distinct immunological responses, with a mixed Th1/Th2 T cell response, long-lived plasma cells, an expanded repertoire of memory B cells, and high titers of cross-neutralizing polyfunctional antibodies against viral variants. Because of these various properties, emulsion adjuvants were included in pandemic influenza vaccines deployed during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, are still included in seasonal influenza vaccines, and are currently at the forefront of the development of vaccines against emerging SARS-CoV-2 pandemic variants.

Patients with vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy are typically offered laser or intravitreal injections which often require more than one treatment cycle. However, treatment is not always initiated, or it is not completed, resulting in poor visual outcomes. Interventions aimed at improving the uptake or completion of treatment for diabetic retinopathy can potentially help prevent or delay visual loss in people with diabetes. METHODS We will search MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health and Cochrane Register of Studies for studies reporting interventions to improve the uptake of treatment for diabetic retinopathy (DR) and/or diabetic macular oedema (DMO), compared with usual care, in adults with diabetes. The review will include studies published in the last 20 years in the English language. We will include any study design that measured any of the following outcomes in relation to treatment uptake and completion for DR and/or DMO: (1) proportion of patients initiating treatment for DR and/or DMO among those to whom it is recommended, (2) proportion of patients completing treatment for DR and/or DMO among those to whom it is recommended, (3) proportion of patients completing treatment for DR and/or DMO among those initiating treatment and (4) number and proportion of DR and/or DMO rounds of treatment completed per patient, as dictated by the treatment protocol. For included studies, we will also report any measures of cost-effectiveness when available. Two reviewers will screen search results independently. Risk of bias assessment will be done by two reviewers, and data extraction will be done by one reviewer with verification of 10% of the papers by a second reviewer. The results will be synthesised narratively. DISCUSSION This rapid review aims to identify and synthesise the peer-reviewed literature on the effectiveness of interventions to increase uptake and completion of treatment for DR and/or DMO in LMICs.

The exchange of cocoa germplasm between germplasm collections and breeding centres is vital for varietal development. Intermediate quarantine facilities, such as the International Cocoa Quarantine Centre, Reading UK (ICQC-R) play a vital role in ensuring the transfer of germplasm whilst minimising the risk of spreading pests and diseases. Current screening procedures combine visual inspection and molecular techniques, which are effective in detecting Cocoa swollen shoot virus (CSSV), a badnavirus, which causes severe losses but are restricted to West Africa. However, the detection of latent or mild virus infections that produce no visual symptoms has been a challenge. Recently two badnavirus species of cocoa producing mild symptoms, cacao mild mosaic virus (CaMMV) and cacao yellow vein-banding virus (CYVBV), have been sequenced. Here, we report new assays for the detection of these two species, for the first time in non-symptomatic accessions. Evolutionary and bioinformatic analyses of the viruses suggest their most recent source was from Trinidad, though there is historic evidence that these viruses may have their origin in South America and then become widespread globally over the last century. We also report a novel colorimetric Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the detection of CYVBV.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Departments of Nephrology, Combined Military Hospital Peshawar and Combined Military Hospital Malir, Karachi, during March 2020. METHODOLOGY: Doctors working in different parts of Pakistan were approached online through snowball sampling technique. Those with history of psychiatric disorders were excluded. They were administered a questionnaire including Seven-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Reasons why they felt anxious were also explored. RESULTS: Responses from 431 doctors, including 238 (55.2%) males, were evaluated. Most of them were younger than 30 years (286; 66.4%), in training (335; 77.7%), and working in public hospitals (347; 80.5%). Mild, moderate and severe anxiety was seen in 120 (27.8%), 103 (23.9%) and 42 (9.7%) doctors, respectively. Median score on GAD-7 was 6 (interquartile range = 3 - 11). Lady doctors had higher scores than males (7 vs. 5; p=0.024). No significant differences in scores were found amongst doctors from different workplaces or of different professional status. A greater proportion of females had anxiety as compared to males (67.9% vs. 56.3%; p=0.014). Frequency of anxiety was not different amongst doctors of different professional status, types of workplace and amongst different age groups. Commonest reasons for anxiety were lack of personal protective equipment (83.8% doctors); and the fear that they could spread infection to family members (79.8% doctors).

It can cause serious infections in humans that may result in encephalitis/meningoencephalitis. Although several studies have described the involvement of specific genes in the host response to TBEV infection in the central nervous system (CNS), the overall network remains poorly characterized. Therefore, we investigated the response of DAOY cells (human medulloblastoma cells derived from cerebellar neurons) to TBEV (Neudoerfl strain, Western subtype) infection to characterize differentially expressed genes by transcriptome analysis. Our results revealed a wide panel of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including type III but not type I (or II) interferons (IFNs), which are activated upon TBEV infection, as well as a number of non-coding RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs. To obtain a broader view of the pathways responsible for eliciting an antiviral state in DAOY cells we examined the effect of type I and III IFNs and found that only type I IFN pre-treatment inhibited TBEV production. The cellular response to TBEV showed only partial overlap with gene expression changes induced by IFN- treatment - suggesting a virus-specific signature - and we identified a group of ISGs that were highly up-regulated following IFN- treatment. Moreover, a high rate of down-regulation was observed for a wide panel of pro-inflammatory cytokines upon IFN- treatment. These data can serve as the basis for further studies of host-TBEV interactions and the identification of ISGs and/or lncRNAs with potent antiviral effects in cases of TBEV infection in human neuronal cells.","output":"Analysis of tick-borne encephalitis virus-induced host responses in human cells of neuronal origin and interferon-mediated protection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) has been recognized as an aerosol\\\\generating procedure.

METHODS: This is a randomized trial in patients scheduled for EGD between April and June 2020. Eligible 212 patients were randomized with 1:1 allocation. Rapid adenosine triphosphate test was used to determine contamination level using relative light units of greater than 200 as a cutoff value. All eligible patients were randomized to lie in either the LL or prone position during EGD. The primary outcome was the rate of contamination on the endoscopist's face shield. RESULTS: The majority of patients were female (63%), with a mean age of 60  13 years. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. There was no face shield contamination after EGD in either group. The number of coughs in the LL group was higher than the prone group (1.38  1.8 vs 0.89  1.4, P = 0.03).

The survey was designed based on a review of relevant literature and inquired about the strengths, limitations, and overall utility of VIs. RESULTS A total of 365 PDs responded to our survey. Almost all respondents (90%) found VIs to be less expensive than in-person interviews, while only 34% agree that VIs were less time-consuming. Only a median of 5% of interviews was complicated by technical difficulties. Most PDs found it more challenging to assess applicants' fit (75%), personality and communication skills (71%), and commitment to specialty (60%). Only 14% found VIs to be overall better for assessing residency applicants.

The disease has now become a global pandemic. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between COVID-19 and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. METHODS We collected and analyzed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 by high-throughput sequencing or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We reviewed electronic medical records of 405 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the Third Hospital of Wuhan. RESULTS Among the 405 confirmed patients, 210 had no GI symptoms, 195 had GI symptoms, and the first symptom of 155 patients was GI. The prevalence of vascular and digestive diseases in the group with GI symptoms was significantly higher than in the group without GI symptoms. In patients with GI symptoms, the proportion with fever, cough, dysphoria, chest tightness, poor appetite, chest pain, and pharyngeal pain was significantly higher than in those without GI symptoms. There was no significant difference in imaging between the 2 groups. In patients with GI symptoms, the proportion with increased procalcitonin (PCT) level and decreased lymphocyte count was significantly higher than in those without GI symptoms. CONCLUSION COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms had significantly more vascular and digestive system diseases and were more likely to have clinical manifestations of fever, cough, poor appetite, chest tightness, chest pain, insomnia, and pharyngeal pain. There were more patients with diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Patients with GI symptoms were more likely to have increased PCT and decreased lymphocyte count.","output":"Clinical Characteristics of 195 Cases of COVID-19 with Gastrointestinal Symptoms COVID-19 with Gastrointestinal Symptoms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the initial spark of the COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019, which was later declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be a global pandemic, all affected countries are implementing various preventive and control measures to mitigate the spread of the disease.

Therefore, a method that can convert 3Q into a substrate with enhanced detectability by GC-MS would be an important tool in its analysis. METHODS 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl chloride (TrocCl) was used in the derivatization of 3Q in three different soils of varying composition and total organic content (Virginia Type A soil, Nebraska EPA standard soil and Ottawa sand) when present at a 10 gg-1 concentration in each. A direct derivatization protocol and one involving the pre-extraction of the analyte were evaluated for their individual efficiencies and subsequent analysis by EI-GC-MS. RESULTS The practical derivatization of 3Q, when present at low levels (10 gg-1 ) in three different soil matrices was found to be rapid (1 hour) and to smoothly take place at ambient temperature (and as low as 4 o C). The method detection limit (MDL) was determined to be 30 ngmL-1 for the Virginia type A soil, 49 ngmL-1 for the Nebraska EPA standard soil and 72 ngmL-1 for the Ottawa sand sample. CONCLUSIONS An expedient and practical derivatization method for 3Q, a chemical warfare degradation product difficult to detect by GC-MS, has been accomplished using trichloroethyl chloroformate.

METHODS: 70 negative control samples (collected before the COVID-19 pandemic) and samples from 101 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (collected at different time points from symptoms onset: 7, 8-14, and >14 days) were used to compare the sensitivity, specificity, agreement, positive and negative predictive values of each assay with RT-PCR. A concordance assessment between the five assays was also conducted. Cross-reactivity with other HCoV, non-HCoV respiratory viruses, non-respiratory viruses, and nuclear antigens was investigated. RESULTS: Lionex showed the highest specificity (98.6%, 95%CI: 92.3-99.8), followed by EDI and Dia.Pro (97.1%, 95%CI: 90.2-99.2), NovaTec (85.7%, 95%CI: 75.7-92.1), then AnshLabs (75.7%, 95%CI: 64.5-84.2).

While the anosmia resulting from olfactory bulb (OB) pathology is the prominent clinical characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD), SARS-CoV-2 infection has been predicted as a potential risk factor for developing Parkinsonism-related symptoms in a significant portion of COVID-19 patients and survivors. SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to alter the dopamine system and induce the loss of dopamine neurons that have been known to be the cause of PD. However, the underlying biological basis of anosmia and the potential link between COVID-19 and PD remains obscure. Ample experimental studies in rodents suggest that the occurrence of neural stem cell (NSC) mediated neurogenesis in the OB and olfactory epithelium (OE) is important for olfaction. However, the reports on neurogenesis in the human OB have been a subject of debate, while considerable experimental evidence strongly supports the incidence of neurogenesis in the human OB in adulthood. To note, various viral infections and neuropathogenic conditions including PD with olfactory dysfunctions have been characterized by impaired neurogenesis in OB and OE. Therefore, this article describes and examines the recent reports on SARS-CoV-2 mediated OB dysfunctions and defects in the dopaminergic system responsible for PD. Further, the article emphasizes that COVID-19 and PD associated anosmia could result from the regenerative failure in the replenishment of the dopaminergic neurons in OB and olfactory receptor-expressing neurons in OE respectively.","output":"COVID-19 and Parkinsons disease: Defects in neurogenesis as the potential cause of olfactory system impairments and anosmia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"India had made an early move to constrain the spread of COVID 19, requesting a 21 day across the country lockdown for its population 1.3 billion persons beginning March 25th 2020.

In this setting the sensitivity and specificity of the best performing assays can both exceed 98%. However, antibody assay performance following mild infection is less clear. METHODS: We assessed quantitative IgG responses in a cohort of healthcare workers in Oxford, UK, with a high pre-test probability of Covid-19, in particular the 991/11,475(8.6%) who reported loss of smell/taste. We use anosmia/ageusia and other risk factors as probes for Covid-19 infection potentially undiagnosed by immunoassays by investigating their relationship with antibody readings either side of assay thresholds. RESULTS: The proportion of healthcare workers reporting anosmia/ageusia increased at antibody readings below diagnostic thresholds using an in-house ELISA (n = 9324) and the Abbott Architect chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA; n = 11,324): 426/906 (47%) reported anosmia/ageusia with a positive ELISA, 59/449 (13.1%) with high-negative and 326/7969 (4.1%) with low-negative readings. Similarly, by CMIA, 518/1093 (47.4%) with a positive result reported anosmia/ageusia, 106/686 (15.5%) with a high-negative and 358/9563 (3.7%) with a low-negative result. Adjusting for the proportion of staff reporting anosmia/ageusia suggests the sensitivity of both assays in mild infection is lower than previously reported: Oxford ELISA 89.8% (95%CI 86.6C92.8%) and Abbott CMIA 79.3% (75.9C82.7%). CONCLUSION: Following mild SARS-CoV-2 infection 10C30% of individuals may have negative immunoassay results.

PPE must be available, safe, and effective. There is increasing evidence that the use of PPE can cause physical health problems. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to further examine PPE-related physical problems experienced by nurses as well as the role of wear time on these problems. METHODS: Using a descriptive cross-sectional design, a survey was conducted among nurses working for state or university hospitals across Turkey who actively cared for patients with COVID-19. Survey questions included demographic variables, type of PPE used, physical problems experienced, and length of time PPE was worn (4 hours or less, or more than 4 hours). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Three hundred and seven (307) nurses completed the survey. The most commonly reported problems were sweating when wearing a surgical (50.9%) or N95 (64.2%) mask, dry hands from wearing gloves (73.9%), perspiration when wearing overalls/gowns (84.1%), and vision problems when wearing goggles/face shields (47.9%).

Despite the significant advantages of bedside teaching, its usage within medical education has been declining, and COVID-19 has added additional challenges. The pandemic has resulted in a significant reduction in opportunities to deliver bedside teaching due to risk of viral exposure, patients declining student interactions, and ward closures. Educators have therefore been required to be innovative in their teaching methods, leading to the use of online learning, social media platforms, and simulation. Simulation-based education allows for learning in a low-risk environment and affords the opportunity for deliberated repeated practice with case standardization. The results demonstrate that simulation-based training can increase students confidence, increase the rates of correct clinical diagnoses, and improve retention of skills and knowledge when compared with traditional teaching methods. OBJECTIVE: To mitigate the impact of COVID-19 upon bedside teaching for third year students at Hull York Medical School amid closure of the cardiorespiratory wards, a high-fidelity simulation-based model of traditional bedside teaching was designed and implemented. The objectives of the teaching session were to enable students to perform history taking and a focused cardiorespiratory clinical examination in a COVID-19Csafe environment using SimMan 3G. METHODS: Four clinical teaching fellows with experience of simulation-based medical education scripted histories for 2 common cardiorespiratory cases, which were asthma and aortic stenosis. The simulation sessions were designed for students to take a focused cardiorespiratory history and clinical examination using SimMan 3G. All cases involved dynamic vital signs, and the simulator allowed for auscultation of an ejection systolic murmur and wheezing in accordance with the cases chosen. Key aspects of the pathologies, including epidemiology, differential diagnoses, investigations, and management, were summarized using an interactive PowerPoint presentation, followed by a debriefing session. RESULTS: In total, 12 third year medical students undertook the sessions, and overall feedback was highly positive. Of the 10 students who completed the feedback questionnaires, 90% (n=9) felt more confident in their clinical examination skills following the teaching; 100% (n=10) of the students responded that they would recommend the session to a colleague; and implementation of regular simulation was frequently requested on feedback. These results are in keeping with the current literature. CONCLUSIONS: Bedside teaching continues to face ongoing challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as declining patient recruitment and fluctuations in clinical findings. The support for simulation-based medical education is derived from high-quality studies; however, studies describing the use of this technology for bedside teaching in the undergraduate curriculum are limited. The authors describe a highly effective teaching session amid the pandemic, which allowed for maintenance of staff and student safety alongside continued education during a challenging time for educators globally.","output":"An Alternative to Traditional Bedside Teaching During COVID-19: High-Fidelity Simulation-Based Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular complications, including myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and pulmonary embolism, represent an important source of adverse outcomes in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVES: To assess the frequency of arterial and venous thromboembolic disease, risk factors, prevention and management patterns, and outcomes in patients with COVID-19, the authors designed a multicenter, observational cohort study. METHODS: We analyzed a retrospective cohort of 1,114 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed through our Mass General Brigham integrated health network. The total cohort was analyzed by site of care: intensive care (n = 170); hospitalized nonintensive care (n = 229); and outpatient (n = 715). The primary study outcome was a composite of adjudicated major arterial or venous thromboembolism. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 were 22.3% Hispanic/Latinx and 44.2% non-White. Cardiovascular risk factors of hypertension (35.8%), hyperlipidemia (28.6%), and diabetes (18.0%) were common. Prophylactic anticoagulation was prescribed in 89.4% of patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care cohort and 84.7% of those in the hospitalized nonintensive care setting. Frequencies of major arterial or venous thromboembolism, major cardiovascular adverse events, and symptomatic venous thromboembolism were highest in the intensive care cohort (35.3%, 45.9%, and 27.0 %, respectively) followed by the hospitalized nonintensive care cohort (2.6%, 6.1%, and 2.2%, respectively) and the outpatient cohort (0% for all). CONCLUSIONS: Major arterial or venous thromboembolism, major adverse cardiovascular events, and symptomatic venous thromboembolism occurred with high frequency in patients with COVID-19, especially in the intensive care setting, despite a high utilization rate of thromboprophylaxis.","output":"Registry of Arterial and Venous Thromboembolic Complications in Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Essential oils (EOs) like eucalyptus and camphor have pro-convulsant properties. These EOs are present in many over- the- counter balms and oils. The effect of exposure to these EOs and occurrence of seizure is not systematically studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between essential oils and the first episode of seizure and breakthrough seizures in known epileptic patients. METHODS: This was a multi-center prospective study, conducted in four hospitals over four years. Every person presenting with the first episode of seizure or breakthrough seizure was asked about exposure to EOs, mode of exposure, time to onset of a seizure in relationship to exposure, duration of seizure, type of seizure, and antiepileptic drug therapy. RESULTS: During the four-year period there were 55 patients with essential oil-related seizure (EORS). 22(40 %) had essential oil-induced seizures (EOIS) and 33(60 %) had essential oil-provoked seizures (EOPS). The female: male ratio was 1:1.1, the age of the patients ranged from 8 months to 77 years. In the EOIS group, 95 % had generalized tonic-clonic seizures and 5% had focal impaired awareness seizures. In the EOPS group, 42.4 % had focal impaired awareness seizures, 27.3 % generalized tonic-clonic seizures, 15 % focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, and 15 % focal aware motor seizures. EOs implicated were preparations containing eucalyptus and camphor. CONCLUSION: Exposure to essential oils of eucalyptus and camphor is an under-recognized cause of the first and breakthrough seizure. Identifying the true causative factor will prevent unnecessary antiepileptic drug therapy and future recurrence.","output":"Essential oil related seizures (EORS): A multi-center prospective study on essential oils and seizures in adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(177)Lu-PSMA-617 is an effective therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, treatment resistance occurs frequently, and combination therapies may improve outcomes. We report the final safety and efficacy results of a phase I/II study combining (177)Lu-PSMA-617 with idronoxil (NOX66), a radiosensitizer, and examine potential clinical, blood-based, and imaging biomarkers. Methods: Fifty-six men with progressive mCRPC previously treated with taxane chemotherapy and novel androgen signaling inhibitor (ASI) were enrolled. Patients received up to 6 doses of (177)Lu-PSMA-617 (7.5 GBq) on day 1 in combination with a NOX66 suppository on days 1C10 of each 6-wk cycle. Cohort 1 (n = 8) received 400 mg of NOX66, cohort 2 (n = 24) received 800 mg, and cohort 3 (n = 24) received 1,200 mg. (68)Ga-PSMA and (18)F-FDG PET/CT were performed at study entry, and semiquantitative imaging analysis was undertaken. Blood samples were collected for analysis of blood-based biomarkers, including androgen receptor splice variant 7 expression. The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability; secondary outcomes included efficacy, pain scores, and xerostomia. Regression analyses were performed to explore the prognostic value of baseline clinical, blood-based, and imaging parameters. Results: Fifty-six of the 100 men screened were enrolled (56%), with a screening failure rate of 26% (26/100) for PET imaging criteria. All men had received prior treatment with ASI and docetaxel, and 95% (53/56) had received cabazitaxel. Ninety-six percent (54/56) of patients received at least 2 cycles of combination NOX66 and (177)Lu-PSMA-617, and 46% (26/56) completed 6 cycles. Common adverse events were anemia, fatigue, and xerostomia. Anal irritation attributable to NOX66 occurred in 38%. Forty-eight of 56 had a reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (86%; 95% CI, 74%C94%); 34 of 56 (61%; 95% CI, 47%C74%) had a PSA reduction of at least 50%. Median PSA progression-free survival was 7.5 mo (95% CI, 5.9C9 mo), and median overall survival was 19.7 mo (95% CI, 9.5C30 mo). A higher PSMA SUV(mean) correlated with treatment response, whereas a higher PSMA tumor volume and prior treatment with ASI for less than 12 mo were associated with worse overall survival. Conclusion: NOX66 with (177)Lu-PSMA-617 is a safe and feasible strategy in men being treated with third-line therapy and beyond for mCRPC. PSMA SUV(mean), PSMA-avid tumor volume, and duration of treatment with ASI were independently associated with outcome.","output":"(177)Lu-PSMA-617 and Idronoxil in Men with End-Stage Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (LuPIN): Patient Outcomes and Predictors of Treatment Response in a Phase I/II Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This short communication described the actions taken in ophthalmic practice in Kabul, Afghanistan during the COVID-19 pandemic to effectively protect both patients and staff.

Research to date has focused primarily on exposure to single pesticides or pesticide classes in isolation; there are little data on the effect of exposure to pesticide mixtures on child and adolescent neurodevelopment. METHODS: Using Californias Pesticide Use Reporting database, we estimated agricultural pesticide use within 1 km of the home during the prenatal and postnatal (ages 0C5 years) periods among participants in the Center for the Health Assessment for Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) birth cohort. We implemented a Bayesian Hierarchical linear mixed-effects model to examine associations with maternal- and youth-reported behavioral and emotional problems from the Behavior Assessment System for Children, 2nd edition (BASC-2) at ages 16 and 18 years (n = 593). RESULTS: We observed mostly null associations between pesticide applications and neurobehavioral outcomes. There were some trends of modestly increased internalizing behaviors and attention problems in association with organophosphate insecticide use near the home during the prenatal period. In the postnatal period, a two-fold increase in glyphosate applications was associated with more youth-reported depression ( = 1.2, 95% credible intervals [CrI] = 0.2, 2.2), maternal-reported internalizing behaviors ( = 1.23, 95% CrI = 0.2, 2.3), and anxiety ( = 1.2, 95% CrI = 0.2, 2.3).

Genetic variation and selective pressures lead to the accumulation of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the viral genome that may affect virulence, transmission rate, viral recognition and the efficacy of prophylactic and interventional measures. To address these concerns at the genomic level, we assessed the phylogeny and SNPs of the SARS-CoV-2 mutant population collected to date in Iran in relation to globally reported variants. Phylogenetic analysis of mutant strains revealed the occurrence of the variants known as B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.525 (Eta), and B.1.617 (Delta) that appear to have delineated independently in Iran. SNP analysis of the Iranian sequences revealed that the mutations were predominantly positioned within the S protein-coding region, with most SNPs localizing to the S1 subunit. Seventeen S1-localizing SNPs occurred in the RNA binding domain that interacts with ACE2 of the host cell. Importantly, many of these SNPs are predicted to influence the binding of antibodies and anti-viral therapeutics, indicating that the adaptive host response appears to be imposing a selective pressure that is driving the evolution of the virus in this closed population through enhancing virulence.

However, there is no published data to date on Switzerland. Identifying these reasons among the Swiss population who are vaccine hesitant may help inform campaigns to encourage vaccine confidence. Aims: The primary aim of this study is to identify the reasons for not getting vaccinated against COVID-19 among Swiss residents who are vaccine hesitant. The secondary aim is to examine whether reasons differ by age, gender, education, and likelihood of accepting a vaccination to better target campaigns and design interventions. Design: An online survey asked participants to indicate the reasons why they were hesitant to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Setting: German-speaking Swiss Cantons, the survey was administered online between 5 May 2021 and 16 May 2021.Participants: The participants in this analysis were a sample of (N=1191) Swiss residents age 16-60 years old from German-speaking Cantons, who could answer an online survey in German, who had yet not been vaccinated, who had not yet registered for a vaccination appointment, and who did not indicate that they would definitely be vaccinated if offered the chance. Findings: Among people who are vaccine hesitant in Switzerland, the most common reasons for being hesitant were side-effect, safety, and effectiveness concerns. It was also common for people to indicate that they were healthy/at low risk, would decide later, and that they wanted to build immunity naturally. Less common, but still prevalent concerns included wanting more information, thinking COVID-19 was not a real threat, and concerns that the vaccine may serve another purpose. Differences in reasons for being vaccine hesitant were found by age, gender, education, and likelihood of accepting a vaccination if offered. Conclusions: To increase the likelihood of accepting a vaccination, vaccination campaigns should address side-effect, safety, and effectiveness concerns. Campaigns could also consider informing people why it is necessary for people in lower risk groups to be vaccinated, and why vaccination is preferable to infection for building immunity. While campaigns may be effective in reaching some of the population, alternative strategies might be necessary to strengthen the trust relationship with vaccines and vaccine providers in some groups. Less prevalent concerns, such as not liking needles, could be addressed through individual level interventions.","output":"Reasons for not getting vaccinated against COVID-19 in German-speaking Switzerland: An online survey among vaccine hesitant 16-60 year olds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19) virus, first diagnosed in China in December 2019, causes an infectious and multisystem disease.

SETTING Academic tertiary care pediatric hospital. PATIENTS Eighty-seven patients with CLP or cleft lip and alveolus treated with autologous iliac crest bone grafting for alveolar clefts over a 10-year period (January 2009 to March 2019) with minimum 6-month follow-up. Fifty patients had postoperative CT evaluation; 37 did not. INTERVENTIONS Postoperative CT to determine ABG success, versus standard clinical examination and 2-dimensional radiographs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Requirement for revision ABG, defined as failure of the original graft by clinical or radiographic examination. RESULTS Fifty-eight percent of patients underwent a postoperative CT scan at median interval of 10 months after surgery.

We aimed to examine the prevalence of smoking HTPs among a working population in Japan. SETTING, DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: In 2018, we conducted a cross-sectional study comprised of 7714 retail business workers in the service industry in Japan. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: For the definition of smoking HTPs, we identified current HTP smokers who only smoked HTPs, using five mutual categories of current smoking status (never, former, HTPs only, combustible cigarettes only and dual smokers who smoked both combustible cigarettes and HTPs). Occupational classes were classified into office workers (eg, upper non-manual workers) and other workers. ORs and 95% CIs of office workers were estimated for HTP usage, adjusted for age, sex, employment type and cigarette smoking-related health knowledge. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of smoking HTPs was 3.0% (male 5.0%, female 2.2%). The prevalence of HTP smokers differed across occupational classes (5.6% in office workers vs 2.5% in others; p<0.05). Compared with other workers, the adjusted odds of office workers for smoking HTPs remained elevated (OR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.40 to 2.77). Sensitivity analyses with workers of all smoking status showed the same pattern. When stratified by sex, the occupational difference only remained significant in male workers. CONCLUSIONS: We found a positive occupational difference in smoking HTPs, particularly among male workers in the retail sector in Japan.

Weaned piglets, infected experimentally with transmissible gastroenteritis virus, a coronavirus that induces a diarrheal illness similar to human rotavirus infection, received methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) or saline intramuscularly at 48 and 72 h after infection; noninfected littermate controls were similarly injected with methylprednisolone. Animals were killed at 96 h, at the height of diarrhea, and jejunal epithelium was studied in vitro. Transmissible gastroenteritis, as expected, induced structural, enzyme, and Na transport abnormalities. Methylprednisolone did not affect small intestinal structure or function of noninfected control piglets. In transmissible gastroenteritis-infected piglets, jejunal villi were longer and glucose-facilitated Na absorption was greater after methylprednisolone than after saline treatment. Increased glucose stimulation of Na flux in vitro in the methylprednisolone-treated infected group was not attributable to enhanced Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity and occurred despite persistence of the virus within mucosal cells, shown by immunofluorescense microscopy.

The available information about COVID-19 and its propensity of contamination through droplets and aerosol need some modifications for conducting surgeries successfully without contaminating the hospital buildings, protecting healthcare teams and the patient. With these objectives, some modifications in the operating theater including surgical techniques for minimal access, laparoscopy, and robotic surgery are proposed in this review article. This review article also discusses the safety measures to be followed for the suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient and the guidelines and recommendations for healthcare teams while treating these patients. Although there is little evidence of viral transmission through laparoscopic or open approaches, modifications to surgical practice such as the use of safe smoke evacuation and minimizing energy device used to reduce the risk of exposure to aerosolized particles to healthcare team are proposed in this review article.","output":"Adaptations and Safety Modifications to Perform Safe Minimal Access Surgery (MIS: Laparoscopy and Robotic) During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Practice Modifications Expert Panel Consensus Guidelines from Academia of Minimal Access Surgical Oncology (AMASO)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Study associations between frailty, illness severity and post-discharge survival in older adults admitted to medical wards with acute clinical conditions. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 195 individuals (mean age 86; 63% females) admitted to two medical wards with acute illness, followed up for all-cause mortality for 20 months after discharge. Ward physicians screened for frailty and quantified its degree from one to eight using Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), while clinical illness severity was estimated by New Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) and laboratory illness severity was calculated by a frailty index (FI-lab) using routine blood tests. RESULTS: CFS, NEWS2 and FI-lab scores were independently associated with post-discharge survival in an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model with age, ward category (acute geriatric and general medical) and comorbidity as covariates. Adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were 1.54 (1.24C1.91) for CFS, 1.12 (1.03C1.23) for NEWS2, and 1.02 (1.00C1.05) for FI-lab. A frailty  illness severity category interaction effect (p = 0.003), suggested that the impact of frailty on survival was greater in those experiencing higher levels of illness severity. Among patients with at least moderate frailty (CFS six to eight) and high illness severity according to both NEWS2 and FI-lab, two (13%) were alive at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Frailty screening aided prognostication of survival following discharge in older acutely ill persons admitted to medical wards. The prognostic value of frailty increased when combined with readily available illness severity markers acquired during admission.

The impact of IS drugs on COVID-19 outcomes in patients with IBD and other immune-mediated inflammatory disorders (IMIDs) is unclear. We aimed to determine COVID-19 outcomes in a large population database from a single healthcare system. Methods: Adult patients with IBD and other IMIDs were identified using SNOMED-CT codes from the EMR of the Providence Health System. COVID-19 diagnoses were identified based on SARSCoV-2 positive PCR results. COVID-19 incidence, hospitalization, ICU admission and death were analyzed among IBD, other IMID patients and a control group without IMIDs. Risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes were estimated using logistic regression with demographics, comorbidities and IMID drugs including corticosteroids, biologics and JAK inhibitors as independent variables. We considered defined drug exposure as having a drug prescribed or administered at least once within the year prior to the first positive SARS-CoV-2 positive test result. Results: We identified 58,612 adult patients with IBD (32,043 UC and 26,569 CD), 130,799 with other IMIDs, and 6,06,081 controls without IMID. Among these, there were 59,647 COVID-19 cases (0.95%) including 427 (0.73%) among IBD patients. Of these 80 (18.7%) were hospitalized, 3 (0.7%) required ventilatory support and 10 died (2.3%). COVID-19 incidence was similar among IBD, other IMID and non-IMID controls. Risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes are shown in the Table 1. Among IBD patients, only age (aOR 1.04, p=0.0001) was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization whereas steroid, IMM or advanced therapeutic use was not. Age was also a risk factor for hospitalization among other IMID patients whereas the use of immunotherapeutic drugs appeared to be protective. Conclusion: Patients with IBD and other IMIDs do not appear to be at increased risk of COVID-19 infections or related serious complications. Age is the only variable associated with an increased risk factor for hospitalization among patients with IBD and other immune-mediated conditions.

METHODS: In a phenomenologic study, we used thematic analysis to explore the COVID-19 disruption to clinical training and understand processes relating to adaptation in a large academic medical center. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 14 clinical teachers and 16 trainees representing all levels of clinical learning. Interviews occurred within the initial three months of the crisis, and data were analyzed following a thematic analysis coding process. RESULTS: We constructed eight themes synthesizing our participants perceptions of the immediate unanticipated disruption, noting in the process their alignment with a change management framework. These included: urgency in adapting, with an obvious imperative for change; overcoming inconsistent involvement and support through the formation of self-organized frontline coalitions; attempts to develop strategy and vision via initially reactive but eventually consistent communication; empowering a volunteer army through co-creation and a flattened hierarchy; and efforts to sustain improvement and positive momentum with celebration of trial, error, and growth. The majority of participants found positive outcomes resulting from the tumultuous change process. Moreover, they were now more readily accepting of change, and tolerant of the ambiguous and iterative nature inherent in the education change process. Many anticipated that some innovation would, or would at least deserve to, continue post- crisis. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic afforded an opportunity to study the content and process of change during an active crisis. In this case of clinical education, our findings provide insight into the ways an academic medical system adapts to unanticipated circumstances. We found alignment with broader organizational change management models and that, compared with crisis management models (and their shorter term focus on resolving such crises), stakeholders self-organized in a reliable manner that carries the potential advantage of preserving such beneficial change.

Additionally, as a vital reactive oxygen species (ROS), it is an innate immune system weapon and performs a critical function in many pathophysiology processes. In this paper, a novel water-soluble fluorescent probe, BMH, with excellent performance is designed and synthesized by simple condensation of benzocoumarin and 2-mercaptoethanol. BMH has specific selectivity, excellent sensitivity, ultra-fast response (<3 s), and a wide pH detection range. The fluorescence intensity of BMH has an excellent linear correlation with the concentration of HOCl in the scope of 0-10 M, and the calculated detection limit (DL) is 2.45 nM. The intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) sensing mechanism of BL has been verified by fluorescence, UV, and MS studies as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, BMH can be incorporated into a solid-state visual sensor to detect HOCl conveniently. BMH was applied to detect HOCl-spiked actual water samples and achieved satisfying recovery rates. Also, the low-toxicity BMH can be successfully used to track changes in endogenous/exogenous HOCl in living cells. In short, BL provides a robust and reliable monitoring tool to reveal the biological functions of HOCl and ensure its safe use.","output":"A benzocoumarin-based fluorescent probe for ultra-sensitive and fast detection of endogenous/exogenous hypochlorous acid and its applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019, virtual visits have become the primary means of delivering efficient, high-quality, and safe health care while Americans are instructed to stay at home until the rapid transmission of the virus abates An important variable in the quality of any patientCclinician interaction, including virtual visits, is how adroit the clinician is at forming a relationship This article offers a review of the research that exists on forming a relationship in a virtual visit and the outcomes of a quality improvement project which resulted in the refinement of a Communication Tip Sheet that can be used with virtual visits It also offers several communication strategies predicated on the R E D E to Communicate model that can be used when providing care virtually","output":"Enhancing Your Webside Manner: Optimizing Opportunities for Relationship-Centered Care in Virtual Visits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spectroscopic analysis such as FT-IR, FT-Raman, UV-Vis and NMR are conducted for the synthesized molecule by both experimental and theoretical approach.

Conventional methods to quantify aerosol concentration that susceptible victims in contaminated environments are exposed to use real time particle counters to measure concentrations in environments without occupancy. Breathing-induced airflow interacts and influences concentration around nostrils or mouth and alter the ultimate exposure. This subject has not yet been systematically studied, particularly under transient emission. In this work, an experimental facility comprising two manikins was designed and fabricated. One of them mimicked realistic breathing, acting as a susceptible victim. Both steady and episodic emissions were generated in an air-conditioned environmental chamber in which two different ventilation schemes were tested. The scaled-dose of the victim under different expiratory velocities and pulmonary ventilation was measured. Inferring from results obtained from comprehensive tests, it can be concluded that breathing has very significant influence on the ultimate dose compared with that without breathing. Majority of results show that breathing reduces inhalation quantity and the reduction magnitude increases with breathing rate. This is attributed to the fact that the exhalation process plays a more significant role in reducing the dose level than the enhanced effect during inhalation period. The higher the breathing rate, the sharper the decline of the resultant concentration would be leading to lower dose. Nevertheless, under low pulmonary ventilation, results show that breathing increases dose marginally. Results also reveals that ventilation scheme also affects the exposure.","output":"An experimental study quantifying pulmonary ventilation on inhalation of aerosol under steady and episodic emission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the globalizing world, many factors such as rapidly increasing population, production and consumption habits, and economic growth cause climate changes.

To describe the occurrence of adverse reactions associated with the administration of each of two doses of the adsorbed vaccine COVID-19 (inactivated) produced by Sinovac up to one week after vaccination in Adults (18-59 years of age) and Elderly (60 years of age or more). TRIAL DESIGN: This is a Phase III, randomized, multicenter, endpoint driven, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of the adsorbed vaccine COVID-19 (inactivated) produced by Sinovac. The adsorbed vaccine COVID-19 (inactivated) produced by Sinovac (product under investigation) will be compared to placebo. Voluntary participants will be randomized to receive two intramuscular doses of the investigational product or the placebo, in a 1: 1 ratio, stratified by age group (18 to 59 years and 60 years or more) and will be monitored for one year by active surveillance of COVID-19. Two databases will be established according to the age groups: one for adults (18-59 years) and one for the elderly (60 years of age or older). The threshold to consider the vaccine efficacious will be to reach a protection level of at least 50%, as proposed by the World Health Organization and the FDA. Success in this criterion will be defined by sequential monitoring with adjustment of the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval above 30% for the primary efficacy endpoint. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy participants and / or participants with clinically controlled disease, of both genders, 18 years of age or older, working as health professionals performing care in units specialized in direct contact with people with possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19. Participation of pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding, as well as those intending to become pregnant within three months after vaccination will not be allowed. Participants will only be included after signing the voluntary Informed Consent Form and ensuring they undergo screening evaluation and conform to all the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All the clinical sites are located in Brazil. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Experimental intervention: The vaccine was manufactured by Sinovac Life Sciences (Beijing, China) and contains 3 g/0.5 mL (equivalent to 600 SU per dose) of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus, and aluminium hydroxide as adjuvant. Control comparator: The placebo contains aluminium hydroxide in a 0.5 mL solution The schedule of both, experimental intervention and placebo is two 0.5 mL doses IM (deltoid) with a two week interval. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary efficacy endpoint is the incidence of symptomatic cases of virologically confirmed COVID-19 two weeks after the second vaccination. The virological diagnosis will be confirmed by detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in a clinical sample. The primary safety endpoint is the frequency of solicited and unsolicited local and systemic adverse reactions during the period of one week after vaccination according to age group in adult (18-59 years old) and elder (60 years of age or older) subjects. Adverse reactions are defined as adverse events that have a reasonable causal relationship to vaccination. RANDOMISATION: There will be two randomization lists, one for each age group, based on the investigational products to be administered, i.e., vaccine or placebo at a 1: 1 ratio. Each randomization list will be made to include up to 11,800 (18-59 year-old) adults, and 1,260 elderly (60 y-o and older) participants, the maximum number of participants needed per age group. An electronic central randomization system will be used to designate the investigational product that each participant must receive. BLINDING (MASKING): This trial is designed as a double-blind study to avoid introducing bias in the evaluation of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. The clinical care team, the professionals responsible for the vaccination and the participants will not know which investigational product will be administered. Only pharmacists or nurses in the study who are responsible for the randomization, separation and blinding of the investigational product will have access to unblinded information. The sponsor's operational team will also remain blind. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The total number of participants needed to evaluate efficacy, 13,060 participants, satisfies the needed sample size calculated to evaluate safety. Therefore, the total number obtained for efficacy will be the number retained for the study. Up to 13,060 participants are expected to enter the study, with up to 11,800 participants aged 18 to 59 years and 1,260 elderly participants aged 60 and over. Half of the participants of each group will receive the experimental vaccine and half of them will receive the placebo. The recruitment of participants may be modified as recommended by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee at time of the interim unblinded analysis or blind assessment of the COVID-19 attack rate during the study.

Methods: Two empirical models are proposed to explain daily death () records: a) self-similar (SS) recurrences of the global responses, and b) geometric averaging of two independent SS models for global  records. Findings: The detected self-similar recurrences in the global response suggest three global self-similar waves that support multi-month forecasts of the  numbers. However, there are upper and lower-limit SS forecast  scenarios that were jointly integrated with a geometrical average (GA) model, that support the existence of a moderated third wave, with a decaying stage for the next months (July-September 2020).

There is an emergent need to search for possible medications. OBJECTIVE This article intends to use virtual screening and molecular docking methods to find potential inhibitors that can respond to COVID-19 from existing drugs. METHODS To tack part in the current research investigation to define a potential target drug that may protect the world from emerged pandemic corona disease, we have carried out a virtual screening study by of 129 approved drugs that their metabolic characteristics, dosages used, potential efficacy and side effects are clear as they have been approved for treating existing infections. Especially 12 drugs against chronic hepatitis B virus, 37 against chronic hepatitis C virus, 37 against human immunodeficiency virus, 14 anti-herpesvirus, 11 anti- influenza, and 18 others drugs currently on the market were considered for this study. Then these drugs were evaluated using virtual screening and molecular docking studies in the active site of the (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (6lu7). Once the efficacy of the drug is determined, it can be approved for of their in vitro and in vivo activity against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that could be interesting for rapid clinical treatment of patients. These drugs were ranked for potential effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 and those with high molecular docking scores are proposed as novel candidates for repurposing. The N3 inhibitor co-crystallized with the protease (6lu7) and the anti-HIV protease inhibitor Lopinavir were used as standards for comparison. RESULTS The results suggest the effectiveness of Beclabuvir, Nilotinib, Tirilazad, Trametinib and Glecaprevir as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 since they tightly bind to its main protease. CONCLUSION These promising drugs could inhibit the replication of the virus; hence, we suggest the repurposing of these compounds for thetreatment of COVID-19. No toxicity measurements are required for these drugs since they were previously tested prior to their approval by the FDA. However, the assessment of these potential inhibitors as clinical drugs involves further in vivo tests for these drugs.","output":"Discovery of Potent SARS-CoV-2 Inhibitors from Approved Antiviral Drugs via Docking Screening."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Proximal femoral (hip) fracture is common, serious and costly. Rehabilitation may improve functional recovery but evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness are lacking. An enhanced rehabilitation intervention was previously developed and a feasibility study tested the methods used for this randomised controlled trial (RCT). The objectives are to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the enhanced rehabilitation programme following surgical repair of proximal femoral fracture in older people compared with usual care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Protocol for phase III, parallel-group, two-armed, superiority, pragmatic RCT with 1:1 allocation ratio; allocation sequence by minimisation programme with a built-in random element; secure web-based allocation concealment. The two treatments will be usual care (control) and usual care plus an enhanced rehabilitation programme (intervention). The enhanced rehabilitation will consist of a patient-held information workbook, goal setting diary and up to six additional therapy sessions. Outcome assessment and statistical analysis will be performed blind; patient and carer participants will be unblinded. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 17 and 52 weeks follow-up. Primary outcome at 52 weeks will be the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living scale. Secondary outcomes will measure anxiety and depression, health utility, cognitive status, hip pain intensity, falls self-efficacy, fear of falling, grip strength and physical function. Carer strain, anxiety and depression will be measured in carers. All safety events will be recorded, and serious adverse events will be assessed to determine whether they are related to the intervention and expected. Concurrent economic evaluation will be a cost-utility analysis from a health service and personal social care perspective. An embedded process evaluation will determine the mechanisms and processes that explain the implementation and impacts of the enhanced rehabilitation programme.

This paper shows how accuracy and utility of testing programs depend not just on the type of tests, but on the context as well. METHODS: We describe the testing methods that have been developed and the possible testing strategies; then, we focus on two possible methods of population-wide testing, i.e., pooled testing and testing with rapid antigen tests. We show the accuracy of split-pooling method and how, in different pre-test probability scenarios, the positive and negative predictive values vary using rapid antigen tests. RESULTS: Split-pooling, followed by retesting of negative results, shows a higher sensitivity than individual testing and requires fewer tests. In case of low pre-test probability, a negative result with antigen test could allow to rule out the infection, while, in case of a positive result, a confirmatory molecular test would be necessary. CONCLUSIONS: Test performance alone is not enough to properly choose which test to use; goals and context of the testing program are essential. We advocate the use of pooled strategies when planning population-wide screening, and the weekly use of rapid tests for close periodic monitoring in low-prevalence populations.

Suitable controllers based on fuzzy logic concept are designed to stabilise chaos to an infection-free equilibrium as well as to synchronise a chaotic trajectory with a regular non-chaotic one so that the unpredictability dies out. An FOM of COVID-19 is also proposed that displays chaotic propagation similar to the plague models. The index of memory and heredity that characterise FOMs are found to be crucial parameters in understanding the progression of the epidemics, capture the behaviour of transmission more accurately and reveal enriched complex dynamics of periodic to chaotic evolution, which otherwise remain unobserved in the integral models.

A-to-I RNA editing has been shown to directly affect the genome/transcriptome of RNA viruses with significant repercussions for viral protein synthesis, proliferation and infectivity, while it also affects recognition of double-stranded RNAs by cytosolic receptors controlling the host innate immune response. Recent evidence suggests that RNA editing may be present in SARS-CoV-2 genome/transcriptome. The majority of mapped mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome are A-to-G/U-to-C(opposite strand) and C-to-U/G-to-A(opposite strand) substitutions comprising potential ADAR-/APOBEC-mediated deamination events. A single nucleotide substitution can have dramatic effects on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity as shown by the D614G(A-to-G) substitution in the spike protein.

This has been brought into sharp focus by the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, constantly changing hospital policies and surgical guidelines in reducing access to established screening and treatment regimens. Nipple aspirate fluid (NAF), is thought to provide a unique window into the biological processes occurring within the breast, particularly in the context of a developing neoplasm. Evaluation of NAF in asymptomatic women, for novel chemical biomarkers of either early disease and/or cancer risk offers tremendous promise as a tool to facilitate early detection and to supplement screening. However, it is acceptability as a method of collection and screening by women is critical and yet unknown. A breast health questionnaire was disseminated to women through breast cancer charities, patient support groups and social media platforms, with the aim of collecting opinions on the acceptability of use of NAF as a potential screening tool. Method: Following ethical approval a questionnaire was prepared using online surveys consisting of four parts: (a) introduction on breast health screening in the UK, (b) core demographic data, (c) questions regarding screening and the acceptability of using NAF and (d) opinions about the process of collecting and using nipple fluid for screening. The voluntary and anonymous questionnaire was disseminated through social media, professional networks, charity websites and by individuals between October 2019 and December 2020. Survey responses were collected electronically, and the data analysed using online surveys statistical tools. Results: A total of 3178 women completed the questionnaire (65.9% Caucasian, 27.7% Asian/British Asian, 0.6% black and 5.0% other). Of these, 2650 women (83.4%) had no prior knowledge of NAF and 89.4% were unaware that NAF can be expressed in up to 90% of all women. Concerning their risk of breast cancer, 89.8% of women were keen to know their future risk of breast cancer, 8.5% were unsure whether they wanted to know their risk and a further, 1.6% did not want to know. Regarding screening, 944 women (29.8%) were unaware of the lack of routine National Health Service Breast Screening for those under the age of 47 years. Furthermore, 53.0% of women were unaware that mammographic screening is affected by breast density. In terms of the acceptability of home testing for breast health, 92.0% were keen to undergo a home test. Both 79.7% and 70.9% stated they would consider hand massage and a breast pump to acquire nipple fluid samples, respectively. A further 48.6% of women would consider the use of a hormonal nasal spray for the same purpose. However, with regards to acquiring results from NAF testing, 42.6% of women would prefer to receive results at home and 34.2% in a medical facility. Finally, 91.6% of women believed that breast health should be incorporated as part of school education curriculum. Conclusion: Public awareness regarding breast screening protocols and limitations of mammography could be improved. Many women were unaware that NAF might be a useful biofluid for future risk prediction, and yet the concept of self-testing of nipple fluid, with either hand massage or a breast pump was well received. Efforts should be made to increase awareness of the benefits of alternative and supplementary tests, especially in the context of high-risk individuals and younger patients. ?

We find substantial heterogeneity in how the lockdown affected farmers in these two states, which is likely related to existing structural differences in market infrastructure and to differences in state-specific COVID-related policies. In Odisha, where mechanization is limited, farmers spent more on labor to harvest their crops, and distress selling was more prevalent due to the absence of a well-functioning procurement system for their crops. In Haryana, preexisting market infrastructure allowed the state to sustain procurement at stable prices, limiting impacts on smallholder production. As consumers, farmers in Haryana faced more disruptions than those in Odisha, due to reduced availability of foods in the markets, whereas farmers in Odisha benefited from more diverse cropping patterns and increased local supply of foods following transport restrictions.","output":"Impacts of a national lockdown on smallholder farmers income and food security: Empirical evidence from two states in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the mechanistic basis of adaptive cellular antigen recognition, T cell receptors (TCRs) encode clinically valuable information that reflects prior antigen exposure and potential future response.

However, the potential transmission from exposure to clinic instrumentation is unknown, including which additional pathogens may be spreading in this context. This study seeks to fill this gap by characterizing the microbiota of instrumentation in ophthalmology clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic and identifying potential sources of pathogenic spread encountered by patients and healthcare workers. METHODS: Thirty-three samples were captured using standard cultures and media. Ten positive and negative controls were used to confirm proper technique. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all samples. Samples were collected from the retina (N = 17), glaucoma (N = 6), cornea (N = 6), and resident (N = 4) clinics with rigorous disinfection standards at a tertiary academic medical center. Standard media cultures and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for each sample. RESULTS: From 33 samples, more than half (17/33, 51.5%) yielded bacterial growth. Using two different molecular methods, three samples (3/33, 9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cycle thresholds 36.48, 37.14, and 37.83). There was no significant difference in bacterial growth (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: ? 0.644C0.358, p = 0.076) among different clinics (retina, glaucoma, cornea, resident). Staphylococcus (S.) epidermidis grew most frequently (12/35, 34%), followed by S. capitis (7/35, 20%), Micrococcus luteus (2/35, 5.7%), Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum (2/35, 5.7%), and Cutibacterium ([C.], Propionibacterium) acnes (2/35, 5.7%). C. acnes growth was more frequent with imaging device forehead rests (2/7, 28.6%) than other surfaces (0/26, 0%, 95% CI: 0.019C0.619, p = 0.040). No samples isolated fungus or adenovirus. CONCLUSIONS: Most samples across subspecialty clinic instrumentation grew bacteria, and several tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Many isolated pathogens have been implicated in causing infections such as endophthalmitis, conjunctivitis, uveitis, and keratitis. The clinical implications of the ophthalmology microbiome for transmitting nosocomial infections warrant optimization of disinfection practices, strategies for mitigating spread, and additional study beyond the pandemic.

Its use is being proposed for the disinfection of workplaces and public places atmosphere, and for disposable masks and personal protective equipment disinfection for reuse, with particular reference to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Ozone can be generated in situ by means of small, compact ozone generators, using dried ambient air as a precursor. It should be injected into the room that is to be disinfected until the desired ozone concentration is reached;after the time needed for the disinfection, its concentrations must be reduced to the levels required for the workers safety.

To this end, we prepared two series of bithiophene diesters and diamides with methylene, ethylene, or propylene spacers between the bithiophene core and the functional groups in their terminal substituents. The hydrogen-bonded bithiophene diamides showed significantly denser packing of the bithiophene cores than the diesters and other known &#945;,&#969;-disubstituted bithiophenes. The bithiophene packing density reach a maximum in the bithiophene diamide with an ethylene spacer, which featured the smallest longitudinal bithiophene displacement and infinite 1D arrays of electronically conjugated, parallel, and almost linear N-HO=C hydrogen bonds. The synergistic hydrogen bonding and &#960;-interactions were attributed to the favorable conformational mechanics of the ethylene spacer and resulted in H-type spectroscopic aggregates in solid-state absorption spectroscopy. These results demonstrate that the optoelectronic properties of &#960;-conjugated materials in the solid-state may be tailored systematically via side chain engineering, and hence that this approach has significant potential for the design of organic and polymer semiconductors.","output":"Structure-Property Relationships in Bithiophenes with Hydrogen-Bonded Substituents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with metastatic cancers often require radiotherapy (RT) as a palliative therapy for cancer pain.

This pattern disappears a few weeks into the pandemic, after which layoffs are more uniformly distributed. This pecking order of layoffs is most pronounced in low-skilled industries (e.g., retail trade) and in firms with high turnover costs. Firms are also more likely to rehire high-tenure employees that were laid off first. These results are consistent with theories which document that search frictions play an important role in determining firms' responses to aggregate shocks. To further evaluate the importance of search frictions in our setting, we examine whether expansion of unemployment benefits under the CARES Act increased the likelihood of layoffs.

The study aims to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of our technique of robotic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (RSPDP) by a stepwise approach. METHODS The data of consecutive patients presented for RSPDP from 2014 to 2019 at Verona University were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. The patients were divided into two groups based on the surgical procedure performed, such as Kimura's (KG) or Warshaw's (WG) technique, and then compared. RESULTS In the study period, 32 patients underwent RSPDP. Twenty-three patients presented for the Kimura procedure (72%), while nine patients underwent the Warshaw procedure (28%). A higher body mass index was found in the KG (26  4 vs. 22  3, p = 0.037). Regarding the pathological data, the WG group differed in the tumor dimension, and the lymph nodes harvested (30  2 vs. 17  10, 9  5 vs. 3  4, p = 0.0028, and p = 0.005, respectively). Notably, no conversions and mortality were recorded. The overall morbidity was 25% ( eight patients) with no difference between the groups (p = 0.820). The mean length of stay was 8 days, and was similar between the groups (p = 0.350). CONCLUSIONS The present study suggests that RSPDP is a valid option for the treatment of benign or pre-malignant pancreatic diseases of the distal pancreas, with comparable morbidity with the standard treatment and no mortality.

Conversely, underlying molecular mechanisms and any beneficial effects remain unknown. This study shows anticancer efficacy for both T sinensis and A camphorata co-treatments that target HL-60 cells. The combination index values indicate that 40 g/mL of T sinensis and 25 g/mL of A camphorata as a combined treatment shows a synergetic effect, which reduces HL-60 cell proliferation. Alternately, this treatment exhibited no cytotoxic effects for human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Western blot data showed that T sinensis and A camphorata as a combined treatment result in augmented expression of apoptosis, cytochrome c release, Bcl-2 inhibition, expression of Bax, Fas, and FasL, as well as the cleavage of Bid in HL-60 cells. Moreover, this combined treatment overshadowed monotherapy in its ability to inhibit uPAR, MMP-9, MMP-2, COX-2 expression, and PGE(2) secretions. Our study strongly implies that this combined treatment offers more beneficial effects to suppress and treat leukemia due to apoptosis-mediated cell inhibition. Further in vivo studies related to the combined treatment could establish its future potential.","output":"The Leaf Extracts of Toona sinensis and Fermented Culture Broths of Antrodia camphorata Synergistically Cause Apoptotic Cell Death in Promyelocytic Leukemia Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an important public health issue of great concern at home and abroad, and it is still in the state of global pandemic.

METHODS This was a post hoc analysis of the Recovery by Endovascular Salvage for Cerebral Ultra-acute Embolism Japan Registry 2. Among 2420 patients in the registry, we evaluated patients with isolated M2 occlusion and those with functional independence before the stroke. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate and compare clinical outcomes between EVT and medical treatment. Additional propensity score-matched (PSM) analyses were performed. We performed subgroup analyses of the primary outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2 at 90 days) using forest plots of treatment effects. RESULTS Overall, 372 patients with M2 occlusion (n=184 EVT; n=188, medical treatment) were evaluated. The EVT group had a higher baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (median (IQR), 15 [9-19] vs 10 [5-16]) and earlier onset to hospital door time (110 [50-258] vs 150 [60-343] min) than the medical treatment group. After adjustment, EVT was significantly associated with higher odds of primary outcome (adjusted OR=2.09; 95% CI 1.26 to 3.47) and lower odds of mortality at 90 days (adjusted OR= 0.27; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.93). After PSM analyses (184 patients were 1:1 matched with each group), EVT was effective and safe relative to medical treatment. Effects favoring EVT were present in several subgroups of interest.

Previous research on the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal, to a certain extent, ignored or simplified the structure of dissemination networks and users cognition as well as decision-making and interaction behaviors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to roughly evaluate the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal; dig deeply into the attitude-based echo chamber effect on users responses to rumor rebuttal under multiple topics on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic; and evaluate the echo chambers impact on the information characteristics of user interaction content. METHODS: We used Sina Weibos application programming interface to crawl rumor rebuttal content related to COVID-19 from 10 AM on January 23, 2020, to midnight on April 8, 2020. Using content analysis, sentiment analysis, social network analysis, and statistical analysis, we first analyzed whether and to what extent there was an echo chamber effect on the shaping of individuals attitudes when retweeting or commenting on others tweets. Then, we tested the heterogeneity of attitude distribution within communities and the homophily of interactions between communities. Based on the results at user and community levels, we made comprehensive judgments. Finally, we examined users interaction content from three dimensionssentiment expression, information seeking and sharing, and civilityto test the impact of the echo chamber effect. RESULTS: Our results indicated that the retweeting mechanism played an essential role in promoting polarization, and the commenting mechanism played a role in consensus building. Our results showed that there might not be a significant echo chamber effect on community interactions and verified that, compared to like-minded interactions, cross-cutting interactions contained significantly more negative sentiment, information seeking and sharing, and incivility. We found that online users information-seeking behavior was accompanied by incivility, and information-sharing behavior was accompanied by more negative sentiment, which was often accompanied by incivility. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed the existence and degree of an echo chamber effect from multiple dimensions, such as topic, interaction mechanism, and interaction level, and its impact on interaction content. Based on these findings, we provide several suggestions for preventing or alleviating group polarization to achieve better rumor rebuttal.","output":"Echo Chamber Effect in Rumor Rebuttal Discussions About COVID-19 in China: Social Media Content and Network Analysis Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Social networks are taking over teenagers' lives and altering the way they relate to others. They are creating their own and changing culture. Which is a cause for concern for adults, who do not understand it. Moreover, usage peaks at a pivotal time in life: adolescence. Therefore it seems important to understand these new habits, and the reasons why social networks are such an important part of the life of adolescents. Furthermore, we looked into the question if virtual relationships have an impact on real-life relationships, and vice versa. SUBJECTS AND METHODS This literature review examined studies published between 2008 and September 2019. Twenty-five articles were selected from PubMed, Scopus, PsychINFO and Cochrane databases. RESULTS Above all, teenagers are motivated to use social networks because they can develop an identity based on an idealized profile. This profile must be at least as good as those of their peers, in order to obtain the latter's approval. This is notably the case in a context where changes to the family structure give a greater weight to the opinion of peers. Young people are driven to seek refuge on the Internet by a lack of family support, and parents who are less emotionally present. This effect could be limited by encouraging communication between teenagers and their parents. Finally, romantic relationships are impacted by the availability of pornography. Viewing pornography is increasingly seen as a normal stage of development and is linked to poorer attachment to peers and family. CONCLUSIONS The Internet seems to support a gradual detachment from family life and a move towards greater inclusion in the peer group.

While the general subject of working from home has recently drawn increased attention as a research focus, few studies have assessed which demographic subgroups may be more vulnerable to the potential mental health effects of working from home. Material and Methods: Data were from the Health, Ethnicity, and Pandemic Study (HEAP), a national survey conducted in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic in October 2020. The effects of working from home on psychological distress in 1,577 workers were examined via logistic regression, and stratified analyses were conducted to identify vulnerable subgroups. This analytic research project was reviewed and approved for exemption by the University of California, Los Angeles Institutional Review Board. Results: After adjustment for covariates, compared to workers who were not working from home, those who were working from home had higher odds of psychological distress (OR and 95% CI = 2.74 [1.49, 5.04]). Two subgroups, i.e., younger workers (<45 years) and women were identified to be associated with elevated psychological distress (ORs and 95% CIs were 3.23 [1.82, 5.76] and 3.70 [1.64, 8.34], respectively). Conclusions: Working from home is associated with psychological distress, and these associations are stronger in younger workers and in women.

Moreover, despite being sporadically reported, given that pulmonary hemorrhage may develop after regression and even disappearance of skin rash, the asynchronous progression of skin and lung lesions poses escalating challenges in the timely diagnosis. We herein presented a delayed diagnosis of late-onset pulmonary hemorrhage in a child with HSP after regression of purpuric rash. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 6-year and 3-month child with a history of self-resolved purpuric rash three weeks ago, presented acutely with cough and dyspnea but without fever. DIAGNOSES: The decreased hemoglobin and diffuse ground-glass opacities of both lungs on CT scan werent comprehensively evaluated. The child was initially misdiagnosed as pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS: Antibiotic treatment was initiated. However, no improvement of respiratory status was found following aggressive combination therapy. Bronchoscopy was subsequently performed. OUTCOMES: An diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with low inflammatory profile was noted after a bronchoscopy. Considering the history of HSP, the diagnosis of HSP-associated pulmonary hemorrhage was ultimately confirmed and the patient received corticosteroids with satisfactory results. LESSONS: Pulmonary hemorrhage could occur in children with HSP at late onset of disease after regression of skin rash. New-onset respiratory symptoms in patients with a history of HSP should heighten suspicion for pulmonary hemorrhage, particularly if presenting with lack of fever, sudden drop of hemoglobin, new pulmonary infiltrates and unresponsiveness to antibiotics therapy. Bronchoscopy should be performed early to confirm the diagnosis, specifically for children.","output":"A delayed diagnosis of late-onset pulmonary hemorrhage in a toddler with Henoch-Sch?nlein purpura after regression of skin rash: A case report and literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Myositis ossificans circumscripta (MOC) is a benign disease characterized by localized heterotopic bone formation within muscles or soft tissue, usually interesting great muscles of extremities.

Initial therapy with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and physiokinetic therapy gave only a slight improvement. A neck ultrasound showed an inhomogeneous right neck mass, with posterior shadowing due to calcifications. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a huge right neck mass, located in the paravertebral space with peripheral calcifications and mild central contrast enhancement. After surgical excision of the lesion, pathology revealed the presence of muscular tissue mixed with fibroblastic/myofibroblastic proliferation and ossification areas consistent with myositis ossificans.

The results showed that the lower ratio of DSi to[Formula: see text] (0.044  0.001) was mainly controlled by the domination of carbonate mineral in the sedimentary rock of the Yalongjiang River drainage basin. The DSi:[Formula: see text] ratio was positively correlated with discharge (P < 0.05), and negatively correlated with the water retention time (P < 0.01) and chlorophyll a, implying that the variations of DSi:[Formula: see text] ratio were mainly determined by the rock chemical weathering processes and the hydrologic process outside the reservoirs and the biological processes within the cascade reservoirs. The phytoplankton photosynthetic process stoichiometrically assimilated DSi and [Formula: see text], resulted in 3.46  104 tSi a-1 and 1.89  104 tC a-1 sequestering in the cascade reservoirs, respectively. Compared with the situation of dam-free in the lower reaches of Yalongjiang River, the export flux of [Formula: see text] and DSi at the mouth of Yalongjiang River was reduced by 11.87% and 62.50%, respectively; the ratio of DSi:[Formula: see text] decreased by 36.01% for only building the Ertan dam and 53.15% for the cascade damming, respectively.

This article introduces a unique approach to general surgery resident allocation by dividing patient care into separate inpatient care, operating care, and clinic care teams. Separate teams made up of all resident levels will work in each setting for a 1-week period. By creating this emergency structure, we have limited the number of surgery residents with direct patient contact and have created teams working in isolation from one another to optimize physical distancing while still performing required work. This also provides a resident reserve without exposure to the virus, theoretically flattening the curve among our general surgery resident cohort.

The combination of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), injurious invasive ventilation, micro/macro thrombi and the potential for direct myocardial injury create conditions where RVD is likely to occur. No study has prospectively explored the prevalence of RVD, and its association with mortality, in a cohort requiring mechanical ventilation. MethodsProspective, multi-centre, trans-thoracic echocardiographic, cohort study of ventilated patients with COVID-19 in Scottish intensive care units. RVD was defined as the presence of severe RV dilatation and interventricular septal flattening. To explore role of myocardial injury, high sensitivity troponin and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were measured in all patients. ResultsOne hundred and twenty-one patients were recruited to COVID-RV, 118 underwent imaging and it was possible to determine the primary outcome in 112. RVD was present in seven (6.2% [95%CI; 2.5%, 12.5%]) patients. Thirty-day mortality was 85.7% in those with RVD, compared to 44.8% in those without (p=0.051). Patients with RVD were more likely to have; pulmonary thromboembolism (p<0.001), higher plateau pressure (p=0.048), lower dynamic compliance (p=0.031), higher NT-proBNP (p<0.006) and more frequent abnormal troponin (p=0.048).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic caused increased number of orchiectomies in pediatric patients presenting with acute testicular torsion compared to pre-COVID-19 period. STUDY DESIGN: A total number of 119 pediatric patients who underwent surgery for acute testicular torsion from January 2019 to December 2020 were enrolled in retrospective multi-center study from six institutions in Croatia. The patients were divided in two groups. The first group (pre-COVID-19) consisted of the patients who underwent surgery before COVID-19 pandemic (n = 68), while the second group (COVID-19) consisted of the patients who underwent surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 51). Main outcomes of the study were orchiectomy rates and time from onset of the symptoms to emergency department presentation. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic period 43.1% (22/51) of the patients underwent orchiectomy while orchiectomy was performed in 16.2% (11/68) of the patients from the pre-COVID group (p = 0.001). Median time from onset of the symptoms to emergency department presentation during COVID-19 pandemic and pre-COVID-19 periods was 14h (IQR 5, 48) and 6h (IQR 3, 22) (p = 0.007), respectively.

The objective of this review is to examine the adaptations of psychiatric care in France during this pandemic. METHOD: This narrative review is based on the observation of changes made in French psychiatric hospitals and on an analysis of the literature. RESULTS: Regarding psychiatric hospitalization, the COVID-19 epidemic required rapid measures that profoundly modified the conditions of patients' reception, forcing the medical staffs to adapt their methods of care. The authors noted the creation of at least 89 wards specifically dedicated to patients with COVID-19 needing psychiatric hospitalization, allowing dual care of general medicine and psychiatry. Regarding ambulatory care, maintaining patients with long-term follow-up was a priority. Patients recalling and teleconsultation have been precious resources but cannot entirely replace face-to-face consultations. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 epidemic created unprecedented situation of large-scale upheavals in the healthcare system and in society. Despite the absence of previous recommendations on the subject, French psychiatry has shown great adaptability. Some changes could inspire post-COVID-19 care.","output":"[Responsiveness and sustainability of psychiatric care in France during COVID-19 epidemic]./ Ractivit et prennit des soins psychiatriques en France  l'preuve du COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epithelial surfaces throughout the body continuously sample and respond to environmental stimuli. The accessibility of lung epithelium to inhaled therapies makes it possible to stimulate local antimicrobial defences with aerosolized innate immune ligands. This strategy has been shown to be effective in preclinical models, as delivery of innate immune ligands to the lungs of laboratory animals results in protection from subsequent challenge with microbial pathogens. Survival of the animal host in this setting correlates directly with killing of pathogens within the lungs, indicating the induction of a resistance mechanism. Resistance appears to be mediated primarily by activated epithelial cells rather than recruited leucocytes. Resistance reaches a peak within hours and persists for several days. Innate immune ligands can interact synergistically under some circumstances, and synergistic combinations of innate ligands delivered by aerosol are capable of inducing a high level of broad host resistance to bacteria, fungi and viruses. The induction of innate antimicrobial resistance within the lungs could have clinical applications in the prevention of lower respiratory tract infection in subjects transiently at high risk. These include cancer patients undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy, intubated patients being mechanically ventilated, vulnerable individuals during seasonal influenza epidemics, asthmatic subjects experiencing a respiratory viral infection, and healthy subjects exposed to virulent pathogens from a bioterror attack or emergent pandemic. In summary, stimulation of the lung epithelium to induce localized resistance to infection is a novel strategy whose clinical utility will be assessed in the near future.","output":"Inhaled innate immune ligands to prevent pneumonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, we developed a deep learning model-based approach to forecast the spreading trend of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States.

Our aim is to describe characteristics and outcomes of the donor program at our stool bank. METHODS: Donor candidates underwent a four-step selection process, including a clinical interview, blood and stool testing, a further questionnaire and a direct stool testing the day of each donation. From March 2020, specific changes to this process were introduced to avoid the potential transmission of COVID-19. We evaluated the rate of excluded candidates at each step of the screening, as well as the number of total fecal aliquots provided by qualified donors. RESULTS: Overall, 114 donor candidates were evaluated. Seventy-five candidates declined to join the program for logistic or personal issues, three were excluded after the questionnaire and seven for positive stool exams. Finally, 29 (25%) subjects qualified as stool donors, and provided 70 stool samples. Fifteen samples were excluded after direct molecular stool testing. A total of 127 aliquots was finally obtained.

Adequate restoration of circulation and treatment of shock is key. Pediatric treatment guidelines of DKA have become standard but complexities arise in children with co-morbidities. Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by impaired kidney concentrating ability and treatment is challenging. NDI and DKA together have only been previously reported in one patient. CASE DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: We present the case of a 12-year-old male with NDI and new onset DKA with hyperosmolality. He presented in hypovolemic shock with altered mental status. Rehydration was challenging and isotonic fluid resuscitation resulted in increased urine output and worsening hyperosmolar state. Use of hypotonic fluid and insulin infusion led to lowering of serum osmolality faster than desired and increased the risk for cerebral edema. Despite the rapid decline in serum osmolality his mental status improved so we allowed him to drink free water mixed with potassium phosphorous every hour to match his urinary output (1:1 replacement) and continued 0.45% sodium chloride based on his fluid deficit and replacement rate with improvement in his clinical status.

ADARB1 encodes the enzyme ADAR2 that is highly expressed in the brain and essential to modulate the function of glutamate and serotonin receptors. Impaired ADAR2 editing causes early onset progressive epilepsy and premature death in mice. In humans, ADAR2 dysfunction has been very recently linked to a neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly and epilepsy in four unrelated subjects. METHODS: We studied three children from two consanguineous families with severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) through detailed physical and instrumental examinations. Exome sequencing (ES) was used to identify ADARB1 mutations as the underlying genetic cause and in vitro assays with transiently transfected cells were performed to ascertain the impact on ADAR2 enzymatic activity and splicing. RESULTS: All patients showed global developmental delay, intractable early infantile-onset seizures, microcephaly, severe-to-profound intellectual disability, axial hypotonia and progressive appendicular spasticity. ES revealed the novel missense c.1889G>A, p.(Arg630Gln) and deletion c.1245_1247+1 del, p.(Leu415PhefsTer14) variants in ADARB1 (NM_015833.4). The p.(Leu415PhefsTer14) variant leads to incorrect splicing resulting in frameshift with a premature stop codon and loss of enzyme function. In vitro RNA editing assays showed that the p.(Arg630Gln) variant resulted in a severe impairment of ADAR2 enzymatic activity. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these data support the pathogenic role of biallelic ADARB1 variants as the cause of a distinctive form of DEE, reinforcing the importance of RNA editing in brain function and development.","output":"Biallelic variants in ADARB1, encoding a dsRNA-specific adenosine deaminase, cause a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Researchers seek help from machine learning methods to alleviate the enormous burden of reading radiological images for clinicians under the COVID- 19 pandemic. However, clinicians often feel reluctant to trust AI-based models because of its black-box characteristic and lack of proper explainability. This paper proposes an explainable attention transfer classification model based on the knowledge distillation network structure to automatically differentiate COVID-19, community acquired pneumonia (CAP) from healthy lungs with radiographic imaging. The proposed network structure can be divided into teacher network and student network based on the attention transfer direction. Firstly, the teacher network extracts global features and concentrates on the infection regions to generate attention maps. We propose a deformable attention module (DAM) to strengthen infection regions response and suppress noise in irrelevant regions with expanded reception field. Moreover, combining essential information in original input, attention knowledge transfers from teacher network to student network via an image fusion module. Trained with teacher network jointly, the student branch with weighted dense connectivity can focus on irregularly shaped lesion regions to learn discriminative features and improve network performance. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on public chest X-ray and CT imaging datasets. The proposed architecture achieves state-of-art performance and improves the AI-based model's explainable ability by attention map, severity assessment, and prediction confidence.","output":"COVID-19 Automatic Diagnosis with Radiographic Imaging: Explainable AttentionTransfer Deep Neural Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on evidence gathered from a newly built large macroeconomic data set for the UK, labeled UK-MD and comparable to similar datasets for the US and Canada, it seems the most promising avenue for forecasting during the pandemic is to allow for general forms of nonlinearity by using machine learning (ML) methods.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: All laboratory confirmed dengue cases in Taiwan during 2009 and 2015 were included by CDC notifiable database. The self-controlled case-series design was used to evaluate the association between DENV infection and MACE (including acute myocardial infarction [AMI], heart failure and stroke). The \\"risk interval\\" was defined as the first 7 days after the diagnosis of DENV infection and the \\"control interval\\" as 1 year before and 1 year after the risk interval. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for MACE were estimated by conditional Poisson regression. Finally, the primary outcome of the incidence of MACEs within one year of dengue was observed in 1,247 patients. The IRR of MACEs was 17.9 (95% CI 15.80C20.37) during the first week after the onset of DENV infection observed from 1,244 eligible patients. IRR were significantly higher for hemorrhagic stroke (10.9, 95% CI 6.80C17.49), ischemic stroke (15.56, 95% CI 12.44C19.47), AMI (13.53, 95% CI 10.13C18.06), and heart failure (27.24, 95% CI 22.67C32.73).

In the absence of pharmaceutical treatment, various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to contain the spread of COVID-19 brought the entire world to a halt. After almost a year of seemingly returning to normalcy with the world's quickest vaccine development, the emergence of more infectious and vaccine resistant coronavirus variants is bringing the situation back to where it was a year ago. In the light of this new situation, we conducted a study to portray the possible scenarios based on the three key factors: impact of interventions (pharmaceutical and NPIs), vaccination rate, and vaccine efficacy. In our study, we assessed two of the most crucial factors, transmissibility and vaccination rate, in order to reduce the spreading of COVID-19 in a simple but effective manner. In order to incorporate the time-varying mutational landscape of COVID-19 variants, we estimated a weighted transmissibility composed of the proportion of existing strains that naturally vary over time. Additionally, we consider time varying vaccination rates based on the number of daily new cases. Our method for calculating the vaccination rate from past active cases is an effective approach in forecasting probable future scenarios as it actively tracks people's attitudes toward immunization as active cases change. Our simulations show that if a large number of individuals cannot be vaccinated by ensuring high efficacy in a short period of time, adopting NPIs is the best approach to manage disease transmission with the emergence of new vaccine breakthrough and more infectious variants.","output":"Incorporating the mutational landscape of SARS-COV-2 variants and case-dependent vaccination rates into epidemic models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: In this descriptive cross-sectional study we aimed, to assess the level of depression, anxiety, insomnia and distress symptoms experienced by healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia.

Among these therapeutic molecules, anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF-) antibodies were the first to revolutionize treatment algorithms in IBD. However, due to the parenteral route of administration and systemic mode of action, TNF- blockers are characterised by high rates of immunogenicity-related loss of response and serious adverse events.

From 2516 weaning cases documented in 2019, 2097 (83.3%) could primarily be successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation and only 120 (4.8%) had to be discharged with home ventilation. The mortality in this sample was 11.0% (na?= 276). The results of the survey demonstrate that prolonged weaning during early neurological and neurosurgical rehabilitation is an important and effective component of healthcare provision for critically ill patients in Germany.","output":"Weaning in der neurologisch-neurochirurgischen Frhrehabilitation - Ergebnisse der \\"WennFrh\\"-Studie der Deutschen Gesellschaft fr Neurorehabilitation./ [Weaning in neurological and neurosurgical early rehabilitation-Results from the \\"WennFrh\\" study of the German Society for Neurorehabilitation]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-protein) are promising therapeutics for COVID-19. However, natural bivalent nAbs suffer from limited potency and are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutated RBDs. We report a novel format that enables modular assembly of bi-paratopic, tetravalent nAbs with antigen-binding sites from two distinct nAbs. The diabody-Fc-Fab format consists of a central Fc with a bivalent diabody fused to its N-terminus and two Fabs fused to its C-terminus. The diabody and Fab modules do not interfere with each other, and thus, any diabody can be combined with any Fab in a facile manner. We engineered a diabody-Fc-Fab that contained the paratopes of two distinct nAbs derived from a phage-displayed library of synthetic Abs. The tetravalent nAb was purified in high yields with methods used to produce conventional IgGs, and it exhibited favorable biophysical characteristics comparable to those of approved therapeutic antibodies. The tetravalent nAb bound to the S-protein trimer at least 100-fold more tightly than the bivalent IgGs (apparent KD <1 pM). Most importantly, the tetravalent nAb exhibited extremely high potencies in neutralization assays across a panel of pseudoviruses representing seven natural SARS-CoV-2 variants (IC50  5 ng/mL), including several that resisted IgGs and are known to evade approved IgG drugs. Taken together, our results showed that the tetravalent diabody-Fc-Fab is a robust, modular platform for rapid production of drug-grade nAbs with potencies and breadth of coverage that far exceed those of conventional bivalent IgGs.","output":"Ultrapotent and Broad Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 Variants by Modular, Tetravalent, Bi-paratopic Antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has drastically changed the life of every person and has infected people in 185 countries.

Presentation of case. A 42-year old man was hospitalized for Covid-19 pneumonia. Fever, respiratory symptoms and hypoxemia significantly improved over the next 2 weeks, but the patient developed abdominal pain, nausea, and low-grade fever. Computed tomography scan revealed absence of contrast enhancement of gallbladder wall and a micro-perforation of the fundus. At laparoscopy, gallbladder gangrene was confirmed and a subtotal cholecystectomy performed. Special precautions were adopted for patient transportation from the ward to a dedicated operating room, and two teams with adequate personal protective equipment took charge of the procedure. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 7 under protective lockdown measures for 2 weeks. DISCUSSION: The pathogenesis of acute acalcolous gangrenous cholecystitis is multifactorial. It is unknown whether a prothrombotic state induced by COVID-19 contributes to wall ischemia and perforation. Percutaneous cholecystostomy should be avoided in patients with gallbladder gangrene. Contraindications to laparoscopy are not evidence-based since aerosolization is produced during both open and laparoscopic surgical procedures.

Serum samples from patients diagnosed with falciparum malaria (FM) (n = 20), vivax malaria (VM) (n = 17) and healthy controls (HC) (n = 20) were investigated using multiple proteomic techniques and results were validated by employing immunoassay-based approaches. Specificity of the identified malaria related serum markers was evaluated by means of analysis of leptospirosis as a febrile control (FC). Compared to HC, 30 and 31 differentially expressed and statistically significant (p<0.05) serum proteins were identified in FM and VM respectively, and almost half (46.2%) of these proteins were commonly modulated due to both of the plasmodial infections. 13 proteins were found to be differentially expressed in FM compared to VM. Functional pathway analysis involving the identified proteins revealed the modulation of different vital physiological pathways, including acute phase response signaling, chemokine and cytokine signaling, complement cascades and blood coagulation in malaria. A panel of identified proteins consists of six candidates; serum amyloid A, hemopexin, apolipoprotein E, haptoglobin, retinol-binding protein and apolipoprotein A-I was used to build statistical sample class prediction models. By employing PLS-DA and other classification methods the clinical phenotypic classes (FM, VM, FC and HC) were predicted with over 95% prediction accuracy.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between in-hospital use of ACEI/ARB and all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension and hospitalized due to COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective, multi-center study included 1128 adult patients with hypertension diagnosed with COVID-19, including 188 taking ACEI/ARB (ACEI/ARB group; median age 64 [interquartile range, 55-68] years; 53.2% men) and 940 without using ACEI/ARB (non-ACEI/ARB group; median age 64 [interquartile range 57-69]; 53.5% men), who were admitted to 9 hospitals in Hubei Province, China from December 31, 2019 to February 20, 2020. In mixed-effect Cox model treating site as a random effect, after adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, and in-hospital medications, the detected risk for all-cause mortality was lower in the ACEI/ARB group versus the non-ACEI/ARB group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.19-0.92]; P=0.03). In a propensity score-matched analysis followed by adjusting imbalanced variables in mixed-effect Cox model, the results consistently demonstrated lower risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients who received ACEI/ARB versus those who did not receive ACEI/ARB (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.15-0.89]; P=0.03). Further subgroup propensity score-matched analysis indicated that, compared with use of other antihypertensive drugs, ACEI/ARB was also associated with decreased mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.12-0.70]; P=0.01) in patients with COVID-19 and coexisting hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and coexisting hypertension, inpatient use of ACEI/ARB was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with ACEI/ARB nonusers. While study interpretation needs to consider the potential for residual confounders, it is unlikely that in-hospital use of ACEI/ARB was associated with an increased mortality risk.","output":"Association of Inpatient Use of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers With Mortality Among Patients With Hypertension Hospitalized With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 (corona virus disease 2019) is a kind of acute severe pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV (2019-nCoV) infection.

During the period of admission, under the condition of tertiary protection, nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, blood, feces and anal swabs of COVID-19 cases were collected many times in the isolation ward for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection. All biological samples are sealed and transferred to the laboratory in strict accordance with the standard process. The RT-PCR test kits (BioGerm) were recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The same technician and brand of test kit was used for all RT-PCR testing reported; both internal controls and negative controls were routinely performed with each batch of tests. Results: | 132 the results of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of various biological samples during the treatment of confirmed COVID-19 cases are as follows: the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of nasopharyngeal swab is 38.13% (180/472 times), the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of sputum is 48.68% (148/304 times), the positive rate of blood 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test is 3.03% (4/132 times), and the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of feces is 9.83% (24/244 times).

OBJECTIVE: The study aims to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with an emphasis on cardiovascular compromises, compared with past outbreaks of influenza AH1N1, to identify prognostic factors of severity. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 72 subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 was conducted. Subjects were evaluated in two groups: 38 hospitalized patients and 34 patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Data from different outbreaks of influenza AH1N1 were then compared with this group. RESULTS: The 34 subjects in the ICU had higher levels of high sensible troponin, D dimer, creatinine, and leukocytes compared with the 38 hospitalized subjects. The lymphocytes count was diminished in 85.29% of ICU subjects. When compared with AH1N1 patients, it was found that SARS-CoV2 patients were 10 years older on average. The proportion of overweight and obese SARS-CoV2 patients was double that in the influenza outbreaks. In addition, it was observed that a high number of SARS-CoV2 subjects presented with diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: There were various clinical and severity differences between each of these outbreaks. However, viral respiratory infection diseases such as SARS-CoV2 are a significant risk factor for acute ischemic, functional, and structural cardiovascular complications. The only way to combat this risk is a prevention approach, specifically through vaccines, but also through measures that force drastic changes in health policies to reduce perhaps the worst of pandemics, obesity, and its metabolic consequences.","output":"Clinical and cardiovascular characteristics from subjects with in COVID-19 and viral outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This paper aims to explore how the Italian wine industry discloses corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices and quality certifications and the corresponding determinants via websites.

Lastly, the paper investigates how the relationship between the size of wineries and CSR disclosure changes according to firms' geographic location. Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyses CSR corporate communication via the websites of a sample of Italian wineries by adjusting the theoretical framework developed by Amran (2012) to the wine sector's peculiarities. Moreover, a cross-certification analysis and a moderation analysis were performed to fulfil the purpose of the research. Findings: The analysis revealed the extensive use of CSR disclosure via websites. It was found that company size positively affects CSR disclosure and Quality Certification Disclosure (QCD), while geographic location slightly moderates the relationship between the two variables. In addition, a negative relationship between CSR disclosure and corporate financial performance and its reverse causality emerged. Moreover, for most wineries, information consistency between the quality certificates reported on corporate websites and official database statements was observed. Research limitations/implications: The study's main limitation is that the search process was performed during lockdown. Therefore, the examined issues could change in the near future due to the shift in priorities that the COVID-19 pandemic is determining.

In most settings microglia perform a surveillance role in the brain detecting and responding to invaders to maintain homeostasis. However, microglia have also been implicated in producing harm possibly by changing its phenotype from its beneficial, anti-inflammatory state (termed M2) into an injurious pro-inflammatory state (termed M1); it is likely that there are intermediates states between these polar phenotypes and some consider that a gradient exists with a number of intermediates, rather than a strict dichotomy between M1 and M2. In the pro-inflammatory phenotypes, microglia can disrupt synaptic plasticity such as long- term potentiation that can result in disorders of learning and memory of the type observed in Peri-operative Neurocognitive Disorders. Therefore, investigators have sought strategies to prevent microglia from provoking this adverse event in the perioperative period. In preclinical studies microglia can be depleted by removing trophic factors required for its maintenance; subsequent repopulation with a more beneficial microglial phenotype may result in memory enhancement, improved sensory motor function, as well as suppression of neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. Another approach consists of preventing microglial activation using the non-specific P38 MAP kinase blockers such as minocycline. Perhaps a more physiologic approach is the use of inhibitors of potassium (K(+)) channels that are required to convert the microglia into an active state. In this context the specific K(+) channels that are implicated are termed Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 and high selective inhibitors for each have been developed. Data are accumulating demonstrating the utility of these K(+) channel blockers in preventing Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorders.","output":"The Role of Microglia in Perioperative Neuroinflammation and Neurocognitive Disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This cross-sectional study evaluated and quantified the possible association of psychological symptoms and health status ratings on the burnout of healthcare workers from a tertiary medical center.

They provide education, stimulate discussion, and build faculty reputation. The COVID-19 pandemic led to cancellations in teaching conferences and lost opportunities for all of the above starting in March 2020. The social medial hashtag #VirtualPathGR and @VirtualPathGR Twitter (San Francisco, CA) accounts (VPGR) were created to address a need for continued engagement in academic pathology, during and after periods of physical distancing. METHODS: #VirtualPathGR was first used on March 21, 2020 to assess interest in a VPGR format. Six pathologists organized a social-media based platform, utilizing video conferencing. Zoom (San Jose, CA) was selected because it is free and easy to use. A committee developed criteria for inviting hosts and speakers, developed a logo and template for announcements and promoted VPGR. Potential speakers were selected initially via self-nomination and subsequently by selections from the VPGR board. Free pre-registration was required to minimize risk of disruption by malicious actors. Academic institutions served as hosts similar to traditional GR, and the speaker was introduced by one of the VPGR board members. Evaluations were sent to participants via the chat function in Zoom. Lectures were recorded and archived via YouTube (San Bruno, CA). RESULTS: As of May 1, #VirtualPathGR has 2.6 million impressions and the Twitter account has 808 followers. From April 2 to May 1, five VPGR were held with 1,720 registrations (average 344 per event) and 829 Zoom attendees overall (average 165 per event). 4 separate academic host institutions were involved and speakers included Assistant to Full Professors. Participants from 16 different countries attended the live sessions. The archived talks have been viewed 954 times via YouTube. VPGR received support from the American Society for Clinical Pathology (Chicago, IL), leading to a partnership to provide CME credit. CONCLUSION: VPGR serves as strong proof of concept of the ability and demand for high quality academic pathology talks to be given remotely. VPGR promotes academic engagement and provides career-building opportunities by partnering with host universities. While remote learning comes with challenges, VPGR shows that the pathology community can harness the power of remote technologies to enhance learning across the world, now and in the future.","output":"Excellence Available Everywhere: The Virtual Pathology Grand Rounds Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The efficacy of antidepressants in post-stroke depressive symptoms (PSD) varies. We aimed to examine whether the effect of escitalopram on PSD differs according to individual depressive symptoms and stroke lesion location. METHODS This is a post hoc analysis of EMOTION (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01278498), a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial that examined the efficacy of escitalopram on depression in acute stroke patients (237 with placebo, 241 with escitalopram). Depressive symptoms were evaluated with the 10-item Montgomery-?sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Changes in MADRS and individual item scores at 12 weeks were compared between the treatment groups and among the stroke lesion location groups. Stroke lesion locations were grouped according to the anatomical distribution of serotonin fibers that originate from the midbrain/pons and spread to the forebrain via subcortical structures: \\"Midbrain-Pons,\\" \\"Frontal-Subcortical,\\" and \\"Others.\\" Least-squares means were calculated to demonstrate the independent effect of lesion location. RESULTS Total MADRS scores decreased more significantly in the escitalopram than in the placebo group, while a significant effect of escitalopram was observed in only 3 items: apparent sadness, reported sadness, pessimistic thoughts. In the lesion location analyses, escitalopram users in the Frontal-Subcortical group showed significant improvement in total MADRS scores (placebo [n = 130] vs. escitalopram [n = 148], least-square mean [95% CI]: -2.3 [-3.5 to -0.2] vs. -4.5 [-5.5 to -3.4], p = .005), while those in the Midbrain-Pons and Others groups did not.

METHODS: From March 2-13 of 2020, 4,618 health professionals in China were included in an anonymous, self-rated online survey regarding their concerns on exposure to the COVID-19 outbreak. The questionnaires consisted of five parts: basic demographic information and epidemiological exposure; occupational and psychological impact; concerns during the episode; coping strategies; and the Huaxi Emotional-Distress Index (HEI). RESULTS: About 24.2% of respondents experienced high levels of anxiety or/and depressive symptoms since the COVID-19 outbreak. Respondents who worried about their physical health and those who had COVID-19 infected friends or close relatives were more likely to have high HEI levels, than those without these characteristics. Further, family relationship was found to have an independent protective effect against high HEI levels. Their main concerns were that their families would not be cared for and that they would not be able to work properly. Compared to respondents with clear emotional problems, those with somewhat hidden emotional issues adopted more positive coping measures. CONCLUSIONS: About a quarter of medical staff experienced psychological problems during the pandemic of COVID-19.

The purpose of our article is to describe clinical characteristics and multimodal imaging, that can help the diagnosis and treatment of PICCPs. METHODS Narrative review with multimodal imaging analysis. RESULTS Choriocapillaris non-perfusion can affect the end-choriocappilaries, at the benign end of the PICCP spectrum (MEWDS), to larger choriocapillaris vessels or precapillary vessels at the origin of more severe forms such as acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE), idiopathic multifocal choroiditis (MFC) and Serpiginous Choroiditis (SC). Diagnosis is mostly based on multimodal imaging and especially on indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)/OCT-angiography (OCT-A). ICGA shows the typical pattern of patchy lobular hypofluorescence reflecting hypo- or non-perfusion of the choriocapillaris that can also take the aspect of geographic areas in the more severe forms. Treatment depends on the severity of the disease and goes from observation in MEWDS and some mild cases of APMPPE, to oral corticosteroid and/or immunomodulator agents in the more severe conditions of APMPPE and MFC and SC cases. Close multimodal monitoring is crucial in order to introduce or adjust treatment. CONCLUSION PICCPs are resulting from one common clinicopathological mechanism, inflammatory choriocapillaris hypo- or non-perfusion. ICGA findings are essential for the diagnosis and follow-up of PICCPs, but non-invasive methods such as FAF and SD-OCT/OCT-A also have their role especially in follow-up of the diseases.

However, the changes of cytokine profiles of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, as well as the underlying mechanisms that are involved, remain unknown. Using a cytokine array containing 174 inflammation-related cytokines, we found significantly altered cytokine profiles in severe COVID-19 patients compared with those in mild patients or healthy controls, and identified leptin, CXCL-10, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-&#945; as the top differentially expressed cytokines. Notably, leptin showed high consistency with CXCL-10 and TNF-&#945; in predicting disease severity, and correlated with body mass index, decreased lymphocyte counts, and disease progression. Further analysis demonstrated that monocytes in severe patients with higher leptin levels were inclined toward M1 polarization. Mechanistic studies revealed that leptin synergistically up-regulated expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and surface markers with IL-6 in monocytes through STAT3 and NF-&#954;B signaling pathways. Collectively, our results suggest that overweight COVID-19 patients were prone to have higher leptin levels, which further activated monocytes, resulting in amplified or dysregulated immune responses.

Coronavirus is readily mutating from one variant to another. Among the several variants, we selected SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 in this study. Upon infection of any virus, ideally, the phagocytic cells of the host engulf and destroy the virus by a mechanism called phagocytosis. However, compromised immunity impairs phagocytosis, and thus, restoring the immune system is crucial for a speedy recovery of infected patients. The autophagy and activation of Toll-like receptor-4 are the only ways to restore innate immunity. Recently, immunocompromised COVID-19 patients have been suffering from the coinfection of black fungus. Rhizomucor, a black fungus species, causes more than 75% of cases of mucormycosis.

The HTLV viruses (CPID: 32.8  3.4) resemble HIV-2 (C PID: 26.6  2.9) with a moderately disordered capsid. Totally distinct patterns, however, are seen for the non-primate retroviruses. They generally have highly disordered nucleocapsids (PID > 65%) and more ordered outer shells especially the matrix. These characteristics might be attributed to the differences in the way the retroviruses are transmitted, with non-primate viruses having greater non-sexual transmission components such as oral-fecal transmission. These differences are also evolutionarily related to the ways the viruses evade the host immune systems, and thus, have implications for oncolytic virotherapy and animal models in vaccine research. The importance of protein shell disorder in immune evasion, as related to the case of HIV-1, and the difficult search for its vaccines are highlighted.","output":"Shell disorder, immune evasion and transmission behaviors among human and animal retroviruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objective COVID-19 pandemic continues unabated due to the rapid spread of new mutant strains of the virus. Decentralized cluster containment is an efficient approach to manage the pandemic in the long term, without straining the healthcare system and economy. In this study, the objective is to forecast the peak and duration of COVID-19 spread in a cluster under different conditions, using a probabilistic cellular automata configuration designed to include the observed characteristics of the pandemic with appropriate neighbourhood schemes and transition rules. Methods The cellular automata, initially configured to have only susceptible and exposed states, enlarges and evolves in discrete time steps to different infection states of the COVID-19 pandemic. The transition rules take into account the probability and proximity of contact between infected hosts and susceptible individuals. A transmittable and transition neighbourhoods are defined to identify the most probable individuals infected from a single host in a time step. Results The model with novel neighbourhood schemes and transition rules reproduce the macroscopic behaviour of infection and recovery observed in pandemics. The temporal evolution of the pandemic trajectory is sensitive to lattice size, range, latent and recovery periods but has constraints in capturing the changes in the infectious period. A study of lockdown and migration scenarios shows strict social isolation is crucial in controlling the pandemic. The simulations also indicate that earlier vaccination with a higher capacity and rate is essential to mitigate the pandemic. A comparison of simulated and actual data shows a good match. Conclusions The study concludes that social isolation during movement and interaction of people can limit the spread of new infections. Vaccinating a large proportion of the population reduces new cases in subsequent waves of the pandemic. The model and algorithm with real-world data as input can quickly forecast the trajectory of the pandemic, for effective response in cluster containment.","output":"A model based on cellular automata for investigating the impact of lockdown, migration and vaccination on COVID-19 dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2(SARS-Cov2) virus replicates in the nasal cavity, nasopharynx, and the oropharynx. During oral surgery, the risk of viral transmission is high during instrumentation in these areas, while performing airway management procedures, the oral surgery itself, and related procedures. During the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patients with an oral pathology usually present for emergency procedures. However, patients with oral cancer, being a semi-emergency, may also present for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. When elective surgeries are resumed, these patients will come to the operating room. In asymptomatic patients, the false-negative rate can be as high as 30%. These patients are a source of infection to the healthcare workers and other patients. This mandates universal precautions to be taken for all patients presenting for surgery. Lesions along the airway, distorted anatomy secondary to cancer therapy, shared airway with the surgeon, surgical handling of the airway and the risk of bleeding, make airway management challenging in these patients, especially while wearing personal protective equipment. Airway management procedures, oral surgery, use of cautery, and other powered surgical instruments in the aero digestive tract, along with constant suctioning are a source of significant aerosol generation, further adding to the risk of viral transmission. Maintaining patient safety, while protecting the healthcare workers from getting infected during oral surgery is paramount. Meticulous advance planning and team preparation are essential.

Only a few laboratories routinely isolate the virus, which is because the current co-culture strategy is highly time-consuming and requires working in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. This work aimed to develop a new high-throughput isolation strategy using novel technologies for rapid and automated isolation of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We used an automated microscope based on high-content screening (HCS), and we applied specific image analysis algorithms targeting cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 on Vero E6 cells. A randomized panel of 104 samples, including 72 that tested positive by RT-PCR and 32 that tested negative, were processed with our HCS strategy and were compared to the classical isolation procedure. RESULTS: The isolation rate was 43% (31/72) with both strategies on RT-PCR-positive samples and was correlated with the initial RNA viral load in the samples, in which we obtained a positivity threshold of 27 Ct. Co-culture delays were shorter with the HCS strategy, where 80% (25/31) of the positive samples were recovered by the third day of co-culture, compared to only 26% (8/30) with the classic strategy. Moreover, only the HCS strategy allowed us to recover all the positive samples (31 with HCS versus 27 with classic strategy) after 1 week of co-culture. CONCLUSIONS: This system allows the rapid and automated screening of clinical samples with minimal operator workload, which reduces the risk of contamination, thus paving the way for future applications in clinical microbiology, such as large-scale drug susceptibility testing.","output":"High-speed large-scale automated isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples using miniaturized co-culture coupled to high-content screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Timely access to emergency funding has been identified as a bottleneck for outbreak response in Nigeria.

METHODS: Subjects wearing a basic surgical facemask and the rubber band mask brace underwent quantitative fit testing using machinery designed to certify N95 mask fit. Subjects were tested with the brace anchored behind their ears, with a paperclip behind the head, and on the side knobs of their face shields. The primary outcome measure was whether the subject passed the quantitative fit test at or above the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)\\\\verified standard for N95 masks.

The causes of coagulopathy are poorly understood. Aim: To investigate the relationship between von Willebrand factor (VWF) biomarkers, intravascular hemolysis, coagulation, and organ damage in COVID19 patients and to study their association with disease severity and mortality. Methods: 181 hospitalized adult COVID19 patients were randomly selected with a balanced distribution of survivors and non-survivors during the period of March 26(th) 2020 to May 5(th) 2020. The medical records and laboratory values were reviewed. Statistical analysis was performed using R studio V.3.6.2. Results: Patients who died (n=90) had significantly lower ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) activity, elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, increased schistocyte/RBC fragment counts, and elevated VWF antigen and activity levels compared to patients discharged alive (n=91). In 31 patients, we measured several of these biomarkers on two or more occasions. The trending of ADAMTS13 activity illustrated that it is not steady throughout the hospitalization course. ADAMTS13 activity levels tended to improve and/or reach normal levels in patients that survived, yet ADAMTS13 activity levels worsened in most patients that died. Likewise, the VWF antigen and activity levels tended to decrease in patients that survived whereas tended to increase well above the normal range (2-3 folds) in patients that died. D-Dimer levels trended downwards in survivors, sometimes to levels less than 1 g/ml, yet tended to increase in patients who died. Given the relationship between ADAMTS13 activity and mortality, we wanted to determine a cut-point of initial ADAMTS13 activity (within 72 hours from admission) to predict mortality. 102 patients in our cohort had an ADAMTS13 activity measurement within this timeframe. We determined that this optimal cut-point of initial ADAMTS13 activity was 43% using Youdens J statistic. Only 30% of patients who had an ADAMTS13 activity level of less than 43% on admission survived, yet 60% of patients survived who had an ADAMTS13 activity level of greater than 43% on admission. Conclusions: COVID-19 may present with low ADAMTS13 activity in a subset of hospitalized patients. Presence of schistocytes/RBC fragment and elevated D-dimer levels on admission may warrant a work-up for ADAMTS13 activity and VWF antigen and activity levels.

Except for the group B virus which has caused widespread outbreaks of quite severe diarrhoea in adults in China (still not reported from outside China) these novel rotaviruses are rarities in the human and probably represent uncommon zoonotic infections.

Respondents completed a Demographic, Social Rejection, Resilience and General Well\\\\being questionnaire. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty\\\\seven nurses responded. The majority were female with a mean age of 43.6 years Approximately one\\\\third were worried about infecting their family members and many agreed that their family fears that the nurse will infect them. Nurses reported their partner, family members, neighbours and the public physically distanced themselves from them. Approximately one quarter reported feeling lonely. Statistically significant differences were found between those who worked versus not work on a COVID\\\\19 unit on general well\\\\being, and social rejection. No differences were found in resilience scores. CONCLUSIONS: Social rejection was felt by many nurses as shown by an inverse relationship between the closeness of the relationship and the sense of social rejection and a high level of loneliness and depression. A higher level of social rejection and lower well\\\\being were found among nurses working on COVID\\\\19 wards as opposed to those who did not. General well\\\\being was found to be exceptionally low during COVID\\\\19. Resilience did not mediate the relationship between social rejection and general well\\\\being. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Perceived social rejection might be associated with decreased well\\\\being. The level of resilience is related to the level of well\\\\being among nurses in general.

As a public health measure, efficient screening methods are needed to determine the functional effects of new sequence variants. Here we show that structural modeling of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding to the human ACE2 receptor, the first step in host-cell entry, predicts many novel variant combinations with enhanced binding affinities. By focusing on natural variants at the Spike-hACE2 interface and assessing over 700 mutant complexes, our analysis reveals that high-affinity Spike mutations (including N440K, S443A, G476S, E484R, G502P) tend to cluster near known human ACE2 recognition sites (K31 and K353). These Spike regions are conformationally flexible, allowing certain mutations to optimize interface interaction energies. Although most human ACE2 variants tend to weaken binding affinity, they can interact with Spike mutations to generate high-affinity double mutant complexes, suggesting variation in individual susceptibility to infection. Applying structural analysis to highly transmissible variants, we find that circulating point mutations S447N, E484K and N501Y form high-affinity complexes (~40% more than wild-type). By combining predicted affinities and available antibody escape data, we show that fast-spreading viral variants exploit combinatorial mutations possessing both enhanced affinity and antibody resistance, including S447N/E484K, E484K/N501Y and K417T/E484K/N501Y. Thus, three-dimensional modeling of the Spike/hACE2 complex predicts changes in structure and binding affinity that correlate with transmissibility and therefore can help inform future intervention strategies.","output":"Structural modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike/human ACE2 complex interface can identify high-affinity variants associated with increased transmissibility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We aim to analyze the risk factors for pneumothorax associated with computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous core needle biopsy (PCNB) of the lung. Whether the lung function characteristics are related to pneumothorax is unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 343 patients who received CT-guided pulmonary PCNBs and underwent preoperative pulmonary function testing. Demographical, lesion-related, procedure-related features and histopathological diagnosis, as well as results of pulmonary function test were analyzed as risk factors of pneumothorax RESULTS: Variables associated with higher rate of pneumothorax were location of lesion, presence of emphysema, and dwell time. The proportion of middle lobe, lingular, or lower lobe lesions in pneumothorax group (30/50, 60.0%) is higher than non-pneumothorax group (113/293, 38.6%). The incidence of emphysema in pneumothorax group was significantly higher than that in non-pneumothorax group (34.0% vs. 7.5%). Obstructive pulmonary function abnormalities, not restrictive, mixed ventilation function abnormalities and small airway dysfunction, correlated with pneumothorax. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed lower location of lesion sampled and presence of emphysema were independent predictors of pneumothorax. Although dwell time, FEV(1)/FVC ratio, FEF(50%), FEF(75%) and FEF(25C75%) were significantly correlated with pneumothorax on univariate analysis, these were not confirmed to be independent predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with obstructive pulmonary dysfunction have a higher risk of pneumothorax.

As the average age of the population increases, the incidence of such fractures also raises, resulting in high healthcare costs. The type of surgical devices employed for their surgical management influences these costs. METHODS A comparative clinical study was conducted on patients operated by one single surgeon between December 2018 and November 2020 in a high-volume regional referral centre. All patients who received a Zimmer Natural Nail (ZNN) or ELOS devices were included. RESULTS In 119 (66.48%) of the 179 fractures, a ZNN nail was used. Post-operatively, the TAD (tip-to-apex distance) was measured at an average value of 17.05 (4.42-41.85) mm and the CalTAD (calcar-referenced TAD) at an average of 20.76 (10.82-43.63) mm. The mean hospitalization time was 10.19 (4-22) days. In the other 60 trochanteric fractures, an ELOS nail was used. Post-operative imaging indicated a TAD of 19.65 (5.08-31.4) mm and a CalTAD of 22.86 mm (12.66-33.77). The average time of the operation was 45.82 (20-110) min.

Several experimental studies have shown that this treatment has been used effectively to treat RH. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of ablation parameters (i.e., electrode length, applied voltage, ablation time, and blood flow) on the temperature distribution using a balloon-based array electrodes system. A simplified three-dimensional model including four electrodes and a balloon was established. The balloon diameter was 3 mm and placed in a 5 mm diameter renal artery for forming intra-arterial occlusion. Four electrodes were mounted on the balloon and distributed in the same plane to mimic circumferential RF ablation. Computer simulations were conducted to investigate the thermal performances of the device by setting different electrode configurations, treatment protocols, and physiological factors. The thermal performances including the thermal distribution, maximum lesion depth, length, and area were analyzed. The lesion shape of the array RF electrodes was approximately a sphere with a 100% circumference coverage rate of the renal artery. The lesion depth and length increase with each factor except for blood velocity. Increasing the electrode length from 2 to 4 mm or 2 to 6 mm, the lesion depth increases by 1.15 mm and 0.54 mm at 60 s. The corresponding lesion length increases by 2.65 mm and 2.34 mm, respectively. The range of effective lesion depth is 1.90-4.90 mm, at a voltage of 15-30 V. But the peak temperature at the arterial outer wall exceeded 100 C when the voltage is above 25 V. In tissue, the degree of thermal injury in the 2 mm area reached 100%, but in blood was not more than 5%. There was no significant difference at different flow conditions because the difference value in lesion depth was not exceeded 0.5 mm. The results showed that the balloon-based four electrodes system is expected to overcome the difficulty of incomplete ablation. In clinical application, 2 mm-electrode is recommended to avoid long wall damage as much as possible and control the voltage below 25 V. This treatment has little thermal injury on the blood, which means it may avoid coagulation formation. Moreover, the application of this device does not need to consider the difference in individual blood velocity.","output":"Evaluating the thermal performance of a balloon-based renal sympathetic denervation system with array electrodes: a finite element study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Malware creators have been very opportunistic in creating novel malware by leveraging the vulnerabilities which can be either at system level or environmental level.

METHOD A cross-sectional study using WhatsApp and Facebook social media platforms was conducted to survey 1,057 young people aged 15 to 24 years from six Middle Eastern countries. Participants completed survey items including demographic and COVID-19-related questions; the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS); the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS); and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. RESULTS The prevalence of experienced loneliness was 1 (0.1%), 625 (59.1%), 429 (40.6%), and 2 (0.2%), reflecting low, moderate, moderately high, and high experiences for loneliness, respectively.

Higher concentrations of myeloperoxidase, a source of reactive oxygen species, were observed in the septic patients relative to healthy controls (194 vs. 14 mg/mL, p < 0.0001). In contrast to neutrophils from healthy volunteers, the neutrophils from septic patients demonstrated elevated uptake of extracellular ascorbate. Overall, neutrophils from septic patients exhibited comparable intracellular ascorbate content to those from healthy controls, despite the patients presenting with hypovitaminosis C. The mechanisms involved are currently uncertain, but could include increased generation of dehydroascorbic acid in septic patients, enhanced basal activation of their neutrophils or upregulation of their vitamin C transporters.","output":"Neutrophils Isolated from Septic Patients Exhibit Elevated Uptake of Vitamin C and Normal Intracellular Concentrations despite a Low Vitamin C Milieu"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background/Aims: Although a majority of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases were characterized as mild, data assessing the development of pneumonia in mild COVID-19 patients are limited. We aimed to examine the effect of pneumonia development on the clinical course of mild COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted via medical record review between February 25, 2020 and April 11, 2020 at a single center. The impact of pneumonia development on the time to viral clearance in mild COVID-19 patients was evaluated. Risk factors associated with the development of pneumonia were also identified. Results: Chest radiographs revealed the development of pneumonia in 26.8% of mild COVID-19 patients. The time to pneumonia development was a median of 8.0 days from the onset of symptoms and 3.5 days after hospital admission. A multivariate analysis for predicting pneumonia development identified age &#8805; 65 years (odds ratio [OR], 3.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14 to 8.73), cough (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.29 to 3.68), dyspnea (OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.10 to 11.69), and diarrhea (OR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.51 to 4.78) as significant variables. The time to negative conversion was longer in mild COVID-19 patients who developed pneumonia (23.6 days vs. 18.4 days, p = 0.003). In Kaplan-Meier estimation and multivariate Cox regression analyses, newly developed pneumonia was significantly related with delayed time to negative conversion (log-rank test, p = 0.02; hazard ratio, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.06 to 7.97). Conclusions: The development of pneumonia delayed viral clearance in patients with mild COVID-19. Elderly patients or those suffering from diarrhea should be closely monitored, given the increased risk of developing pneumonia.","output":"Clinical implication and risk factor of pneumonia development in mild coronavirus disease 2019 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previously, antioxidants have not been evaluated for treatment of parvoviral diarrhea in dogs.

Materials and methods: Relevant literature pertaining to COVID-19 and dentistry was scrutinized on electronic search engines including PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane. Guidelines given by various organizations, institutions, national and international regulatory bodies and Indian Prosthodontic Society were also consulted to gather information pertaining to the objectives of our review. Results: and observations: A total of 160 articles including cross-sectional studies, in vitro study, narrative reviews, letters to the editor and opinions were found to be relevant in accordance with our search strategy. Documented literature revealed that Covid-19 pandemic has culminated in serious clinical, financial and psychological implications in the field of dentistry. Certain steps such as adoption of teledentistry, judicious use of protective equipment, use of rubber dams, pre-procedural rinses have been suggested unanimously. However, there is a dearth of evidence-based recommendations in literature. Data regarding consequences of delaying prosthodontic procedures and patients' perspectives is also sparse.

A literature search was conducted that included Medline?-cited peer-reviewed articles published in the past 10 years in order to identify impact data and post-implementation of a multidisciplinary VAT that support the benefits to patient safety and satisfaction and to hospital efficiencies reported in the interview program.Results: While VATs vary in structure and function, clarity of purpose and supportive training and education are key. Barriers to the implementation of VATs show commonality across countries, such as lack of investment, insufficient training and lack of awareness. Proven markers of VAT success include rapid referrals, improved patient outcomes and improved organizational efficiency. Standardization of outcomes data capture, processing and reporting are key to monitoring performance against baseline.

Over 1,900 cases have been reported to date, with 36% fatality rate. Lack of autopsies from MERS cases has hindered understanding of MERS-CoV pathogenesis. A small animal model that develops progressive pulmonary manifestations when infected with MERS-CoV would advance the field. As mice are restricted to infection at the level of DPP4, the MERS-CoV receptor, we generated mice with humanized exons 10-12 of the mouse Dpp4 locus. Upon inoculation with MERS-CoV, human DPP4 knockin (KI) mice supported virus replication in the lungs, but developed no illness. After 30 serial passages through the lungs of KI mice, a mouse-adapted virus emerged (MERSMA) that grew in lungs to over 100 times higher titers than the starting virus. A plaque-purified MERSMA clone caused weight loss and fatal infection. Virus antigen was observed in airway epithelia, pneumocytes, and macrophages. Pathologic findings included diffuse alveolar damage with pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation associated with accumulation of activated inflammatory monocyte-macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs. Relative to the parental MERS-CoV, MERSMA viruses contained 13-22 mutations, including several within the spike (S) glycoprotein gene. S-protein mutations sensitized viruses to entry-activating serine proteases and conferred more rapid entry kinetics. Recombinant MERSMA bearing mutant S proteins were more virulent than the parental virus in hDPP4 KI mice. The hDPP4 KI mouse and the MERSMA provide tools to investigate disease causes and develop new therapies.","output":"Mouse-adapted MERS coronavirus causes lethal lung disease in human DPP4 knockin mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary: Mango is one of the most widely consumed fresh fruit in the world with an export volume valued at approximately USD 3 billion in 2019. Understanding how consumers perceive quality is crucial to improve and strengthen the overall mango value chain performance in many producing countries. This systematic literature review evaluates and discusses the methods adopted in the identified studies and synthesises the quality attributes and characteristics preferred that have been analysed in a specific market. The results show three main findings: (i) a majority of the identified studies used sensory analysis, which was does not capture the general consumers' perception of quality;(ii) the synthesis reveals that there are a limited number of studies in major importing countries despite the growth of global mango export and (iii) although there were thirty\\\\three mango quality attributes identified, there was no comprehensive information on consumer perception in any specific market available due to the variability of methods adopted in the studies. Future studies need to obtain detailed information such as the importance of a mango quality attribute, the characteristic preferred in each identified important attribute and the willingness to pay for a combination of mango quality attributes and characteristics.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the probabilities of a clinically meaningful reduction in mortality for remdesivir and systemic corticosteroids. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a probabilistic re-analysis of clinical trial data for corticosteroids and remdesivir in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 using a Bayesian random effects meta-analytic approach. Studies were identified from existing meta-analyses performed by the World Health Organization. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Posterior probabilities of an absolute decrease in mortality compared with control patients, by subgroups based on oxygen requirements, were calculated for corticosteroids and remdesivir. Probabilities of &#8805;1%, &#8805;2% and &#8805;5% absolute decrease in mortality were quantified. RESULTS: For patients needing mechanical ventilation, the probability of &#8805;1% absolute decrease in mortality was 4% for remdesivir and 93% for corticosteroids. For patients needing supplemental oxygen without mechanical ventilation, the probability of &#8805;1% absolute decrease in mortality was 81% for remdesivir and 93% for dexamethasone. Finally, for patients who did not need oxygen support, the probability of &#8805;1% absolute decrease in mortality was 29% for remdesivir and 4% for dexamethasone. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Using a Bayesian analytic approach, remdesivir had low probability of achieving a clinically meaningful reduction in mortality, except for patients needing supplemental oxygen without mechanical ventilation. Corticosteroids were more promising for patients needing oxygen support, especially mechanical ventilation. While awaiting more definitive studies, this probabilistic interpretation of the evidence will help to guide treatment decisions for clinicians, as well as guideline and policy makers.","output":"Remdesivir and systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19: A Bayesian re-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND To present the struggle of a high volume liver transplant center against coronavirus infectious disease-2019 pandemic. METHODS Between March 2020 and December 2020, the demographic and clinical data of staff and liver transplant candidates diagnosed with coronavirus infectious disease-2019 in our Liver Transplant Institute were prospectively analyzed. RESULTS First, 32 healthcare staff were diagnosed with coronavirus infectious disease-2019, and 6 of them were surgeons. Six staff were asymptomatic, while 24 staff had mild or moderate and 2 staff had severe coronavirus infectious disease-2019. All the staff recovered from the disease without any permanent sequela and returned to duty after 2 consecutive negative polymerase chain reaction results within 24-hour intervals. Second, during the preoperative investigation, 6 living liver donor candidates and 13 recipients were tested positive for coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (son = 6, unrelated = 3, cousin = 3, daughter = 2, cadaveric = 1). Eleven patients received favipiravir and 8 did not receive any treatment because they were asymptomatic. Only one recipient who had severe coronavirus infectious disease-2019 died due to multiple organ failure syndrome. One recipient died in the early postoperative period. The median duration from the initial diagnosis of the patients till the transplant procedure was 21 days (min-max: 14-105 days). During the time of operation, the polymerase chain reaction tests of the donors and the recipients were negative, and the thorax tomography images showed no signs of viral pneumonia. CONCLUSION Meticulous precautions, multidisciplinary approach, team effort, and organization of facilities can increase the quality of care of these patients in the coronavirus infectious disease-2019 era.

As obesity is strongly associated with socio-economic status, excluding its use from the public system will deny many of the most in-need access to a potentially very effective treatment. Alternatively, with rigorous follow-up and behavioural change requirements, highly successful outcomes in the private system may not translate to the public system. METHODS The Alfred Hospital rapidly expanded bariatric surgery from 2007. A 6-year prospective follow-up study was conducted with annual review of weight, co-morbidities, retention in follow-up, serum HbA1c, quality of life and patient satisfaction. RESULTS There were 1453 patients. Procedures were predominantly laparoscopic-adjustable gastric bands (n = 861). Patient details were age 49  11 years, body mass index 50.7  11.2 kg/m(2) and weight 139.0  30.2 kg. There was no mortality, and mean length of stay was 1.1  1.2 days. Follow-up was 98% (1 year) and 85% (6 years). Weight loss was 22  13.1 kg (32.8  18% excess weight loss) at 1 and 30.1  16.8 kg (60  28%) at 6 years. The mean number of co-morbidities was 4.2  1.1 with significant improvements observed. Patient satisfaction was 7.7  2.3 out of 10.

The bovine O118:H16 EHEC strain was able to colonize the gut of three newborn calves, and to induce diarrhoea twenty-four hours after challenge and to produce AE lesions in the small and/or large intestines. AE lesions were detected microscopically and ultrastructurally in the small intestine of one calf and in the whole intestinal track of two calves. Internalization of bacteria and also of pedestal-bacteria complex inside of the enterocyte was observed in two of the three calves. The significance of this stage is unknown but may be related to the invasion of the calf by the bacteria. The challenge strain was isolated from the mesenteric lymph nodes of the same two calves but not from other organs or from heart blood. No blood was observed in the faeces of any of the three calves, nor were any lesions in the internal organs, which may have been related to the production of a verotoxin whose role is still unknown in cattle.","output":"Clinical signs, reproduction of attaching/effacing lesions, and enterocyte invasion after oral inoculation of an O118 enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli in neonatal calves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: It is known that viral infections are epidemiologically prevalent and some of them are harmful to the central nervous system (CNS) due to the development of neuropsychiatric syndromes which affect the cognitive, affective, behavioral and perceptual domains.

Previous studies have revealed that some proteins in silkworm digestive juice show antiviral activity. In this study, antiviral activity examination of different resistant strains showed that the digestive juice of the resistant strain (A35) had higher inhibition to virus than the susceptible strain (P50). Subsequently, the label-free quantitative proteomics was used to study the midgut digestive juice response to BmNPV infection in P50 and A35 strains. A total of 98 proteins were identified, of which 80 were differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) with 54 enzymes and 26 nonenzymatic proteins by comparing the proteomes of infected and non-infected P50 and A35 silkworms. These DEPs are mainly involved in metabolism, proteolysis, neuroactive ligand receptor interaction, starch and sucrose metabolism and glutathione metabolism. After removing the genetic background and individual immune stress response proteins, 9 DEPs were identified potentially involved in resistance to BmNPV. Further studies showed that a serine protease, an alkaline phosphatase and serine protease inhibitor 2 isoform X1 were differentially expressed in A35 compared to P50 or post BmNPV infection. Taken together, these results provide insights into the potential mechanisms for silkworm digestive juice to provide resistance to BmNPV infection. Signifcance: Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is highly pathogenic, which has a great impact on the sericulture. BmNPV entered the midgut lumen and exposed to digestive juices after oral infection. Previous studies have revealed that some proteins in silkworm digestive juice show antiviral activity, however, current information on the digestive juice proteome of high resistant silkworm strain after BmNPV challenge compared to susceptible strain is incomprehensive. Here, we combined label-free quantification method, bioinformatics, RT-qPCR and western blot analysis and found that BmNPV infection causes some protein changes in the silkworm midgut digestive juice.

Recent advances in treatment techniques and parameters for laser cyclophotocoagulation has expanded its role in today's glaucoma practice. In this review, we discuss the treatment outcomes of slow-coagulation continuous-wave transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (CW-TSCPC) as a glaucoma surgical procedure for multiple types of glaucoma in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP). RECENT FINDINGS Slow-coagulation TSCPC is a relatively new technique for CW-TSCPC that, unlike the 'pop' power titration technique of laser energy delivery, aims to avoid the production of the 'pop' sound that signals explosive inflammatory energy delivery to the ciliary body and nearby tissue. In slow-coagulation TSCPC, laser energy is applied in a fixed and lower amount over a longer duration, compared with the conventional pop technique. This laser energy approach leads to more stable, reliable, titratable, and selective ciliary body ablation for control of IOP, especially relative to the controversial current use of micropulse TSCPC. SUMMARY Slow-coagulation CW-TSCPC can be used safely, efficiently, reproducibly, and efficaciously in wide range of glaucoma types including those with no history of incisional surgeries, good visual acuity, and medically refractory glaucomas.","output":"Clinical outcomes of slow-coagulation continuous-wave transscleral cyclophotocoagulation laser for treatment of glaucoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To compare self-taken and healthcare worker (HCW)-taken throat/nasal swabs to perform rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for SARS-CoV-2, and how these compare to RT-PCR.

Design A prospective diagnostic accuracy evaluation as part of the Facilitating Accelerated Clinical Evaluation of Novel Diagnostic Tests for COVID -19 (FALCON C-19), workstream C (undifferentiated community testing). Setting NHS Test and Trace drive-through community PCR testing site (Liverpool, UK). Participants Eligible participants 18 years or older with symptoms of COVID-19. 250 participants recruited; one withdrew before analysis. Sampling Self-administered throat/nasal swab for the Covios RDT, a trained HCW taken throat/nasal sample for PCR and HCW comparison throat/nasal swab for RDT. Main outcome measures Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were calculated; comparisons between self-taken and HCW-taken samples used McNemars test. Results Seventy-five participants (75/249, 30.1%) were positive by RT-PCR. RDTs with self-taken swabs had a sensitivity of 90.5% (67/74, 95% CI: 83.9-97.2), compared to 78.4% (58/74, 95% CI: 69.0-87.8) for HCW-taken swabs (absolute difference 12.2%, 95% CI: 4.7-19.6, p=0.003). Specificity for self-taken swabs was 99.4% (173/174, 95% CI: 98.3-100.0), versus 98.9% (172/174, 95% CI: 97.3-100.0) for HCW-taken swabs (absolute difference 0.6%, 95% CI: 0.5-1.7, p=0.317). The PPV of self-taken RDTs (98.5%, 67/68, 95% CI: 95.7-100.0) and HCW-taken RDTs (96.7%, 58/60, 95% CI 92.1-100.0) were not significantly different (p=0.262). However, the NPV of self-taken swab RDTs was significantly higher (96.1%, 173/180, 95% CI: 93.2-98.9) than HCW-taken RDTs (91.5%, 172/188, 95% CI 87.5-95.5, p=0.003). Conclusion Self-taken swabs for COVID-19 testing offer substantial individual benefits in terms of convenience, accuracy, and reduced risk of transmitting infection.

It has been recently suggested that SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS may differ from usual non-SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS by higher respiratory system compliance (C(RS)), lower potential for recruitment with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) contrasting with severe shunt fraction. The purpose of the study was to systematically assess respiratory mechanics and recruitability in SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS. METHODS: Gas exchanges, C(RS) and hemodynamics were assessed at 2 levels of PEEP (15 cmH(2)O and 5 cmH(2)O) within 36 h (day1) and from 4 to 6 days (day 5) after intubation. The recruited volume was computed as the difference between the volume expired from PEEP 15 to 5 cmH(2)O and the volume predicted by compliance at PEEP 5 cmH(2)O (or above airway opening pressure). The recruitment-to-inflation (R/I) ratio (i.e. the ratio between the recruited lung compliance and C(RS) at PEEP 5 cmH(2)O) was used to assess lung recruitability. A R/I ratio value higher than or equal to 0.5 was used to define highly recruitable patients. RESULTS: The R/I ratio was calculated in 25 of the 26 enrolled patients at day 1 and in 15 patients at day 5. At day 1, 16 (64%) were considered as highly recruitable (R/I ratio median [interquartile range] 0.7 [0.55C0.94]) and 9 (36%) were considered as poorly recruitable (R/I ratio 0.41 [0.31C0.48]). The PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio at PEEP 15 cmH(2)O was higher compared to PEEP 5 cmH(2)O only in highly recruitable patients (173 [139C236] vs 135 [89C167] mmHg; p < 0.01). Neither PaO(2)/FiO(2) or C(RS) measured at PEEP 15 cmH(2)O or at PEEP 5 cmH(2)O nor changes in PaO(2)/FiO(2) or C(RS) in response to PEEP changes allowed to identify highly or poorly recruitable patients. CONCLUSION: In this series of 25 patients with SARS-Cov-2 associated ARDS, 64% were considered as highly recruitable and only 36% as poorly recruitable based on the R/I ratio performed on the day of intubation. This observation suggests that a systematic R/I ratio assessment may help to guide initial PEEP titration to limit harmful effect of unnecessary high PEEP in the context of Covid-19 crisis.","output":"Recruitability and effect of PEEP in SARS-Cov-2-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preventing communicable diseases requires understanding the spread, epidemiology, clinical features, progression, and prognosis of the disease.

Similarities with bacterial sepsis were observed; however, few studies specifically addressed differences of immune response between both conditions. Here, we report a longitudinal analysis of the immune response in coronavirus disease 2019 patients, its correlation with outcome, and comparison between severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients and septic patients. DESIGN Longitudinal, retrospective observational study. SETTING Tertiary-care hospital during the first 2020 coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in France. PATIENTS All successive patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection admitted to the emergency department, medical ward, and ICU with at least one available immunophenotyping performed during hospital stay. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Between March and April 2020, 247 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 were included and compared with a historical cohort of 108 severe septic patients. Nonsevere coronavirus disease 2019 patients (n = 153) presented normal or slightly altered immune profiles. Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (n = 94) immune profile differed from sepsis. Coronavirus disease 2019 exhibited profound and prolonged lymphopenia (mostly on CD3, CD4, CD8, and NK cells), neutrophilia, and human leukocyte antigen D receptor expression on CD14+ monocytes down-regulation. Surprisingly, coronavirus disease 2019 patients presented a unique profile of B cells expansion, basophilia, and eosinophilia. Lymphopenia, human leukocyte antigen D receptor expression on CD14+ monocytes down-regulation, and neutrophilia were associated with a worsened outcome, whereas basophilia and eosinophilia were associated with survival. Circulating immune cell kinetics differed between severe coronavirus disease 2019 and sepsis, lack of correction of immune alterations in coronavirus disease 2019 patients during the first 2 weeks of ICU admission was associated with death and nosocomial infections. CONCLUSIONS Circulating immune cells profile differs between mild and severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Severe coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a unique immune profile as compared with sepsis. Several immune features are associated with outcome. Thus, immune monitoring of coronavirus disease 2019 might be of help for patient management.","output":"Comparison of Circulating Immune Cells Profiles and Kinetics Between Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Bacterial Sepsis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As affordable senior housing communities aimed to address the health and well-being concerns of residents in the COVID-19 pandemic, special attention to safety during renovation had to be addressed.

Over 190,000 patients from all 50 states with SARS-CoV-2 results performed mid-March through mid-June, 2020 and matching 25(OH)D results from the preceding 12 months were included. Residential zip code data was required to match with US Census data and perform analyses of race/ethnicity proportions and latitude.

The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was 9.3% (95% C.I. 9.2C9.5%) and the mean seasonally adjusted 25(OH)D was 31.7 (SD 11.7). The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was higher in the 39,190 patients with deficient 25(OH)D values (<20 ng/mL) (12.5%, 95% C.I. 12.2C12.8%) than in the 27,870 patients with adequate values (30C34 ng/mL) (8.1%, 95% C.I. 7.8C8.4%) and the 12,321 patients with values 55 ng/mL (5.9%, 95% C.I. 5.5C6.4%). The association between 25(OH)D levels and SARS-CoV-2 positivity was best fitted by the weighted second-order polynomial regression, which indicated strong correlation in the total population (R(2) = 0.96) and in analyses stratified by all studied demographic factors. The association between lower SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates and higher circulating 25(OH)D levels remained significant in a multivariable logistic model adjusting for all included demographic factors (adjusted odds ratio 0.984 per ng/mL increment, 95% C.I. 0.983C0.986; p<0.001).

We estimated the parameters of a novel mathematical model of hospital infection using SARS episode data. These estimates described levels of transmission between the index super-spreader, staff and patients, and were used to compare three plausible hypotheses. The broadest of the supported hypotheses ascribes the initial surge in cases to a single super-spreading individual and suggests that the per capita risk of infection to patients increased approximately one month after the start of the outbreak. Our estimate for the number of cases caused by the SSE is substantially lower than the previously reported values, which were mostly based on self-reported exposure information. This discrepancy suggests that the early identification of the index case as a super-spreader might have led to biased contact tracing, resulting in too few cases being attributed to staff-to-staff transmission.

Network pharmacology research is very suitable for the analysis of multiple components, multiple targets, and multiple pathways of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). According to the relevant theory, we first carefully collected and screened the active ingredients in ZSS and received 11 active ingredients that may work. The targets going along with these active components were also strongly related to insomnia targets, 108 common genes were identified, and drug-compound-gene symbol-disease visualization network and protein-protein interaction network were constructed. Forty-eight core genes were identified by PPI analysis and subjected to GO functional analysis with KEGG pathway analysis. The results of GO analysis pointed that there were 998 gene ontology items for the treatment of insomnia, including terms of 892 biological processes, 47 cellular components, and 59 molecular functions. It mainly shows the coupling effect and transport mode of some proteins in the biological pathways of ZSS in the treatment of insomnia and explains the mechanism of action through the connection between the target and the cell biomembrane. KEGG enrichment analyzed 19 signaling pathways, which were collectively classified into seven categories. We have identified the potential pathways of ZSS against insomnia and obtained the regulatory relationship between core genes and pathways and know that the same target can be regulated by multiple components at the same time.

METHODS Four hundred and two SARS patients were selected based on the diagnostic criteria for SARS from Ministry of Health, China. Of them, 358 SARS patients were selected as their clinical manifestations conformed to the diagnostic criteria of serious SARS. The study subjects were divided into two groups. One group consisted of the patients with serious SARS (358 patients), and they either underwent invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation or died of the disease. The remaining 44 SARS patients constituted the non-serious SARS group. Taking the lowest value of oxygen index (OI) as the main index, the OI was categorized into 3 classes, namely< or =200 mm Hg (1 mm Hg=0.133 kPa) as 1,200-300 mm Hg as 2, and >300 mm Hg as 3. According to this index, the seriousness and the prognosis were analyzed. RESULTS OI less than 300 mm Hg were identified as the unequivocal serious SARS patients, and the mistake judgement rate was 6.800%. Furthermore mortality and complications were compared with Logistic regression, and questionable SARS patients were excluded. The results showed that the patients identified with OI less than 300 mm Hg had worse outcome than the original ones diagnosed with criteria of Ministry of Health.

We observed a correlation between anti-spike (S) immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, length of hospitalization and clinical parameters associated with worse clinical progression. Although high anti-S IgG levels correlated with worse disease severity, such correlation was time dependent. Deceased patients did not have higher overall humoral response than discharged patients. However, they mounted a robust, yet delayed, response, measured by anti-S, anti-receptor-binding domain IgG and neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels compared to survivors. Delayed seroconversion kinetics correlated with impaired viral control in deceased patients. Finally, although sera from 85% of patients displayed some neutralization capacity during their disease course, NAb generation before 14 d of disease onset emerged as a key factor for recovery.

Surface electromyography recordings of skeletal trunk muscles are commonly contaminated with spike shaped artifacts. This artifact originates from electrical heart activity, recorded by electrocardiography, commonly present in the surface electromyography signals recorded in heart proximity. For appropriate assessment of neuromuscular changes by means of surface electromyography, application of a proper filtering technique of electrocardiography artifact is crucial. METHODS A novel method for automatic artifact cancellation in surface electromyography signals by applying fractional order calculus and nonlinear median filter is introduced. The proposed method is compared with the linear moving average filter, with and without prior application of fractional order calculus. 3D graphs for assessment of window lengths of the filters, crest factors, root mean square differences, and fractional calculus orders (called WFC and WRC graphs) have been introduced. For an appropriate quantitative filtering evaluation, the synthetic electrocardiography signal and analogous semi-synthetic dataset have been generated. The examples of noise removal in 10 able-bodied subjects and in one patient with muscle dystrophy are presented for qualitative analysis. RESULTS The crest factors, correlation coefficients, and root mean square differences of the recorded and semi-synthetic electromyography datasets showed that the most successful method was the median filter in combination with fractional order calculus of the order 0.9. Statistically more significant (p < 0.001) ECG peak reduction was obtained by the median filter application compared to the moving average filter in the cases of low level amplitude of muscle contraction compared to ECG spikes. CONCLUSIONS The presented results suggest that the novel method combining a median filter and fractional order calculus can be used for automatic filtering of electrocardiography artifacts in the surface electromyography signal envelopes recorded in trunk muscles.","output":"ECG artifact cancellation in surface EMG signals by fractional order calculus application."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to quantify and compare the decline in volumes of cardiovascular procedures between the United States and non-US institutions during the early phase of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the care of many non-COVID-19 illnesses. Reductions in diagnostic cardiovascular testing around the world have led to concerns over the implications of reduced testing for cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. METHODS: Data were submitted to the INCAPS-COVID (International Atomic Energy Agency Non-Invasive Cardiology Protocols Study of COVID-19), a multinational registry comprising 909 institutions in 108 countries (including 155 facilities in 40 U.S. states), assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on volumes of diagnostic cardiovascular procedures. Data were obtained for April 2020 and compared with volumes of baseline procedures from March 2019. We compared laboratory characteristics, practices, and procedure volumes between U.S. and non-U.S. facilities and between U.S. geographic regions and identified factors associated with volume reduction in the United States. RESULTS: Reductions in the volumes of procedures in the United States were similar to those in non-U.S. facilities (68% vs. 63%, respectively; p = 0.237), although U.S. facilities reported greater reductions in invasive coronary angiography (69% vs. 53%, respectively; p < 0.001). Significantly more U.S. facilities reported increased use of telehealth and patient screening measures than non-U.S. facilities, such as temperature checks, symptom screenings, and COVID-19 testing. Reductions in volumes of procedures differed between U.S. regions, with larger declines observed in the Northeast (76%) and Midwest (74%) than in the South (62%) and West (44%). Prevalence of COVID-19, staff redeployments, outpatient centers, and urban centers were associated with greater reductions in volume in U.S. facilities in a multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We observed marked reductions in U.S. cardiovascular testing in the early phase of the pandemic and significant variability between U.S. regions. The association between reductions of volumes and COVID-19 prevalence in the United States highlighted the need for proactive efforts to maintain access to cardiovascular testing in areas most affected by outbreaks of COVID-19 infection.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Cardiovascular Testing in the United States Versus the Rest of the World: The INCAPS-COVID Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, ultrasound has emerged as an effective tool for bedside monitoring of patients.

The pandemic has required pain clinics to transition in-person visits to telemedicine, postpone procedures and cancel face-to-face educational sessions. There are no data on how fellowship programs have adapted. METHODS A 17-question survey was developed covering topics including changes in education, clinical care, and psychological stress due to the COVID pandemic. The survey was hosted by Qualtrics Inc. and disseminated by the Association of Pain Program Directors on April 10, 2020 to program directors at ACGME-accredited fellowships. Results are reported descriptively and stratified by COVID infection rate, which was calculated from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data on state infections, and census data. RESULTS Among 107 surveys distributed, 70 (65%) programs responded. Twenty-nine programs were located in states in the upper tertile for per capita infection rates, 17 in the middle third, and 23 in the lowest tertile. Nearly all programs (93%) reported a decreased workload, with 11 (16%) reporting a dramatic decrease (only urgent or emergent cases). Just over half of programs had either already deployed (14%) or credentialed (39%) fellows to provide non-pain care. Higher state infection rates were significantly associated with reduced clinical demand (Rs = 0.31, 95% CI [0.08, 0.51], P = .011) and redeployment of fellows to non-pain areas (Rs = 0.30, 95% CI [0.07, 0.50], P = .013). Larger program size but not infection rate was associated with increased perceived anxiety level of trainees. CONCLUSIONS We found a shift to online alternatives for clinical care and education, with correlations between per capita infection rates, and clinical care demands and redeployment, but not with overall trainee anxiety levels. It is likely that medicine in general, and pain medicine in particular, will change after COVID-19, with greater emphasis on telemedicine, virtual education, and greater national and international cooperation.

These events can be caused by a large number of infectious and noninfectious agents and are associated with an increased local and systemic inflammatory response. Their frequency and severity have been linked to progressive deterioration in lung function and health status. Infectious pathogens ranging from viral to atypical and typical bacteria have been implicated in the majority of episodes. Most therapeutic regimens to date have emphasized broad, nonspecific approaches to bronchoconstriction and pulmonary inflammation. Increasingly, therapy that targets specific etiologic pathogens has been advocated. These include clinical and laboratory-based methods to identify bacterial infections. Further additional investigation has suggested specific pathogens within this broad class. As specific antiviral therapies become available, better diagnostic approaches to identify specific pathogens will be required. Furthermore, prophylactic therapy for at-risk individuals during high-risk times may become a standard therapeutic approach. As such, the future will likely include aggressive diagnostic algorithms based on the combination of clinical syndromes and rapid laboratory modalities to identify specific causative bacteria or viruses.","output":"Pathogen-directed therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The core pathology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is infection of airway cells by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that results in excessive inflammation and respiratory disease, with cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome implicated in the most severe cases.

Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease and/or traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and advanced age, are at the highest risk of death from COVID-19.

We highlight the distinct contributions of coagulopathy, thrombocytopathy and endotheliopathy to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and discuss potential therapeutic strategies in the management of patients with COVD-19. Harnessing the expertise of the biomedical and clinical communities is imperative to expand the available therapeutics beyond anticoagulants and to target both thrombocytopathy and endotheliopathy.

DPP-4, originally known as 'T-cell antigen CD26', is expressed in many immune cells and regulates their functions, so the initial concern over the use of DPP-4is was the possible increased susceptibility to infections. Furthermore, because of the high affinity between human DPP-4 and the spike (S) receptor-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it was suspected that this virus, responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), might be able to use the DPP-4 enzyme as a functional receptor to gain entry into the host. However, DPP-4is also exert anti-inflammatory effects, which could be beneficial in patients exposed to cytokine storms due to COVID-19. Yet, when observational (mostly retrospective) studies compared clinical outcomes in DPP-4i users vs non-users among diabetes patients with COVID-19, the overall results regarding the risk of progression towards more severe forms of the disease and mortality were heterogeneous, thereby precluding any definite conclusions. Nevertheless, new expectations have arisen following recent reports of significant reductions in admissions to intensive care units and mortality in DPP-4i users. However, given the limitations inherent in such observational studies, any available results should be considered, at best, as hypothetical and only suggestive of potentially substantial benefits with DPP-4is in diabetes patients with COVID-19. While the safe use of DPP-4is in COVID-19 patients appears to be an acceptable hypothesis, all such positive findings still need to be confirmed in randomized controlled trials (a few of which are currently ongoing) before any recommendations can be made for clinical practice.","output":"DPP-4 inhibition and COVID-19: From initial concerns to recent expectations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may help to discover therapeutic targets. METHODS: To determine the metabolomic profile of circulating plasma from COVID-19 survivors with pulmonary sequelae 3 months after discharge, a random, outcome-stratified case-control sample was analyzed. We enrolled 103 recovered COVID-19 patients as well as 27 healthy donors, and performed pulmonary function tests, computerized tomography (CT) scans, laboratory examinations, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Plasma metabolite profiles of COVID-19 survivors with abnormal pulmonary function were evidently different from those of healthy donors or subjects with normal pulmonary function. These alterations were associated with disease severity and mainly involved amino acid, and glycerophospholipid metabolic pathways. Furthermore, increased levels of triacylglycerols, phosphatidylcholines, prostaglandin E2, arginine, and decreased levels of betain and adenosine were associated with pulmonary CO diffusing capacity and total lung capacity. The global plasma metabolomic profile differed between subjects with abnormal and normal pulmonary function.

Reducing inequalities is particularly pertinent in light of the Covid-19 outbreak which has exacerbated already widening inequalities in health. This study aimed to explore understandings of inequality, the anticipated pathways for reducing inequalities among CYP and key factors affecting the development and implementation of policy to reduce inequalities among CYP at a local level. METHODS: We carried out a qualitative case study of one local government region in the North of England (UK), comprising semi structured interviews (n = 16) with service providers with a responsibility for child health, non-participant observations of key meetings (n = 6 with 43 participants) where decisions around child health are made, and a local policy documentation review (n = 11). We employed a novel theoretical framework, drawing together different approaches to understanding policy, to guide our design and analysis. RESULTS: Participants in our study understood inequalities in CYP health almost exclusively as socioeconomically patterned inequalities in health practices and outcomes. Strategies which participants perceived to reduce inequalities included: preventive support and early intervention, an early years/whole family focus, targeted working in local areas of high deprivation, organisational integration and whole system/place-based approaches. Despite demonstrating a commitment to a social determinants of health approach, efforts to reduce inequalities were described as thwarted by the prevalence of poverty and budget cuts which hindered the ability of local organisations to work together. Participants critiqued national policy which aimed to reduce inequalities in CYP health for failing to recognise local economic disparities and the interrelated nature of the determinants of health. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased calls for a 'whole systems' approach to reducing inequalities in health, significant barriers to implementation remain. National governments need to work towards more joined up policy making, which takes into consideration regional disparities, allows for flexibility in interpretation and addresses the different and interrelated social determinants of health. Our findings have particular significance in light of Covid-19 and indicate the need for systems level policy responses and a health in all policies approach.","output":"Exploring the local policy context for reducing health inequalities in children and young people: an in depth qualitative case study of one local authority in the North of England, UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the etiologic agent responsible for COVID-19 coronavirus disease, is a global threat To better understand viral tropism, we assessed the RNA expression of the coronavirus receptor, ACE2, as well as the viral S protein priming protease TMPRSS2 thought to govern viral entry in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from healthy individuals generated by the Human Cell Atlas consortium We found that ACE2, as well as the protease TMPRSS2, are differentially expressed in respiratory and gut epithelial cells In-depth analysis of epithelial cells in the respiratory tree reveals that nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and ciliated cells, display the highest ACE2 expression of all the epithelial cells analyzed The skewed expression of viral receptors/entry-associated proteins towards the upper airway may be correlated with enhanced transmissivity Finally, we showed that many of the top genes associated with ACE2 airway epithelial expression are innate immune-associated, antiviral genes, highly enriched in the nasal epithelial cells This association with immune pathways might have clinical implications for the course of infection and viral pathology, and highlights the specific significance of nasal epithelia in viral infection Our findings underscore the importance of the availability of the Human Cell Atlas as a reference dataset In this instance, analysis of the compendium of data points to a particularly relevant role for nasal goblet and ciliated cells as early viral targets and potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 infection This, in turn, serves as a biological framework for dissecting viral transmission and developing clinical strategies for prevention and therapy","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Entry Genes Are Most Highly Expressed in Nasal Goblet and Ciliated Cells within Human Airways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unforeseen outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic has significantly stipulated the use of plastics to minimize the exposure and spread of the novel coronavirus.

The collected data was weighted to generalize the study sample for the reference population. The analysis was conducted using multiple linear regression models. The mediation effect was tested according to the Baron and Kenny approach. RESULTS The obtained results indicate that internet use for instrumental purposes is directly related to a better QoL of elderly Polish males.

This study aimed to find differences and changes in the physical activity behavior of owners of ten different dog breeds that were selected based on their size and energy level. Nine dog breed groups were used and owners filled out an online physical activity questionnaire once per year for three years. The results show that dog owners total and dog-related physical activity as well as their leisure time and dog walking decreased over time. Owners of the dog breed groups differed in all physical activity variables. If only participants who completed the study were analyzed, no changes in any physical activity variable were found. At baseline, owners of different dog breeds differed in the types of reported dog-related activities. Overall, the results indicate that physical activity behavior in dog owners is stable over time. However, no clear pattern could be found based on the age, size and energy level of the dogs. ABSTRACT: Dog ownership contributes positively to physical activity (PA). The impact of different dog breeds and age on PA is less investigated in longitudinal studies. This study aimed to evaluate PA changes in dog owners as their dogs ages increased and to explore whether there are differences in PA between owners of different breeds over a three-year period. Owners of different dog breeds were categorized into nine groups according to the perceived energy level and size of the breed. PA was monitored using an online questionnaire for three consecutive years. Linear mixed models (LMM) showed a small, but significant decrease in total PA, leisure time walking, dog-related PA and dog walking over three years. No decreases were found if only participants who attended at all time points were included. In all LMM analyses, a significant relationship between the dog breed and the outcomes of PA were shown. At baseline, dog owners performed different types of activities depending on their dog breed. In conclusion, owners of different dog breeds differ in their types of PA.

METHODS: An extensive online literature review including Pubmed and Medline. RESULTS: There is evidence for RAS involvement in gastrointestinal physiology and pathophysiology, with all the components required for autonomous regulation identified throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The RAS is implicated in the regulation of glucose, amino acid, fluid and electrolyte absorption and secretion, motility, inflammation, blood flow and possibly malignant disease within the gastrointestinal tract.

In this study, we are interested in the predictors of emotional resilience in healthy older adults, and also on how the repetition of confinement periods could influence this resilience and its predictors. METHOD: 102 cognitively unimpaired older adults from the Age\\\\Well cohort were included. They all completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS\\\\42) during each period of national confinement (April and November 2020), used here as a measure of emotional resilience (lower scores indicating greater resilience). Baseline measures from the Age\\\\Well study, all acquired before the pandemic, were used as predictors, including demographics (age, sex, education), personality (Big Five Inventory), psychological (anxiety [STAI\\\\B], depression [GDS]), lifestyle (Lifetime of experience questionnaire), global cognitive functioning (Mattis\\\\DRS) and neuroimaging data (hippocampal volume, brain perfusion, amyloid burden). We ran stepwise regressions to predict emotional resilience during the first confinement. Then, we used paired t\\\\test to assess the evolution of emotional resilience between the two confinements. Finally, we replicated the stepwise regressions to predict changes in resilience over time ('second\\\\minus\\\\first' confinement). RESULT: Neuroticism was the only significant predictor of the DASS\\\\42 score during the first confinement (=.48; p<.001; Figure\\\\1), lower neuroticism being associated with better resilience. We found the DASS\\\\42 score to increase significantly from the first to the second confinement, indicating decreased emotional resilience over time. Moreover, higher neuroticism (=.53; p<.001) and higher agreeableness (=.20; p=.03) were associated with higher DASS\\\\42 increase over time (Figure\\\\2). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that lower neuroticism is the main predictor of greater emotional resilience to the COVID\\\\19\\\\related confinement. Importantly, the repetition of the confinement situation is associated with a decrease in emotional resilience in older adults, especially if they are prone to experience distress (neuroticism) or have a particularly social personality (agreeableness). Overall, these results underline the increasing need, as the crisis persists, for a psychoaffective support of older adult.","output":"Neuroticism is the best predictor of lower emotional resilience during the COVID?19\\\\related confinement periods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When the COVID-19 pandemic forced university campuses and healthcare agencies to temporarily suspend both undergraduate and graduate direct care educational experiences, nursing programs had to formulate alternative plans to facilitate clinical learning. Texas Woman's University used this opportunity to assemble a faculty group tasked with creating a set of college-wide guidelines for virtual simulation use as a substitution for traditional face-to-face clinical. The process included completing a needs assessment of both undergraduate and graduate level programs across three campuses and identifying regulatory requirements and limitations for clinical experiences. The task force utilized the information gathered to develop evidence-based recommendations for simulation hour equivalence ratios and compiled a list of virtual activities and products faculty could use to complete clinical experiences. Undergraduate and graduate student surveys were conducted to determine the effectiveness of the transition to virtual clinical experiences. Overall, the majority of survey results were positive regarding virtual simulation experiences providing students with valuable opportunities to enhance their learning. Negative comments regarding the impact of COVID-19 on a personal level included issues involving internet access and web conferencing logistics, lack of motivation to study, family difficulties, and faculty inexperience teaching in an online environment. Undergraduate pre-licensure students were provided with opportunities to successfully complete all remaining required clinical hours virtually, while graduate students were allowed to complete non-direct care hours as applicable using virtual clinical experiences.","output":"Transitioning from direct care to virtual clinical experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic()()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors reflect on the experience of working with groups of parents of children with mental or physical disabilities, which had started long before the Covid lockdown and continued online after a brief interruption due to the pandemic.

For improving the knowledge about the pandemic consequences for cancer care, this article aims to identify the effects of mitigation strategies developed to reduce the impact of such delays and disruptions. METHODS: Systematic review with a comprehensive search including formal databases, cancer and COVID-19 data sources, gray literature, and manual search. We considered clinical trials, observational longitudinal studies, cross-sectional studies, before-and-after studies, case series, and case studies. The selection, data extraction, and methodological assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed by specific tools. The mitigation strategies identified were described in detail and their effects were summarized narratively. RESULTS: Of 6,692 references reviewed, 28 were deemed eligible, and 9 studies with low to moderate methodological quality were included. Five multiple strategies and four single strategies were reported, and the possible effects of mitigating delays and disruptions in cancer care because of COVID-19 are inconsistent. The only comparative study reported a 48.7% reduction observed in the number of outpatient visits to the hospital accompanied by a small reduction in imaging and an improvement in radiation treatments after the implementation of a multiple organizational strategy. CONCLUSION: The findings emphasize the infrequency of measuring and reporting mitigation strategies that specifically address patients' outcomes and thus a scarcity of high-quality evidence to inform program development. This review reinforces the need of adopting standardized measurement methods to monitor the impact of the mitigation strategies proposed to reduce the effects of delays and disruptions in cancer health care because of COVID-19.","output":"Impact of Strategies for Mitigating Delays and Disruptions in Cancer Care Due to COVID-19: Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, 7 coronaviruses that cause human disease are known, 3 of which over the past 20 years have caused epidemics with a large number of severe cases, a high mortality rate and infection from the primary focus to other countries, followed by the formation of epidemic foci.

At baseline and 4 months post-treatment, we measured: (1) Perfused boundary region (PBR), a marker of glycocalyx integrity, in sublingual microvessels with diameter 5C25 m using a Sidestream Dark Field camera (GlycoCheck). Increased PBR indicates damaged glycocalyx. Functional microvascular density, an index of microvascular perfusion, was also measured. (2) Pulse wave velocity (PWV-Complior) and (3) LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) using speckle-tracking echocardiography. Compared with baseline, PBR(5C25 m) decreased only after apremilast (?12% at 4 months, p < 0.05) whereas no significant changes in PBR(5C25 m) were observed after etanercept or cyclosporine treatment. Compared with etanercept and cyclosporine, apremilast resulted in a greater increase of functional microvascular density (+14% versus +1% versus ?1%) and in a higher reduction of PWV. Apremilast showed a greater increase of GLS (+13.5% versus +7% versus +2%) than etanercept and cyclosporine (p < 0.05).

Cooking dinner more frequently is associated with better diet quality. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to examine how food insecurity and dinner cooking frequency are associated with diet quality during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN This cross-sectional study analyzed data from a national web-based survey (June 23- July 1, 2020). PARTICIPANTS /setting: Participants were 1,739 low-income (<250% of the federal poverty level) adults in the US. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The outcome was diet quality, measured by the Prime Diet Quality Score (PDQS-30D). The PDQS-30D is a food frequency questionnaire-based, 22-component diet quality index. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED Food security status (high, marginal, low, very low) and frequency of cooking dinner (7, 5-6, 3-4 or 0-2 times/week) were evaluated in relation to PDQS-30D scores (possible range 0-126) in age- and sex and gender-, and fully-adjusted linear regression models. Post-estimation margins were used to predict mean PDQS-30D score by food security status and dinner cooking frequency. The interaction between food security status and frequency of cooking dinner was also tested. RESULTS Overall, the mean PDQS-30D score was 51.9 11 points (possible range 0-126). The prevalence of food insecurity (low/very low) was 43%, 37% of the sample cooked 7 times/week and 15% cooked 0-2 times/week. Lower food security and less frequent cooking dinner were both associated with lower diet quality. Very low food security was associated with a 3.2-point lower PDQS-30D score (95%CI: -4.6, -1.8) compared to those with high food security. Cooking dinner 0-2 times/week was associated with a 4.4-point lower PDQS-30D score (95%CI: -6.0, -2.8) compared to cooking 7 times/week. The relationship between food insecurity and diet quality did not differ based on cooking dinner frequency. CONCLUSIONS During the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic food insecurity and less frequently cooking dinner at home were both associated with lower diet quality among low-income Americans. More research is needed to identify and address barriers to low-income households' ability to access, afford and prepare enough nutritious food for a healthy diet.","output":"Food insecurity and less frequent cooking dinner at home are associated with lower diet quality in a national sample of low-income adults in the US during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current global pandemic COVID-19 challenges oncologists to reorganise cancer care in order to strikingly reduce hospital visits and admissions.

Additionally in this context, contributing factors are registered. Materials and Methods: Burnout and psychological distress were assessed with the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18). A newly developed self-reporting questionnaire was used to evaluate demographic data and pandemic-associated stress factors. Results: 252 general practitioners and 229 private practice physicians provided sufficient responses to the outcome variables for analysis. The prevalence of clinically relevant psychological distress was comparable between groups (12.4 vs. 9.2%). A larger proportion of general practitioners than specialists had intermediate (43.8 vs. 39.9%) or high burnout (26.9 vs. 22.0%) without reaching statistical significance for either category. When combining study participants with intermediate and high levels of burnout, the group difference attained significance (70.7 % vs. 61.9%). Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence that practicing physicians are at high risk of burnout in the context of the pandemic.

During this period, there was a significant increase in supermarket expenditure. It has been shown that stress, anxiety and boredom are triggers for unhealthy eating habits. Fat consumption is a risk factor for both the development of gallstones and, additionally, the development of acute calculous cholecystitis. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of acute calculous cholecystitis during the nationwide lockdown and compare it to the same period one year prior. METHODS: A retrospective review of all emergency abdominal imaging performed during the first 5 weeks of the lockdown was completed using the hospital PACS (picture archiving and communication system). All cases of acute calculous cholecystitis were identified and compared with the same period 1 year prior. RESULTS: Eighteen cases of acute calculous cholecystitis were identified from 24 March to 27 April 2020. Eleven cases were identified during the same period in 2019.

This paper aims to provide insight into shifts in alcohol consumption and associated factors during the epidemic. DESIGN AND METHODS A cross-sectional convenience sample of 2307 Australians aged 18 and over who drank at least monthly was recruited through social media. Respondents were asked about their alcohol consumption and purchasing in 2019 prior to the epidemic plus similar questions about their experiences in the month prior to being surveyed between 29 April and 16 May 2020. RESULTS Reports of average consumption before (3.53 drinks per day [3.36, 3.71 95% confidence interval]) and during (3.52 [3.34, 3.69]) the pandemic were stable. However, young men and those who drank more outside the home in 2019 reported decreased consumption during the pandemic, and people with high levels of stress and those who bulk-bought alcohol when restrictions were announced reported an increase in consumption relative to those who did not. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS A reported increase in consumption among those experiencing more stress suggests that some people may have been drinking to cope during the epidemic. Conversely, the reported decrease in consumption among those who drank more outside of their home in 2019 suggests that closing all on-trade sales did not result in complete substitution of on-premise drinking with home drinking in this group.

Low dose radiotherapy (LDRT) has received both interest and criticism as a potential treatment for this condition. In this qualitative study we explored clinicians perspectives in order to identify barriers to testing LDRT in clinical trials and implementing it in clinical practice. Methods Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with six clinicians from three medical disciplines. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically, using a framework approach. Common themes regarding barriers to using LDRT for COVID-19 lung disease were identified from the data. Results Three categories of barriers emerged: i) the potential to do harm to the patient, including difficulty in predicting harm and lack of existing data to inform quantification of risks; ii) the feasibility of trialling this novel treatment strategy in the clinical setting, in particular patient selection and buy-in from relevant clinician groups; and iii) the logistics of delivering the treatment, in particular risks of transmission to other patients and resources required for patient transfer. Conclusions This study identified several barriers that may impede the evaluation and subsequent implementation of LDRT as a treatment for COVID-19 lung disease, from the perspectives of clinicians in three relevant specialties. By documenting and articulating these concerns, we hope to enhance discussion of why these barriers exist, and enable them to be addressed in a proactive manner in order to facilitate research into the potential benefits of radiation treatment for patients with COVID-19 lung disease.","output":"Clinician attitudes to using low dose radiotherapy to treat COVID-19 lung disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) is mainly based on a positive SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result.

Methods The selection of participants was through a multi-stage sampling design from all the 11 districts and 280 wards of the city-state, with two-stage allocation proportional to population-size. Household selected was via systematic random sampling, and individual participant selection through the age-order procedure. The blood samples were screened using the IgG ELISA COVID-Kawach kit (August Round), and the ERBALISA COVID-19 IgG (September and October) rounds. The seroprevalence was estimated by applying the sampling weights based on age and sex with further adjustment for the assay-kit characteristics. Results A total of 4267 (n=15046), 4311 (n=17409), and 3829 (n=15015) positive tests indicative of the presence of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 were observed during the August, September, and October 2020 serosurvey rounds, respectively. The adjusted seroprevalence declined from 28.39% (95% CI 27.65-29.14) (August) to 24.08% (95% CI 23.43-24.74) (September), and 24.71% (95% CI 24.01, 25.42%) (October). The antibody positivity was highest in the >=50 and female age-group during all rounds of the serosurvey, while the decline was maximum among the younger age-group (5-17 years). On adjusted analysis, participants with lower per capita income, living in slums or overcrowded households, and those with diabetes comorbidity had significantly higher statistical odds of antibody positivity. Conclusions Despite high IgG seroprevalence, there was evidence for waning of antibody positivity with the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, implying a potential reduction in population immunity, especially if also associated with the lack of trained T cell immunity.","output":"The seroprevalence and trends of SARS-CoV-2 in Delhi, India: A repeated population-based seroepidemiological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a respiratory support system that has become prominent in the treatment of respiratory failure.

Data were derived from the 2013 Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS). Using exploratory factor analysis, the original questionnaires 10 health services were grouped into 2 dimensions, including health management service and public health service. Then, the satisfaction was described. The associations between satisfaction and factors were assessed using a multivariable logistic regression model. As a result, a total of 5283 subjects were enrolled. The satisfaction was 56.74% for health management service and 54.48% for public health service. Those with older age, lower education level, positive social environment factors (ie, higher perceived social class, higher perceived social trust, and perceived social equity), and having pension were more likely to report high satisfaction. Moreover, compared to the east region (the most prosperous region), the individuals from the central region or the north-east region (both regional economic levels were medium) had lower odds of reporting high satisfaction. In comparison, those from the west region (the least developed region) had higher odds. In conclusion, actionable measures to increase satisfaction should be proposed by the Chinese government, including increasing pension insurance coverage, increasing investment in health services, creating an excellent social environment, etc.","output":"Who Is More Satisfied with Health Services?

One of the promising approaches was a T cell-based vaccine, but the narrow breadth of T-cell immunity due to the immunodominance hierarchy established by previous influenza infection and efficacy against only mild challenge condition are important hurdles to overcome. To model T-cell immunodominance hierarchy in humans in an experimental setting, influenza-primed C57BL/6 mice were chosen and boosted with a mixture of vaccinia recombinants, individually expressing consensus sequences from avian, swine, and human isolates of influenza internal proteins. As determined by IFN- ELISPOT and polyfunctional cytokine secretion, the vaccinia recombinants of influenza expanded the breadth of T-cell responses to include subdominant and even minor epitopes. Vaccine groups were successfully protected against 100 LD50 challenges with PR/8/34 and highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which contained the identical dominant NP366 epitope. Interestingly, in challenge with pandemic A/Cal/04/2009 containing mutations in the dominant epitope, only the group vaccinated with rVV-NP + PA showed improved protection. Taken together, a vaccinia-based influenza vaccine expressing conserved internal proteins improved the breadth of influenza-specific T-cell immunity and provided heterosubtypic protection against immunologically close as well as distant influenza strains.","output":"Vaccinia-based influenza vaccine overcomes previously induced immunodominance hierarchy for heterosubtypic protection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The successive emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs) such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 has stimulated a number of studies on the molecular biology.

Two aspects were specifically considered: 1) reported changes in intake of specific food categories and 2) effect on healthy eating, operationalized as adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MEDAS score). Respondents (N = 2,462) completed a 44-items self-administered online survey designed for the assessment of their socio-demographic characteristics, general food habits, and consumption frequency of selected foods (mainly related to the MedDiet) during the lockdown. The data indicated that the lockdown has affected dietary habits of adult Danes to a relatively limited degree. The most important findings were that a substantial proportion of respondents (28%) reported eating more, snacking more, exercising less, and gaining weight during the lockdown. Results could be linked to the amount of time spent at home (e.g., a higher cooking frequency) a higher degree of emotional eating during the lockdown (e.g., a higher consumption of pastries and alcohol). Women were generally affected to a higher degree than men. Additionally, dietary changes during the lockdown to a certain degree reflected pre-existing (un)healthy eating habits, as positive health outcomes were observed in respondents with a high MEDAS score and negative outcomes (e.g., weight gain and higher intakes of pastries and carbonated beverages) were associated with respondents with a low MEDAS score. These changes, if sustained long-term, are potentially concerning from a public health perspective, especially given that more than half of the respondents were characterized by a low adherence to the MedDiet.","output":"Reported Changes in Dietary Habits During the COVID-19 Lockdown in the Danish Population: The Danish COVIDiet Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 is causing a worldwide health crisis We aimed to present clinical and CT features for a cohort of patients in Henan, China with more foc","output":"Clinical and CT Features of 106 Patients with Mild and Severe COVID-19 and Longitudinal 3D CT Dynamics of Patients with Series of CTs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incidence of tick-borne diseases has increased in recent decades and accounts for the majority of vector-borne disease cases in temperate areas of Europe, North America, and Asia.

In this forum paper, we focus on how land use changes have shaped the eco-epidemiology of Ixodes scapularis-borne pathogens, in particular the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto in the eastern United States. We use this as a model system, addressing other tick-borne disease systems as needed to illustrate patterns or processes. We first examine how land use interacts with abiotic conditions (microclimate) and biotic factors (e.g., host community composition) to influence the enzootic hazard, measured as the density of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.s. We then review the evidence of how specific landscape configuration, in particular forest fragmentation, influences the enzootic hazard and disease risk across spatial scales and urbanization levels. We emphasize the need for a dynamic understanding of landscapes based on tick and pathogen host movement and habitat use in relation to human resource provisioning. We propose a coupled natural-human systems framework for tick-borne diseases that accounts for the multiple interactions, nonlinearities and feedbacks in the system and conclude with a call for standardization of methodology and terminology to help integrate studies conducted at multiple scales.","output":"Impact of Land Use Changes and Habitat Fragmentation on the Eco-epidemiology of Tick-Borne Diseases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AbstractEver since biologists began studying the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases (EEID), laboratory-based model systems have been important for developing and testing theory.

Here, we borrow a definition of model systems from the biomolecular sciences to assess how EEID researchers are (and are not) using 10 key model systems. According to this definition, model systems in EEID are not being used to their fullest and, in fact, cannot even be considered model systems. Research using these systems consistently addresses only two of the three fundamental processes that underlie disease dynamics-transmission and disease, but not recovery. Furthermore, studies tend to focus on only a few scales of biological organization that matter for disease ecology and evolution. Moreover, the field lacks an infrastructure to perform comparative analyses.

A ventilator is an essential unit in hospitals because it seems to be the first step to protect the life of the patient getting sick. Some low-income countries aim to make a simple ventilator using locally available and low-cost materials for primary care and palliative care. One of the simple principles of ventilators is to adopt an artificial manual breath unit (AMBU) bag with paddles. Unfortunately, the squeezing angle of paddles is not proportional to the exhaust air volume from the AMBU bag. This paper analyzes the character of the squeezing angle of the paddles and the exhaust air volume of the adult AMBU bag through experiments.

Objectives: A preliminary investigation to explore the views of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, with and without experience of psychosis symptoms, and carers on the resumption of clinical research and adaptations to trials in light of COVID-19. Methods: An anonymous self-administered online survey was completed by 30 PD patients and six family members/carers via the Parkinson's UK Research Support Network to explore current perceptions on taking part in PD research and how a planned clinical trial for psychosis in PD may be adapted so participants feel safe. Results: Ninety-one percent of respondents were enthusiastic about the continuation of non-COVID-19 related research as long as certain safety measures were in place. Ninety-four percent stated that they would be happy to complete assessments virtually. However, they noted that care should be taken to ensure that this does not exclude participants, particularly those with more advanced PD who may require assistance using portable electronic devices. Regular and supportive communication from the research team was also seen as important for maintaining the psychological well-being of participants while taking part in the trial. Conclusions: In the era of COVID-19 pandemic, standard approaches will have to be modified and rapid adoption of virtual assessments will be critical for the continuation of clinical research.

More than 66% would be willing to try this novel product compared to 23% who expressed reluctance to do so. Nearly 40% of the total respondents did not want to eat cell-based meat regularly at all, whereas 29%, 43.2%, and 39.9% were willing to eat it regularly in restaurants, at home, and/or in ready-made meals, respectively. However, the majority of respondents (71%) were keen to pay much less for cell-based meat than conventionally produced meat (or even nothing at all), compared to 24.3% who were willing to pay the same price as conventional meat, whereas only 4.8% were willing to pay more. Approximately 51% of them considered that cell-based meat should not be called meat for marketing purposes. Job, monthly income, age, and gender were major factors impacting consumer acceptance. Meat professionals and consumers with higher incomes were less willing to eat cell-based meat regularly. Women (especially younger women) were the most concerned about the ethical and environmental issues related to meat production and were the most convinced that reducing meat consumption could be a good solution to the meat industrys problems. Respondents who did not accept cell-based meat and did not eat meat substitutes had a negative attitude to this novel food (they considered it absurd and/or disgusting) and did not believe that cell-based meat should be called meat for marketing purposes.

In this study, we aim to assess the prevalence of self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic among HCWs in central Ethiopia. METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey from June 25, 2020, to July 25, 2020, in Ethiopia. Data were collected using a self-reported Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Data were cleaned, coded, and analysed using SPSS Version 23. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to identify the associated factors for mental health outcomes at a p-value of less than 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 816 HCWs completed the self-report questionnaire. The percentage of HCWs who had moderate to extremely severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress were 60.3%, 78%, and 33.8%, respectively.

The objectives of this work are: 1) Determining the best configuration of the proposed CNN, 2) Determining the best strategy of multi-steps forecasting (MSF) using the obtained CNN for a prediction horizon of 30 min, and 3) Comparing the CNN and LSTM models for one-step and multi-steps prediction. Toward the first objective, we conducted series of experiments through parameter selection. Then five MSF strategies are developed for the CNN to reach the second objective. Finally, for the third objective, comparisons between CNN and LSTM models are conducted and assessed by the Wilcoxon statistical test. All the experiments were conducted using 10 patients datasets and the performance is evaluated through the Root Mean Square Error. The results show that the proposed CNN outperformed significantly the LSTM model for both one-step and multi-steps prediction and no MSF strategy outperforms the others for CNN.","output":"Deep Learning for Blood Glucose Prediction: CNN vs LSTM"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Liver transplant is a lifesaving treatment option for end-stage liver disease in those with or without hepatocellular carcinoma. Organ shortage is currently the main limitation to liver transplant in many countries worldwide, with fewer donors than patients waiting for transplant. Different solutions have been proposed, including the use of marginal grafts, living donors, and machine perfusion. Potential organs are sometimes discarded due to technical difficulties that may hamper the success of their retrieval and eventual transplant. Here, we present the case of a 69-year-old man with a history of cardiac and pulmonary disease who was considered a potential organ donor after brain death. According to the patient's history, a computed tomography before acceptance was required. The scan revealed a giant thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. The donor had previous cardiac surgery with sternotomy and a talcage of the right pleural space. The 2 renal arteries were also unusable because of spread calcifications and involvement by the aneurism. We decided to cannulate the superior mesenteric vessels. Liver transplant was uneventful, and the recipient had no vascular complications, as shown by Doppler ultrasonography performed on days 1, 3, and 7. Length of hospitalization was 14 days. Organ shortages for transplant seemed to have worsened during the COVID-19 period. Nonetheless, the condition of oncology patients can worsen if surgical treatments are delayed.

The most frequently reported pathology is conjunctivitis, which may be the first or only clinical manifestation of the disease. Involvement of SARS-CoV-2 in development of alterations in other ocular structures was suggested, including the cornea, the retina, and blood vessels. Possible mechanisms include direct activity of the viral agent, as well as systemic inflammatory response with accompanying thromboembolic complications. Genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in ocular secretions of infected individuals, including asymptomatic patients. Moreover, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor protein used by the virus to enter the cell, has been found on the surface of various structures of the eye, which indicates a risk of transmission through ocular tissues. Therefore, it is crucial to use eye protection by medical professionals having contact with potentially infected patients. This paper is a review of the literature regarding ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a summary of the current state of knowledge about possibility of transmission from an ophthalmology point of view. For data collection, a thorough PubMed search was performed, using the key words: COVID ocular, COVID eye, SARS-CoV-2 ocular, and SARS-CoV-2 eye. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection may manifest itself in various ocular conditions. Eye protection should not be neglected, as recent studies suggest the eye as a potential route of transmission.

METHODS: All ED accesses of children (<14 years of age) at two university hospitals, in Turin and Rome, Italy, between January 6, 2020 and April 21, 2020, were examined and compared with the corresponding periods of 2019. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 lockdown period (February 23-April 21, 2020), there was a 72 % decrease in all pediatric ED accesses over the corresponding 2019 period (n = 3,395 vs n = 12,128), with a 38 % decrease in seizure-related accesses (n = 41 vs n = 66). The observed decrease of seizure-related ED accesses was not accompanied by significant changes in age, sex, type of seizure, or hospitalization rate after the ED visit.

It has since been recognized as a pandemic and has led to great social and economic disruption globally. The Reverse Transcriptase Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rtRT-PCR) has become the primary method for COVID-19 testing worldwide. The method requires a specialized laboratory set up. Long-term persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal secretion after full clinical recovery of the patient is regularly observed nowadays. This forces the patients to spend a longer period in isolation and test repeatedly to obtain evidence of viral clearance. Repeated COVID-19 testing in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases often leads to extra workload for laboratories that are already struggling with a high specimen turnover. Here, we present 5 purposively selected cases with different patterns of clinical presentations in which nasopharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed in patients for a long time. From these case studies, we emphasized the adoption of a symptom-based approach for discontinuing transmission-based precautions over a test-based strategy to reduce the time spent by asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients in isolation. A symptom-based approach will also help reduce laboratory burden for COVID-19 testing as well as conserve valuable resources and supplies utilized for rtRT-PCR testing in an emerging lower-middle-income setting. Most importantly, it will also make room for critically ill COVID-19 patients to visit or avail COVID-19 testing at their convenience.","output":"Acceptance of a Symptom-Based Approach for COVID-19 rtRT-PCR Testing to Conserve Resources in a Lower Middle-Income Setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lockdowns and quarantines have been implemented widely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Triterpenoids, a group of bioactive phytochemicals, have been tested for antibiofilm activity against model biofilm forming bacteria in recent times. In this context, glycyrrhetinic acid (GRA), ursolic acid (UA) and betulinic acid (BA), representing three categorically distinct groups of pentacyclic triterpenoids, are targeted for profiling their impact on Vibrio cholerae C6709 biofilms. The triterpenoids substantially affected biofilm associated attributes like formation, substratum adherence and dispersion from preformed biofilms. Though at variable degree, the compounds decreased cell surface hydrophobicity and composition in terms of macromolecular content. Not only EPS-associated extracellular enzyme activities were estimated to be reduced by triterpenoid exposure, ultra structural analysis also revealed that GRA, UA and BA can affect extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) content. Albeit total extracellular proteolytic activity remained unaffected by the triterpenoids, GRA treatment resulted in considerable reduction of extracellular gelatinase activity. Molecular docking analysis indicated potential interaction with cyclic di-GMP sensor VpsT, autoinducer-2 sensor kinase LuxP-LuxQ and transcriptional activator HapR, components of complex quorum sensing networks modulating biofilm formation. Comprehensive analysis of antibiotic action revealed accentuation of cephalosporin antibiotics with GRA and UA while BA potentiated action of fluoroquinolones against biofilmed bacteria, widening the scope of combinatorial therapeutic strategy.","output":"A comprehensive and comparative study on the action of pentacyclic triterpenoids on Vibrio cholerae biofilms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemiological studies have documented that insulin resistance and diabetes not only constitute metabolic abnormalities but also predispose to hypertension, vascular stiffness, and associated cardiovascular disease.

As children in school-going age are vulnerable and continue to suffer from preventable illnesses, this study aims to spot barriers to handwashing among children while simultaneously recognizing the influencing factors to aid the solutions narrative for effective water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) strategies. METHODS A school-based cross-sectional, mixed-method study was conducted in Ballabhgarh block, Faridabad district, India. A predesigned, pretested, structured questionnaire was administered to 106 class V students in five randomly selected rural government primary schools. Due permissions, consent and ethical clearances were taken. RESULTS The majority (>91%) of children were found to have low illness threat perception. The inability to visually see germs came out as one of the biggest barriers (46%) that were preventing children from practicing regular handwashing. Family, teachers and peers were found to be the most important sources of information for children and not any particular media channel. In fact, role of peers was found to be critical as 72% children said that they would wash hands if their friends were also washing hands. CONCLUSION This study suggests children's need for visible proof of germs and associated casual attitude toward illness threat as a hitherto unexplored potential barrier to practicing regular handwashing. In addition, the human channel of communication seems to be the most relevant regarding public health messaging in rural heartlands. Despite 100% penetration of mobile phones and commonplace presence of television, it is the community ecosystem that is still the most trusted sources of information and influence.

However, despite these advances, outcome still remains poor for most patients and there is still a lot of room to improve prognosis in these patients. To date, we have no tools that allow us to identify the patients that will benefit from chemo- and/or radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy, what treatment-induced immune changes can be expected, and what are the most optimal treatment combinations. Therefore, prognostic and predictive immunological biomarkers are urgently needed. This prospective exploratory study aimed to identify potential prognostic and predictive immune-related proteins that are associated with progression-free survival in patients with stage I/III NSCLC. The results of this trial provide a good starting point to implement blood-based immune profiling analyses in future clinical trials. ABSTRACT: Radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy can induce immune responses, but not much is known regarding treatment-induced immune changes in patients. This exploratory study aimed to identify potential prognostic and predictive immune-related proteins associated with progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this prospective study, patients with stage I NSCLC treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (n = 26) and patients with stage III NSCLC treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (n = 18) were included. Blood samples were collected before (v1), during (v2), and after RT (v3). In patients with stage I NSCLC, CD244 (HR: 10.2, 95% CI: 1.8C57.4) was identified as a negative prognostic biomarker. In patients with stage III NSCLC, CR2 and IFNGR2 were identified as positive prognostic biomarkers (CR2, HR: 0.00, 95% CI: 0.00C0.12; IFNGR2, HR: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.00C0.46).

Our analysis to the triple crisis that the world is experiencing as a result of COVID-19 has enabled us to identify several challenges to overcome for current decision-making systems and industrial environments that are constrained to develop adaptative management systems, flexible networks and smart business continuity plans. The impacts of both geospatial and business intelligence as well as advanced simulation have motivated our proposition of a new generic framework based on digital twins to deal with these challenges. Our proposed framework by combining first digital twins with business intelligence tools aims to develop smart information models, value-driven DT architectures and context aware services that tries to mimic real-environment dynamics, and according to its developed smart engines prevent the occurrence of unpredictable events. Secondly, by integrating to this combination, location intelligence provides multi-perspective modelling and geo-statistic data integration with real-time operational data into digital twins offers a generic system for prognostication, optimization and on-line and offline learning.

The Treatment of Brain AVM Study (TOBAS) was designed to assess curative treatments in the management of AVMs. The purpose of our study is to provide a care trial context to brain AVM patients. METHODS TOBAS is a pragmatic, prospective study including 2 randomized controlled trials and a registry. All AVM patients can be recruited. The preferred management modality will be predetermined prior to randomization by the team based on clinical judgment. Patients eligible for both conservative and interventional management will be randomly allocated conservative or curative treatment. Randomization will be stratified by a treatment modality (surgery, radiosurgery or embolization) and minimized according to a history of previous rupture and Spetzler-Martin grade. A second randomization will allocate eligible patients to embolization/no embolization prior to surgery or radiosurgery. The primary outcome of the study is death (any cause) or disabling stroke (mRS>2) at 10 years. All patients managed according to clinical judgment alone will be included in the registry. The study is registered under: wwwTrials.gov, ID: NCT02098252. EXPECTED RESULTS A minimum recruitment of 540 patients is required to show that treatment can reduce the primary outcome by 10 % (from 25 to 15 %); 440 patients will be needed to show a 10 % increase in angiographic occlusion for a good clinical outcome with pre-embolization.

This study examined spatiotemporal variations of the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 across its course. Three approaches, i.e. calendar-based, measure-driven and data-driven ones, were applied to all individual cases reported as of 30th November 2020, dividing the COVID-19 pandemic into five periods. A total of 808 people with confirmed diagnosis and 279 asymptomatic cases were reported, the majority of whom were aged 30-49 and <30 years, respectively. The highest risk was seen in Chengdu (capital city), with 411 confirmed and 195 asymptomatic cases. The main sources of infection changed from importation from Hubei Province to importation from other provinces, then local transmission and ultimately importation from foreign countries. The periods highlighted by the three methods presented different epidemic patterns and trends. The calendar-based periods were even with most cases aggregated in the first period, which did not reflect various transmission patterns of COVID-19 due to various sources of infection;the measure-driven and data-driven periods were not consistent with each other, revealing that the effects of implementing prevention measures were reflected on the epidemic trend with a time lag. For example, the decreasing trends of new cases occurred 7, 3 and 4 days later than the firstlevel emergency response, the district-level prevention measures and the second-level emergency response, respectively.

Case counts, however, are influenced by testing rates and strategies, which have varied over time and space. A method to interpret COVID-19 case counts consistently in the context of other surveillance data is needed, especially for data-limited settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS: Statistical analyses were used to detect changes in COVID-19 surveillance data. The pruned exact linear time change detection method was applied for COVID-19 case counts, number of tests, and test positivity rate over time. With this information, change points were categorized as likely driven by epidemiological dynamics or non-epidemiological influences, such as noise. FINDINGS: Higher rates of epidemiological change detection are more associated with open testing policies than with higher testing rates. This study quantified alignment of non-pharmaceutical interventions with epidemiological changes. LMICs have the testing capacity to measure prevalence with precision if they use randomized testing. Rwanda stands out as a country with an efficient COVID-19 surveillance system. Subnational data reveal heterogeneity in epidemiological dynamics and surveillance. INTERPRETATION: Relying solely on case counts to interpret pandemic dynamics has important limitations. Normalizing counts by testing rate mitigates some of these limitations, and an open testing policy is key to efficient surveillance. The study findings can be leveraged by public health officials to strengthen COVID-19 surveillance and support programmatic decision-making.","output":"Evaluating COVID-19 reporting data in the context of testing strategies across 31 low- and middle-income countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter argues that Karl Polanyis economic sociology offers foundational concepts for a radical analysis of the social and ecological conditions that have caused the coronavirus pandemic.

Little is known about its prevalence, risk factors, and prognostic factors in China or anywhere else in the world. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of small airway dysfunction using spirometry before and after bronchodilation, both overall and in specific population subgroups; assess its association with a range of lifestyle and environmental factors (particularly smoking); and estimate the burden of small airway dysfunction in China. METHODS From June, 2012, to May, 2015, the nationally representative China Pulmonary Health study invited 57 779 adults to participate using a multistage stratified sampling method from ten provinces (or equivalent), and 50 479 patients with valid lung function testing results were included in the analysis. We diagnosed small airway dysfunction on the basis of at least two of the following three indicators of lung function being less than 65% of predicted: maximal mid-expiratory flow, forced expiratory flow (FEF) 50%, and FEF 75%. Small airway dysfunction was further categorised into pre-small airway dysfunction (defined as having normal FEV1 and FEV1/forced vital capacity [FVC] ratio before bronchodilator inhalation), and post-small airway dysfunction (defined as having normal FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio both before and after bronchodilator inhalation). Logistic regression yielded adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for small airway dysfunction associated with smoking and other lifestyle and environmental factors. We further estimated the total number of cases of small airway dysfunction in China by applying present study findings to national census data. FINDINGS Overall the prevalence of small airway dysfunction was 435% (95% CI 407-463), pre-small airway dysfunction was 255% (236-275), and post-small airway dysfunction was 113% (103-125). After multifactor regression analysis, the risk of small airway dysfunction was significantly associated with age, gender, urbanisation, education level, cigarette smoking, passive smoking, biomass use, exposure to high particulate matter with a diameter less than 25 m (PM25) concentrations, history of chronic cough during childhood, history of childhood pneumonia or bronchitis, parental history of respiratory diseases, and increase of body-mass index (BMI) by 5 kg/m2. The ORs for small airway dysfunction and pre-small airway dysfunction were similar, whereas larger effect sizes were generally seen for post-small airway dysfunction than for either small airway dysfunction or pre-small airway dysfunction. For post-small airway dysfunction, cigarette smoking, exposure to PM25, and increase of BMI by 5 kg/m2 were significantly associated with increased risk, among preventable risk factors. There was also a dose-response association between cigarette smoking and post-small airway dysfunction among men, but not among women. We estimate that, in 2015, 426 (95% CI 411-468) million adults had small airway dysfunction, 253 (238-278) million had pre-small airway dysfunction, and 111 (104-126) million had post-small airway dysfunction in China. INTERPRETATION In China, spirometry-defined small airway dysfunction is highly prevalent, with cigarette smoking being a major modifiable risk factor, along with PM25 exposure and increase of BMI by 5 kg/m2. Our findings emphasise the urgent need to develop and implement effective primary and secondary prevention strategies to reduce the burden of this condition in the general population.

With the aim of assessing vaccine safety, we conducted a cross-sectional survey administrating a voluntary-based questionnaire on adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs) in San Raffaele Hospital, Milano, Italy. METHODS: From 4(th) January 2021 to 27(th) April 2021, we collected 2,659 questionnaires (response rate: 24,5%). We analyzed data, reporting AEFIs by gender, age, self-reported severity, type, time of insurgence and duration, and estimating relative-risk ratios (RRR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The most reported symptoms were injection site pain, fatigue, headache, myalgia, chills, fever, and arthralgia. Severe systemic reactions were more frequent after receiving the second dose (RRR 6.25, 95% CI 4.57-8.55), in women (RRR 3.33, 95% CI 2.30-4.82), and less frequent in individuals aged 60 or more (RRR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14-0.49).

BACKGROUND The MVP? is a novel device with PTFE integrated. The device has been recently introduced in the radiological field and reported exclusively for neurological anomalies. METHODS All CHD patients receiving the device from April 2015 until July 2015 were included in the study and followed up clinically as well as by transthoracic echocardiography. Standard safety and follow-up such as vascular complications, embolization rate, and residual shunting were assessed. RESULTS Twelve patients with a median age of 2.6-years (0.03-12.6 years) and a mean weight of 13 kg (2.8-34.2 kg) were included. Devices were delivered from the femoral artery in 10 and from the femoral vein in 2 patients. Devices were used for closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure (n = 5), aorto-pulmonary collaterals or Blalock-Taussig shunt (n = 5), veno-venous fistula (n = 1), and coronary fistula (n = 1). One device was retrieved before release due to inappropriate size estimation (PDA spasm). The PDA was successfully closed using a PDA device (Lifetech, Medtronic). Immediate angiographic evaluation showed minimal or no shunt in 90% (10/11 patients) and 100% occlusion rate after a mean follow-up of 3.2-months. There was no device embolization, hemolysis, or any other complication following closure. CONCLUSIONS The delivery of new MVP? micro vascular plug system (Covidien) is safe and effective in patients with CHD for closure of a variety of vascular abnormalities.

A model that tracks microorganisms between compartments by coupled ordinary differential equations or a Markov chain is benchmarked against a mechanistic interpretation of the physical transfer of microorganisms from surfaces to fingers and subsequently to a susceptible person's facial mucosal membranes. The primary objective was to compare these models in their estimates of doses and changes in microorganism concentrations on hands and fomites over time. The abilities of the models to capture the impact of episodic events, such as hand hygiene, and of contact patterns were also explored. For both models, greater doses were estimated for the asymmetrical scenarios in which a more contaminated fomite was touched more often. Differing representations of hand hygiene in the Markov model did not notably impact estimated doses but affected pathogen concentration dynamics on hands. When using the Markov model, losses due to hand hygiene should be handled as separate events as opposed to time-averaging expected losses. The discrete event model demonstrated the effect of hand-to-mouth contact timing on the dose. Understanding how model design influences estimated doses is important for advancing models as reliable risk assessment tools.","output":"Comparing approaches for modelling indirect contact transmission of infectious diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which emerged in December 2019, continues to be a serious health concern worldwide.

The difference between binary classification and regression is in the target range: in binary classification, the target can have only two values (usually encoded as 0 and 1), while in regression the target can have multiple values. Even if regression analysis has been employed in a huge number of machine learning studies, no consensus has been reached on a single, unified, standard metric to assess the results of the regression itself. Many studies employ the mean square error (MSE) and its rooted variant (RMSE), or the mean absolute error (MAE) and its percentage variant (MAPE). Although useful, these rates share a common drawback: since their values can range between zero and +infinity, a single value of them does not say much about the performance of the regression with respect to the distribution of the ground truth elements. In this study, we focus on two rates that actually generate a high score only if the majority of the elements of a ground truth group has been correctly predicted: the coefficient of determination (also known as R-squared or R(2)) and the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE).

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the betacoronavirus genus. Due to the error-prone nature of the viral RNA-dependent polymerase complex, coronaviruses are known to acquire new mutations at each cycle of genome replication. This constitutes one of the main factors driving the evolution of its relatively large genome and the emergence of new genetic variants.

Until significant ingrowth occurs integrity of the repair depends solely on mesh overlap and anchoring device. Relatively few studies have addressed the effect of mesh properties and anchoring device on long-term parietal ingrowth. METHODS In 20 sheep, using laparoscopy, we inserted two different polypropylene-based meshes, Physiomesh? and Ventralight? ST, anchored with Protack?, SecureStrap?, or Glubran?. After 6 and 12 months, 10 sheep at each time point were euthanized, and we harvested the meshes with corresponding fascia. Mesh with fascia was attached on an Alwetron? materials testing machine and pulled apart obtaining the peel-off energy (kilojoule (kJ)). RESULTS The strength of parietal ingrowth at 6 months was 5.99  0.54 kJ (mean  SEM), 4.94  0.54 kJ and 7.35  0.55 kJ when anchored with Protack?, Glubran?, or SecureStrap?, respectively. At 6 months, the strength of parietal ingrowth of SecureStrap? was significantly higher than Glubran? (p = 0.04). No significant difference was seen between any other combinations. Parietal ingrowth at 12 months was 7.05  0.56 kJ, 7.55  0.54 kJ, and 5.73  0.54 kJ when anchored with Protack?, Glubran?, and SecureStrap?, respectively. No significant difference in strength of parietal ingrowth was seen between the three types of anchoring, (p = 1.00, p = 1.00, and p = 0.29). CONCLUSIONS At 12 months, the strength of parietal ingrowth was the same for all comparisons. The two polypropylene meshes showed equal strength of parietal ingrowth independent of mesh properties and anchoring devices used.","output":"Polypropelene-mesh properties and type of anchoring do not influence strength of parietal ingrowth."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In clinical consultations, men with erectile dysfunction do not always express personal, sexual, and interpersonal concerns. AIM: We explore whether the attenuated impact of erectile dysfunction may be explained by a regulation of negative affect that causes activation of the attachment system. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 69 men diagnosed with erectile dysfunction, mean (SD) age 56 (10.83) years. Participants completed self-reported questionnaires to assess erectile dysfunction severity, attachment style, sexual satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, and psychological symptoms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The moderating role of attachment between erectile dysfunction and sexual satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, and psychological distress was evaluated using multiple linear regression and moderation analysis. RESULTS: All men in the sample had high attachment avoidance, distributed between the dismissive-avoidant (69.6%) and fearful-avoidant (30.4%) substyles, but low levels of psychological symptoms. Despite their erectile dysfunction, 27 patients (39.1%) rated their sexual life as satisfactory, and 46 (66.7%) rated their relationship with their partner as satisfactory. Men with fearful-avoidant attachment reported feeling more sexual desire and less sexual satisfaction than men with dismissive-avoidant attachment. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that sexual satisfaction variance was explained by erectile dysfunction severity, attachment anxiety, and relationship satisfaction scores. Moderation analysis showed that attachment anxiety, but not relationship satisfaction, moderated the impact of erectile dysfunction on sexual satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The avoidance dimension of attachment, which tends to be high in patients with erectile dysfunction, involves deactivation of the sexual system in an effort to minimize the emotional distress associated with erectile dysfunction, which damages sexual and relationship intimacy and delays the decision to obtain professional help. The presence of high attachment avoidance and the moderating value of attachment anxiety allow us to propose specific treatments for these men.

Antibodies are clearly critical for control of this deadly disease; however, the specific mechanisms of action of protective antibodies have yet to be defined. In this Perspective we discuss the antibody features that correlate with in vivo protection during infection with Ebola virus, based on the results of a systematic and comprehensive study of antibodies directed against this virus. Although neutralization activity mediated by the Fab domains of the antibody is strongly correlated with protection, recruitment of immune effector functions by the Fc domain has also emerged as a complementary, and sometimes alternative, route to protection. For a subset of antibodies, Fc-mediated clearance and killing of infected cells seems to be the main driver of protection after exposure and mirrors observations in vaccination studies. Continued analysis of antibodies that achieve protection partially or wholly through Fc-mediated functions, the precise functions required, the intersection with specificity and the importance of these functions in different animal models is needed to identify and begin to capitalize on Fc-mediated protection in vaccines and therapeutics alike.","output":"Antibody-mediated protection against Ebola virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fact-checking is the task of verifying the veracity of claims by assessing their assertions against credible evidence.

Thailand was massively infected in 2004 and 2005 and continues today to experience sporadic outbreaks. While research findings suggest that the spread of HPAI H5N1 is influenced primarily by trade patterns, identifying the anthropogenic risk factors involved remains a challenge. In this study, we investigated which anthropogenic factors played a role in the risk of HPAI in Thailand using outbreak data from the second wave of the epidemic (3 July 2004 to 5 May 2005) in the country. We first performed a spatial analysis of the relative risk of HPAI H5N1 at the subdistrict level based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. We observed a strong spatial heterogeneity of the relative risk. We then tested a set of potential risk factors in a multivariable linear model. The results confirmed the role of free-grazing ducks and rice-cropping intensity but showed a weak association with fighting cock density. The results also revealed a set of anthropogenic factors significantly linked with the risk of HPAI. High risk was associated strongly with densely populated areas, short distances to a highway junction, and short distances to large cities. These findings highlight a new explanatory pattern for the risk of HPAI and indicate that, in addition to agro-environmental factors, anthropogenic factors play an important role in the spread of H5N1.

We aimed at evaluating its clinical effectiveness in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, with indication of oxygen and/or ventilator support. Following prior publication of preliminary results, here we present the final results after completion of data monitoring. Methods: In this European multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, randomised, controlled trial (DisCoVeRy, NCT04315948, EudraCT2020-000936-23), participants were randomly allocated to receive usual standard of care (SoC) alone or in combination with remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir and IFN-beta-1a, or hydroxychloroquine. Adult patients hospitalised with COVID-19 were eligible if they had clinical evidence of hypoxemic pneumonia, or required oxygen supplementation. Exclusion criteria included elevated liver enzyme, severe chronic kidney disease, any contra-indication to one of the studied treatments or their use in the 29 days before randomization, or use of ribavirin, as well as pregnancy or breast-feeding. Here, we report results for remdesivir + SoC versus SoC alone. Remdesivir was administered as 200 mg infusion on day 1, followed by once daily infusions of 100 mg up to 9 days, for a total duration of 10 days. It could be stopped after 5 days if the participant was discharged. Treatment assignation was performed via web-based block randomisation stratified on illness severity and administrative European region. The primary outcome was the clinical status at day 15 measured by the WHO 7-point ordinal scale, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Findings: Between March 22nd, 2020 and January 21st, 2021, 857 participants were randomised to one of the two arms in 5 European countries and 843 participants were included for the evaluation of remdesivir (control, n=423; remdesivir, n=420). At day 15, the distribution of the WHO ordinal scale was as follow in the remdesivir and control groups, respectively: Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities: 62/420 (14.8%) and 72/423 (17.0%); Not hospitalized, limitation on activities: 126/420 (30%) and 135/423 (31.9%); Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen: 56/420 (13.3%) and 31/423 (7.3%); Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen: 75/420 (17.9%) and 65/423 (15.4%); Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices: 16/420 (3.8%) and 16/423 (3.8%); Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO: 64/420 (15.2%) and 80/423 (18.9%); Death: 21/420 (5%) and 24/423 (5.7%).

To generate higher quality, more cost-effective, and less time-consuming measures, it is necessary to explore dual- or multi-method strategy toward sampling optimization, improvement of measurement, and enhancement of efficiency. To justify the proposed dual-method approach, the study has three major objectives. First, it examines the uncertainties associated with different sample sizes by using GIS to generate scenarios that contrast the validity of measurements to aid sampling optimization in auditing. Second, it compares the validity of GIS measures with those generated through Google Street View Auditing (GSVA) by human raters. Third, it further examines the efficiency of the proposed dual-method approach in comparison to the two individual methods. Such investigation generates several novel findings. First, the study presents important evidence to support that GIS measures can offer sampling guidance applicable to the GSVA method. It leads to a recommendation of sampling sizes (5%-20%) for cases in settings with a mixture of affluent and disadvantaged neighborhoods. Results further indicate that different communities and certain individual features and characteristics may demand different sampling practices. Second, the study found that while GSVA is trustworthy for most characteristic variables, especially those that required subjective input, GIS provides well-validated measures for certain objective environmental attributes. Furthermore, the study reports that a dual-method approach of GIS and GSVA had a lower financial and time burden than using GSVA alone and is thus recommended as a comprehensive solution for optimal measurement of an objective built environment in mixed urban neighborhoods.","output":"A dual-method approach toward measuring the built environment - sampling optimization, validity, and efficiency of using GIS and virtual auditing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In spite of various and extensive studies known for pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines the synthesis, in silico studies and biological evaluation of their 5-(het)aryl analogs remained underexplored.

Despite this need, few studies have compared the effectiveness of clinic-based versus web-based or telehealth services. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the clinical outcomes of clinic-based multidisciplinary therapy in an integrated practice unit (C-IPU) model with online integrated multidisciplinary therapy (O-IPU) in individuals undergoing conservative care for LBP. METHODS: A total of 1090 participants were prospectively recruited to participate in a clinical trial registry (NCT04081896) through the SpineZone rehabilitation IPU program. All participants provided informed consent. Participants were allocated to the C-IPU (N=988) or O-IPU (N=102) groups based on their personal preferences. The C-IPU program consisted of a high-intensity machine-based core muscle resistance training program, whereas the O-IPU program consisted of therapist-directed home core strengthening exercises through a web-based platform. Changes in LBP symptom severity (Numeric Pain Rating Scale), disability (Oswestry Disability Index), goal achievement (Patient-Specific Functional Scale), and frequency of opioid use were compared between the C-IPU and O-IPU groups using multivariate linear regression modeling adjusted for age, gender, treatment number, program duration, and baseline pain and disability. RESULTS: Approximately 93.03% (1014/1090) of the participants completed their recommended programs, with no group differences in dropout rates (P=.78). The C-IPU group showed greater pain relief (P<.001) and reductions in disability (P=.002) than the O-IPU group, whereas the O-IPU group reported greater improvements in goal achievement (P<.001). Both programs resulted in reduced opioid use frequency, with 19.0% (188/988) and 21.5% (22/102) of participants reporting cessation of opioid use for C-IPU and O-IPU programs, respectively, leaving only 5.59% (61/1090) of participants reporting opioid use at the end of their treatment.

Yet, limited data are available about access and quality of care available to pregnant individuals in rural areas, particularly among American Indians (AIs). Unannounced standardized patients (USPs), or secret shoppers with standardized characteristics, have been used to assess healthcare access and quality when outcomes cannot be measured by conventional methods or when differences may exist between actual versus reported care. While the USP approach has shown benefit in evaluating primary care and select specialties, its use to date for OUD and pregnancy is very limited. METHODS: We used literature review, current practice guidelines for perinatal OUD management, and stakeholder engagement to design a novel USP protocol to assess healthcare access and quality for OUD in pregnancy. We developed two USP profilesone white and one AIto reflect our target study area consisting of three rural, predominantly white and AI US counties. We partnered with a local community health center network providing care to a large AI population to define six priority outcomes for evaluation: (1) OUD treatment knowledge among clinical staff answering telephones; (2) primary care clinic facilitation and provision of prenatal care and buprenorphine treatment; (3) appropriate completion of evidence-based screening, symptom assessment, and initial steps in management; (4) appropriate completion of risk factor screening/probing about individual circumstances that may affect care; (5) patient-directed tone, stigma, and professionalism by clinic staff; and (6) disparities in care between whites and American Indians. DISCUSSION: The development of this USP protocol tailored to a specific environment and high-risk patient population establishes an innovative approach to evaluate healthcare access and quality for pregnant individuals with OUD. It is intended to serve as a roadmap for our own study and for future related work within the context of substance use disorders and pregnancy.

Inlammatory lung injury progressing to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a recognized clinical feature of the disease. Inlammatory cytokines released in response to COVID-19 activate the transcription factor-the nuclear factor-B (NF-B) and series of pro-inlammatory cytokines, which are responsible for lung injury. Accurate yet precise treatment of coro-navirus disease still remains inconclusive, and intervention is mainly symp-tomatic treatment, respiratory support, antiviral therapies and vaccination. Currently, the major focus of therapy is on reducing lung inlammation by elevating the host immunity. In this scenario, NF-B inhibition can be con-ceptualized as a promising approach to down-regulate the overproduction of cytokines, such that inlammatory lung tissue injury could be prevented in COVID-19 infected patients. Towards this, curcumin from Curcuma longa (Turmeric) would play a vital role in the intervention and suppress NF-B activation via translocation of p65 into the nucleus. Moreover, Curcumin is a proven therapeutic agent against various inlammatory pathologies as it also has the potential to inhibit the expression of certain genes that are critical for the regulation of inlammation. Keeping this phenomenon and the cur-rent medical signiicance in view, we have explored and computed the anti-inlammatory properties of curcumin to develop it as a potent therapeutic agent to prevent NF-B induced lung tissue injury in COVID-19 with the main goal of elevating immunity in the post-covid-19 situations as well as in healthy human beings.","output":"Curcumin therapy: Immune booster in present and post-pandemic (COVID-19) era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly worldwide and leads to high morbidity and mortality.

The lungs are the primary organ affected by SARS-CoV-2, with a very slow turnover for renewal. SARS-CoV-2 enters the lungs via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors and induces an immune response with the accumulation of immunocompetent cells, causing a cytokine storm, which leads to target organ injury and subsequent dysfunction.

Awake ECMOis frequently used to indicate an alternative approach of using ECMO without invasive mechanical ventilation, and it has the unique advantages of application. In this study, we explored the feasibility and stability of the establishment method and management strategy of long-term awake ECMO model in healthy sheep. As the sheep are healthy, according to the histopathological analysis , we explored the effect of ECMO circuit itself on organs and tissues. As a preclinical study in large animals, our study aims to provide clues for further research on application expansion, management strategy optimization, pathophysiology exploration, equipment development and subsequent establishment of the disease animal model. Methods: : Ten healthy sheep were treated with awake veno-arterial (V-A) or veno-venous (V-V) ECMO for 7 days. They were transferred into the monitoring cages after operation and were ambulatory after anesthesia recovery. ECMO configurations, hemodynamic and hematologic parameters were measured every day. Necropsy was conducted at the endpoint of the experiment to visualize the cannula position in vivo and to examine cannulation related injury and thrombus formation in blood vessels and major organs. Main organs and blood vessels were harvested for pathological investigation. Results: : All sheep survived to the end of the experiment (the 7th day). In the whole process of the experiment, the vital signs of which were stable, and no serious bleeding and coagulation events occurred. Hemoglobin concentration and platelet count were in normal reference range, plasma free hemoglobin concentration was maintained at a low level. ECMO flow was stable, and oxygenation performance of oxygenator was satisfied. There was no major adverse pathological injury occurred.

METHODS A cross-sectional survey of registered practising Australian optometrists was undertaken over a three-week period from mid-November 2019. The survey comprised three well-established mental health scales (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale [K10], Depression Anxiety Stress Scales [DASS-21] and Maslach Burnout Inventory [MBI]) and an open-ended question inviting comments. RESULTS Five hundred and five respondents completed the K10, representing 8.8% of registered optometrists in Australia; 466 completed all three scales. Prevalence of moderate to severe psychological distress (K10  25) was 30.7% (95% CI 26.7%-34.7%), with similar findings for depression and anxiety (DASS-21). Prevalence of high burnout, as indicated by MBI-GS exhaustion was 56.1% (95% CI 51.7%-60.4%), cynicism 57.1% (95% CI 52.7%-61.5%) and professional efficacy 23.1% (95% CI 19.4%-26.8%).

The most frequently mentioned work-related issues concerned retail pressures, workload and career dissatisfaction. CONCLUSIONS The rates of mental health conditions and burnout reported by practising Australian optometrists were high compared with the general population and other health professionals. Younger age and burnout were significant risk factors for psychological distress.

METHODS: Chest CT images of patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive COVID-19 were categorized according to the CORADS and RSNA classifications by radiologists with different levels of experience and who were initially unaware of the RT-PCR results. The inter- and intra-observer concordances for each of the classifications were calculated, as were the concordances between classifications. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were included in this study. The RSNA classification showed an almost perfect inter-observer agreement between reviewers with similar experience levels, with a kappa coefficient of 0.892 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.788-0.995). CORADS showed substantial agreement among reviewers with similar experience levels, with a kappa coefficient of 0.642 (95% CI, 0.491-0.793).

Methods: We developed a survey to evaluate surgeon's perception of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey consisted of four major sections focusing on (1) surgeon characteristics and current use of telemedicine, (2) telemedicine for new patients, (3) telemedicine for routine follow-up patients, and (4) telemedicine for postoperative patients. Results: We collected 268 survey responses. Overall, 84.8% of surgeons were using telemedicine, but only 20.5% of surgeons were using it before the COVID-19 pandemic. The overall satisfaction with telemedicine was 70.3%  20.9%. Of those who use telemedicine, 75% currently use it for new patients, 86.6% currently use it for routine follow-up patients, and 80.8% currently use it for postoperative patients (p = 0.01). Surgeons had higher satisfaction with building rapport and performing physical examination maneuvers for either routine follow-up or postoperative patients than for new patients (p < 0.0001 for both).

These differences suggest that while our repeated decontamination cycles do not affect FFR fit, overall wear time and the number of donning/doffing cycles are important factors that likely degrade FFR fit and must be investigated further.","output":"Quantitative Fit Evaluation of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators and Coronavirus Inactivation Following Heat Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Four novel alkali-manganese(II) trifluoroacetates were synthesized, and their potential as self-fluorinating precursors to layered perovskites A2MnF4 (A = K, Rb, and Cs) was demonstrated.

Offering engaging hands-on programming activities could be a beneficial strategy to increase girls self-efficacy beliefs for programming since it has the potential to offer them exposure to mastery experiences. However, a programming workshop in a museum might not offer ideal settings to promote girls mastery experiences in programming because of its short duration and how gender stereotypes may impact the participation in hands-on activities. In the research presented here, we explore how a science museums introductory programming workshop focused on robotics can impact pupils self-efficacy beliefs for programming related to mastery experiences, with a specific focus on girls.

H2Boys generally have more positive experiences with STEM activities than girls, irrespective of experimental condition. Thus, following the workshop, we predict that girls and boys self-efficacy for programming will have increased, but that boys self-efficacy beliefs will remain higher than girls.

These processes require the virus to cross the plasma membrane of the cell twice: once via fusion mediated by the envelope glycoprotein to deliver the viral core into the cytosol; and secondly by ESCRT-mediated scission of budding virions during release. This physical barrier thus presents a perfect location for host antiviral restrictions that target enveloped viruses in general. In this review we will examine the current understanding of innate host antiviral defences that inhibit these essential replicative steps of primate lentiviruses associated with the plasma membrane, the mechanism by which these viruses have adapted to evade such defences, and the role that this virus/host battleground plays in the transmission and pathogenesis of HIV/AIDS.","output":"Inhibiting the Ins and Outs of HIV Replication: Cell-Intrinsic Antiretroviral Restrictions at the Plasma Membrane"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of December 2019, Wuhan City became the epicenter of the highly contagious virus known as the novel coronavirus.

However, for its large-scale implementation, there are challenges related to the variability of the composition of the waste biomass and the seasonal and geographical availability. This research applied the Life Cycle Analysis methodology to evaluate the environmental impacts caused by three biomasses blends as raw material in the HTC process at laboratory scale. The blends analyzed considered different organic fractions of municipal solid waste (food and pruning) and sewage sludge. The results showed that blend 1 had a lower environmental impact for the case of production in the experimental laboratory level, compared with blends 2 and 3. This is mainly due to its greater calorific value and mass yield, which allows obtaining more hydrochar compared with the other blends, increasing the energy efficiency of the process. Also, between 87.94% and 98.00% of the energy reduction is required to obtain neutral impacts regarding the energy requirements in the experimental laboratory level scenario and the Chilean energy matrix. The processing of blends in HTC has excellent potential in a context where municipal solid wastes have been disposed in sanitary landfills or dumps, as in most emerging countries.

Cancer services have faced challenges as a result of COVID-19, including suspension of screening and diagnostic services;delays in diagnosis leading to higher mortality rates;cancellation/deferral of life-saving treatments;changes in treatment regimens and suspension of vital research. For organisations that provide support to cancer patients, declining income, the need to reduce staff and move to virtual working practices has put extra strain while demand for support due to the pandemic has increased. Methods: 5 coalitions surveyed their member organisations. A number of coalitions consulted their members by individual surveys or consultations. Results: A survey of 157 organisations representing advanced breast, bladder, lymphoma, ovarian and pancreatic cancer patient groups from 56 countries found that 57% experienced an average increase of 44% in patient calls and emails. 45% reported that their future viability may be under threat because of the impact of COVID-19 on income. Examples of good practice were reported where healthcare systems have acted to protect patients and cancer services. These include the introduction of COVID-free centres, separation of cancer patients from those who may have COVID-19, and the introduction of virtual and telemedicine services. Organisations have also introduced new ways of working including virtual psychological support services and appbased support groups. These best practices should form part of a global plan of action for future health crisis. Conclusions: Collaboration between patient advocacy organisations, governments and health services is needed to ensure the ground lost to the COVID-19 pandemic is regained.

Monthly follow-ups showed improvement of the facial palsy, and a plan for artificial auricle is set to occur in the following months before the age of five. Discussion. Mucormycosis is considered a very fatal and aggressive infection that has a very high mortality rate in immunocompromised patients. Early detection of such cases with an array of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) is crucial in early treatment. Early aggressive surgical debridement and empirical coverage of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections can also alleviate the chances of preventing any secondary infection to develop in such cases.

It also presents the results of the analysis of monthly forecasting of the values of C, D and I. As earlier, the information was regularly sent to the National Center for Disease Control & Public Health of Georgia and posted on the Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/Avtandil1948/. The analysis of data is carried out with the use of the standard statistical analysis methods of random events and methods of mathematical statistics for the non-accidental time-series of observations. In particular, the following results were obtained. Georgias ranking in the world for Covid-19 monthly mean values of infection and deaths cases in investigation period (per 1 million population) was determined. Among 157 countries with population [] 1 million inhabitants in October 2021 Georgia was in the 4 place on new infection cases, and in September - in the 1 place on death. Georgia took the best place in terms of confirmed cases of diseases (thirteenth) in December, and in mortality (fifth) - in October. A comparison between the daily mortality from Covid-19 in Georgia from September 01, 2021 to December 31, 2021with the average daily mortality rate in 2015-2019 shows, that the largest share value of D from mean death in 2015-2019 was 76.8 % (September 03, 2021), the smallest 18.7 % (November 10, 2021). As in previous work [9,10] the statistical analysis of the daily and decade data associated with coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic of confirmed, recovered, deaths cases and infection rate of the population of Georgia are carried out. Maximum daily values of investigation parameters are following: C = 6024 (November 3, 2021), R = 6017 (November 15, 2021), D = 86 (September 3, 2021), I = 12.04 % (November 24, 2021). Maximum mean decade values of investigation parameters are following: C = 4757 (1 Decade of November 2021), R = 4427 (3 Decade of November 2021), D = 76 (2 Decade of November 2021), I = 10.55% (1 Decade of November 2021). It was found that as in spring and summer 2021 [9,10], from September to December 2021 the regression equations for the time variability of the daily values of C, R, D and I have the form of a tenth order polynomial. Mean values of speed of change of confirmed -V(C), recovered - V(R), deaths - V(D) and infection rate V(I) coronavirus-related cases in different decades of months for the indicated period of time were determined. Maximum mean decade values of investigation parameters are following: V(C) = +139 cases/day (1 Decade of October 2021), V(R) = +124 cases/day (3 Decade of October 2021), V(D) = +1.7 cases/day (3 Decade of October 2021), V(I) = + 0.20 %/ day (1 decades of October 2021). Cross-correlations analysis between confirmed COVID-19 cases with recovered and deaths cases shows, that from September 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021 the maximum effect of recovery is observed on 12 and 14 days after infection (CR=0.77 and 0.78 respectively), and deaths - after 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14 days (0.70[]CR[]0.72); from October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 - the maximum effect of recovery is observed on 14 days after infection (RC=0.71), and deaths - after 9 days (CR=0.43).

As the pandemic has progressed, the understanding of this disease has evolved. OBJECTIVE: This narrative review provides emergency clinicians with a focused update of the resuscitation and airway management of COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Patients with COVID-19 and septic shock should be resuscitated with buffered/balanced crystalloids. If hypotension is present despite intravenous fluids, vasopressors including norepinephrine should be initiated. Stress dose steroids are recommended for patients with severe or refractory septic shock. Airway management is the mainstay of initial resuscitation in patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 and ARDS should be managed similarly to those ARDS patients without COVID-19. Clinicians should not delay intubation if indicated. In patients who are more clinically stable, physicians can consider a step-wise approach as patients' oxygenation needs escalate. High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) are recommended over elective intubation. Prone positioning, even in awake patients, has been shown to lower intubation rates and improve oxygenation. Strategies consistent with ARDSnet can be implemented in this patient population, with a goal tidal volume of 4C8 mL/kg of predicted body weight and targeted plateau pressures <30 cm H(2)O. Limited data support the use of neuromuscular blocking agents (NBMA), recruitment maneuvers, inhaled pulmonary vasodilators, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

Several studies report that ABO blood group polymorphism may be related to COVID-19 susceptibility and clinical outcomes; however, the results are controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate whether ABO blood groups are associated with increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. A total of 715 articles were retrieved from seven databases. Ten articles were selected for meta-analysis after removal of duplicates and two levels of screenings. Overall, individuals with blood group A [odds ratio (OR) = 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 1.56] and B (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.13) had a substantially higher risk of COVID-19, whereas this was not the case for blood group AB (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.30). Individuals with blood group O was not prone to develop the disease (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.84). Moreover, the risk of COVID-19 was significantly associated with the Rh-positive blood group (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.50). A meta-analysis of 5 studies suggested that blood group A was associated with a significantly increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (OR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.52). Mild publication bias was found in the included studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that blood groups A and B may be risk factors for COVID-19, whereas the blood group O appears to be protective. Blood group A may be related to unfavourable outcomes. Further rigorous and high-quality research evidence is needed to confirm this association.","output":"The impact of ABO blood group on COVID-19 infection risk and mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dignified death is a basic human right that has been widely overlooked in countries like India.

This study attempts to assess the effectiveness of these interventions in terms of revealing their impact on infections over time. Dates of infections were estimated from official German case data by incorporating the incubation period and an empirical reporting delay. Exponential growth models for infections and reproduction numbers were estimated and investigated with respect to change points in the time series. A significant decline of daily and cumulative infections as well as reproduction numbers is found at March 8, March 10 and March 3, respectively. Further declines and stabilizations are found in the end of March. There is also a change point in new infections at April 19, but daily infections still show a negative growth. From March 19, the reproduction numbers fluctuate on a level below one. The decline of infections in early March 2020 can be attributed to relatively small interventions and voluntary behavioural changes. Additional effects of later interventions cannot be detected clearly. Liberalizations of measures from April 20 did not induce a re-increase of infections. Thus, the effectiveness of most German interventions remains questionable.

Over the past 4 years, considerable international experience has been gained with this approach. Most published reports focus on TAMIS for local excision of rectal neoplasia, but there are other important applications such as transanal mesorectal excision for rectal cancer. This comprehensive review details the progress with TAMIS since its inception. Robotic transanal surgery is a natural evolution of TAMIS still in its early infancy, which is also reviewed. A comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Knowledge was performed. Since the inception of TAMIS in 2009, 33 retrospective studies and case reports, and 3 abstracts have been published on TAMIS for local excision of rectal neoplasms, which represents a combined n = 390 TAMIS procedures performed worldwide using eight different types of TAMIS platforms. A total of 152 lesions were excised for benign disease including adenomas and high-grade dysplasias (39 %), 209 for malignancy for carcinomas in situ and adenocarcinomas (53.5 %). Twenty-nine (7.5 %) of TAMIS resections were for other pathology, of which the majority (23/29) were neuroendocrine lesions. The remaining resections were for mucocele, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, melanoma, and fibrosis. Robotic-TAMIS has also been reported, however, data are extremely limited as there are only 7 case reports (combined n = 11) in the published literature. Success with Robotic-TAMIS has been demonstrated with various patient positions and by use of a special glove port.

These narratives create complexities as they collide with the authors' everyday lives as nurses, educators, and women. This collision creates three paradoxes for us: (a) learning to care by creating physical distance, (b) a sense of togetherness erases inequities, and (c) returning to normal is possible. To inquire into these three paradoxes, we draw on our experiences with Ingrid, an older adult who requires in-home physical care, and Matthew, a man with multiple disabilities including severe oral dyspraxia and developmental delays. We outline how narrative care is a counterstory to the dominant narratives and enables us to find ways to live our lives within the paradoxes. Narrative care allows us, through attention to embodiment, liminality, and imagination, to create forward looking stories. Understanding narrative care within these paradoxes allows us to offer more complex understandings of the ways narrative care can be embodied in our, and others', lives.","output":"Narrative care: Unpacking pandemic paradoxes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is still one of the most critical issues impeding worldwide TB control efforts. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to give an updated picture of the prevalence of DR-TB in Sudan. A comprehensive systematic search was performed on four electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar) to identify all published studies reporting prevalence data of DR-TB in Sudan. Sixteen eligible studies published during 2002C2020 were included. Using meta-analysis of proportions, the pooled prevalence of TB cases with resistance to any anti-TB drugs was 47.0% (95% CI: 35.5C58.6%). The overall prevalence of mono, multi, poly and extensive drug resistance were estimated to be 16.2% (95% CI: 9.0C23.4%), 22.8% (95% CI: 16.0C29.7%), 6.8% (95% CI: 0.5C13.0%) and 0.7% (95% CI: 0C2.1%), respectively. Considering any first-line anti-TB drugs, the resistance prevalence was highest for isoniazid (32.3%) and streptomycin (31.7%), followed by rifampicin (29.2%). In contrast, resistance against second-line drugs was reported for only two antibiotics, namely, ofloxacin (2.1%) and kanamycin (0.7%). Of note, the resistance profile of the previously treated patients was found to be remarkably high compared with the newly diagnosed TB patients.

The purpose of this study is to share the experience of a distant online lecture on a surgical procedure and related anatomy in a three-dimensional (3D) virtual reality (VR) workspace and to compare it with reported teaching methods, that is, an in-person class and a Zoom online class. The lecture was delivered by three authors of this article in a VR workspace that enables people to meet through VR. The lectures were about combinations of dental surgical procedures and related clinical anatomy. Physically, the attendees could have been located anywhere in the world, so lecturers joined from the United States and the attendees were all from Japan. VR environment and its flexibility enabled attendees to join the lecture actively, helping them to gain understanding of the surgical procedure and anatomy more efficiently. The use of VR technology with a live communication tool demonstrated in this study has several advantages over previous education methods, although there are still technical issues or disadvantages that need to be addressed. Development of the technology and app/software is required so that more data can be processed at higher speed. Use of VR technology with a live communication tool could be an alternative teaching method. Its overall advantages are a closer look at the slides/monitor and concurrent observation of the multiple assets in various directions by multiple attendees. These advantages cannot be achieved by any other teaching method without VR assets with the workspace provided by Spatial. Even during the mandatory social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this could enable us to foster 3D understanding of surgery and related anatomy.

Choosing end points for therapeutic trials of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) requires careful consideration, because they are complications of critical illness. It may be difficult to distinguish the consequences of VAP and HAP from manifestations of the underlying illnesses, and it is important to determine their incremental magnitude, to plan for possible treatment effects and, thus, sample size calculations. In this article, we discuss mortality, attributable mortality, and time to clinical events as possible end points for HAP and/or VAP trials. Because of the paucity of evidence on HAP, we focus predominantly on VAP. In a systematic review of applicable trials, VAP appears to have slight intensive care unit and low hospital-attributable mortality. VAP is associated with prolonged durations of intensive care unit stay, hospital stay, and mechanical ventilation. Because of these findings, superiority trials of VAP treatment that use mortality as a primary end point are not possible. Equivalency studies are possible, but there are sample size implications. The use of time to clinical event end points, especially when combined with mortality, may be the best option for trial in the future.","output":"Mortality, attributable mortality, and clinical events as end points for clinical trials of ventilator-associated pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Wireless stethoscopes can measure respiratory rate noninvasively and continuously, but there are no reports of their use during dental treatment. This study evaluated the usefulness of wireless stethoscopes during dental procedures requiring intravenous sedation (IVS). MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was a prospective cohort study. The study sample consisted of dental patients who received IVS by propofol or midazolam administration at the Nippon Dental University Hospital (Tokyo, Japan). The predictor was respiratory rate measured using the wireless stethoscope (BrRR), and the outcome variable was respiratory rate measured during capnography (RR). Pearson correlation coefficients and paired-samples t tests were used for data analysis. A P value less than .05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS The study sample consisted of 12 patients. BrRR and RR were significantly and positively correlated (r = 0.93, P < .01). The mean  standard deviation of BrRR was 14.16  2.67 and that of RR was 14.32  2.77. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups (P = .27).

Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), a novel bunyavirus reported to be endemic in central and northeastern China. This article describes the first identified patient with SFTS and a retrospective study on SFTS in Japan. Methods. Virologic and pathologic examinations were performed on the patient's samples. Laboratory diagnosis of SFTS was made by isolation/genome amplification and/or the detection of anti-SFTSV immunoglobulin G antibody in sera. Physicians were alerted to the initial diagnosis and asked whether they had previously treated patients with symptoms similar to those of SFTS. Results. A female patient who died in 2012 received a diagnosis of SFTS. Ten additional patients with SFTS were then retrospectively identified. All patients were aged 50 years and lived in western Japan. Six cases were fatal. The ratio of males to females was 8:3. SFTSV was isolated from 8 patients. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that all of the Japanese SFTSV isolates formed a genotype independent to those from China. Most patients showed symptoms due to hemorrhage, possibly because of disseminated intravascular coagulation and/or hemophagocytosis. Conclusions.

Using 113 clinical samples received at our diagnostic laboratory over a 4-year period, the performance of the assay was tested and compared with that of a previously described nested RT-PCR assay. All the fecal samples which tested positive for TGEV by the nested RT-PCR assay also tested positive by the TaqMan assay. However, approximately 9% of the samples that tested negative by the nested RT-PCR assay tested positive by the TaqMan assay.

Scientists are intensively studying the specifics of the disease caused by this virus and the impact of restrictive measures on the economy, environment and other aspects of life. We present an approach to spatial modeling and analysis of the COVID19 spreading process using the concept of the center of gravity. Based on weekly data on this disease in all European countries, the trajectories of the center of gravity of new cases and deaths during the pandemic have been calculated. These two trajectories reflect the dominant role of certain countries or regions of Europe during different stages of the pandemic. It is shown that the amplitude of the trajectory of the center of gravity in the longitudinal direction was quite high (about 1,500 km) in comparison with the amplitude of the trajectory in the latitudinal direction (500 km). Using an approximation of the weekly data, the delays between the peaks of new cases and mortality for different countries were calculated, as well as the delays in comparison with the countries that first reached the peaks of morbidity and mortality. The trajectories of the center of gravity are also calculated for the regions of Ukraine as an example of analysis at the national scale.

An existing method to improve access in the Veterans Affairs (VA) system is the econsultation, which allows text-based consultation by specialty services. However, many patients require more in-depth care than is feasible by e-consult. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the James A. Haley VA (JAHVA) Hematology/Oncology department implemented VA video connect (VVC) telehealth visits to allow providers to connect with patients in their homes. Our aim was to assess the implementation of this novel telehealth service and assess provider perceptions via questionnaires. Methods: We reviewed charts of patients seen via VVC by the JAHVA Hematology/Oncology department. We gathered data including patient demographics, zip code, primary visit diagnosis, and date of visit. We adapted a previously validated telehealth usability questionnaire by Parmanto et al. Providers were surveyed about perceptions of VVCs prior to implementation and 1 year later. Responses were assessed via 5-point Likert scale. Results: From May 2020 to April 2021, 1290 VVCs were conducted. Median VVCs per month was 106 (range 26 to 161), with peak in June 2020. 71% of patients were 65 years, 24% were 45-64 years, and 5% were<45 years. 77% of patients were white, 16% African American, 3% other, and 4% declined to answer or were of unknown race. 87% of patients were male. 12.5% of visits were for new consults. 41% of visits were for primary neoplasm-related diagnoses, 27% for hematologic diagnoses, and 32% for other.

Numerous observational studies have reported an association between the A blood group and an increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our objective was to investigate the frequency and clinical course of COVID-19 in a large sample of patients who had undergone TAVR and to determine the associations of the ABO blood group with disease occurrence and outcomes. Patients who had undergone TAVR between 2010 and 2019 were included in this study and followed-up through the recent COVID-19 outbreak. The occurrence and severity (hospitalization and/or death) of COVID-19 and their associations with the ABO blood group served as the main outcome measures. Of the 1125 patients who had undergone TAVR, 403 (36%) died before 1 January 2020, and 20 (1.8%) were lost to follow-up. The study sample therefore consisted of 702 patients. Of them, we identified 22 cases (3.1%) with COVID-19. Fourteen patients (63.6%) were hospitalized or died of disease. Multivariable analysis identified the A blood group (vs. others) as the only independent predictor of COVID-19 in patients who had undergone TAVR (odds ratio (OR) = 6.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.11-18.92; p = 0.001).

However, less than 20% of eligible U.S. citizens have been offered the chance to register to vote at a government-funded agency like a hospital or clinic that provides Medicaid or Medicare services. Medical students are well positioned to increase voting access due to their interactions with multiple actors in health care settings, including patients, visitors, colleagues, and others. APPROACH Vot-ER, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that aims to promote civic engagement in health care settings, launched the inaugural Healthy Democracy Campaign from July 20 to October 9, 2020. As part of this national, gamification-based competition, medical student captains were recruited to lead teams of health care trainees and professionals that helped eligible adults start the voter registration and/or mail-in ballot request processes prior to the November 2020 elections. Post competition, medical student captains were surveyed about their motivations for participating and skills and knowledge gained. OUTCOMES In total, 128 medical student captains at 80 medical schools in 31 states and the District of Columbia formed teams that helped 15,692 adults start the voter registration and/or mail-in ballot request processes. Eighty-two (64.1%) captains responded to the post competition survey, representing 56 (70.0%) of the participating schools.

Previous work has demonstrated that psychological cognition affects individual behavior. However, perceptual differences between individuals, as well as the dynamics of perceptual evolution, are not taken into account. In order to explore how these realistic characteristics of psychological cognition influence collective vaccination behavior, we propose a prospect theory based evolutionary vaccination game model, where the evolution of reference points is used to characterize changes in perception. We compare the fractions of vaccinated individuals and infected individuals under variable reference points with those under the expected utility theory and the fixed reference point, and highlight the role of evolving perception in promoting vaccination and contributing to epidemic control. We find that the epidemic size under variable reference point is always less than that under the expected utility theory. Finding that there exists a vaccination cost threshold for the cognitive effect, we develop a novel mixed-reference-point mechanism by combining individual psychological characteristics with network topological feature. The effectiveness of this mechanism in controlling the network epidemics is verified with numerical simulations. Compared with pure reference points, the mixed-reference-point mechanism can effectively reduce the final epidemic size, especially at a large vaccination cost.

The scoring system was intended for patients with and without coronavirus disease 2019. There was disagreement about whether the scoring system might exacerbate health disparities and about whether the score should include age. We measured the relationship of ventilator scores to in-hospital and 3-month mortality. We analyzed our findings in the context of ethical and legal guidance for the triage of scarce resources. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Multihospital within a single healthcare system. PATIENTS: Five-hundred four patients emergently intubated and admitted to the ICU. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Ventilator Allocation Score was positively associated with higher mortality (p < 0.0001). The 3-month mortality rate for patients with a score of 6 or higher was 96% (42/44 patients). Age was positively associated with mortality. The 3-month mortality rate for patients 80 and older with scores of 4 or greater was 93% (40/43 patients). Of patients assigned a score of 5, those with end stage renal disease had lower mortality than patients without end stage renal disease although the difference did not achieve statistical significance (n = 27; 25% vs 58%; p = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: The Ventilator Allocation Score can accurately identify patients with high rates of short-term mortality. However, these high mortality patients only represent 27% of all the patients who died, limiting the utility of the score for allocation of scarce resources. The score may unfairly prioritize older patients and inadvertently exacerbate racial health disparities through the inclusion of specific comorbidities such as end stage renal disease. Triage frameworks that include age should be considered. Purposeful efforts must be taken to ensure that triage protocols do not perpetuate or exacerbate prevailing inequities.

Increasing the mortality and morbidity rate among such patients. Cardiac patients are at an increased risk to develop a severe illness if infected by COVID-19 and are associated with a high mortality rate. Therefore, measures had to be taken to reduce the spread of the virus. Various approaches such as the hubs and the spokes centers, or parallel system were enforced. Elective surgeries were postponed while urgent surgeries were prioritized. Use of personal protective equipments and surgeries performed by only senior surgeons became necessary. Surgical trainees were also affected as limited training opportunities deprived them of the experience required to complete their fellowship. Some of the trainees were reallocated to COVID-19 wards, while others invested their time in research opportunities. Online platforms were used for teaching, meetings, and workshops across the globe.

However, selection on specific genes and genomic regions can alter the apportionment of diversity. We examine genetic diversity at the HLA loci, located within the MHC region. HLA genes code for proteins that are critical to adaptive immunity and are well-documented targets of balancing selection. The SNPs within HLA genes show strong signatures of balancing selection on large timescales and are broadly shared among populations, with low FST values. However, when we analyze haplotypes defined by these SNPs (i.e., which define HLA alleles), we find marked differences in frequencies between geographic regions. These differences are not reflected in the FST values because of the extreme polymorphism at HLA loci, illustrating challenges in interpreting FST. Differences in the frequency of HLA alleles among geographic regions are relevant to bone-marrow transplantation, which requires genetic identity at HLA loci between patient and donor. We explore the case of Brazils bone-marrow registry, where a deficit of enrolled volunteers with African ancestry reduces the chance of finding donors for individuals with an MHC region of African ancestry.","output":"Population structure in the MHC region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study used the elaboration likelihood model as a theoretical basis to explore the effects of various persuasion strategies on consumer perception and attitude regarding the corporate image of sports organizations that engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities.

Background: The SARS-CoV-2 vaccination program campaign has been underway in Indonesia for people aged  18 years. The programs success can be hampered by vaccine hesitancy in communities. This study aims to elucidate the determinants of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy in a rural area of the Indonesia-Philippines border island Sangihe. Methods: A mixed-methods study was conducted; a quantitative part involving a cross-sectional survey was carried out among participantes aged  18 years to determine the prevalence and determinants of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy. The qualitative part involved in-depth interviews to explore the perceptions towards the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Results: Among 557 participantes, the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was 63.9% (95% CI: 59.8C67.9). In the adjusted analysis, three factors affected vaccine hesitancy: education (aOR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.22C0.70), knowledge of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine (aOR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.41C3.34) and willingness to pay (aOR: 0.12; 95% CI: 0.07C0.20). The majority of reasons for refusing the vaccine included doubt regarding its safety and effectiveness, the fear of side effects, lack of information regarding the vaccine and local Christians religious beliefs. Conclusion: This study found that most adults in the area were hesitant about the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Lack of knowledge, a low level of education and misinformation were factors that greatly affected vaccination hesitancy. The government, by involving religious leaders, is expected to pay serious attention to the dissemination of accurate and convincing information to the public regarding the safety and importance of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.","output":"Determinantes de la indecisin ante la vacuna contra el SARS-CoV-2 en una zona rural de una isla fronteriza entre Indonesia y Filipinas: estudio de mtodos mixtos"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Personal protective equipment (PPE) compliance is important to reduce the rate of transmission of virulent pathogens to health care workers.

Enzymatic assays and molecular docking calculations showed that SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) was inhibited by ATV, with Morrisons inhibitory constant (Ki) 1.5-fold higher than boceprevir (GC376, a positive control). ATV was a competitive inhibition, increasing the Mpros Michaelis-Menten (Km) more than 6-fold. Cell-based assays indicated that SARS-CoV-2 gamma is more susceptible to ATV than its predecessor strain B.1. Using oral administration of ATV in mice to reach plasmatic exposure similar to humans, transgenic mice expression in human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (K18-hACE2) were partially protected against lethal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 gamma. Moreover, less cell death and inflammation were observed in the lung from infected and treated mice.

BACKGROUND DEB have shown promising results in femoropopliteal lesions, but data for infrapopliteal lesions are scarce. METHODS In this prospective, multicenter, randomized first-in-man study, 72 patients were randomized 1:1 to either a Passeo-18 Lux DEB (Biotronik AG, Buelach, Switzerland) (n = 36) or Passeo-18 PTA (n = 36).

And what are the discrepancies between conceptualised CECs and the actual practices of Chinese student entrepreneurs? The findings suggest that the CECs of college students extracted from Chinese experts opinions overlapped but were not completely consistent with the competence frameworks found in the literature. Such an inconsistency might be attributed to Chinas distinct sociocultural context and developmental stage.

Using a hand-collected database of partial business closures for all U.S. counties from March through December 2020, we examine the impact of capacity restrictions on COVID-19 fatality growth. For the restaurant and bar sector, we find that several combinations of partial capacity restrictions are as effective as full shutdowns.

The understanding of physiological responses of psammophytes in relation to warming and precipitation is a possible way to estimate the response of plant community stability to climate change. We selected Lespedeza davurica, Artemisia scoparia, and Cleistogenes squarrosa in sandy grassland to examine the effect of a combination of climate warming and decreasing precipitation on relative water content (RWC), chlorophyll, proline, and antioxidant enzyme activities. We found that all experimental treatments have influenced RWC, chlorophyll, proline, and antioxidant enzyme activities of three psammophytes. L. davurica has the highest leaf RWC among the three psammophytes. With the intensification of precipitation reduction, the decreasing amplitude of chlorophyll from three psammophytes was L. davurica > C. squarrosa > A. scoparia. At the natural temperature, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content of the three psammophytes under severe drought treatment was much higher than other treatments, and their increasing degree was as follows: A. scoparia > C. squarrosa > L. davurica. At the same precipitation gradient, the proline of three psammophytes under warming was higher than the natural temperature. The differences in superoxide dismutase (SOD) among the three psammophytes were A. scoparia > L. davurica > C. squarrosa. Moreover, at natural temperature, more than 40% of precipitation reduction was most significant. Regardless of warming or not, the catalase (CAT) activity of A. scoparia under reduced precipitation treatments was higher than natural temperature, while the response of L. davurica was opposite. Correlation analyses evidenced that warming (T) was significant in L. davurica and precipitation (W) was significant in A. scoparia and C. squarrosa according to the Monte-Carlo permutation test (p = 0.002, 0.004, and 0.004). The study is important in predicting how local plants will respond to future climate change and assessing the possible effects of climate change on sandy grassland ecosystems.","output":"Leaf Physiological Responses of Three Psammophytes to Combined Effects of Warming and Precipitation Reduction in Horqin Sandy Land, Northeast China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Annually, the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) recognizes three outstanding researchers for significant scientific contributions to the field of bioinformatics and computational biology, as well as one individual for exemplary service to the field.

METHODS: According to the PRISMA guideline, a comprehensive systematic search was performed in different electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus) up to July 2021. One hundred and sixty-four studies were screened in accordance with a predefined set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eighteen eligible articles were finally included in the current systematic review. RESULTS: According to the in vitro and in vivo findings, it was found that doxorubicin administration leads to decreased cell survival, increased mortality, decreased bodyweight, heart weight, and heart to the bodyweight ratio compared to the control groups. However, curcumin cotreatment demonstrated an opposite pattern in comparison with the doxorubicin-treated groups alone. Other findings showed that doxorubicin significantly induces biochemical changes in the cardiac cells/tissue. Furthermore, the histological changes on the cardiac tissue were observed following doxorubicin treatment. Nevertheless, for most of the cases, these biochemical and histological changes mediated by doxorubicin were reversed near to control groups following curcumin coadministration. CONCLUSION: It can be mentioned that coadministration of curcumin alleviates the doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Curcumin exerts these cardioprotective effects through different mechanisms of antioxidant, antiapoptosis, and anti-inflammatory. Since the finding presented in this systematic review are based on in vitro and in vivo studies, suggesting the use of curcumin in cancer patients as a cardioprotector agent against cardiotoxicity mediated by doxorubicin requires further clinical studies.","output":"In Vitro and In Vivo Cardioprotective Effects of Curcumin against Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is a recently emerged respiratory pathogen that has significantly impacted global human health. We wanted to rapidly characterise the transcriptomic, proteomic and phosphoproteomic landscape of this novel coronavirus to provide a fundamental description of the viruss genomic and proteomic potential. METHODS: We used direct RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 grown in Vero E6 cells which is widely used to propagate the novel coronavirus. The viral transcriptome was analysed using a recently developed ORF-centric pipeline. Allied to this, we used tandem mass spectrometry to investigate the proteome and phosphoproteome of the same virally infected cells. RESULTS: Our integrated analysis revealed that the viral transcripts (i.e. subgenomic mRNAs) generally fitted the expected transcription model for coronaviruses. Importantly, a 24 nt in-frame deletion was detected in over half of the subgenomic mRNAs encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein and was predicted to remove a proposed furin cleavage site from the S glycoprotein. Tandem mass spectrometry identified over 500 viral peptides and 44 phosphopeptides in virus-infected cells, covering almost all proteins predicted to be encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including peptides unique to the deleted variant of the S glycoprotein. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of an apparently viable deletion in the furin cleavage site of the S glycoprotein, a leading vaccine target, shows that this and other regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins may readily mutate. The furin site directs cleavage of the S glycoprotein into functional subunits during virus entry or exit and likely contributes strongly to the pathogenesis and zoonosis of this virus. Our data emphasises that the viral genome sequence should be carefully monitored during the growth of viral stocks for research, animal challenge models and, potentially, in clinical samples. Such variations may result in different levels of virulence, morbidity and mortality.","output":"Characterisation of the transcriptome and proteome of SARS-CoV-2 reveals a cell passage induced in-frame deletion of the furin-like cleavage site from the spike glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People with implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) who are nearing the end of life are at risk for arrhythmias, which activate the ICD and may cause unnecessary shocks and suffering.

Despite published recommendations 10 years ago regarding the management of ICDs during the end of life, over half of patients with ICDs who are dying still have not been offered the choice of deactivation. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has complicated this issue and the need to discuss it because of practices that separate patients from loved ones and that modify the usual interactions of patients with doctors and nurses. We offer the following recommendations: (1) the management of ICDs at the end-of-life needs to be understood by all physicians who care for patients with ICDs; (2) discussions about deactivating the ICD should occur while patients have decision-making capacity and are clinically stable, beginning at the time of ICD implantation, then periodically at follow-up appointments, and certainly when a change in the patient's clinical status warrants a reconsideration of the goals of care; and (3) clinicians should compensate for the impediments to communication with patients and families associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which includes patient isolation and restrictive visitor policies, by using devices that permit visual communication to reexamine goals of care, including defibrillator deactivation, in patients with ICDs who are expected to die.","output":"Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator Deactivation During End-of-Life Care in the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many Americans have experienced mental distress, which may be partially characterized by a rise in mental illnesses. However, COVID-19 specific psychological distress may also be separate from diagnosable conditions, a distinction that has not been well established in the context of the pandemic. METHODS: Data came from an online survey of US adults collected in March 2020. We used factor analysis to assess the relationship between COVID-19 related mental distress and depressive symptoms. Using four questions on psychological distress modified for COVID-19 and eight depressive symptoms, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to identify the factor structure and then estimated a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). RESULTS: The EFA model indicated a two-factor solution, where the COVID-19 distress items loaded onto the first factor and depression items loaded onto the second. Only two items cross-loaded between factors: feeling fearful and being bothered by things that do not usually bother the participant. The CFA indicated that this factor structure fit the data adequately (RMSEA=0.106, SRMR=0.046, CFI=0.915, TLI=0.890). LIMITATIONS: It is possible that there are additional important symptoms of COVID-19 distress that were not included. Depression symptoms were measured via the CES-D-10, which while validated is not equivalent to a clinician diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: As COVID-19 related mental distress appears to be distinct from, though related to, depression, public health responses must consider what aspects of depression treatment may apply to this phenomenon. For COVID-related distress, it may be more appropriate to treat symptomatically and with supportive psychotherapy.","output":"Distress in the time of COVID-19: Understanding the distinction between COVID-19 specific mental distress and depression among United States adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background - Vaccination has helped to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods - We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, phase 1/2 trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of GBP510 (2-doses at a-28-day interval) adjuvanted with or without AS03 in adults aged 19-85 years. The main outcomes included solicited and unsolicited adverse events; anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG antibody and neutralizing antibody responses; T-cell immune responses. Findings Of 328 participants underwent randomization, 327 participants received at least 1 dose of study. Each received either 10 {micro}g GBP510 adjuvanted with AS03 (n = 101), 10 {micro}g unadjuvanted GBP510 (n = 10), 25 {micro}g GBP510 adjuvanted with AS03 (n = 104), 25 {micro}g unadjuvanted GBP510 (n = 51), or placebo (n = 61). Most solicited adverse events were mild-to-moderate in severity and transient. Higher reactogenicity was observed in the GBP510 adjuvanted with AS03 groups compared to the non-adjuvanted and placebo groups. Reactogenicity was higher post-dose 2 compared to post-dose 1, particularly for systemic adverse events.

Methods: A systematic search of the peer-reviewed English survey literature indexed in PubMed was done on December 25, 2020. Results from 30 studies, met the inclusion criteria and formed the basis for final COVID-19 vaccine acceptance estimates. Results of an additional recent survey from Jordan and Kuwait was considered in this review as well. Results: Survey studies on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found from 33 different countries. Among adults representing the general public, the highest COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found in Ecuador (97.0%), Malaysia (94.3%), Indonesia (93.3%) and China (91.3%). On the other hand, the lowest COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found in Kuwait (23.6%), Jordan (28.4%), Italy (53.7), Russia (54.9%), Poland (56.3%), US (56.9%), and France (58.9%).

Purpose: To describe changes in the incidence of hospital admissions for STE- and NSTE-ACS and related short term outcomes during the first pandemic wave in Tuscany, Italy. Methods: The Agenzia Regionale di Sanit (ARS) collects administrative data from 40 hospitals in Tuscany, serving 3.730.000 inhabitants. We analyzed hospitalization rates, clinical characteristics and in-hospital mortality of STE- and NSTE-ACS patients admitted during the first 2020 pandemic wave and compared them with those of an historical reference period (2018-2019) in 3 time intervals: A) pre-LD (Jan-Feb);B) LD (March- May) and C) post-LD (June-Sept). Results: A total of 1955 STE-ACS (mean age 6913 years;69% males) and 2582 NSTE-ACS (mean age 7313 years;65% males) admissions were recorded. Compared to the historical reference period a notable and statistically significant decrease for both STE- (-10%, p<0.0001) and NSTE-ACS (-17.9%, p=0.004) was observed (Figure). Among STE-ACS hospital admissions, the greatest reduction was observed during B (-23%, p<0.0001), particularly in the month of April (-35.2%) and persisted, just missing statistical significance (-7%, p=0.08), during C. Among NSTEACS a similar behavior could be observed with the greatest reduction during B (-34%, p<0.0001) and a peak in the month of March (-43.3%). Interestingly, a significant decrease was observed both during A (-12.4%, p=0.004) and continued during C (-7%, p<0.04). Analyzing mean age and gender as well as baseline main clinical characteristics (eg. diabetes, heart failure, Charlson comorbidity score) no differences could be observed among STE- and NSTE-ACS patients between the two observation periods (2020 vs 2018-2019). Interestingly the percentage of STE-ACS patients presenting through the Emergency Medical System increased significantly (+10%) while no change was seen for the rate of those with a FMC to catheterization lab wire crossing <120 min. In Hospital mortality rates were 7.7% and 2.7% for STE-ACS and NSTE-ACS respectively and did not differ with those observed in the historical refence period. Conclusions: We found a marked reduction in ACS hospitalizations during the first pandemic wave compared to the same period of observation in the previous two years. This decline was present for both groups of ACS, but was more pronounced for patients presenting with NSTE-ACS and persisted to some extent in the post-lockdown period. Nevertheless, our data show that the process of care was granted as usual for the management of ACS patients who gained access to the emergency network during the first pandemic wave and in-hospital mortality did not increase.","output":"Hospital admissions for acute coronary syndromes during the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave: time course, patients characteristics and in-hospital mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may not return to a pre-COVID functional status and baseline levels of healthcare needs after discharge from acute care hospitals.

RAS components including angiotensin II (Ang II), angiotensin AT1 and AT2 receptors, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) are expressed in the skin and act independently from the plasma RAS. AT1 receptors, which are usually the dominating receptor subtype, promote fibrosis and scar formation, while AT2 receptors inhibit the aforementioned AT1 receptor-coupled effects. Elevated angiotensin II (Ang II) levels acting on the AT1 receptor contribute to skin scar formation through increased expression of inflammatory factors such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibrinogenic factors such as transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), while at the same time suppressing the anti-fibrotic tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMPs).

Conventional gel electrodes for electrophysiological recordings have limited use in everyday applications such as prosthetic control or muscular therapy at home. This study investigates the efficacy and feasibility of dry-contact electrode materials employed in smart textiles for EMG recordings. Methods Dry-contact electrode materials were selected and implemented on textile substrates. Using these electrodes, EMG was recorded from the forearm of able-bodied subjects. 25% and 50% isometric maximum voluntary contractions were captured. A comparative investigation was performed against gel electrodes, assessing the effect of material properties on signal fidelity and strength compared. Results When isolating for electrode surface area and pressure, 31 of the 40 materials demonstrated strong positive correlations in their mean PSD with gel electrodes (r > 95, p < 0.001). The inclusion of ionic liquids in the material composition, and using raised or flat electrodes, did not demonstrate a significant effect in signal quality. Conclusions For EMG dry-contact electrodes, comparing the performance against gel electrodes for the application with the selected material is important.

From this elementary immune response, the more complex antigen-specific adaptive responses are recruited to provide a long-lasting memory against the pathogens. Innate immunity gets activated when the host cell utilizes a diverse set of receptors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRR) to recognize the viruses that have penetrated the host and respond with cellular processes like complement system, phagocytosis, cytokine release and inflammation and destruction of NK cells. Viral RNA or DNA or viral intermediate products are recognized by receptors like toll-like receptors(TLRs), nucleotide oligomerization domain(NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) thereby, inducing type I interferon response (IFN) and other proinflammatory cytokines in infected cells or other immune cells. But certain viruses can evade the host innate immune response to replicate efficiently, triggering the spread of the viral infection. The present review describes the similarity in the mechanism chosen by viruses from different families -HIV, SARS-CoV2 and Nipah viruses to evade the innate immune response and how efficiently they establish the infection in the host. The review also addresses the stages of developments of various vaccines against these viral diseases and the challenges encountered by the researchers during vaccine development.","output":"RNA sensors as a mechanism of innate immune evasion among SARS-CoV2, HIV and Nipah viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to millions of deaths worldwide.

In the initial stages of the pandemic, reduced patient flow produced a dramatic drop in the volume of skin cancer screening. Consistent with COVID-19 precautions, our practice conducted visual skin examinations (VSE) utilizing semi-automated total body photography (TBP). METHODS: A cross-sectional study of patient characteristics and self-reported melanoma risk factors associated with TBP usage was conducted on all patients from May to November 2020 in a single practitioner private dermatology setting. The process and histopathology-confirmed outcomes were compared to those in the same 6-month period in 2019. RESULTS: For the May-November 2020 timeframe, those who opted for the home TBP (35%) compared to clinic TBP were younger, had higher self-reported skin cancer risk, and were more likely to have had previous TBP sessions. Overall, the number of TBP sessions increased, while dermoscopy usage and biopsy number decreased. There was no change in the number and distribution of skin cancer diagnoses compared to the same period in 2019. The Melanoma-In-Situ:Invasive Melanoma (MIS:INV) ratio was above the U.S. ratio reported for 2020 of 0.95:1 (95,710 MIS:100,350 INV).

Screening and diagnosis are challenges in resource-limited countries as confirmation with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is expensive and less accessible. Besides, due to the overlapping manifestations, there are no strongly suggestive symptoms that can be used as a screening tool. The goal of this study was to assess the validity of a newly created mobile phone application tool as a COVID-19 screening approach to the gold standard test (RT-PCR). Methods: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 1029 individuals for validity assessment of a newly developed COVID-19 screening tool by having PCR test results as a reference. After obtaining consent, data were collected using a structured questionnaire, maintaining all the COVID 19 prevention protocols. SPSS version 25 was used to analyze the data. The sensitivity and specificity of the tool were determined. Result: A total of 1005 participants were included in the study, which made the response rate close to 98%. The mean age of the respondents was 50.8 (SD=17.32) years;574 (57.1%) were males and 108 (10.7%) were in the age category of 41 years and above. The current study identified that the internal consistency of Cronbachs  was 0.769. The validity analysis result of the tool revealed that it has a sensitivity of 77.6% with 31.6% of positive predictive value and specificity of t 46.4% with 86.5% of negative predictive value. This study revealed that 59.4% of the study participants showed COVID-19 related symptoms and classified as tested positive for the infection, based on the newly developed mobile phone COVID-19 screening tool, whereas only 24.4% of them had positive test results for COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: The sensitivity and specificity of the mobile application tool for symptomatic COVID 19 patients was almost equivalent to the nasal swab RT PCR test. Therefore, we recommend the use of this screening test bot.

METHODS: We undertook enzyme linked immunosorbent assay characterisation of IgM and IgG responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein of 431 unselected general-population participants of the TwinsUK cohort from South-East England, aged 19-86 (median age 48; 85% female). 382 participants completed prospective logging of 14 COVID-19 related symptoms via the COVID Symptom Study App, allowing consideration of serology alongside individual symptoms, and a predictive algorithm for estimated COVID-19 previously modelled on PCR positive individuals from a dataset of over 2 million. FINDINGS: We demonstrated a seroprevalence of 12% (51participants of 431). Of 48 seropositive individuals with full symptom data, nine (19%) were fully asymptomatic, and 16 (27%) were asymptomatic for core COVID-19 symptoms: fever, cough or anosmia.

Our approach has been to offer surgery to mitigate the risk of infection and possible malignancy. All patients routinely undergo a CT scan of the chest postnatally and once the diagnosis is confirmed, minimal access surgery is offered. Our anesthetists provide single-lung ventilation to enhance the operative view. We conducted a retrospective review over a 10-year period, during which 91 patients were prenatally suspected to have a cystic lung lesion. There were 88 live births of which 29 (33%) cases were initially managed conservatively based on CT findings. Five of these patients, however, became symptomatic needing surgery. A total of 64 (73%) patients underwent surgery with the most common lesions being congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAMs) (24), hybrid lesions (19), and pulmonary sequestrations (12). The median age at surgery was 5 months (1 day to 17 months). Using a minimal access approach, 41 (64%) cases were completed with 17 performed open from the onset. Open surgery was indicated in neonates who became symptomatic within the first few weeks of life as well as patients in respiratory distress that would not tolerate either single-lung ventilation or gas insufflation. There were six further conversions to open from minimal access surgery due to poor visualization or technical difficulties. One patient needed a perioperative blood transfusion and one patient had a more prolonged stay due to persistent air leak managed conservatively. Among asymptomatic patients, evidence of microscopic disease was seen, which included infection as well as two cases of tumors, one pleuropulmonary blastoma seen as part of a CPAM, and one rhabdomyomatous dysplasia seen in the CPAM component of a hybrid lesion. In our experience, excising asymptomatic lesions is safe with minimal complications. Single-lung ventilation in combination with thoracoscopy provides excellent vision. There is a risk of infection and a definite, albeit low, risk of malignancy, which may outweigh the benefits of conservative management.","output":"Antenatally Detected Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformations: The Oxford Experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A total lockdown for pandemic SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) entailed a restriction of elective orthopedic surgeries in Switzerland. While access to the hospital and human contacts were limited, hygiene measures were intensified. The objective was to investigate the impact of those strict public health guidelines on the rate of intra-hospital, deep surgical site infections (SSI), wound healing disorders and non-infectious postoperative complications after orthopedic surgery during the first Covid-19 lockdown. METHODS: In a single-center study, patients with orthopedic surgery during the first Covid-19 lockdown from March 16, 2020 to April 26, 2020 were compared to cohorts that underwent orthopedic intervention in the pre- and post-lockdown periods of six months each. Besides the implementation of substantial public health measures (promotion of respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene), no additional infection control bundles have been implemented. RESULTS: 5791 patients were included in this study. In multivariate Cox regression analyses adjusting for the large case-mix, the lockdown was unrelated to SSI (hazard ratio (HR) 1.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6C4.8), wound healing disorders (HR 0.7; 95% CI 0.1C5.7) or other non-infectious postoperative complications (HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.3C1.5) after a median follow-up of seven months.

Currently, no consensus for the ideal AP regimen exists. Thus the present study aimed to gain a better understanding of real world practice AP patterns by surveying neurointerventional surgeons. METHODS Survey links were emailed to 296 neurointerventional surgeons practicing in the USA, asking 51 questions including demographics, stent specific use, AP pre and post-medication, types of APs, point of care (POC) assessment, complications, and outcomes. Data were collected and analyzed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). RESULTS 74 participants responded; 56.8% were from academic centers. Participants treated an average of 5.5 aneurysms per month. They placed an average of 1.6 intracranial stents and 1.4 cervical stents per month. Mean number of pipeline embolization devices (PEDs) placed per year was 15.2. Heterogeneity existed regarding AP regimens; the most frequent included acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 325 mg+Plavix 75 mg daily (for 7 days prior) and ASA 325 mg+Plavix 75 mg daily (for 5 days prior) for routine placement of intracranial and cervical stents, respectively. For emergency placement, ASA 325 mg+Plavix 600 mg (at time of surgery) was the most frequently used. 46.8% routinely used POC testing, most frequently VerifyNow (Accumetrics, San Diego, California, USA); the most common threshold determining a non-responder was <30% inhibition. 85.7% used POC for PED placement.

The processing of pre-existing airborne TEM data has been performed with the state-of-the-art methodologies. In this respect, (1) the minimum possible gate-dependent lateral stacking between adjacent soundings has been performed for the preparation of the data; (2) a 1D nonlinear forward modelling has been used for the inversion of the stacked data; (3) even if the forward modelling was 1D, the data have been inverted by spatially constraining the adjacent models (in a pseudo-2/3D fashion). We adopted an iterative approach in which the processing and inversion parameters, and the type of stabilizer utilized, have been decided after an a-posteriori analysis. Hence, after every inversion, the results have been discussed with the geologists (1) to assess, at least qualitatively, the uncertainty of the solution features and (2) to, as much as possible, include prior geological knowledge into the geophysical analysis. The new geophysical insights detected geological features that might be interpreted as glacial paleovalleys.

Groups from China Identified and sequenced the virus responsible for COVID-19, named SARS-CoV-2, and determined that it was a novel coronavirus (CoV) that shared high sequence identity with bat- and pangolin-derived SARS-like CoVs, suggesting a zoonotic origin. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of Coronaviridae, a family of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that infect a broad range of vertebrates. The rapid release of the sequence of the virus has allowed the development of diagnostic tools (e.g., RT-PCR). Additionally, serological tests can allow identification of persons who have been infected. In humans, CoVs tend to cause mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections. The fatality rate is around 1-3% for infected persons. An acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely due to an uncontrolled immune activation (cytokine storm) occurs in patients with severe disease and poor prognosis. Risk factors for mortality include: advanced age, obesity, diabetes, hypertension and other comorbidities. Drug repurposing has been used to rapidly identify potential treatment for COVID-19, which could move quickly to phase-3. Better knowledge of the virus, its enzymes, will be mandatory to develop more potent and specific direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA). In the long term, a vaccine to prevent infection would be crucial; however even if successful it might not be available before 2021-22. To date, with the exception of intravenous Remdesivir and dexamethasone, which have modest effects in moderate to severe COVID-19, no strong clinical evidence supports the efficacy and safety of any other drugs against SARS-CoV-2.

Method: A retrospective, single centre, observational cohort study of all patients undergoing surgery between 17 March 2020 and 3May 2020 was performed. Outcomes were stratified by British Orthopaedic Association COVID-19 Patient Risk Assessment Tool. Patients who were SARS-CoV-2 positive at the time of surgery were excluded. Results: Overall, 96 patients assessed as negative for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of surgery underwent 100 emergency or urgent orthopaedic procedures during the study period. Within 30 days of surgery 9.4% of patients (n = 9) were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive by nasopharyngeal swab. The overall 30 day mortality rate across the whole cohort of patients during this period was 3% (n = 3). Of those testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 66% (n = 6) developed significant COVID-19 related complications and there was a 33% 30-day mortality rate (n = 3). Overall, the 30-day mortality in patients classified as BOA low or medium risk (n = 69) was 0%, whereas in those classified as high or very high risk (n = 27) it was 11.1%. Conclusion: Orthopaedic surgery in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients who transition to positive within 30 days of surgery carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. In lower risk groups, the overall risk of becoming SARS-CoV-2 positive, and subsequently developing a significant postoperative related complication, was low even during the peak of the pandemic.

Given physical distancing recommendations, access to traditional in-person telehealth training for providers has been limited. Telesimulation is an alternative to in-person telehealth training. Telesimulation training with both remote participants and facilitators using telehealth software has not been described. Objective: We investigated the feasibility of a large group telesimulation provider training of telehealth software for remote team leadership skills with common neonatal cases and procedures. Methods: We conducted a 90-min telesimulation session with a combination of InTouch? provider access software and Zoom? teleconferencing software. Zoom facilitators activated InTouch software and devices and shared their screen with remote participants. Participants rotated through skill stations and case scenarios through Zoom and directed bedside facilitators to perform simulated tasks using the shared screen and audio connection. Participants engaged in a debrief and a pre- and postsurvey assessing participants' comfort and readiness to use telemedicine. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and paired t tests. Results: Twenty (n = 20) participants, five Zoom and eight bedside facilitators participated. Twenty-one (21) pre- and 16 postsurveys were completed. Most participants were attending neonatologists who rarely used telemedicine software. Postsession, participants reported increased comfort with some advanced InTouch features, including taking and sharing pictures with the patient (p < 0.01) and drawing on the shared image (p < 0.05), but less comfort with troubleshooting technical issues, including audio and stethoscope (p < 0.01).

Three training algorithms are adopted to train the neural networks: Levenberg-Marquard, scaled conjugate gradient, and Bayesian regularization. The results are hopeful and reveal the robustness of the proposed model. In the proposed approach, we have found Levenberg-Marquard error falls from ? 0.1074 to 0.1424, scaled conjugate gradient error falls from ? 0.1476 to 0.1618, and similarly, Bayesian regularization error falls in ? 0.09854 to 0.09871, which showed that out of the three approaches considered, the Bayesian regularization gives better results.","output":"Self-organizing Maps and Bayesian Regularized Neural Network for Analyzing Gasoline and Diesel Price Drifts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gene therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease requires efficient gene transfer to airway epithelial cells after intralumenal delivery.

We have utilized human primary airway epithelial cell cultures that generate a well-differentiated pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium to investigate whether RSV infects airway epithelium via the lumenal (apical) surface. A recombinant RSV expressing green fluorescent protein (rgRSV) infected epithelial cell cultures with high gene transfer efficiency when applied to the apical surface but not after basolateral inoculation. Analyses of the cell types infected by RSV revealed that lumenal columnar cells, specifically ciliated epithelial cells, were targeted by RSV and that cultures became susceptible to infection as they differentiated into a ciliated phenotype. In addition to infection of ciliated cells via the apical membrane, RSV was shed exclusively from the apical surface and spread to neighboring ciliated cells by the motion of the cilial beat. Gross histological examination of cultures infected with RSV revealed no evidence of obvious cytopathology, suggesting that RSV infection in the absence of an immune response can be tolerated for >3 months. Therefore, rgRSV efficiently transduced the airway epithelium via the lumenal surface and specifically targeted ciliated airway epithelial cells. Since rgRSV appears to breach the lumenal barriers encountered by other gene transfer vectors in the airway, this virus may be a good candidate for the development of a gene transfer vector for CF lung disease.","output":"Respiratory syncytial virus infection of human airway epithelial cells is polarized, specific to ciliated cells, and without obvious cytopathology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to contain the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, nation states have focused on governance of im\\\\/mobilities: Certain mobility restrictions were enforced, while simultaneously some forms of mobility were maintained or even enhanced in order to keep the system running in crisis mode.

Regression analysis results demonstrate that both the communication processes and relational attributes of resilience affect psychological stress, but differently. The communication processes of establishing identity anchors, positive emotion, and communication networks predict the situational stress dimension. The relational attributes of personal-relational identity tension, hope, and weak-tie social capital predict the self-efficacy dimension. Both dimensions are important to understanding psychological stress.

Accordingly, a comprehensive study of the compositional diversity and evolutionary patterns of accessory proteins is critical to understanding the host adaptation and epidemic variation of coronaviruses. Here, we developed a standardized genome annotation tool for coronavirus (CoroAnnoter) by combining open reading frame prediction, transcription regulatory sequence recognition and homologous alignment. Using CoroAnnoter, we annotated 39 representative coronavirus strains to form a compositional profile for all of the accessary proteins. Large variations were observed in the number of accessory proteins of 1C10 for different coronaviruses, with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV having the most (9 and 10, respectively). The variation between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins could be traced back to related coronaviruses in other hosts. The genomic distribution of accessory proteins had significant intra-genus conservation and inter-genus diversity and could be grouped into 1, 4, 2 and 1 types for alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-coronaviruses, respectively. Evolutionary analysis suggested that accessory proteins are more conservative locating before the N-terminal of proteins E and M (E-M), while they are more diverse after these proteins. Furthermore, comparison of virus-host interaction networks of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV accessory proteins showed that they share multiple antiviral signaling pathways, those involved in the apoptotic process, viral life cycle and response to oxidative stress.

This observational prospective study was designed to verify durability of antibodies against the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) spike (S)-protein (RBD S-Protein IgG) after the second-dose administration of the vaccine among Health Care Workers (HCWs). METHODS: In all HCWs at the Poliambulanza Foundation Hospital Brescia (Italy) were quantified the levels of RBD S-Protein IgG (Abbott Diagnostics) at 45 and 240 days after the second-dose vaccine. Previous infection was defined as antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid positivity (Abbott Diagnostics) before vaccination. The MannCWhitney U test was used to compare mean levels of RBD S-Protein IgG among previously infected and uninfected HCWs. RESULTS: The mean level of the RBD S-protein IgG detected 45 days after the second dose of the vaccine was 30,041 AU/mL (95% CI 145C80,000) for the 250 previously infected HCWs and it was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than that observed in the 1121 previously uninfected subject with the mean level of 10,604 AU/mL (95% CI 165C62,241). Similarly, at 240 days in previously infected subjects the antibody titer was of 8145 AU/mL (95% CI 347C80,000) and significantly higher (p < 0.001) than that observed in the 1121 previously uninfected HCWs with a mean antibody level of 1271 AU/mL (95% CI 50C80,000). When comparing the change in mean antibody levels overtime, the previously infected HCWs presented a 72.9% reduction in RBD S-protein IgG while in the previously uninfected HCWs the reduction was 88.0%. In addition, in the HCWs group without previous infection we reported 53 new SARS-CoV-2 infections and they had a mean level of RBD S-protein IgG antibodies of 1039 AU/mL (95% CI 157C4237) at 240 days. No new infections were found in previously SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects. CONCLUSIONS: We report that the mean level of post vaccinal RBD S-protein IgG was significantly higher in the previously infected HCWs than in previously uninfected subjects at 45 and 240 days after the second-dose vaccine. Moreover, our data suggest that the risk of a new SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher in the previously uninfected HCWs than in those who had already contracted natural viral infection.

METHODS & RESULTS This is a retrospective cohort study of 44 patients with MIS-C admitted at Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian during April and May 2020. We evaluated the number of patients who developed hepatitis and examined both demographics and inflammatory laboratory values to ascertain those that were at higher risk for liver involvement and more severe disease. Hepatitis was present in 19 subjects (43%) and was associated with more severe disease. Individuals with hepatitis had significantly higher rates of shock at presentation (21.1% vs. 0%, p=0.008), greater respiratory support requirement (42.1% vs. 12%, p=0.005), and longer hospitalization times (median 7-days [IQR5,10] vs 4-days [IQR3.5,6.5], p<0.05). Patients with hepatitis also had significantly higher levels of ferritin (706.9 vs. 334.2 mg/mL, p<0.01), Interleukin-6 (233.9 vs. 174.7 pg/mL, p<0.05), troponin (83 vs. 28.5 ng/L, p<0.05) and B-type Natriuretic peptide (7424.5 vs. 3209.5 pg/mL, p<0.05). The single patient with liver failure also developed multiorgan failure requiring vasopressors, hemodialysis, and mechanical ventilation. All patients were discharged, though more than 50% had persistent hepatitis up to one month after discharge. CONCLUSION Hepatitis is common in children with MIS-C and is associated with a more severe presentation and persistent elevation of LFTs in many.

This study explored the influence of altruism on negative affect and mental health (anxiety and depressive symptoms) during the COVID-19 pandemic while people self-isolated at home in China. Method: University students were recruited to participate in a cross-sectional online survey during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Self-reported perceived risk, altruism, negative affect, anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured using the Self-Report Altruism Scale (SRA scale), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-9). A structural equation model was used to analyse the mediating and moderating effects on mental health. Results: : The final sample comprised 1346 Chinese participants (Mage = 19.76  2.23 years, 73% female). Overall, the higher the risk the participants perceived, the more negative affect they exhibited (  = 0.16, p < .001), and thus, the more anxious and depressed they felt (  = 0.134, p < .001);however, this relationship between risk perception and negative affect was moderated by altruism. In contrast to previous studies, the increase in negative affect associated with the increased perceived risk was pronounced among individuals with high altruism ( t = 7.68, p < .001). Conclusions: : Individuals with high altruism exhibited more negative affect than those with low altruism, which indirectly increased their anxiety and depressive symptoms.

There is little information on the clinical presentation and specific prognostic factors for this group. This trial evaluated the clinical presentation and prognostic factors of severe disease and mortality in the oldest-old population. METHODS: This is an ambispective cohort study of oldest-old patients hospitalized for respiratory infection associated with COVID-19 and with a positive test by RT-PCR. The clinical presentation and the factors associated with severe disease and mortality were evaluated (logistic regression). All patients were followed up until discharge or death. RESULTS: A total of 103 patients (59.2% female) were included. The most frequent symptoms were fever (68.9%), dyspnoea (60.2%), and cough (39.8%), and 11.7% presented confusion. Fifty-nine patients (57.3%) presented severe disease, and 59 died, with 43 patients (41.7%) presenting both of these.

Materials and Methods: A cohort study was done over 5000 previously serosurveyed individual. They were followed up via telephone. Data was collected using a questionnaire with questions regarding infection post-serosurvey, severity of infection among relatives and vaccination status. Thus information collected was uploaded in Google form. Results: Re-infection rate among previously exposed individuals was 1.2%;at the same time period, 6% of nonexposed individuals got infected. All the re-infection cases were mild, whereas 80.74% of individuals who got infected for the first time had mild symptoms. Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in relatives who were staying with participants was found to be 3.23% and 4.22% among previously exposed and non-exposed individuals respectively. 17% of previously nonexposed individuals were fully vaccinated, whereas 0.65% of exposed individual got fully vaccinated.

Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) has been noticed as a common complication in these patients with unfavorable outcomes. The current study aimed to assess bacterial and fungal VAP in COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs during the second wave and to identify the possible risk factors. METHODS: Respiratory samples were collected from 197 critically ill COVID-19 patients under mechanical ventilation. Bacterial and fungal superinfections were diagnosed by microbiological cultures with subsequent antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates using available kits. RESULTS: All specimens 197/197 (100%) were positive for bacterial infections, while fungal elements were detected in 134/197 (68%) of specimens. The most frequently isolated bacteria were pan drug resistant (PDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae (41.1%), followed by multi drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii (27.4%). On the other hand, Candida species represented the most frequently isolated fungi (75.4%) followed by molds including Aspergillus (16.4%) and Mucor (8.2%) species. Possible risk factors for fungal VAP included underlying diabetes mellitus (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09?3.31; p = 0.02), chest disease (95% CI 1.01?3.32; p = 0.05), hypothyroidism (95% CI 1.01?4.78; p = 0.05), and longer duration of mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001). Furthermore, all patients 134/134 (100%) who developed fungal VAP, were already under treatment with corticosteroids and Tocilizumab.

A sectoral, whole-economy macroeconomic model was linked to a population-wide epidemiological demographic model to assess the potential macroeconomic impact of COVID-19, together with policies to mitigate or suppress the pandemic by means of home quarantine, school closures, social distancing and accompanying business closures. Our simulations indicate that, assuming a clinical attack rate of 48% and a case fatality ratio of 1.5%, COVID-19 alone would impose a direct health-related economic burden of 39.6bn (1.73% of GDP) on the UK economy. Mitigation strategies imposed for 12 weeks reduce case fatalities by 29%, but the total cost to the economy is 308bn (13.5% of GDP); 66bn (2.9% of GDP) of which is attributable to labour lost from working parents during school closures, and 201bn (8.8% of GDP) of which is attributable to business closures. Suppressing the pandemic over a longer period of time may reduce deaths by 95%, but the total cost to the UK economy also increases to 668bn (29.2% of GDP), where 166bn (7.3% of GDP) is attributable to school closures and 502bn (21.9% of GDP) to business closures. Our analyses suggest Covid-19 has the potential to impose unprecedented economic costs on the UK economy, and whilst public actions are necessary to minimise mortality, the duration of school and business closures are key to determining the economic cost. The initial economic support package promised by the UK government may be proportionate to the costs of mitigating Covid-19, but without alternative measures to reduce the scale and duration of school and business closures, the economic support may be insufficient to compensate for longer term suppression of the pandemic which could generate an even greater health impact through major recession.","output":"The impact of Covid-19, associated behaviours and policies on the UK economy: A computable general equilibrium model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this research work, nanofibrous hybrids are manufactured, characterized, and assessed as active antiviral and antibacterial membranes. In more detail, both polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) nanofibrous (NF) membranes and their composites with embedded silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) are manufactured by an electrospinning process. Their morphological structures have been investigated by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) which revealed a homogenous distribution and almost beads-free fibers in all manufactured samples. Characterization with spectroscopic tools has been performed and proved the successful manufacturing of Ag-incorporated PVA and TPU hybrid nanofibers. The crystalline phase of the nanofibers has been determined using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) whose patterns showed their crystalline nature at an angle value (2theta) of less than 20degree. Subsequent screening of both antiviral and antibacterial potential activities of developed nanohybrid membranes has been explored against different viruses, including SARS-Cov-2 and some bacterial strains. As a novel approach, the current work highlights potential effects of several polymeric hybrids on antiviral and antibacterial activities particularly against SARS-Cov-2. Moreover, two types of polymers have been tested and compared;PVA of excellent biodegradable and hydrophilic properties, and TPU of excellent mechanical, super elasticity, hydrophobicity, and durability properties. Such extreme polymers can serve a wide range of applications such as PPE, filtration, wound healing, etc. Consequently, assessment of their antiviral/antibacterial activities, as host matrices for Ag NPs, is needed for different medical applications. Our results showed that TPU-Ag was more effective than PVA-Ag as HIV-1 antiviral nanohybrid as well as in deactivating spike proteins of SARS-Cov-2. Both TPU-Ag and PVA-Ag nanofibrous membranes were found to have superior antimicrobial performance by increasing Ag concentration from 2 to 4 wt.%. Additionally, the developed membranes showed acceptable physical and mechanical properties along with both antiviral and antibacterial activities, which can enable them to be used as a promising functional layer in Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as (surgical gowns, gloves, overshoes, hair caps, etc.). Therefore, the developed functional membranes can support the decrease of both coronavirus spread and bacterial contamination, particularly among healthcare professionals within their workplace settings.","output":"Hybrid Nanofibrous Membranes as a Promising Functional Layer for Personal Protection Equipment: Manufacturing and Antiviral/Antibacterial Assessments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Biotechnological substances (BSs) are strongly relied upon to prevent rejection of transplanted organs, and to treat oncological, allergological, and other inflammatory diseases. Allergic reactions to partly foreign biologics can occur due to their potential immunogenicity. The severity of an immune response to a biological drug may range from no clinical significance to a severe, life-threatening anaphylactic reaction. Methods: Detailed searches were performed on Pubmed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to include all available publications. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and British Columbia Cancer Agency Drug Manual databases were screened for hypersensitivity reaction (HSR), infusion reaction, injection site reaction, urticaria, and anaphylaxis for individual BSs. Results: Treatment with BSs can cause various types of HSR. These are mentioned in the literature with definitions such as allergic reactions, anaphylactoid reactions, anaphylaxis, HSR, infusion reactions, injection site reactions, cytokine release syndrome, and urticaria. Due to the overlap in signs and symptoms in the reported descriptions, it is not always possible to differentiate these reactions properly according to their pathomechanism. Similarly, many data reported as anaphylaxis actually describe severe anaphylactic reactions (grades III or IV). Conclusion: There is an urgent need for a simpler symptom- or system-based classification and scoring system to create an awareness for HSRs to BSs. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of HSRs and increased clinical experience in the treatment of side effects will provide timely control of unexpected reactions. As a result, immunotherapy with BSs will become safer in the future. Cite this as Glsen A, Wedi B, Jappe U.

The first novel coronavirus (COVID-19) case was discovered on December 1, 2019, implying that the disease was spreading quietly and quickly in the community before reaching the rest of the world. To deal with the virus wide spread, countries have deployed contact tracing mobile applications to control viral transmission. Such applications collect users information and inform them if they were in contact with an individual diagnosed with COVID-19. However, these applications might have affected human rights by breaching users privacy. METHODOLOGY: This systematic literature review followed a comprehensive methodology to highlight current research discussing such privacy issues. First, it used a search strategy to obtain 808 relevant papers published in 2020 from well-established digital libraries. Second, inclusion/exclusion criteria and the snowballing technique were applied to produce more comprehensive results. Finally, by the application of a quality assessment procedure, 40 studies were chosen. RESULTS: This review highlights privacy issues, discusses centralized and decentralized models and the different technologies affecting users privacy, and identifies solutions to improve data privacy from three perspectives: public, law, and health considerations. CONCLUSIONS: Governments need to address the privacy issues related to contact tracing apps. This can be done through enforcing special policies to guarantee users privacy.

Applicants applied to (mean  SD) 79.7  22.8 ophthalmology residency programs, received 13.1  8.9 invitations to interview, and attended 11.1  5.8 interviews. Most applicants (N = 126; 71.2%) and PDs (N = 22; 78.6%) expressed a preference for in-person interviews over virtual interviews. If given a choice regarding the future direction for interviews, most applicants were unsure (N = 68; 38.4%) or would prefer to hold interviews virtually (N = 62; 35.0%); PDs felt that interviews should go back to being in-person (39.3%) or were unsure (28.6%). Most PDs (N = 21; 72.4%) reported an increased number of applications received by their respective programs this year compared to previous years. While applicants (N = 108; 61.0%) mostly felt that there should not be a cap on the number of applications, 19 (67.9%) PDs supported a limit on application numbers. Applicants spent an average (SD) of $2320.96 ($1172.86) on the application process this year, which is significantly less than 2018-2019 data.Conclusions: The ophthalmology residency application process was especially complex during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although many applicants and PDs were glad that interviews were held virtually this year, they were less certain regarding future years. The virtual format led to a significantly lower financial burden for applicants and may lead some to prefer this format in the future; if a hybrid model is offered for virtual/in-person interviews, these two interview modes should be compared equally.","output":"Ophthalmology Residency Match in the Covid-19 Era: Applicant and Program Director Perceptions of the 2020-2021 Application

brought great changes and convenience with better healthcare and manufacturing and higher safety, security, and efficiency for the whole society As an essential important link in these systems, sensors provide key value proposition and play a pivotal role Take wearable electronics as examples, the market value of wearable technology has doubled in the past five years Sensors have provided core functions for many different products during the development of wearable electronics, and they will continue to play a key role in future generation of products For example, smartwatches and skin patches are built based on the fitness tracking and daily activity data, and are used for medical measurement Virtual, augmented, and mixed reality devices rely on a set of sensors (e g inertial measurement unit, depth induction, force/pressure sensors) to enable users to interact with the content and environment Moreover, the transition from traditional human-computer interaction to a natural user interface will also depend on further advances in sensors Other products in different areas, such as autonomous vehicles, air detector, and smart clothing, are similar and depend on a set of core sensors that can interact with the body or the surrounding environment Some of these sensor systems have been gradually commercialized and expanded to more industrial, agricultural, military, environmental, and safety applications In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has also brought increased attention to sensors owing to their promising applications in tracking early onset and potential virus contacts, and remote patient monitoring of isolated patients In short, the sensor remains a fundamental component of the entire product line, which has been required to be thinner, lighter, smaller, more flexible, and sensitive in the new application systems Based on the important role of sensors, many preparation methods such as vapor deposition, lithography, nano-imprint lithography as well as printing have been developed Each technology has its unique advantages and adapts to different scenarios At the same time, their disadvantages that cannot be ignored also need to be addressed For instance, chemical and physical vapor deposition methods, including thermal evaporation, vacuum evaporation, magnetron sputtering, and molecular beam epitaxy, can produce high-quality materials and devices with good performance, but these technologies usually require expensive equipment and specific operating environment Moreover, it is difficult for these techniques to be compatible with flexible substrates and realize low-cost industrialized mass production In addition, photolithography and nano-imprint lithography are suitable for precision device fabrication However, they often face the challenges of low processing efficiency, low output, high cost due to the complex processing process, high design cost of mask, and long processing cycle In comparison, printing is a very attractive technology for low-cost large scale production But in most cases, the presence of mask limits the precision and resolution of the prepared micro/nano-sized devices Therefore, with the increasing demand for flexible, wearable, miniaturized, precise, integrated, and customized sensors, the new processing method with higher precision and more flexibility manners is needed to achieve controllable preparation To meet the developmental requirements of sensors, various processing techniques mentioned above are utilized to optimize and improve the sensor mainly from the aspects of the electrode, sensing material, and whole device In recent decade, laser micro-nano fabrication has been gradually developed and popular in the field of manufacturing The laser micro-nano fabrication changes the material state and property through the laser-material interaction and realizes the well-control of shape and property across scales With the advantages of large proc ssing speed, high precision, strong controllability, easy integration, and high compatibility with materials, the sensor fabricated by laser has ushered in a new development in structure regulation and performance optimization However, it still faces challenges and difficulties in mass production and efficiency promotion in practical applications Progress The laser processing technologies for the fabrication of sensors and sensing systems of different stimulus sources are summarized (Fig 2) Firstly, three laser processing modes widely used in sensor production including laser induced heating, reaction, and delamination are introduced The convenience and advantages of laser processing compared with those of the traditional processing technology can be clearly understood in the section of laser processing modes (Fig 3) Then, based on the existing research results, the sensor systems prepared by laser are classified into ultraviolet, gas, humidity, temperature, strain/stress, biology, and environmental monitoring sensors It is easily found that the advantages of laser micro-nano fabrication are mainly reflected in the following three aspects 1) Laser micro-nano fabrication has broadened the preparation approaches of electrodes and sensing materials It can realize in-situ or non-in-situ preparation of conductive electrodes and sensing materials by laser reduction, sintering, annealing, ablation, pulse deposition, laser induced carbonization, and hydrothermal reaction as well as other specific laser processing technologies, which provide alternative strategies for material preparation 2) Laser micro-nano fabrication simplifies the assembly process of the whole device The laser direct writing technology can realize in situ selective process in specific areas or specific materials, leading to great convenience for device construction Moreover, the whole sensor on flexible substrates can even be prepared by one-step laser fabrication through digital design 3) Laser micro-nano fabrication contributes to promote sensor performance Sensing material, as a key part of a single sensor, can be modified and regulated by laser processing, thus providing the possibility of performance optimization With these optimizations and improvements, the sensors become softer, smaller, and more customized and have higher integration Finally, we also analyze the problems existing in sensors fabricated by laser micro-nano fabrication, such as insufficient researches on laser-material interaction, limited processing accuracy and efficiency enhancement, and low level of device integration Conclusions and Prospect Laser micro-nano fabrication has gradually become a common and popular technology for sensing system preparation and integration To sum up, the sensor fabricated by laser still needs in-depth and detailed exploration to promote the development of commercialization and industrialization of the sensor ? 2021,

anaesthesiological care of patients in the operating room involves many activities that can lead to an infection. Hand hygiene is the most effective single measure for the prevention of nosocomial infections. Hand disinfectant dispensers should be placed within easy reach. When preparing infusions and drugs to be administered intravenously, the introduction of microorganisms cannot be completely ruled out, even if all hygienic requirements are observed. Therefore, parenterals without preservatives may only be removed immediately before administration, not several times from the same container and not for several patients. For punctures for regional anaesthesia and for the placement of vascular catheters, the highest hygiene requirements apply when long seldinger wires are used or when catheters are placed in deep tissue spaces or body cavities. The timely application of antibiotic prophylaxis is one of the most important measures in perioperative infection prevention. Indications and choice of substance should be defined in an in-house guideline. Maintaining a balanced volume, body temperature and blood sugar level contributes to the prophylaxis of surgical site infections. The preparation of an operating room after an operation must always ensure that it does not pose a risk of infection for the following patient - regardless of the pathogens with which the previous patient is infected or colonized. There is no evidence for further measures to separate so-called aseptic and septic operations or of patients with multi-resistant pathogens. In order to be able to take the necessary measures for employee protection in corona-infected patients in the operating room, it is essential to know the current infection status.

The corona crisis hit Austria at the end of February 2020 with one of the first European superspreading events. In response, the governmental crisis unit commissioned a forecast consortium with regularly projections of case numbers and demand for hospital beds. Methods. We consolidated the output of three independent epidemiological models (ranging from agent-based micro simulation to parsimonious compartmental models) and published weekly short-term forecasts for the number of confirmed cases as well as estimates and upper bounds for the required hospital beds. Findings. Here, we report om four key contributions by which our forecasting and reporting system has helped shaping Austria's policy to navigate the crisis and re-open the country step-wise, namely (i) when and where case numbers are expected to peak during the first wave, (ii) how to safely re-open the country after passing this peak, (iii) how to evaluate the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions and (iv) provide hospital managers guidance to plan health-care capacities. Interpretation. Complex mathematical epidemiological models play an important role in guiding governmental responses during pandemic crises, provided they are used as a monitoring system to detect epidemiological change points. For policy-makers, the media and the public, it might be problematic to distinguish short-term forecasts from worst-case scenarios with undefined levels of certainty, creating distrust in the legitimacy and accuracy of such models. However, when used as a short-term forecast-based monitoring system, the models can inform decisions to ease or strengthen governmental responses.","output":"Guiding Austria through the COVID-19 Epidemics with a Forecast-Based Early Warning System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The preceding chapters have described in detail specific examples of viruses that have emerged or re-emerged from animal sources.

Technologies such as the polymerase chain reaction and mass sequencing have revolutionized virus detection and enabled the rapid identification and characterization of viruses. The application of these methods has led to the identification of new groups of viruses in samples obtained from a range of animal species without the need for invasive sampling or the recovery of live virus.

Subsequently, emergency medical services (EMS) have anecdotally experienced fluctuations in demand, with reports across Canada of both increased and decreased demand. Our primary objective was to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on call volumes for several determinants in Niagara Region EMS. Our secondary objective was to assess changes in paramedic-assigned patient acuity scores as determined using the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS). METHODS: We analyzed data from a regional EMS database related to call type, volume, and patient acuity for January to May 2016-2020. We used statistical methods to assess differences in EMS calls between 2016 and 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: A total of 114,507 EMS calls were made for the period of January 1 to May 26 between 2016 and 2020, inclusive. Overall, the incidence rate of EMS calls significantly decreased in 2020 compared to the total EMS calls in 2016-2019. Motor vehicle collisions decreased in 2020 relative to 2016-2019 (17%), while overdoses relatively increased (70%) in 2020 compared to 2016-2019. Calls for patients assigned a higher acuity score increased (CTAS 1) (4.1% vs. 2.9%). CONCLUSION: We confirmed that overall, EMS calls have decreased since the emergence of COVID-19. However, this effect on call volume was not consistent across all call determinants, as some call types rose while others decreased. These findings indicate that COVID-19 may have led to actual changes in emergency medical service demand and will be of interest to other services planning for future pandemics or further waves of COVID-19.","output":"The effect of COVID-19 on emergency medical service call volumes and patient acuity: a cross-sectional study in Niagara, Ontario"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Managing cardiac arrhythmias with catheter ablation requires positioning electrodes in contact with myocardial tissue.

In this study, we examined the cardiovascular function of anesthetized rats before, during and after being constricted by boas (Boa constrictor) to examine the effect of constriction on the prey's circulatory function. The results demonstrate that within 6 s of being constricted, peripheral arterial blood pressure (PBP) at the femoral artery dropped to 1/2 of baseline values while central venous pressure (CVP) increased 6-fold from baseline during the same time. Electrocardiographic recordings from the anesthetized rat's heart revealed profound bradycardia as heart rate (fH) dropped to nearly half of baseline within 60 s of being constricted, and QRS duration nearly doubled over the same time period. By the end of constriction (mean 6.51 min), rat PBP dropped 2.9-fold, fH dropped 3.9-fold, systemic perfusion pressure (SPP=PBP-CVP) dropped 5.7-fold, and 91% of rats (10 of 11) had evidence of cardiac electrical dysfunction. Blood drawn immediately after constriction revealed that, relative to baseline, rats were hyperkalemic (serum potassium levels nearly doubled) and acidotic (blood pH dropped from 7.4 to 7.0).

Although this may have the beneficial effect of preventing infection, psychological distress may also increase with prolongation of the pandemic. METHODS: Geriatric patients were interviewed by telephone due to the ongoing curfew. Demographical characteristics, comorbidities, personal risk perception of COVID-19, common concerns related to COVID-19, and experiences of delayed hospital admission due to the pandemic were recorded. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess psychological distress, anxiety, and depression. RESULTS: Participants (n = 136; 82 females, 60.3%) had a mean age of 73.4  5.9 years. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (75%). Approximately 80% of the participants reported a decrease in physical activity during the curfew period. The HADS scores indicated rates of anxiety as 25.7% and depression as 16.9%. Anxiety was significantly more common in females than males (P = 0.002). Sleep problems (P = 0.000), fatigue (P = 0.000), and hopelessness (P = 0.000) were more common in participants with depression and anxiety. Logistic regression analyses showed an association between a delay in hospital admission and the presence of depression (P = 0.0029, R2 = 0.146).

Severe forms of COVID-19 are associated with the development of a cytokine storm that is characterized by an increased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, one of the leading strategies of treatment for patients with severe forms of COVID-19 is a decrease in the concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokines and inhibition of their effect on the organism. Objective: to perform a comparative analysis of clinical and economic constituents of the application of an IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab and systemic glucocorticosteroid dexamethasone for the therapy of severe conditions in patients with COVID-19 based on the published data review. Material and methods. The authors analyzed the data obtained from PubMed/MEDLINE databases on the study dedicated to the application of tocilizumab and dexamethasone for the therapy of severe conditions in patients with COVID-19. A statistical evaluation of the influence of these drugs on the 28-day survival rate of patients with a severe form of COVID-19 was performed. The statistical tools included methods of the attribute-based statistic (attribute-based efficiency, relative efficiency (RE), populational attributive efficiency (PAE)). For the visualization of the clinical efficiency of the compared drugs, the authors applied beta-distribution. Markov's model was used for modeling of the mortality rate. The modeling included the study of a hypothetical cohort of patients (1,000 patients with COVID-19). Besides, the authors evaluated the economic constitutive of the therapy with tocilizumab and dexamethasone. The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed. Results. The indication of dexamethasone statistically significantly increases the survival rate by 3.1% and tocilizumab - by 22.5%. RE was 1.04 (95% CI 0.040-2.042) for dexamethasone and 1.66 (95% CI 0.400-2.917) for tocilizumab. The lower border of 95% CI for both drugs was within the range of values &lt;1, which was statistically significant. PAE for dexamethasone was 1.0% (95% CI -0.6-2.6), for tocilizumab - 16.5% (95% CI -0.7-33.7). Lower borders of 95% CI for both drugs ranged within negative values, which was not statistically significant. NNT (dexamethasone) was 32;NNT (tocilizumab) was 4. Markov's modeling showed that the mortality rate among patients who received these drugs was 36 out of 1000 patients with COVID-19 for dexamethasone (initially distributed by the degree of severity according to the official statistical data) and 30 out of 1000 patients for tocilizumab, respectively. The cost of the treatment course with dexamethasone was 107.45 rub., tocilizumab - 78,827.20 rub. Clinical efficiency by the rate of cured patients obtained as a result of Markov's modeling among patients with severe forms of COVID-19 for both drugs was comparable (0.964 for dexamethasone and 0.970 for tocilizumab) with slightly higher values for tocilizumab. Conclusion. Despite relatively comparable clinical efficiency of dexamethasone and tocilizumab and a significantly higher cost the later, it is not impossible to replace tocilizumab with dexamethasone because of a great number of side effects and potential inter-drug interactions during the treatment of severe forms of COVID-19. In particular, dexamethasone therapy should be performed with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus. Procurement planning should be made taking account the reserves of tocilizumab for the stabilization of patients with cytokine storm when dexamethasone application is not safe.","output":"Clinical and economic constituents of the application of dexamethasone and tocilizumab in the therapy for severe conditions in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Cardiac re-transplantation represents a small but growing proportion of total transplants being performed Medical, ethical, moral and social dynamics continue to remain individualized and highly debated but more evolved with advancement in medicine for patients needing cardiac re-transplantation We describe a case of a successful outcome in a patient requiring her third orthotopic heart transplant Case: A 26 year old female with history of orthotopic heart transplant at age 11 for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and subsequent re-transplantation for cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) ten years later presented to our emergency room with cardiac arrest Prior to the index hospitalization, the patient had an echocardiogram with a mildly reduced ejection fraction and an angiogram with chronic total occlusions of the right coronary artery and left circumflex artery with excellent collaterals and preserved cardiac output Nuclear stress test showed no evidence of ischemia Cardiac allograft vasculopathy prophylaxis with aspirin and pravastatin in addition to a triple regimen of immunosuppression of tacrolimus, sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were verified The hospitalization was complicated by rapidly deteriorating biventricular function and three more episodes of cardiac arrest ultimately requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) Fortunately, the patient had negative HLAs with 0% CPRA and preserved end organ function The selection committee thoughtfully considered her history of intermittent social marijuana use, active COVID 19 precautions in the hospital and a third sternotomy at such a young age, with likely need of possible 4th heart transplant in the future, but ultimately approved the patient for listing Despite being Status 1, the patient had near daily loss of pulsatility for greater than 10-15 minutes which made us consider the possibility of total artificial heart Fortunately, the patient received a local heart due to the COVID travel restrictions with total ischemic time of 98 minutes She was induced with basiliximab and had negative retrospective and prospective crossmatches There were no intra-op complications and post-op the patient had mild RV dysfunction requiring 4 days of inotropes Patient was successfully discharged 9 days following her third OHT Conclusion: Patients undergoing re-transplantation have overall poorer outcomes than those undergoing primary transplantation Several factors influence these outcomes including timing from prior transplant, previous sternotomy, sensitization status, and renal dysfunction With advances in medicine and pediatric patients living well into adulthood, there will be more patients requiring re-transplantation As these trends emerge, individualized patient selection remains the key factor to improved outcomes Our case presents an otherwise healthy young woman with graft failure without evidence of sensitization who underwent a successful third transplantation","output":"When Third Time's a Charm: Successful Outcome after Third Orthotopic Heart Transplantation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the spatial closeness of blood vessels and inflammatory cells, blood vessel walls are infrequently targeted by inflammation.

Little is known about physician experiences initiating telehealth and factors that fostered or discouraged adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic with older adult patients. Therefore, our objective was to understand experiences of frontline physicians caring for older adults via telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews from September 2020 to November 2020 with 48 physicians. We recruited a diverse sample of geriatricians (n = 18), primary care (n = 15), and emergency (n = 15) physicians from all United Stated (US) regions, rural-urban settings, and academic-community practices who cared for older adult patients during the pandemic using purposive sampling methods. We completed framework analysis of the transcribed interviews to identify emerging themes and used the Quadruple Aim to organize themes. RESULTS: Frontline physicians described telehealth as a more flexible, value-based, and patient-centered mode of health care delivery. Benefits of using telehealth to treat older adults included reducing deferred care and increasing timely care, improving efficiency for physicians, enhancing communication with caregivers and patients, reducing patient travel burdens, and facilitating health outreach and education. Challenges included unequal access for rural, older, or cognitively impaired patients. Physicians noted that payment parity with in-person visits, between video and telephone visits, and relaxation of restrictive regulations would enhance their ability to continue to offer telehealth. CONCLUSIONS: Frontline physicians who treated older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic were largely in favor of continuing telehealth use beyond the pandemic; however, they noted that sustainability would depend on enacting policies that address access inequities and reimbursement concerns.

METHODS: We develop an AI-based framework that employs deep neural networks to efficiently segment lung lobes and pulmonary opacities. The volume ratio of pulmonary opacities inside each lung lobe gives the severity scores of the lobes, which are then used to predict ICU admission and mortality with three different machine learning methods. The developed methods were evaluated on datasets from two hospitals (site A: Firoozgar Hospital, Iran, 105 patients; site B: Massachusetts General Hospital, USA, 88 patients). RESULTS: AI-based severity scores are strongly associated with those evaluated by radiologists (Spearman's rank correlation 0.837, [Formula: see text]). Using AI-based scores produced significantly higher ([Formula: see text]) area under the ROC curve (AUC) values. The developed AI method achieved the best performance of AUC = 0.813 (95% CI [0.729, 0.886]) in predicting ICU admission and AUC = 0.741 (95% CI [0.640, 0.837]) in mortality estimation on the two datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate severity scores can be obtained using the developed AI methods over chest CT images. The computed severity scores achieved better performance than radiologists in predicting COVID-19 patient outcome by consistently quantifying image features. Such developed techniques of severity assessment may be extended to other lung diseases beyond the current pandemic.","output":"Association of AI quantified COVID-19 chest CT and patient outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The specific underlying pathogenesis of prolactinoma has not been clarified yet, to the best of our knowledge. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling including p38 MAPK (MAPK14), p38 (MAPK11), p38 (MAPK12) and p38 (MAPK13) is associated with the development and progression of several types of cancer. METHODS Immunofluorescence analysis was performed on the prolactin (PRL) and MAPK14 expressions of pituitary gland in C57BL/6 mice and human prolactinoma specimen. In the present study, the role of MAPK14 in prolactinoma was determined using estradiol-induced mice and dopamine D2 receptor knockout (DRD2-/-) mice models in C57BL/6 wild-type (WT), MAPK14-/- and DRD2-/-MAPK14+/- mice. GH3 cells were transfected with different sets of MAPK14 small interfering RNA, which to study MAPK14 and PRL expression in GH3 cells. RESULTS Immunofluorescence analysis showed that PRL and MAPK14 expression were colocalized and increased in the pituitary gland of mice and human prolactinoma specimen compared with the control specimen. It was shown that PRL and MAPK14 expression was colocalized and increased significantly in the pituitary gland of estradiol-injected prolactinoma mice compared with the control mice. Knockout of MAPK14 significantly inhibited tumor overgrowth, and PRL expression was decreased in estradiol-induced mice. Furthermore, MAPK14 knockout of DRD2-/-MAPK14+/- mice significantly reduced the overgrowth of pituitary gland and PRL production and secretion compared with DRD2-/- mice. MAPK14 knockout using siRNA inhibited PRL production in GH3 cells. CONCLUSION These results suggest that MAPK14 serves a promoting role in the formation of prolactinoma, and highlights the potential of MAPK14 as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of prolactinoma.","output":"Inhibiting MAPK14 showed anti-prolactinoma effect."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nesse texto, nosso objetivo foi o de demonstrar que municpios podem e devem desenvolver a??es locais com vistas a garantir a Seguran?a Alimentar e Nutricional (SAN) de seus muncipes em tempo de pandemia.

METHODS: Prospective, multicentre, randomized study in children presenting with FN at five hospitals in Santiago, Chile, evaluated at admission for diagnosis of bacterial and viral pathogens including PCR-microarray for 17 respiratory viruses. Children positive for a respiratory virus, negative for a bacterial pathogen and with a favourable evolution after 48 h of antimicrobial therapy were randomized to either maintain or withhold antimicrobials. Primary endpoint was percentage of episodes with uneventful resolution. Secondary endpoints were days of fever/hospitalization, bacterial infection, sepsis, admission to paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and death. RESULTS: A total of 319 of 951 children with FN episodes recruited between July 2012 and December 2015 had a respiratory virus as a unique identified microorganism, of which 176 were randomized, 92 to maintain antimicrobials and 84 to withdraw. Median duration of antimicrobial use was 7 days (range 7C9 days) versus 3 days (range 3C4 days), with similar frequency of uneventful resolution (89/92 (97%) and 80/84 (95%), respectively, not significant; OR 1.48; 95% CI 0.32C6.83, p 0.61), and similar number of days of fever (2 versus 1), days of hospitalization (6 versus 6) and bacterial infections throughout the episode (2%C1%), with one case of sepsis requiring admission to PICU in the group that maintained antimicrobials, without any deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of antimicrobials in children with FN and respiratory viral infections, based on clinical and microbiological/molecular diagnostic criteria, should favour the adoption of evidence-based management strategies in this population.","output":"Efficacy and safety of withholding antimicrobial treatment in children with cancer, fever and neutropenia, with a demonstrated viral respiratory infection: a randomized clinical trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study analyzed the characteristics of pursuit and assessed the influence of prior and visual information on eye velocity and saccades in amblyopic and control children, in comparison to adults. Eye movements of 41 children (21 amblyopes and 20 controls) were compared to eye movements of 55 adults (18 amblyopes and 37 controls). Participants were asked to pursue a target moving at a constant velocity. The target was either a 'standard' target, with a uniform color intensity, or a 'noisy' target, with blurry edges, to mimic the blurriness of an amblyopic eye. Analysis of pursuit patterns showed that the onset was delayed, and the gain was decreased in control children with a noisy target in comparison to amblyopic or control children with a standard target. Furthermore, a significant effect of prior and visual information on pursuit velocity and saccades was found across all participants. Moreover, the modulation of the effect of visual information on the pursuit velocity by group, that is amblyopes or controls with a standard target, and controls with a noisy target, was more limited in children. In other words, the effect of visual information was higher in control adults with a standard target compared to control children with the same target. However, in the case of a blurry target, either in control participants with a noisy target or in amblyopic participants with a standard target, the effect of visual information was larger in children.","output":"Influence of prior and visual information on eye movements in amblyopic children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A record number of firearm background checks were completed at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and during the protests following the murder of George Floyd.

As a result, individuals lost their social relationships, leading to social isolation and loneliness. Both social isolation and loneliness are major risk factors for poor physical and mental health status through enhanced chronic inflammation; however, there might be an interplay between social isolation and loneliness on the association with chronic inflammation. We aimed to clarify the link between social relationships and inflammation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic by distinguishing whether social isolation only, loneliness only, or both were associated with chronic inflammation markers among community-dwelling adults. The data of 624 people (aged 18-92 years, mean 51.4) from the Utsunomiya COVID-19 seROprevalence Neighborhood Association (U-CORONA) study, which targeted randomly sampled households in Utsunomiya city, Japan, were analyzed. Social isolation was assessed as a structural social network by asking the number of social roles they have on a daily basis. Loneliness was measured with the UCLA loneliness scale. As chronic inflammation biomarkers, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the concentration of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. Generalized estimating equations method was employed to take into account the correlations within households. Isolated-Lonely condition (i.e., being both socially isolated and feeling lonely) was associated with higher NLR among men (B = 0.141, 95%CI = -0.01 to 0.29). Interestingly, Nonisolated-Lonely condition (i.e., not socially isolated but feeling lonely) was associated with lower CRP among women (B = -0.462, 95%CI = -0.82 to -0.10) and among the working-age population (B = -0.495, 95%CI = -0.76 to -0.23). In conclusion, being both socially isolated and feeling lonely was associated with chronic inflammation. Assessing both social isolation and loneliness is critical for proper interventions to mitigate the impact of poor social relationships on health, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Interplay between social isolation and loneliness and chronic systemic inflammation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan: Results from U-CORONA study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"School health and nutrition (SHN) interventions are among the most ubiquitous public health investments and comprise a key mechanism for reaching populations that are otherwise difficult to reach through the health system.

Yet, little is known about the extent of this support over the early childhood period or how program participation varies by race (or ethnicity) and metropolitan county residence. We use administrative data from Virginia to document participation in SNAP and TANF among children born between 2007 and 2010 during their early childhood period, which we define here as birth to age six. We find that participation in SNAP is about four times greater than participation in TANF and that most children begin their connection with the social welfare system in their birth year. Children who participate earlier in life tend to stay connected over a longer portion of the early childhood period, although SNAP participation peaks around ages 3C4 while TANF peaks earlier, around ages 2C3. Most households on SNAP do not receive TANF, but only about 1 in 12 children on TANF do not receive SNAP. Finally, over the early childhood period, on average, just under 1 in 2 children in Virginia participated in SNAP or TANF but demography plays an important role in this process: The level of cumulative receipt is 1 in 4 among White children, 1 in 2 among Hispanic children but rises to 3 in 4 for Black children; cumulative receipt is also higher in nonmetropolitan counties than metropolitan counties.

We study the implementation of Medicaid expansion to assess the extent to which broadening insurance eligibility affected the functioning of municipal homelessness programs targeting chronic homelessness. The article also considers how Medicaid expansion interacted with existing governance structures and contributed to conflicts pertaining to homelessness. METHODS We employ a comparative case study of San Francisco, California, and Shreveport, Louisiana, which were selected as example cases based on a sampling approach using a Most Similar Systems framework from a national sample of cities across the U.S. We conduct elite interviews with a range of local-level stakeholders and combine this data with a review of primary-source documentation. FINDINGS Medicaid expansion did not enhance the functioning of homelessness programs and policies because of Medicaid access challenges and governance conflicts. Administrative burden and funding limitations contributed to limited provider networks, inadequate service coverage, and lack of linkages between Medicaid enrollment and homelessness programming. Governance conflicts reinforced these functional challenges, with homelessness under the administration of local municipalities and non-government organizations while states administer Medicaid. CONCLUSIONS Improving access to health care services for persons experiencing homelessness cannot occur without intentional coordination between sectors and levels of government and necessitates the development of targeted policies and programs to overcome these challenges.","output":"Technically Accessible, Practically Ineligible: The Effects of Medicaid Expansion Implementation on Chronic Homelessness."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Limited access to corneal tissue for transplantation remains a challenge in many parts of the world. To date, little attention has been paid to the problem of the cornea donor shortage in Poland, where the number of waiting patients exceeds the number of transplants performed three-fold. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and willingness towards participating in corneal donation among different social groups in Poland. Methods: This prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted among health professionals, medical students, clerics, teachers, journalists, employees and patients of the District Railway Hospital in Katowice. Online and paper questionnaires were used to collect socio-demographic data and information regarding awareness of, knowledge about and attitudes toward corneal donation. For health professionals and medical students, the questionnaires contained additional questions concerning knowledge and solutions for expanding the donor pool. Descriptive analysis and associations were evaluated using the chi(2) test. Results: In the survey, 1026 participants took part, including 370 (36.06%, group 1) health professionals and 656 (63.94%, group 2) participants from a non-medical field. A total of 330 (89.18%) from group 1 and 528 (80.49%) respondents from group 2 expressed willingness to donate their corneas. The main reason for refusal of donation in both groups was a lack of knowledge concerning eye donation (7.8%). A social campaign (64.6%) was the most frequently chosen solution for increasing the number of potential donors by health professionals and medical students. In the group of doctors, not knowing how to report a potential donor was chosen as the greatest source of difficulty in donor reporting (40%).

These challenges include the need for large, diverse, yet still representative study samples. This often means a protracted, costly, and inefficient recruitment process. Multi-site clinical trials can overcome some of these hurdles but incur their own unique challenges. With recent advances in mobile health (mHealth) and digital technologies, there is now a promising alternative: Remote Trials. These trials are led and coordinated by a local investigative team, but are based remotely, within a given community, state, or even nation. The remote approach affords many of the benefits of multi-site trials (more efficient recruitment of larger study samples) without the same barriers (cost, multi-site management, regulatory hurdles).

Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.37. However, if the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation can be halved by intense surveillance, then the probability that an imported case leads to sustained transmission is only 0.005.

Initial findings suggest that physical distancing in particular can prevent the spread of COVID-19. Objectives To investigate how information to prevent the spread of infectious diseases should be presented to increase willingness to comply with preventive measures. Methods In a preregistered online experiment, 817 subjects were presented with either interactively controllable graphics on the spread of COVID-19 and information that enable them to recognize how much the spread of COVID-19 is reduced by physical distancing (experimental group) or text-based information about quantitative evidence (control group). It was hypothesized that participants receiving interactive information on the prevention of COVID-19 infections show a significantly higher willingness to comply with future containment measures than participants reading the text-based information. Explorative analyses were conducted to examine whether other factors influence compliance. Results As predicted, we found a small effect (d = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.11;0.23, p < .001) for the tested intervention. The exploratory analysis suggests a decline in compliance later in the study (r = ?0.10, 95% CI: ?0.15;?0.07). Another significant predictor of change in compliance was health-related anxiety, but the effect was trivial. Conclusions When presented interactively, information on how the own behavior can help prevent infectious diseases can lead to slightly stronger changes in attitude towards behavioral prevention measures than just text-based information.

METHODS: The CATALYST study collected data from 3342 adults in Scotland during weeks 9C12 of a national lockdown. Using a cross-sectional design, participants completed an online questionnaire providing data on key sociodemographic and health variables, and completed a measure of positive change. The positive change measure spanned diverse domains (e.g., more quality time with family, developing new hobbies, more physical activity, and better quality of sleep). We used univariate analysis and stepwise regression to examine the contribution of a range of sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, educational attainment, and employment status) in explaining positive change. RESULTS: There were clear sociodemographic differences across positive change scores. Those reporting higher levels of positive change were female, from younger age groups, married or living with their partner, employed, and in better health.

Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common disabling complication among convalescent SARS patients who received corticosteroid therapy. In China, a considerable number of convalescent SARS patients with steroid-associated ONFH had undergone conservative treatment by traditional Chinese medicine, and this study aims to evaluate the long-term results of a spleen-invigorating Huo-Gu formula (HGF) therapy in these patients. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A total of 33 convalescent SARS patients (9 males and 24 females) with bilateral steroid-associated ONFH (66 hips) were enrolled in this study. All patients received oral HGF therapy for 6 months when they were confirmed the diagnosis of steroid-associated ONFH. They had been regularly followed up at an interval of 1 year. Harris hip score and medical imaging modalities, including plain radiography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, were performed to evaluate the outcomes. RESULTS: Based on average 14 years of follow-up of HGF therapy (ranging from 6 to 16 years), 38 hips (57%) among the 66 hips developed definite osteoarthritis, and 14 hips (26%) in 53 precollapse hips (Association Research Circulation Osseous [ARCO] Stage I or II) progressed to femoral head collapse (ARCO Stage III or IV). Only five patients (also 5 hips) underwent total hip arthroplasty, and the mean hip survival time was over 15 years by the KaplanCMeier analysis. We observed a mean Harris hip score of 63 points, which represented the reserve of 55% in pain score and 70% in physical function score. The severity of groin pain was not correlated to the severity of osteoarthritis. CONCLUSION: Chinese herbal HGF therapy demonstrates beneficial effects on preventing femoral head collapse, delaying total hip arthroplasty, and maintaining physical function in the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH. HGF therapy might be therefore a good alternative for the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH secondary to rheumatologic and infection diseases.","output":"Chinese herbal Huo-Gu formula for the treatment of steroid-associated osteonecrosis of femoral head: A 14-year follow-up of convalescent SARS patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Rare diseases affect <1 in 2000 people.

METHODS C57BL/6 mice and MRL/lpr mice were selected for experimental comparison. Mouse kidney tissues were removed and sectioned for hematoxylin and eosin staining, Masson's trichome staining, Sirius staining, and immunohistochemistry. The mRNA and protein levels of YAP1 in mouse kidney tissues were detected, and the correlation between YAP1 and fibronectin (FN) mRNA levels was analyzed. Mouse renal epithelial cells were used for in vitro experiments. After transfection and stimulation, the cells were divided into 4 groups, namely the C57BL/6 serum group (group 1), the MRL/lpr serum group (group 2), the MRL/lpr serum + siRNA-negative control group (group 3), and the MRL/lpr serum + siRNA-YAP1 group (group 4). Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in each group were detected by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. Serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and urinary protein levels were detected and assessed for their correlation with YAP1 mRNA levels by Spearman's analysis. RESULTS Compared to C57BL/6 mice, MRL/lpr mice exhibited obvious changes in fibrosis in renal tissues. In addition, YAP1 expression was significantly higher in the renal tissues of MRL/lpr mice than in those of C57BL/6 mice, and YAP1 mRNA levels were positively correlated with those of FN. YAP1 silencing in lupus serum-stimulated cells could effectively relieve serum-induced EMT. Finally, we observed that YAP1 mRNA levels in mouse kidney tissue were significantly and positively correlated with the degree of renal function injury.

Hence, the age at the onset of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) keeps growing as well. Moreover, ageing is a risk factor for both frailty and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Frailty and CVD in the elderly share pathophysiological mechanisms and associated conditions, such as malnutrition, sarcopenia, anemia, polypharmacy and both increased bleeding/thrombotic risk, leading to a negative impact on outcomes. In geriatric populations ACS is associated with an increased frailty degree that has a negative effect on re-hospitalization and mortality outcomes. Frail elderly patients are increasingly referred to cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs after ACS; however, plans of care must be tailored on individuals clinical complexity in terms of functional capacity, nutritional status and comorbidities, cognitive status, socio-economic support. Completing rehabilitative intervention with a reduced frailty degree, disability prevention, improvement in functional state and quality of life and reduction of re-hospitalization are the goals of CR program. Tools for detecting frailty and guidelines for management of frail elderly patients post-ACS are still debated.

However, the use of PCM in care team decisions remains limited. Integrated knowledge translation (IKT) offers a collaborative, adaptive approach to explore best practices for incorporating PCM into primary care practices by involving knowledge users, including patients and providers, in the exploratory process. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to test the feasibility of using patient-generated data in team-based care; describe the use of these data for team-based mental health care; and summarize patient and provider care experiences with PCM. METHODS: We conducted a multi-method exploratory study in a rural team-based primary care clinic using IKT to co-design, implement, and evaluate the use of PCM in team-based mental health care. Care pathways, workflows, and quality improvement activities were adjusted iteratively to improve integration efforts. Patient and provider experiences were evaluated using individual interviews relating to the use of PCM and patient portals in practice. All meeting notes, interview summaries, and emails were analyzed to create a narrative evaluation. RESULTS: During co-design, a care workflow was developed to incorporate electronically collected patient-generated data from the patient portal into the electronic medical record, and customized educational tools and resources were added. During implementation, care pathways and patient workflows for PCM were developed. Patients found portal use easy, educational, and validating, but data entries were not used during care visits. Providers saw the portal as extra work, and the lack of portal and electronic medical record integration was a major barrier. The IKT approach was invaluable for addressing workflow changes and understanding the ongoing barriers to PCM use and quality improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Although the culture toward using PCM is changing, the use of PCM during care has not been successful. Patients felt validated and supported through portal use and could be empowered to bring these data to their visits. Training, modeling, and adaptable PCM methods are required before PCM can be integrated into routine care.","output":"Paving the Way for Electronic Patient-Centered Measurement in Team-Based Primary Care: Integrated Knowledge Translation Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 can cause various symptoms in children.

To understand the continuing spread of the virus, to detect those who are and were infected, and to follow the immune response longitudinally, reliable and robust assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection and immunological monitoring are needed and have been setup around the world. We quantified immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG and IgA antibodies recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) or the Spike (S) protein over a period of five months following COVID-19 disease onset or in previously SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive volunteers. We report the detailed setup to monitor the humoral immune response from over 300 COVID-19 hospital patients and healthcare workers, 2500 University staff and 187 post-COVID19 volunteers, and assessing titres for IgM, IgG and IgA. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses followed a classic pattern with a rapid increase within the first three weeks after symptoms. Although titres reduce from approximately four weeks, the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies remained robust for five months in a large proportion of previously virus-positive screened subjects.

The Conservation of Resource (COR) theory postulates that resource loss generates related stress responses. It can suitably be applied to understand the pandemic's encompassing adverse consequences. Yet, no assessment tool exists. This study hence developed and validated the COR Scale for COVID-19 (CORS-COVID-19) to facilitate relevant research. The five hypothesized domains included losses in financial resource, family resource, future control, fun, and social resource. A population-based random telephone survey interviewed 300 Chinese adults in the general population in Hong Kong, China during April 3-10, 2020. The levels of different types of resource losses were high (especially for loss in fun). The 5-factor structure identified by factor analysis matches with the five hypothesized dimensions. Its psychometric properties are acceptable, including good internal consistency, content validity (the correlations between the items and their respective subscales were stronger than that between the items and the other four subscales), concurrent validity (significant correlations between the scale/subscale scores and both emotional distress due to COVID-19 and satisfaction with living in Hong Kong), and convergent validity (significant correlations between specific subscales and corresponding external variables). Relatively high floor effects were detected in some subscales. The scale, which is the first of the types to assess resource losses during a pandemic, can provide theory-based understandings/assessment about the negative impacts of COVID-19.

We assessed the accuracy of a nucleocapsid-containing assay in identifying natural infection among vaccinated individuals. A longitudinal cohort comprised of healthcare workers in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area was enrolled. Two rounds of seroprevalence studies separated by one month were conducted from 11/2020C1/2021 among n=81 participants. Capillary blood from rounds 1 and 2 was tested for IgG antibodies against spike proteins via ELISA (spike-only assay). During round 2, IgGs reactive to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (nucleocapsid-containing assay) were assessed. Vaccination status at round 2 was determined via self-report. Area under the curve (AUC) was computed to determine the discriminatory ability of the nucleocapsid-containing assay for identification of recent infection. Participants had a mean age of 40 (range=23-66) years, 83% were female. Round 1 seroprevalence was 9.5%. Prior to round 2 testing, 46% reported vaccination. Among those not recently infected, when comparing vaccinated vs. unvaccinated individuals, elevated levels of spike 1 (p<0.001) and spike 2 (p=0.01) were observed while nucleocapsid levels were not statistically significantly different (p=0.90). Among all participants, nucleocapsid response predicted recent infection with an AUC(95%CI) of 0.93(0.88,0.99). Among individuals vaccinated >10 days prior to antibody testing, the specificity of the nucleocapsid-containing assay was 92% and while the specificity of the spike-only assay was 0%.

Multiple choice questions were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square analyses were conducted to compare the two groups (PWP and FC); open-ended responses were coded using Hamilton's rapid assessment process. RESULTS: A total of 1,017 respondents (831 PWP, 186 FC). PWP shared the same levels of COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy and received similar levels of information about the vaccine as the general population. Unique concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine expressed solely by PWP included fear of death after the vaccine, concerns about vaccine efficacy, and concerns about Federal Drug Administration approval. At the time, the majority of PWP plan to seek a COVID-19 vaccination and were vaccinated at a higher rate than was the general population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 342 consecutive carotid artery lesions in 319 patients who underwent carotid artery stenting between April 2008 and April 2015. After excluding cases with carotid artery dissection and acute occlusion, 301 lesions in total of 277 patients were included in the analysis. We examined the association between in-stent protrusion, which was detected by intravascular ultrasound, and postoperative ipsilateral stroke within 30 days. RESULTS In-stent protrusion was observed in 47 (15.6%) lesions, of which postoperative ipsilateral stroke within 30 days occurred with 4 (8.5%) lesions. All these events occurred within 10 days after treatment. On the other hand, only 1 (0.39%) of the 256 lesions without in-stent protrusion showed this symptom, and the event occurred at 30days after treatment. Thus, lesions with in-stent protrusion had a higher cumulative risk of ipsilateral stroke than those without in-stent protrusion (8.5% vs 0.4% at 30 days, log-rank P < 0.001). In-stent protrusion, which was more often seen in symptomatic lesions, was associated with a vulnerable plaque assessed by MRI. After adjustment for postoperative stroke risks such as symptomatic lesions, plaque vulnerability, age or sex, in-stent protrusion was still significantly associated with postoperative ipsilateral stroke within 30 days (OR = 27.03, P = 0.001).

Many centers have delayed in-person visits by expanding the use of telemedicine (TM). The New Orleans Louisiana Neuroendocrine Tumor Specialists (NOLANETS) is a specialty referral center for patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NET), a rare cancer. This study sought to analyze the experience of TM in patients with a rare cancer and compare their experience with general oncology (Gen Onc) patients. Methods: NET patients completed an online survey conducted by the Neuroendocrine Cancer Awareness Network (NCAN), or an identical mailed paper survey conducted by NOLANETS. Data from these patients were pooled. Gen Onc patients completed the identical online survey using REDCap. Multi-disciplinary oncology physicians completed a unique online survey using REDCap. Results: NET patients (n = 247) rated their overall experience of TM as excellent (47%;n = 116) or good (41%;n = 102), and Gen Onc patients (n = 508) rated their experience as excellent, (54.6%;n = 305) and good (35.2%;n = 197);with no statistical difference between the cohorts. However, NET patients were less likely to agree that all their questions were answered than Gen Onc patients (p < 0.001). Factors associated with suboptimal experience for both cohorts included: telephone format and connection issues. Patients who experienced connection issues were less likely to agree that their questions were answered (NET p = 0.004;Gen Onc p < 0.0001) or that they wanted additional virtual visits (NET p = 0.004;Gen Onc p < 0.0001). NET patients reported a significant difference in the travel required to receive inperson care than Gen Onc patients (p < 0.0001) and significant cost savings associated with TM (p = 0.012). Physicians (n = 51) reported that they were able to effectively care for their patients using TM (88%), however there were significant differences when providers were asked if they were able to provide adequate care for follow-up (FU) visits vs new patient visits vs end-of-life visits (FU vs new, p = 0.000;FU vs End of Life, p < 0.0001;New vs End of Life, p = 0.009). Conclusions: While most NET and Gen Onc patients had a positive experience with TM, connection issues, and audio-only platform significantly decreased the overall experience. Importantly, while NET patients reported a significant cost savings, they were less likely to agree that all their questions were answered when compared to Gen Onc patients. And while most physicians agreed that they were able to effectively care for their patients, additional considerations should be made when new patients or end-of-life patients participate in TM.

Constructs were deployed at 30, 45, 60, and 90 angles to fix mesh to the tissue specimens. Lap-shear testing was performed in upward, downward, and lateral directions in relation to the abdominal wall cranial-caudal axis to evaluate fixation. Absorbatack? (AT), SorbaFix?

Since the first reported cases in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019, humans have been under threat from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV), subsequently declared a pandemic. While the world is searching for expedited approval for a vaccine, which may be only preventative and not a cure, physicians and country leaders are considering several concerted clinical trials suggesting that the age-old antimalarial drugs CQ/HCQ could be a potent therapeutic against COVID-19. Based on accumulating scientific reports, here we highlight the possible modes of action of CQ/HCQ that could justify its use against viral infections. Considering the global health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, the option of repurposing old drugs, e.g. CQ/HCQ, particularly HCQ, for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be a good choice. CQ/HCQ has diverse modes of action, including alteration of the acidic environment inside lysosomes and late endosomes, preventing endocytosis, exosome release and phagolysosomal fusion, and inhibition of the host cytokine storm. One or more diverse mechanisms might work against viral infections and reduce mortality. As there is no cure for COVID-19, clinical testing of HCQ is urgently required to determine its potency against SARS-CoV-2, as this is the currently available treatment option. There remains a need to find other innovative drug candidates as possible candidates to enter clinical evaluation and testing.","output":"A review on possible modes of action of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine: repurposing against SAR-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has become clear since the pandemic broke out that SARS-CoV-2 virus causes reduction of smell and taste in a significant fraction of COVID-19 patients. The olfactory dysfunction often occurs early in the course of the disease, and sometimes it is the only symptom in otherwise asymptomatic carriers. The cellular mechanisms for these specific olfactory disturbances in COVID-19 are now beginning to be elucidated. Several very recent papers contributed to explaining the key cellular steps occurring in the olfactory epithelium leading to anosmia/hyposmia (collectively known as dysosmia) initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this Viewpoint, we discuss current progress in research on olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 and we also propose an updated model of the SARS-CoV-2-induced dysosmia. The emerging central role of sustentacular cells and inflammatory processes in the olfactory epithelium are particularly considered. The proposed model of anosmia in COVID-19 does not answer unequivocally whether the new coronavirus exploits the olfactory route to rapidly or slowly reach the brain in COVID-19 patients.

Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities and abroad, which may cause the global outbreak. Chang Sha is the nearest provincial capital city to Wuhan, the first case of COVID-19 in Changsha was diagnosed on January 21, 2020. Estimating the transmissibility and forecasting the trend of the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 under the prevention and control measures in Changsha could inform evidence based decisions to policy makers. Methods: : Data were collected from the Health Commission of Changsha and Hunan Center for Disease Control and Prevention. A Susceptible-exposed-infections/ asymptomatic- removed (SEIAR) model was established to simulate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Changsha. Berkeley Madonna 8.3.18 were employed for the model simulation and prediction, while the curve fitting problem was solved by the Runge-Kutta fourth-order method, with a tolerance of 0.001. Results: : In this study, we found that Rt was 2.05 from January 21 to 27 and reduced to 0.2 after January 27, 2020 in Changsha. The prediction results showed that when no obvious prevention and control measures were applied, the total number of patients in Changsha would reach the maximum (2.27 million) on the 79th day after the outbreak, and end in about 240 days;When measures have not been fully launched, the total number of patients would reach the maximum (1.60 million) on the 28th day after the outbreak, and end in about 110 days;When measures have been fully launched, the total number of patients would reach the maximum (234) on the 23rd day after the outbreak, and end in about 60 days. Conclusions: : Outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Changsha is in a controllable stage under current prevention and control measures, it is predicted that the cumulative patients would reach the maximum of 234 on February 12, and the outbreak would be over on 20 March in Changsha. With the fully implementation of prevention and control measures, it could effectively reduce the peak value, short the time to peak and duration of the outbreak.","output":"Assessment and forecasting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Changsha, China: Based on a SEIAR Dynamic Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 dynamics is one of the most relevant subjects nowadays, and, in this regard, mathematical modeling and numerical simulations are of special interest.

Hospital infrastructure is also included into the mathematical description allowing the consideration of collapse scenarios. Initially, a model verification is carried out calibrating system parameters with data from China outbreak that is considered a benchmark due the availability of data for the entire cycle. Afterward, Brazil outbreak is of concern, calibrating the model and developing numerical simulations. Results show several scenarios highlighting the importance of social isolation and hospital infrastructure. System dynamics has a strong sensitivity to transmission rate showing the importance of numerical simulations to guide public health decision strategies.

In the most recent version, published in March 2021, a meta-analysis was done to determine the pooled sensitivity and specificity of chest X-ray (CXR) and lung ultrasound (LUS) for the diagnosis of COVID-19. CXR gave a sensitivity of 80.6% (95%CI: 69.1-88.6) and a specificity of 71.5% (95%CI: 59.8-80.8). LUS gave a sensitivity rate of 86.4% (95%CI: 72.7-93.9) and specificity of 54.6% (95%CI: 35.3-72.6). These results differed from the findings reported in the recent article in this journal where they cited the previous versions of the study in which a meta-analysis for CXR and LUS could not be performed. Additionally, the article states that COVID-19 could not be distinguished, using chest computed tomography (CT), from other respiratory diseases. However, the latest review version identifies chest CT as having a specificity of 80.0% (95%CI: 74.9-84.3), which is much higher than the previous version which indicated a specificity of 61.1% (95%CI: 42.3-77.1).

METHODS In vitro human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiomyocyte model showed that miR-1, miR-133a, miR-208a, miR-208b, and miR-499 are released from cells into culture medium in a time- and dose-dependent manner on doxorubicin exposure. Left ventricular (LV) myocardial deformation and circulating heart-associated miRs and plasma hs-cTnT during and after completion of chemotherapy were determined in 40 children with newly diagnosed acute leukaemia. RESULTS Significant reduction of LV global longitudinal strain and strain rates were found within 1 week after completion of anthracycline therapy in the induction phase of treatment (all p < 0.05). Hs-cTnT level peaked and miR-1 increased significantly at this time point. Log-transformed hs-cTnT correlated negatively with LV global systolic longitudinal strain (r = -0.38, p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that area under the curve for changes in plasma hs-cTnT from baseline and plasma miR-1 levels in detecting a reduction in 20% of global longitudinal strain were respectively 0.62 (95% CI 0.38-0.87) and 0.62 (95% CI 0.40-0.84).

Specifically, we train a semi-supervised model to propagate labels from a small dataset consisting of diverse image-level annotations to a large unlabeled dataset. Using the propagated labels, we generate a patch-level dataset for pretraining and formulate a multi-label contrastive learning objective to capture position-specific features encoded in each patch. We empirically validate the transfer learning performance of SWCL on seven public retinal fundus datasets, covering three disease classification tasks and two anatomical structure segmentation tasks. Our experiment results suggest that, under very low data regime, large-scale ImageNet pretraining on improved architecture remains a very strong baseline, and recently proposed self-supervised methods falter in segmentation tasks, possibly due to the strong invariant constraint imposed.

Median (Me) age was 47(range 18-81) years (y), 47% males. Chronic phase, accelerated phase and blast crisis at diagnosis was in 631 (93%), 41(6%) and 6(1%) pts, respectively. The annual number of newly diagnosed pts was as follows: 2002 - 15 pts, 2003 - 38 pts, 2004 - 46 pts, 2005 - 206 pts, 2006 - 302 pts. The last update for 209 pts was done in Jun. 2021;last contact for 100 pts - in 2020, for 39pts - in 2019, for the other - before 2018. The date of the last contact/death could not be established for 14 pts. Statistical analysis included 661 pts, the OS was evaluated by Kaplan-Mayer method using the SAS 9.4 package. In total, 331 (50%) pts of the analyzed cohort were alive with the Me follow-up of 180 (range 2-232) mo or 15 y (range 2 mo-19,3 y). All pts started therapy with IM with 25% switched to 2G TKI in subsequent therapy lines. In total, 218 (66%) pts achieved MR4, 183 (55%) pts got MMR;46 (21%) of these pts with deep molecular response (DMR) were observed in hematology centers of Moscow. The 15-y OS in the total cohort was 63% (CI 59-70%)(fig.1). The OS by age groups was as follows: 18-40yy-75% (CI 73-82%), 40-60yy- 63% (CI 59-70%), 60-80yy- 37% (CI 30-45%). The most complete information was provided by Moscow centers (2 centers, 113 pts). The 15-y OS of pts receiving treatment in Moscow was significantly higher vs pts from other regions (32 centers, 548 pts): 75% vs 60%, p=0,0030 (fig.2). The mortality in the whole cohort of 661 pts was 35% (233 pts). Of these 233 pts, 112(48%) pts deaths were due to CML progression to AP or BP (including non-compliant cases);3pts (1,5%) died after allogenic stem cell transplantation (infection complications);the cause of death was unknown in 50 (21,5%) pts. The highest death rate from CML progression was at 4-9 y of follow-up. Deaths caused by concomitant diseases were in 68 (29%) pts: coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction/heart failure in 42 (62%) of 68 pts, acute ischemic stroke in 10 (15%) pts, second malignancies (Cr- cancer) in 10 (15%) pts (lung tumor, metastatic esophageal Cr, stomach Cr, brain tumor, sigmoid colon Cr, rectal colon Cr, melanoma, renal Cr, breast tumor, other hematological malignancies), accidents - 1 pt, liver cirrhosis - 2 pts, in 2 cases - respiratory virus infections complicated with pneumonia, 1 pt died due to Covid-19. Conclusions. The long-term follow-up of the multicenter study EUTOS OSP in 35 regions of Russian Federation allows not only to characterize the 15-y OS in CML pts but also provides the long-term outlook of the routine clinical practice. Probably, better OS of CML patients receiving treatment in Moscow (2 centers) may be related to organizational issues of interaction with the federal center, better monitoring and timely switching to 2G TKI therapy. The organization and support of multicenter studies may improve the situation with the treatment of diseases of the blood system.

Study of the validity and reliability of the discourse approach for the psycholinguistic understanding of the nature, structure, and features of the linguistic consciousness functioning. Materials & Methods. This paper analyzes artificial neural network models built on the corpus of texts, which were obtained in the process of experimental research of the coronavirus quarantine concept as a new category of linguistic consciousness. The methodology of feedforward artificial neural networks (multilayer perception) was used in order to assess the possibility of predicting the leading texts semantics based on the discourses ranks and their place in the respective linear sequence. Same baseline parameters were used to predict respondents' self-assessments of changes in their psychological well-being and in daily life routine during the quarantine, as well as to predict their preferences of the quarantine strategies. The study relied on basic ideas about discourse as a meaning constituted by the dispersion of other meanings (Foucault). The same dispersion mechanism realizes itself in interdiscourse interaction, forming a discursive formation at a higher level. The method of T-units (Hunt) was used to identify and count discourses in the texts. The ranking of discourses was provided based on the criterion of their semantic-syntactic autonomy. Results. The conducted neural network modeling revealed a high accuracy in predicting the work of the linguistic consciousness functions associated with retrospective self-assessment and anticipatory imagination of the respondents. Another result of this modeling is a partial confirmation of the assumption concerning existence a relationship between the structural parameters of the discursive field (the rank of the discourses and their place in the respective linear sequence) and the leading semantics of the text. Conclusions. A discourse approach to the study of linguistic consciousness, understanding of its structure and functioning features seems to be reasonably appropriate. The implementation of the approach presupposes the need to form a base of linguistic corpora with the inclusion in each text markup of such parameters as: the presence of specific discourses, their ranks, positions in the linear sequence of discourses.","output":"Discourseology of Linguistic Consciousness: Neural Network Modeling of Some Structural and Semantic Relationships"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid rollout of vaccinations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to their widespread distribution and administration throughout the world.

Now, America has become the epicenter of the pandemic, with more reported cases and deaths than other regions of the world. Studying the development asymptomatic populations may play a key role in managing the outbreak effectively. Methods: We propose a new model to predict the course of the epidemic and simulate the transmission of the asymptomatic. The model considers seven stages of infection: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), asymptomatic (A), confirmed (C), recovered (R), dead (D), we named it as SEIACRD. We used a model to study the interaction between asymptomatic patients and viral transmission. Result: Our model confirms that about 12 million people will be infected with the virus. Changes in mortality rates will be volatile, first falling, then rising. Not only the number of patients, but also the spread of the epidemic will be affected by the ability to detect asymptomatic persons. Contact with asymptomatic infected patients also significantly promoted the spread of the virus. But these methods had no significant effect on changes in patient mortality. Conclusion: American Asymptomatic patients have a strong interaction with epidemic transmission. They are no less at risk of transmission than symptomatic patients. In terms of controlling the number of infections, efforts to improve detection capacity are more effective than simply suppressing the spread of the virus.

IBV is a member of the Coronaviridae family and the genus Gammacoronavirus. A new infectious bronchitis virus serotype can emerge from only very few amino acid changes within the major peplomer glycoprotein, namely in its S1 part forming the virion spike. Principally, the serotypes are identified by virus neutralization (VN) tests. This study is aimed to investigate the neutralizing efficiency of H52, H120, and 4/91 antiserum against IBV genotypes (IS-1494, IS-720, 793/B, IR-1) recently circulating in Iran. For the first time, we have used cross-neutralization tests for the serological classification of these isolates. In this study, all antisera failed to neutralize all IBV strains. According to the results of our research, cross-protection studies are necessary for the design of a proper vaccination program for IBV circulating genotypes in Iran.

Given that a vaccine will eventually be produced, information will be needed to support a potential campaign to promote vaccination. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the variables affecting the likelihood of refusal and indecision toward a vaccine against COVID-19 and to determine the acceptance of the vaccine for different scenarios of effectiveness and side effects. Materials and Methods: A multinomial logistic regression method based on the Health Belief Model was used to estimate the current methodology, using data obtained by an online anonymous survey of 370 respondents in Chile. Results: The results indicate that 49% of respondents were willing to be vaccinated, with 28% undecided or 77% of individuals who would potentially be willing to be inoculated. The main variables that explained the probability of rejection or indecision were associated with the severity of COVID-19, such as, the side effects and effectiveness of the vaccine; perceived benefits, including immunity, decreased fear of contagion, and the protection of oneself and the environment; action signals, such as, responses from ones' family and the government, available information, and specialists' recommendations; and susceptibility, including the contagion rate per 1,000 inhabitants and relatives with COVID-19, among others. Our analysis of hypothetical vaccine scenarios revealed that individuals preferred less risky vaccines in terms of fewer side effects, rather than effectiveness. Additionally, the variables that explained the indecision toward or rejection of a potential COVID-19 vaccine could be used in designing public health policies. Conclusions: We discovered that it is necessary to formulate specific, differentiated vaccination-promotion strategies for the anti-vaccine and undecided groups based on the factors that explain the probability of individuals refusing or expressing hesitation toward vaccination.","output":"Hesitation and Refusal Factors in Individuals' Decision-Making Processes Regarding a Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic resection of colorectal cancers is a safe alternative to open surgery. The conversion rate to open surgery remains fairly constant but is associated with increased morbidity. A new approach to the surgical excision of rectal cancer is transanal total mesorectal excision (TME), in which the rectum is mobilized peranally using endoscopic instruments. This feasibility study describes initial results with transanal TME. METHODS Between June and August 2012, five consecutive unselected patients with rectal carcinoma underwent surgical excision of rectal tumours by means of transanal TME. RESULTS Transanal endoscopic dissection of the complete rectum was possible in all patients. Histopathological examination confirmed clear surgical margins and an intact mesorectal fascia in all patients. One patient developed a presacral abscess. Median duration of operation was 175 (range 160-194) min. CONCLUSION Transanal TME using the down-to-up principle is feasible.

This study analyzes the mortality and morbidities of veterans who underwent paraesophageal hernia repair in the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. METHODS: Veterans who underwent paraesophageal hernia repair from 2010 to 2017 were identified using Current Procedural Terminology codes. Multivariable analysis was used to compare laparoscopic and open, including abdominal and thoracic approaches, groups. The outcomes were postoperative complications and mortality. RESULTS: There were 1607 patients in the laparoscopic group and 366 in the open group, with 84.1% men and mean age of 61 years. Gender and body mass index did not influence the type of surgical approach. The mortality rates at 30 and 180 days were 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Postoperative complications, including reintubation (2.2%), pneumonia (2.0%), intubation > 48 h (2.0%), and sepsis (2.0%) were higher in the open group (15.9% versus 7.2%, p < 0.001). The laparoscopic group had a significantly shorter length of stay (4.3 versus 9.6 days, p < 0.001) and a lower percentage of return to surgery within 30 days (3.9% versus 8.2%, p < 0.001) than the open group. The ratio of open versus laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repairs varied significantly by different Veterans Integrated Services Network regions. CONCLUSIONS: Veterans undergoing laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair experience similar outcomes as patients in the private sector. Veterans who underwent laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair had significantly less complications compared to an open approach even after adjusting for patient comorbidities and demographics. The difference in open versus laparoscopic practices between various regions requires further investigation.","output":"Outcomes of Paraesophageal Hernia Repair: Analysis of the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program Database"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our opinions and views of life can be shaped by how we perceive the opinions of others on social media like Facebook.

The study aimed to monitor in-depth the feasibility of the regulations and their impact on the well-being of residents, their visitors, and healthcare staff. DESIGN Mixed-methods study in 5 of the 26 facilities; the facilities were affiliated to an academic network of nursing homes. PARTICIPANTS Visitors and healthcare professionals. INTERVENTION Allowing visitors using local regulations based on national guidelines. MEASUREMENTS Digital questionnaire, analyzing documentation such as infection prevention control protocols, attending meetings of COVID-19 crisis teams, in-depth telephone or in-person interviews with visitors and healthcare professionals, and on-site observations. RESULTS National guidelines were translated with great variety into local care practice. Healthcare professionals agreed that reopening would increase the well-being of the residents and their loved ones. However, there were also great worries for increasing workload, increasing the risk of emotional exhaustion, and the risk of COVID-19 infections. Compliance with local regulations was generally satisfactory, but maintaining social distance and correctly wearing face masks appeared to be difficult. Care staff remained ambivalent for fear of infections. In general, allowing visitors was experienced as having a positive impact on the well-being of all stakeholders. Nevertheless, some residents with dementia showed negative effects. CONCLUSION The complete lockdown of Dutch nursing homes had a substantial impact on the well-being of the residents. The reopening was welcomed by all stakeholders, but provided a high organizational workload as well as feelings of ambivalence among care staff.

It is known that exacerbated inflammation and dysregulated immune responses involving T and myeloid cells occur in COVID-19 patients with severe clinical progression. However, the differential contribution of specific subsets of dendritic cells and monocytes to ARDS is still poorly understood. In addition, the role of CD8+ T cells present in the lung of COVID-19 patients and relevant for viral control has not been characterized. With the aim to improve the knowledge in this area, we developed a cross-sectional study, in which we have studied the frequencies and activation profiles of dendritic cells and monocytes present in the blood of COVID-19 patients with different clinical severity in comparison with healthy control individuals. Furthermore, these subpopulations and their association with antiviral effector CD8+ T cell subsets were also characterized in lung infiltrates from critical COVID-19 patients. Collectively, our results suggest that inflammatory transitional and non-classical monocytes preferentially migrate from blood to lungs in patients with severe COVID-19. CD1c+ conventional dendritic cells also followed this pattern, whereas CD141+ conventional and CD123hi plasmacytoid dendritic cells were depleted from blood but were absent in the lungs.

Accordingly, new opportunities have been opened at a breakneck pace with the launch of new satellites, the continuous improvements in data retrieval technology, and the upsurge of cloud computing solutions such as Google Earth Engine (GEE). Therefore, the present work is an attempt to automate the extraction of multi-year (2016C2020) cropland phenological metrics on GEE and use them as inputs with environmental covariates in a trained machine-learning model to generate high-resolution cropland and crop field-probabilities maps in Morocco. The comparison of our phenological retrievals against the MODIS phenology product shows very close agreement, implying that the suggested approach accurately captures crop phenology dynamics, which allows better cropland classification. The entire country is mapped using a large volume of reference samples collected and labelled with a visual interpretation of high-resolution imagery on Collect-Earth-Online, an online platform for systematically collecting geospatial data. The cropland classification product for the nominal year 2019C2020 showed an overall accuracy of 97.86% with a Kappa of 0.95. When compared to Moroccos utilized agricultural land (SAU) areas, the cropland probabilities maps demonstrated the ability to accurately estimate sub-national SAU areas with an R-value of 0.9. Furthermore, analyzing cropland dynamics reveals a dramatic decrease in the 2019C2020 season by 2% since the 2018C2019 season and by 5% between 2016 and 2020, which is partly driven by climate conditions, but even more so by the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that impacted the planting and managing of crops due to government measures taken at the national level, like complete lockdown. Such a result proves how much these methods and associated maps are critical for scientific studies and decision-making related to food security and agriculture.","output":"National-Scale Cropland Mapping Based on Phenological Metrics, Environmental Covariates, and Machine Learning on Google Earth Engine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Respiratory physiotherapy (RPT) is considered essential in patients management during intensive care unit (ICU) stay The role of RPT in critically ill COVID-19 patients is poorly described We aimed to investigate the effects of RPT on oxygenation and lung aeration in critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU Methods: Observational pre-post study Patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to the ICU, who received a protocolized CPT session and for which a pre-and post-RPT lung ultrasound (LUS) was performed, were included A subgroup of patients had an available quantitative computed tomography (CT) scan performed within 4 days from RPT The primary aim was to evaluate whether RPT improved oxygenation;secondary aims included correlations between LUS, CT and response to RPT Results: Twenty patients were included The median (1stC3rd quartile) PaO2/FiO2 was 181 (105C456), 244 (137C497) and 246 (137C482) at baseline (T0), after RPT (T1), and after 6 h (T2), respectively PaO2/FiO2 improved throughout the study (p = 0 042);particularly, PaO2/FiO2 improved at T1 in respect to T0 (p = 0 011), remaining higher at T2 (p = 0 007) compared to T0 Correlations between LUS, volume of gas (rho = 0 58, 95%CI 0 05C0 85, p = 0 033) and hyper-aerated mass at CT scan (rho = 0 54, 95% CI 0 00C0 84, p = 0 045) were detected No significant changes in LUS score were observed before and after RPT Conclusions: RPT improved oxygenation and the improvement persisted after 6 h Oxygenation improvement was not reflected by aeration changes assessed with LUS Further studies are warranted to assess the efficacy of RPT in COVID-19 ICU patients","output":"An Experimental Pre-Post Study on the Efficacy of Respiratory Physiotherapy in Severe Critically III COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Transportation policies and projects have multiple impacts on health Research on these impacts can help promote positive and reduce adverse health consequences of decisions made by transportation agencies Methods In 2019 the U S National Cooperative Highway Research Program published a research roadmap for transportation and public health based on an extensive literature search and key informant interviews The roadmap identified 44 research gaps and 122 research needs on a wide range of relevant topics From this list, using pre-established criteria including specificity, equity, potential impact, and long-term usefulness, we selected 20 topics suitable for further research especially in academic settings Results We present the questions, context, and possible research approach for each of the 20 topics These topics cover issues ranging from integrating equity into performance measures and developing forecasting models for active travel to incorporating health questions into routine household travel surveys and examining health impacts of autonomous vehicles We added questions on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on transportation Discussion This list will be useful to faculty, researchers, and students as they consider topics for research in transportation and public health Results of research on these topics could influence transportation decisions in policy making, planning and community participation, capital programming, project design, and implementation Future leaders of transportation agencies, transportation providers, and advocacy organizations may be more likely to consider transportation policies that incorporate a health perspective if their training includes research findings that increase their awareness of the health impacts of these policies","output":"Advancing research in transportation and public health: A selection of twenty project ideas from a U.S. research roadmap"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Food retailers, manufacturers, and distributors exert powerful influence on our food choices through decisions about stocking, pricing, marketing, and promotional practices [...].","output":"The Retail Food Environment: Time for a Change"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Was wir essen, wie viel, wie, mit wem, wann und wo ist ein Ausdruck von unseren frhesten Erfahrungen und entscheidet wesentlich ber unser sp?teres Leben, unseren Ern?hrungszustand und unsere Gesundheit.

Cross-national evidence is lacking on the association between food insecurity and mental health in youth populations, and on state fragility as a social determinant of these experiences. We analysed data from six cycles of the Gallup World Poll (2014C2019), an annual survey that contains multi-item scales of food insecurity, mental health problems and positive wellbeing. The analytic sample included 164,118 youth aged 15C24 years in 160 states. We linked individual responses to state-level data from the Fragile States Indexan aggregate measure of state vulnerability to collapse or conflict (coded: sustainable, stable, warning, or alert) and estimated adjusted relative risk (RR) of food insecurity as a function of state fragility. We then used linear regression to examine associations of state fragility and food insecurity with mental health and wellbeing. The prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity rose from 22.93% in 2014 to 37.34% in 2019. State fragility (alert vs. sustainable) was related to an increased risk of food insecurity (RR = 2.28 [95% CI 1.30 to 4.01]), more mental health symptoms (b = 6.36 [95% CI 1.79 to 10.93]), and lower wellbeing (b = ?4.49 [95% CI -8.28 to ?0.70]) after controlling for state wealth and household income. Increased food insecurity (severe vs. none or mild) was uniquely related to more mental health symptoms (b = 18.44 [95% CI 17.24 to 19.64]) and reduced wellbeing (b = ?9.85 [95% CI -10.88 to ?8.83]) after state fragility was also controlled. Globally, youth experience better mental health where states are more robust and food access is more secure. The findings underscore the importance of strong governance and coordinated policy actions that may improve youth mental health.","output":"Food insecurity, state fragility and youth mental health: A global perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Peri-operative anaemia is associated with adverse outcomes [1] A previously implemented anaemia pathway reduced peri-operative transfusion rates in our Trust: anaemic patients are identified in the pre-assessment clinic (PAC) and referred to the anaemia clinic (AC) Despite the pathway, local Perioperative Quality Improvement Programme (PQIP) data (October 2018-2019) showed only 23 6% of anaemic patients received pre-operative iron treatment Iron-deficiency anaemia (IDA) screening is a Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) indicator [2];patients undergoing major elective surgery should have (i) haemoglobin (Hb) measured, (ii) if anaemic, have serum ferritin tested, (iii) be offered iron treatment if have IDA We are conducting a quality-improvement project to address barriers to pre-operative treatment of IDA and improve workflow processes for staff Methods A retrospective review was undertaken of patients having major surgery (PQIP eligible operations) over 1 week in February 2020 in a large tertiary hospital Anaemic patients were identified and peri-operative journeys were analysed Focus groups were held with the haematology and PAC teams to identify where processes could improve Audit data informed costs of different options for improvement Results Sixty-seven patients underwent major surgery, of whom 24 (36%) were anaemic Demographic, laboratory results and process data are summarised in Table 1 Our focus groups revealed the following challenges to providing pre-operative iron treatment: referrals to the AC with incomplete information, patients having minor procedures being referred to AC, insufficient time between PAC and surgery to treat IDA, no protocol for offering intravenous iron outside the AC when there is insufficient time We also noted difficulty in identifying whether patients with IDA had been offered treatment impacting on data quality for CQUIN and PQIP Discussion Despite an established anaemia pathway not all anaemic patients had a ferritin test and only 1/14 patients with IDA received iron We presented this to the PAC and (1) optimised the PAC to AC electronic referral: typing the word 'anaemia' produces referral criteria and pulls through lab results;(2) wrote a list of eligible operations to refine PAC referrals to the AC;(3) are adapting our electronic records so information on offering IDA treatment can be identified more easily The sometimes limited time between PAC and surgery is being addressed by a Trust-wide pathway modification following COVID-19","output":"Maximising opportunities for treatment of pre-operative anaemia in patients undergoing major surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

These cases showed that some COVID-19 patients can test negative by PCR but positive using isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods. As PCR tests have the possibility of false-negative results, tests that use isothermal amplification methods which can be performed in a shorter time and at a lower cost than PCR tests, may be able to diagnose patients who have false negative PCR results.","output":"Three SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative cases of COVID-19 diagnosed using isothermal amplification methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TMEM16F, a Ca2+-activated phospholipid scramblase (CaPLSase), is critical for placental trophoblast syncytialization, HIV infection, and SARS-CoV2-mediated syncytialization.

These stereotypes still influence how people interact with each other and with computers. Touch behaviour, essential in social interactions, is an interesting example of such social behaviours. The Midas touch effect describes a situation when a brief touch is used to influence ones behaviour. Our study aimed to analyse the influence of virtual touch on compliance in men in a decision-making game called Ultimatum. In a series of three studies, we investigated whether social cues such as gender, stereotypical masculine/feminine appearance, and high/low social status modify compliance to offers from embodied agents. We built an immersive version of a repeated Ultimatum game in which a proposer offers how to split ten coins, and a responder accepts or rejects the offer. In study 1, men and women played with a female and a male agent. In study 2 and 3, men played with four agents each, differing in gender and levels of stereotypically seen masculinity and social status. There was no significant touch effect. Compliance was secured mostly by the value of the offer: the more generous the offer, the higher the compliance rate. We also found evidence for the perceived masculinity and social status influence. We also describe relationships between agents characteristics and the perception of their touch.

This recommendation was based on risks endemic to these populations, as well as ethical principles related to benefits and harms, mitigating health inequalities, and promoting justice. Commercial truck drivers have played a vital and underappreciated role during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the indispensable role that commercial drivers play in distributing vaccines, they have not been recommended for vaccine allocation in the next phase (1b) by the ACIP. However, the rationale and ethical principles cited for the first vaccine phase suggest that these workers should be recommended for inclusion. By doing so, the acquisition and transmission of COVID-19 may be mitigated, which would benefit both these workers and the US public. Further, persistent vulnerabilities render commercial truck drivers susceptible to severe COVID-19 infection; therefore, vaccination during the next phase is imperative to curb the exacerbation of extant health inequities. Finally, because present-day COVID-19 vulnerabilities in these workers have been shaped by unjust policies over the past several decades, and because COVID-19 public health policies have excluded and potentially exacerbated the impacts of the pandemic for these workers, allocating vaccines to commercial truck drivers is a necessary step toward promoting justice.","output":"Commercial truck drivers should be a priority population for COVID-19 vaccinations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasing awareness about germline predisposition and the widespread application of unbiased whole exome sequencing contributed to the discovery of new clinical entities with high risk for the development of haematopoietic malignancies.

Since then, more germline causes of MN were identified, including SAMD9, SAMD9L, and ERCC6L2. This review describes the genetic and clinical spectrum of predisposition to MN. The main focus lies in delineation of phenotypes, genetics and management of GATA2 deficiency and the novel SAMD9/SAMD9L-related disorders. Combined, GATA2 and SAMD9/SAMD9L (SAMD9/9L) syndromes are recognized as most frequent causes of primary pediatric myelodysplastic syndromes, particularly in setting of monosomy 7. To date, 550 cases with germline GATA2 mutations, and 130 patients with SAMD9/9L mutations had been reported in literature. GATA2 deficiency is a highly penetrant disorder with a progressive course that often rapidly necessitates bone marrow transplantation. In contrast, SAMD9/SAMD9L disorders show incomplete penetrance with various clinical outcomes ranging from spontaneous haematological remission observed in young children to malignant progression.","output":"Germline predisposition in myeloid neoplasms: Unique genetic and clinical features of GATA2 deficiency and SAMD9/SAMD9L syndromes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reduced fitness through genetic drift and inbreeding is a major threat to small and isolated populations.

By assembling a draft arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) genome and re-sequencing complete genomes of 23 additional foxes born before and after a well-documented immigration event in Scandinavia, we here look into the genomic consequences of inbreeding and genetic rescue. We found a difference in genome-wide diversity, with 18% higher heterozygosity and 81% lower FROH in immigrant F1 compared to native individuals.

Triage, an effective solution proposed in disaster medicine, also works well to manage Emergency Department (ED) flow. The aim of this study was to describe the role of an ED Triage Center for patients with suspected novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and characterize the patient flow. METHODS: In March 2020, we established a Covid-19 triage center close to the Lige University EDs. From March 2 to March 23, we planned to analyze the specific flow of patients admitted to this triage zone and their characteristics in terms of inner specificities, work-up and management. During this period, all patients presented to the ED with symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 were included in the study. RESULTS: A total amount of 1071 patients presented to the triage center during the study period. 41.50% of the patients presented with flu-like symptoms. In 82.00% of the cases, no risk factor of virus transmission was found. The SARS-Cov2 positive patients represented 29.26% of the screened patients. 83.00% of patients were discharged home while 17.00% were admitted to the hospital. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that triage centers for the assessment and management of Covid-19 suspected patients is an essential key strategy to prevent the spread of the disease among non-symptomatic patients who present to the EDs for care. This allows for a disease-centered work-up and safer diversion of Covid-19 patients to specific hospital units.","output":"Immersion in an emergency department triage center during the Covid-19 outbreak: first report of the Lige University hospital experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Limited data exist on clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in low-middle income countries.

We created logistic regression models to understand association of clinical characteristics with illness severity and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: The study population comprised 445 patients [67% males, median age 53 (IQR 40-64) years]. Majority of patients (N = 268; 60%) had &#8805; 1 co-morbid [37.5% hypertension, 36.4% diabetes].

The objective of this review is to provide an overview of recently published studies examining ultrasound-guided diaphragm-sparing regional anesthesia techniques for the brachial plexus (BP) to favor their preferent use in patients at risk of respiratory function compromise. RECENT FINDINGS In the last 18 months, study findings on various diaphragm-sparing regional anesthesia techniques have demonstrated comparable block analgesic effectivity with a variable extent of phrenic nerve paralysis. The impact of hemi-diaphragmatic function impairment on clinical outcomes is yet to be established. SUMMARY Existing diaphragm-sparing brachial plexus regional anesthesia techniques used for shoulder and clavicle surgery may help minimize pulmonary complications by preserving lung function, especially in patients prone to respiratory compromise. Used as an anesthetic technique, they can reduce the risk of exposure of healthcare teams to aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs), albeit posing an increased risk for hemi-diaphragmatic paralysis. Reducing the incidence of phrenic nerve involvement and obtaining opioid-sparing analgesia without jeopardizing efficacy should be prioritized goals of regional anesthesia practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Diaphragm-sparing brachial plexus blocks: a focused review of current evidence and their role during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The chief executive officers (CEOs) of nine drug companies working towards a covid-19 vaccine have issued a joint statement promising to only submit [a vaccine] for approval or emergency use authorisation after demonstrating safety and efficacy through a Phase 3 clinical study  We pledge to always make the safety and well-being of vaccinated individuals our top priority, wrote the CEOs of AstraZeneca, BioNTech, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer, and Sanofi on 8 September in a statement entitled Biopharma Leaders Stand With Science 1 The statement follows an open letter by seven drug industry CEOs last week urging that political considerations should be put aside in covid-19 drug and vaccine development and that clinical data should be ","output":"Covid-19: Pharma companies promise not to bow to political pressure to rush vaccine production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Diabetes has emerged as an important risk factor for severe illness and death from COVID-19. There is a paucity of information on glycemic control among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diabetes and acute hyperglycemia. METHODS: This retrospective observational study of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 adults evaluated glycemic and clinical outcomes in patients with and without diabetes and/or acutely uncontrolled hyperglycemia hospitalized March 1 to April 6, 2020. Diabetes was defined as A1C &#8805;6.5%. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia was defined as &#8805;2 blood glucoses (BGs) > 180 mg/dL within any 24-hour period. Data were abstracted from Glytec's data warehouse. RESULTS: Among 1122 patients in 88 U.S. hospitals, 451 patients with diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia spent 37.8% of patient days having a mean BG > 180 mg/dL. Among 570 patients who died or were discharged, the mortality rate was 28.8% in 184 diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia patients, compared with 6.2% of 386 patients without diabetes or hyperglycemia (P < .001). Among the 184 patients with diabetes and/or hyperglycemia who died or were discharged, 40 of 96 uncontrolled hyperglycemia patients (41.7%) died compared with 13 of 88 patients with diabetes (14.8%, P < .001). Among 493 discharged survivors, median length of stay (LOS) was longer in 184 patients with diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia compared with 386 patients without diabetes or hyperglycemia (5.7 vs 4.3 days, P < .001). CONCLUSION: Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia occurred frequently. These COVID-19 patients with diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia had a longer LOS and markedly higher mortality than patients without diabetes or uncontrolled hyperglycemia. Patients with uncontrolled hyperglycemia had a particularly high mortality rate.

A major role of epigenetics is to control the dynamics of chromatin structure, i.e., the condensed packaging of DNA around histone proteins in eukaryotic nuclei. Key epigenetic factors include enzymes for histone modifications and DNA methylation, non-coding RNAs, and prions. Epigenetic modifications are heritable but during embryonic development, most parental epigenetic marks are erased and reset. Interestingly, some epigenetic modifications, that may be resulting from immune response to stimuli, can escape remodeling and transmit to subsequent generations who are not exposed to those stimuli. This phenomenon is called transgenerational epigenetic inheritance if the epigenetic phenotype persists beyond the third generation in female germlines and second generation in male germlines. Although its primary function is likely immune response for survival, its role in the development and functioning of the immune system is not extensively explored, despite studies reporting transgenerational inheritance of stress-induced epigenetic modifications resulting in immune disorders. Hence, this review draws from studies on transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, immune system development and function, high-throughput epigenetics tools to study those phenomena, and relevant clinical trials, to focus on their significance and deeper understanding for future research, therapeutic developments, and various applications.","output":"Do Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance and Immune System Development Share Common Epigenetic Processes?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis has shown how countries initially responded to a global challenge on their own, instead of relying on a multilateral science diplomacy - based response Although, science diplomacy has received great attention for the past decade, its meaning and the nature of the diverse practitioners involved remain elusive Science diplomacy is a transboundary field sitting across national borders, policy frameworks and stakeholders of all natures and professional backgrounds But what is a science diplomat?

Polymerase chain reaction-based assays, direct fluorescent antigen (DFA) assays, and viral cultures can detect viruses in samples from the human respiratory tract, but the presence of the virus does not prove it to be a pathogen, nor does it give information regarding the interaction of viruses with the host immune response and bacterial flora of the respiratory tract. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic provided a better understanding of how viral pathogens mediate lung injury. Although the viruses initially infect the respiratory epithelium, the relative role of epithelial damage and endothelial dysfunction has not been well defined. The inflammatory host immune response to H1N1 infection is a major contributor to lung injury. The SARS coronavirus causes lung injury and inflammation in part through actions on the nonclassical renin angiotensin pathway. The lessons learned from the pandemic outbreaks of SARS coronavirus and H1N1 capture key principles of virally mediated ALI. There are pathogen-specific pathways underlying virally mediated ALI that converge onto a common end pathway resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. In terms of therapy, lung protective ventilation is the cornerstone of supportive care. There is little evidence that corticosteroids are beneficial, and they might be harmful. Future therapeutic strategies may be targeted to specific pathogens, the pathogenetic pathways in the host immune response, or enhancing repair and regeneration of tissue damage.","output":"Viral Pathogens and Acute Lung Injury: Investigations Inspired by the SARS Epidemic and the 2009 H1N1 Influenza Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Melanoma is one of the most common cancers, with an increasing incidence worldwide.

We recently reported that factor H binding by B. burgdorferi is due to inducible expression of several approximately 20 kDa plasmid\\\\encoded, surface\\\\exposed lipoproteins related to OspE (e.g. ErpA, ErpP and P21). In addition, a second class of factor H\\\\binding proteins of approximately 27C35 kDa has been described. The OspE\\\\related lipoproteins are dramatically induced by B. burgdorferi during transmission from its tick vector into the mammalian host. The induction of OspE\\\\related lipoproteins during mammalian infection may play a key a role in the borrelial evasion of the host's immune system. The goal of the present study was to define the factor H\\\\binding regions of OspE\\\\related proteins using mutagenesis, peptide mapping and surface plasmon resonance analysis (Biacore). The combined studies revealed that the C\\\\terminal regions of both human and mouse factor H (SCRs 18C20) specifically bind to OspE\\\\related lipoproteins. We also found FHR\\\\1, whose C\\\\terminal SCRs 3C5 are homologous to SCRs 18C20 of factor H, to bind to OspE. Peptide mapping revealed five putative regions (designated I\\\\V) in OspE that could directly interact with factor H. Deleting the C\\\\terminal 15 amino acid residues from region V of P21 abolished its ability to bind factor H. At the same time, however, synthetic peptides corresponding to the C\\\\termini of OspE, P21 and ErpP did not inhibit factor H binding to OspE. Thus, the C\\\\terminal\\\\binding region V appears to be necessary but not sufficient for factor H binding. When a more specific mutation strategy was employed, where single amino acid residues in peptides spanning over the factor H\\\\binding regions were mutated to alanines, we observed that lysines in the factor H\\\\binding regions of OspE were required for factor H binding. The combined data have revealed that key lysine residues in OspE\\\\related lipoproteins and ionic interactions are crucial for factor H interactions. Furthermore, binding of OspE to the C\\\\termini of both mouse and human factor H suggests that Borrelia spirochetes utilize analogous complement resistance mechanisms in both rodents and man. In Borrelia garinii strains, which in in vitro analyses have been found to be sensitive to complement killing, differences in the OspE sequences as well as in the expression of factor H\\\\binding proteins may account for their susceptibility to serum lysis.","output":"Lysine\\\\Dependent Binding of OspE to the C\\\\terminus of Factor H Mediates Complement Resistance in Borrelia burgdorferi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We develop biologically plausible training mechanisms for self-supervised learning (SSL) in deep networks.

We propose a contrastive hinge based loss whose error involves simple local computations satisfying (ii), as opposed to the standard contrastive losses employed in the literature, which do not lend themselves easily to implementation in a network architecture due to complex computations involving ratios and inner products. Furthermore we show that learning can be performed with one of two more plausible alternatives to backpropagation that satisfy conditions (i) and (ii). The first is difference target propagation (DTP) and the second is layer-wise learning (LL), where each layer is directly connected to a layer computing the loss error. Both methods represent alternatives to the symmetric weight issue of backpropagation.

With the advent of minimally invasive surgery in the late 1980s, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has been proposed as a step procedure in high-risk patients, followed by a second step Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion and duodenal switch and, recently, as a standalone bariatric approach.

I tested the ability of either xanthoxal or ABA to reinstate dormancy in dormant red rice seeds whose dormancy was broken by fluridone (an inhibitor of the synthesis of carotenoids and, subsequently, ABA). Xanthoxal was shown to have a stronger inhibitory effect on germination than ABA when exogenously provided. Although this could indicate an additional effect of xanthoxal above that expected if xanthoxal were simply converted to ABA in the seed, alternative hypotheses cannot be excluded. One alternative is that exogenous xanthoxal may be trapped inside the cells to a greater extent than exogenous ABA, resulting in an intracellular level of ABA higher than that reached with a direct application of ABA. As a further alternative, exogenous xanthoxal may interfere with ABA action in the apoplast. In this study, following germination, early seedling growth was delayed only if ABA was applied.

As a result of this review, the authors concluded that EDIS may be useful to school psychologists supporting educators from a distance to implement interventions with youth who may be engaged in schooling remotely.","output":"Electronically Delivered Support to Promote Intervention Implementation Fidelity: A Research Synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the ongoing rise of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic across the globe, interests in COVID-19 antibody testing, also known as a serology test has grown, as a way to measure how far the infection has spread in the population and to identify individuals who may be immune Recently, many countries reported their population based antibody titer study results South Korea recently reported their third antibody formation rate, where it divided the study between the general population and the young male youths in their early twenties As previously stated, these simple point estimates may be misinterpreted without proper estimation of standard error and confidence intervals In this article, we provide an updated 95% confidence intervals for COVID-19 antibody formation rate for the Korean population using asymptotic, exact and Bayesian statistical estimation meth-ods As before, we found that the Wald method gives the narrowest interval among all asymptotic methods whereas mid p-value gives the narrowest among all exact methods and Jeffreys method gives the narrowest from Bayesian method The most conservative 95% confidence interval estimation shows that as of 00:00 November 23, 2020, at least 69,524 people were infected but not confirmed It also shows that more positive cases were found among the young male in their twenties (0 22%), three times that of the general public (0 051%) This thereby calls for the quarantine authorities need to strengthen quarantine managements for the early twenties in order to find the hidden infected people in the pop-ulation ? 2020, Korea Genome Organization","output":"Updated confidence intervals for the covid-19 antibody retention rate in the korean population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background WU and KI polyomaviruses were discovered in 2007 in samples of respiratory secretions of children with acute respiratory symptoms. Seroepidemiologic studies have shown that these viruses are widely distributed throughout the world, but their incidence in Spain has not been determined. In transplant patients, early detection and treatment of viral infections may influence prognosis and survival, because they are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, including graft failure. Methods We aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of WU and KI polyomaviruses among patients undergoing hematologic or solid organ transplant in the Hospital Marqus de Valdecilla (Santander, Spain). An in-house polymerase chain reaction with the use of specific primers was carried out in invasive lower respiratory samples from hospitalized patients with suspected respiratory infection and/or graft dysfunction and compared with asymptomatic transplant patients. Results Overall, we obtained 5.5% KI-positive samples and 1.4% WU-positive samples, with a higher prevalence of WU and KI polyomaviruses in the symptomatic population compared with the control group. Although the data suggest that their detection in respiratory samples is sporadic and often associated with other microorganisms, we should pay special attention to their association with cases of graft failure. Studies are needed with a larger number of samples to explore the potential clinical impact of these emerging polyomaviruses in transplant recipients.","output":"WU and KI Polyomavirus Prevalence in Invasive Respiratory Samples From Transplant Recipients in Cantabria, Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is commonly used, but many physicians have limited knowledge of CAM despite its widespread use. Therefore, this study sought to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of medical students on complementary and alternative medicine in the management of COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 150 medical students from three Federal Universities in South West, Nigeria. A self-administered semi-structured online Google Forms questionnaire was used to collect information. Chi-squared and Fisher's exact test was used to analyze the bivariate relationship between KAP status and sociodemographic characteristics. Spearman's correlation coefficient matrix was computed to determine the association between knowledge, attitude, CAM, age, and religiosity practice. RESULTS: The median age was 22 years (interquartile range: [IQR]: 21-23 years). Median self-rated score for religion was 4.00 (IQR: 3.00-4.25). Median knowledge score was 4.00 (IQR: 3.75-5.00), median attitude score 2.75 (IQR: 2.38-3.00) and median practice score 2.00 (IQR: 1.00-2.00). Thirty-seven respondents (24.7%) were considered to have poor knowledge about CAM use in COVID-19 while the rest (75.3%) had good knowledge. Thirty-eight (25.3%) had a poor attitude towards using CAM in COVID-19 and 112 (74.7%) had a good attitude. CONCLUSION: Medical students have good knowledge and a positive attitude towards CAM modalities as adjunct management for COVID-19. However, their practices do not reflect wide acceptability. There is a need for clinical trials on the efficacy of CAM as an adjunct treatment for COVID-19 to further inform its use.","output":"KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE AND PRACTICE OF NIGERIAN MEDICAL STUDENTS TOWARDS COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE IN COVID-19 MANAGEMENT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The study aimed to explore the best follow-up management strategy for patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) during the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) epidemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients undergoing PD who were followed up during the NCP epidemic by our hospital were enrolled in this study. Because of the need to control the epidemic, a follow-up system was established during the epidemic period, with WeChat, QQ, and the telephone as the main methods of communication. Outpatient and emergency follow-ups were carried out to ensure the safety of dialysis and the prevention and control of the epidemic. The follow-up strategy included response measures related to the epidemic situation, prevention of peritonitis related to PD, water and salt control, exercise guidance, and psychological care. According to the patient's condition, the appointment system was implemented, with one consulting room and one process for each patient. The emergency patients were isolated in accordance with the epidemic situation. RESULTS Since January 2020, among the 580 patients undergoing PD who were followed up in our department and their families, none had NCP infection. During the epidemic period, the standard hemoglobin level and the inpatient rate decreased. Complications related to PD, such as peritonitis, cardiovascular complications caused by volume overload, and pulmonary infection, did not significantly increase, and the withdrawal rate and mortality rate decreased compared with those in the same period last year. CONCLUSIONS The patient follow-up strategy during the epidemic period had a significant positive effect on preventing and controlling the epidemic. Furthermore, during the epidemic period, encouraging patients and caregivers to pay attention to protection at home, avoid going out, strengthen self-management, and other measures were beneficial to the control of kidney disease itself, which is worth promoting. The close relationship between doctors and patients during the epidemic had a positive effect on the occurrence of complications related to patients undergoing PD.","output":"Follow-up management strategy for patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis during novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Touristic cities will suffer from COVID-19 emergency because of its economic impact on their communities. The first emergency phases involved a wide closure of such areas to support\\"social distancing\\"measures (i.e. travels limitation; lockdown of (over)crowd-prone activities). In the second phase, individual's risk-mitigation strategies (facial masks) could be properly linked to\\"social distancing\\"to ensure re-opening touristic cities to visitors. Simulation tools could support the effectiveness evaluation of risk-mitigation measures to look for an economic and social optimum for activities restarting. This work modifies an existing Agent-Based Model to estimate the virus spreading in touristic areas, including tourists and residents' behaviours, movement and virus effects on them according to a probabilistic approach. Consolidated proximity-based and exposure-time-based contagion spreading rules are included according to international health organizations and previous calibration through experimental data. Effects of tourists' capacity (as\\"social distancing\\"-based measure) and other strategies (i.e. facial mask implementation) are evaluated depending on virus-related conditions (i.e. initial infector percentages). An idealized scenario representing a significant case study has been analysed to demonstrate the tool capabilities and compare the effectiveness of those solutions. Results show that\\"social distancing\\"seems to be more effective at the highest infectors' rates, although represents an extreme measure with important economic effects.

However, few studies have evaluated the predictors of clinical outcome after treatment for acute mesenteric ischemia following cardiovascular surgery. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate prognostic factors in patients who underwent laparotomy for acute mesenteric ischemia after cardiovascular surgery. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 29 patients (20 men and 9 women; median age, 71.0 years) who underwent laparotomy for acute mesenteric ischemia after cardiovascular surgery between January 2010 and August 2020. These patients were classified into the survivor group (comprising patients who were discharged or referred to another hospital, n = 16) and the nonsurvivor group (comprising those who experienced in-hospital mortality, n = 13). We compared clinical parameters between the groups to identify the predictors of outcomes. Results: More patients in the nonsurvivor group underwent emergency cardiovascular surgery (62.5% vs. 100%, p = 0.017) and received hemodialysis (12.5% vs. 61.5%, p = 0.008) at the onset of acute mesenteric ischemia than those in the survivor group. The prelaparotomy serum creatinine level was higher in the nonsurvivor group than in the survivor group (1.27 vs. 2.33 mg/dL, p = 0.004). Logistic regression analysis revealed an association between preoperative serum creatinine level and in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 5.047, p = 0.046), and Cox regression analysis demonstrated a relationship between serum creatinine level and in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio 1.610, p = 0.009). The area under the curve (receiver operating characteristic analysis) for the serum creatinine level was 0.813. Furthermore, the optimal cutoff value of the serum creatinine level was 1.59 mg/dL with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.846 and 0.687, respectively, in predicting in-hospital mortality.

The aim of the article was to study the peculiarities of the use of mental defense mechanisms and coping strategies by students in quarantine isolation caused by COVID-19, and their comparison with the protections and copings used by students before the pandemic. The study involved 108 students (future psychologists and preschool teachers). The sample is homogeneous. The average age of the subjects was 18.4 years. The empirical study used the following techniques: \\"Ways of Coping Questionnaire\\" (WCQ;Folkman & Lazarus, 1988);The Life Style Index (LSI;Plutchik et al., 1979);\\"SVF120\\" (Janke & Erdmann, 1997). Methods of descriptive statistics, Spearman correlation analysis and Mann-Whitney U were used. Mathematical data processing and graphical representation of the results were performed using the computer software package SPSS 22.0. The results of our study confirmed the hypotheses of the work on the connection of protection mechanisms with copings and on the change in the quantity and quality of protection mechanisms and coping strategies in a situation caused by quarantine isolation compared to the usual life of students. In general, this suggests a mutually reinforcing effect of copings and protections in order to effectively influence the adaptation of the individual to the circumstances through COVID-19. Understanding this pattern can help improve students' mental protection by using more mature and adequate life situations in COVID-19 protections and copings.

The apoptotic body count was higher in first-diagnosis patients than in follow-up patients (p = 0.002), and it was strongly correlated to inflammation. Using the apoptotic body count among the simplified AIH score variables, the first-biopsy patients in the definite category rose from 42 to 68%.

Methods: Literatures and clinical reports were reviewed to analyze the relationship between Huopu Xialing Decoction and damp pathogen stagnation of lung syndrome of early stage of COVID-19. TCMSP database was used to screen the potential active components in Huopo Xialing Decoction. Molecular docking of the active components with SARS-CoV-2 hydrolase and ACE2 was also carried out. According to the binding ability, the core components with both were screened. The interaction network of key components target proteins was constructed by using the software of Cytoscape to screen the main targets; The GO analysis of the main targets was carried out by using the STRING database, and the Pathway and KEGG enrichment analysis was carried out by using the plug-in of the software ClueGO of Cytoscape. Results: The Huopo Xialing Decoction was used to treat the early coronavirus pneumonia with damp pathogen and lung depression syndrome in the relationship analysis between prescriptions and syndrome, and the potential components of the 12 ingredients in Huopo Xialing Decoction were selected, with 67 core targets. Among them, paryriogenin I from Tetrapanax papyrifer, ergosterol peroxide from Poria cocos and Polyporus umbellatus, baicalin from Pinellia ternata had good binding activity with SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase and ACE2.

This has been coupled with reduced numbers of available medical professionals due to confirmed or suspected infections with SARS-CoV-2. To counteract these shortages, governments of several countries have considered the enrolment of medical students into the workforce in order to help to tackle the ongoing crisis. METHODS: Questionnaire-based study assessing the perceived role of medical students in assisting in the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary aim was to determine factors contributing to the willingness of medical students to actively assist in the pandemic. The secondary aim was to evaluate their perspectives regarding the associated changes in medical education. RESULTS: Out of 760 responses, 71.18% of medical students were willing to assist the medical workforce during the pandemic. Clinical year students were more likely to help in a medical capacity than pre-clinical students (OR = 0.384, 95%CI [0.167, 0.883, P < 0.05)]. Respondents concerned about their own well-being were less likely to engage in clinical work (OR = 0.680, 95%CI [0.491, 0.941], P < 0.020). Students who agreed that online lectures will negatively impact their education were inclined to think that the academic year should be extended (95%CI [0.065, 0.271], P = 0.001).

Using morphological, trophic, behavioral, and life history traits, we found differences between mobile and sessile assemblages regarding the effect of the type of habitat on the functional diversity. Compared to sessile assemblages, a greater functional similarity was observed for mobile assemblages, which suggests that their dispersal capacity enables them to balance the reduced connectivity between settlement structures.

However, the publics vaccine hesitancy toward the available vaccines is a big challenge in the fighting against the coronavirus spreading. We aimed in this study to report for the first time the short-term side effects following mRNA-based (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) and viral vector-based (AstraZeneca) COVID-19 vaccines among German healthcare workers. A survey-based study was conducted through an online validated questionnaire. Overall, 88.1% of the German healthcare workers included in this study reported at least one side effect following the COVID-19 vaccination. The mRNA-based vaccines were associated with a higher prevalence of local side effects (e.g., injection site pain), while the viral vector-based vaccine was associated with a higher prevalence of systemic side effects (e.g., headache/fatigue). The vast majority (84.9%) of side effects resolved within 1C3 days after vaccination, which are promising results from a safety point of view for both types of vaccines. This study is one of the few studies that aims to enhance our emerging knowledge about the risk factors of COVID-19 vaccines side effects by inquiring and analyzing the self-reported side effects across various demographic and medical parameters. ABSTRACT: Background: the increasing number of COVID-19 vaccines available to the public may trigger hesitancy or selectivity towards vaccination. This study aimed to evaluate the post-vaccination side effects of the different vaccines approved in Germany; Methods: a cross-sectional survey-based study was carried out using an online questionnaire validated and tested for a priori reliability. The questionnaire inquired about demographic data, medical and COVID-19-related anamneses, and local, systemic, oral, and skin-related side effects following COVID-19 vaccination; Results: out of the 599 participating healthcare workers, 72.3% were females, and 79.1% received mRNA-based vaccines, while 20.9% received a viral vector-based vaccine. 88.1% of the participants reported at least one side effect. Injection site pain (75.6%) was the most common local side effect, and headache/fatigue (53.6%), muscle pain (33.2%), malaise (25%), chills (23%), and joint pain (21.2%) were the most common systemic side effects.

METHODS: We created a derivation rule and a validation rule for ICU admission using data from a national registry of a cohort of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted between March and August 2020 (N = 16,298). We analyzed the available demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory variables recorded at hospital admission. We evaluated the performance of the risk score by estimating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Using the ? coefficients of the regression model, we developed a score (0 to 100 points) associated with ICU admission. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 67 years; 57% were men. A total of 1,420 (8.7%) patients were admitted to the ICU. The variables independently associated with ICU admission were age, dyspnea, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lactate dehydrogenase levels, and presence of diffuse infiltrates on a chest X-ray. The model showed an AUROC of 0.780 (CI: 0.763-0.797) in the derivation cohort and an AUROC of 0.734 (CI: 0.708-0.761) in the validation cohort. A score of greater than 75 points was associated with a more than 30% probability of ICU admission while a score of less than 50 points reduced the likelihood of ICU admission to 15%. CONCLUSION: A simple prediction score was a useful tool for forecasting the probability of ICU admission with a high degree of precision.","output":"[Derivation and validation of a risk score for admission to the intensive care unit in patients with COVID-19]./ Derivacin y validacin de una puntuacin de riesgo de ingreso en la unidad de cuidados intensivos para pacientes con COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many studies have been undertaken on the medicinal values of Erythrina abyssinica Lam. ex DC. (Fabaceae). The details, however, are highly fragmented in different journals, libraries, and other publication media. This study was therefore conducted to provide a comprehensive report on its ethnobotany, ethnomedicinal uses, phytochemicals, and the available pharmacological evidence supporting its efficacy and safety in traditional medicine. METHOD: We collected data using a PROSPERO registered systematic review protocol on the ethnobotany, phytochemistry, and ethnopharmacology of Erythrina abyssinica from 132 reports that were retrieved from electronic databases. Documented local names, morphology, growth habit and habitat, ethnomedicinal and nonmedicinal uses, diseases treated, parts used, method of preparation and administration, extraction and chemical identity of isolated compounds, and efficacy and toxicity of extracts and isolated compounds were captured. Numerical data were summarized into means, percentages, and frequencies and presented as graphs and tables. RESULTS: Erythrina abyssinica is harvested by traditional herbal medicine practitioners in East, Central, and South African communities to prepare herbal remedies for various human and livestock ailments. These include bacterial and fungal infections, tuberculosis, malaria, HIV/AIDS, diarrhea, cancer, meningitis, inflammatory diseases, urinary tract infections, wounds, diabetes mellitus, and skin and soft tissue injuries. Different extracts and phytochemicals from parts of E. abyssinica have been scientifically proven to possess anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant, antiplasmodial, antiproliferative, antifungal, antimycobacterial, antidiarrheal, anti-HIV 1, antidiabetic, and antiobesity activities. This versatile pharmacological activity is due to the abundant flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenoids present in its different parts. CONCLUSION: Erythrina abyssinica is an important ethnomedicinal plant in Africa harboring useful pharmacologically active phytochemicals against various diseases with significant efficacies and minimal toxicity to mammalian cells. Therefore, this plant should be conserved and its potential to provide novel molecules against diseases be explored further. Clinical trials that evaluate the efficacy and safety of extracts and isolated compounds from E. abyssinica are recommended.","output":"Traditional Medicinal Uses, Phytoconstituents, Bioactivities, and Toxicities of Erythrina abyssinica Lam. ex DC.

Not only has it caused a significant number of fatalities, but in combination with other hazard sources, it may pose a considerably higher multi-risk. In this paper, three hazardous events are studied through the lens of a concurring pandemic. Several low-probability high-risk scenarios are developed by the combination of a pandemic situation with a natural hazard (e.g., earthquakes or floods) or a complex emergency situation (e.g., mass protests or military movements). The hybrid impacts of these multi-hazard situations are then qualitatively studied on the healthcare systems, and their functionality loss. The paper also discusses the impact of pandemic's (long-term) temporal effects on the type and recovery duration from these adverse events. Finally, the concept of escape from a hazard, evacuation, sheltering and their potential conflict during a pandemic and a natural hazard is briefly reviewed. The findings show the cascading effects of these multi-hazard scenarios, which are unseen nearly in all risk legislation.

ONBEHALF: TeleCheck-AF Investigators AIMS: TeleCheck-AF is a multicentre international project initiated to maintain care delivery for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) during COVID-19 through teleconsultations supported by an on-demand photoplethysmography-based heart rate and rhythm monitoring app (FibriCheck?). We describe the characteristics and experiences from recruited patients. METHODS: Self-reported patient characteristics were obtained from the app. A survey exploring patient experiences completed by 826 patients. RESULTS: Within 28 weeks, 1930 AF patients were recruited by 38 centers in 14 countries, mainly for remote AF control (31% of patients) and AF ablation follow-up (42%). One-third of patients was in the age range 60-69 years. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (42% of all patients). More than 70% of patients were treated with oral anticoagulation. In total 59.858 heart rate and rhythm measurements were recorded. During the one-week FibriCheck? use, patient adherence was high. Patients performed between 2 and 5 recordings a day and the median number of measurements per patient was 21 [15-29]. The highest average number of measurements per patient was seen in patients older than 80years of age. Patients agreed that the FibriCheck? app was easy to use (94%) and easy to install (89%). The app gave patients a safe feeling (74%) due to being in constant heart rate and rhythm control. More than half of the patients (58%) agreed or strongly agreed that they would like to use the FibriCheck? app in the future. They also found the automated reminders useful (64%). CONCLUSIONS: In the TeleCheck-AF project, mHealth adherence was high, particularly in older patients 80 years. The app FibriCheck? is easy to use for 7 days before a scheduled teleconsultation. Patients think that remote rate and rhythm monitoring around teleconsultation by the TeleCheck-AF approach may be an alternative to traditional face-to-face consultations in the future.","output":"The TeleCheck-AF project on remote app-based management of atrial fibrillation during the COVID-19 pandemic: Patient experiences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper examines the global research output on suicidal behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Apart from quantitative data, their feelings, thoughts, and experience are essential to inform the implementation of patient-centered health care policy. AIM: This study explained the psychosocial effects of COVID-19 on Hong Kong Chinese older people. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a qualitative study. Twenty-three participants aged between 63 and 86 were recruited in primary care through purposive sampling. METHOD: Semi-structured in-depth telephone interviews were conducted to explore participants experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Grounded theory was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Three themes, nine subthemes, and 24 quotes were identified. The 3 themes included the psychological response of fear, annoyance, and worrisome; social isolation leading to loneliness and physical exhaustion; and the coping strategies in adversity. Fear was the major emotional response, which was not entirely explained by the uncertainty of the disease, but also the embedded routines norms and values. Loneliness was aggravated by the depleted family and community support. Physical distancing had intensified ones physical demand on self-care, especially among those with comorbid illnesses. The use of digital tools and telecommunications maintained the social connection, but the overexposure had led to a vicious cycle of anxiety and distress. CONCLUSION: Self-isolation has disproportionately affected older individuals whose only social contact is out of the home. Online technologies can be harnessed to provide social support networks and a sense of belonging, but its adaptive and positive uses should be encouraged. Interventions can also involve more frequent telephone contact with significant others, close family and friends, voluntary organizations, or health-care professionals, or community outreach teams.

One of the most important indices noticed by experts, policymakers and managers which is daily evaluated in epidemics and a lot of judgments are made based on it, is case fatality rate (CFR) index of the disease. CFR can change during epidemics. This study aims to calculate CFR index for nCov-2019 in Iran and answer the following question: Is it right to base judgment on CFR all the time during epidemics and is it right to judge based on that since the outbreak of an epidemic? Methods: : This research is a descriptive study. Its required data was obtained from the website of The Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran from February 20 th 2020 until March 14 th 2020. CFR index was calculated when the death toll of a disease is divided by the total number of people infected by that disease. Excel 2013 software was used to a1nalyze the data. Results: According to the findings of this study, In Iran, until March 14 th 2020, 11364 people have been infected by Coronavirus 2019-nCoV and 514 people died of it. CFR index had a descending trend and it was 100%, 18.6%, 8.8%, 3.1%, 3.3%, 4.5% on the first, fifth, tenth, fifteenth, twentieth and twenty fifth day, respectively. Conclusion: In emerging epidemics, an index must not be based to judge a health systems performance until that epidemics condition has not been clarified. It would be suggested that in the outbreak of an epidemic, specifically emerging diseases, CFR must not be the base of judgment. Making judgments, specifically, in the outbreak of emerging epidemics based on fatality rate can lead to an information bias.","output":"Can judgments according to case fatality rate be correct all the time during epidemics?

The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) has attracted interest for its simplicity and consideration of multiple relevant geriatric dimensions. However, a criticism of the CFS has been the possible subjectivity in the scoring, bringing the possible danger of lack of scoring consistency across agencies. For that reason, the authors of the CFS published a classification tree method to assist with routine scoring of the CFS. The aim of the present study was to apply the CFS classification tree to data from adults aged 65 and over from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) and correlate derived CFS categories with patterns of health and social care utilisation in Irish older people assessed in Wave 5 of the study (year 2018). In addition, we explored how CFS categories and states changed over 8 years in TILDA between Wave 1 (2010) and Wave 5. Results showed the following prevalence of CFS categories in Wave 5: 6% very fit (CFS1), 36% fit (CFS2), 31% managing well (CFS3), 16% vulnerable (CFS4), 6% mildly frail (CFS5), 4% moderately frail (CFS6) and 1% severely frail (CFS7). No participants were very severely frail or terminally ill. In wave 5, increasing CFS categories had an association with increasing utilisation of hospital and community health services, and increasing hours of formal and informal social care provision. The transitions analyses from Wave 1 to 5 suggested a dynamic picture of CFS transitions, with 2-year probability of transitioning from fit (CFS1-3) to vulnerable (CFS4), and fit to frail (CFS5+) at 34% and 6%, respectively. Vulnerable and frail had a 22% and 17% probability of reversal to fit and vulnerable, respectively. Our results suggest that the CFS classification tree was able to stratify the TILDA population aged 65 and over into subgroups with increasing health and social care needs. The CFS classification tree could be used to aid the allocation of health and social care resources in older people in Ireland, but given the frequency of CFS transitions in the population, it is recommended that CFS status in individuals is reviewed at least every 2 years.","output":"Informing patterns of health and social care utilisation in Irish older people according to the Clinical Frailty Scale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we investigate estimating the parameters of a discrete time networked virus spread model from time series data.

Prisons and jails are filled with people suffering from many preexisting medical conditions increasing the risk of complications. Detainees' access to medical services is already limited and overcrowding poses a threat of massive contagion. Beyond the health impact of the crisis, the tightening of prison conditions worries. On March 16, 2020, in France, the lockdown measures have been accompanied by specific provisions for prisons: all facilities have suspended visitations, group activities and external interventions. Over 10,000 prisoners have been released to reduce the prison population and the risk of virus propagation. These adjustments had major consequences on the healthcare system in French prisons. The objectives of this article are to describe the reorganization of the three levels of psychiatric care for inmates in France in the context of Covid-19 pandemic and to have a look at the impact of lockdown measures and early releases on mental health of prisoners. METHODS: This work is based on a survey conducted in April 2020 in France among psychiatric healthcare providers working in 42 ambulatory units for inmates and in the 9 full-time inpatient psychiatric wards exclusively for inmates called \\"UHSAs\\" (which stands for \\"units hospitalires spcialement amnages\\", and can be translated as \\"specially equipped hospital units\\"). A review of the international literature on mental healthcare system for inmates during the Covid-19 epidemic has also been performed. RESULTS: The Covid-19 epidemic has been rather contained during the period of confinement in French prisons but the impact of confinement measures on the prison population is significant. The three levels of psychiatric care for inmates have implemented specific measures to ensure continuity of care, to support detainees during Coronavirus lockdown and to prevent an infection's spread. Among the most important are: limitation of medical consultations to serious and urgent cases, creation of \\"Covid units\\", cancellation of voluntary psychiatric hospitalizations, reinforcement of preventive hygiene measures and reshuffling of medical staff. Prolonged confinement has consequences on mental health of detainees. Currently, mental health workers are facing multiple clinical situations such as forced drug and substance withdrawal (linked to difficulties in supplying psychoactive substances), symptoms of anxiety (due to concerns for their own and their relatives' well-being) and decompensation among patients with severe psychiatric conditions. Early releases from prison may also raise some issues. People recently released from prison are identified as at high risk of death by suicide and drug overdose. The lack of time to provide the necessary link between health services within prisons and health structures outside could have serious consequences, emphasizing the well-known \\"revolving prison doors\\" effect. DISCUSSION: The current lockdown measures applied in French jails and prisons point out the disparities between psychiatric care for inmates and psychiatric care for general population. Giving the high vulnerability of prison population, public health authorities should pay more attention to health care in prisons.","output":"[Mental health care in French correctional facilities during the Covid-19 pandemic]./ Prisons confines : quelles consquences pour les soins psychiatriques et la sant mentale des personnes dtenues en France ?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Carborane is a carbon-boron molecular cluster that can be viewed as a 3D analog of benzene.

Building towards this goal, the food and agriculture sector must be considered when designing nutritional interventions. Nevertheless, most frameworks designed to guide nutritional interventions do not adequately capture opportunities for integrating nutrition interventions within the food and agriculture sector. This paper aims to highlight how deeply connected the food and agriculture sector is to underlying causes of malnutrition and identify opportunities to better integrate the food and agriculture sector and nutrition in low and middle income countries. In particular, this paper: (1) expands on the UNICEF conceptual framework for undernutrition to integrate the food and agriculture sector and nutrition outcomes, (2) identifies how nutritional outcomes and agriculture are linked in six important ways by defining evidence-based food and agriculture system components within these pathways: as a source of food, as a source of income, through food prices, womens empowerment, womens utilization of time, and womens health and nutritional status, and (3) shows that the food and agriculture sector facilitates interventions through production, processing and consumption, as well as through farmer practices and behavior. Current frameworks used to guide nutrition interventions are designed from a health sector paradigm, leaving agricultural aspects not sufficiently leveraged. This paper concludes by proposing intervention opportunities to rectify the missed opportunities generated by this approach. Program design should consider the ways that the food and agriculture sector is linked to other critical sectors to comprehensively address malnutrition. This framework is designed to help the user to begin to identify intervention sites that may be considered when planning and implementing multi-sectoral nutrition programs.

Resident weekly duty hours decreased by 23.9 hours with the majority of clinical time redirected to caring for COVID-19 patients. Independent studying increased by 1.6 hours (26.2%) while weekly didactics decreased by 2.1 hours (35.6%). The operative volume per resident decreased by 65.7% from 35.0 to 12.0 cases for the period of interest, with a disproportionately high effect on junior residents, who experienced a 76.2% decrease. Unsurprisingly, 70% of residents reported a negative effect of the pandemic on their surgical skills. Conclusions: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical residents' usual workflows changed dramatically, as much of their time was dedicated to the critical care of patients with COVID-19. However, the consequent opportunity cost was to surgery-specific training; there was a significant decrease in operative cases and time spent in surgical didactics, along with elevated concern about overall preparedness for their intended career.","output":"Impacts on Surgery Resident Education at a First Wave COVID-19 Epicenter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Anterior dislocation of the elbow is comparatively less frequent and is often associated with fractures of the distal humerus. Such injuries require surgical intervention at the earliest but with the surge of COVID-19 pandemic and different protocols being followed by surgeons, such cases are getting neglected. We present a 5-week-old neglected anterior dislocation of the right elbow joint with lateral condyle and medial epicondyle humerus fracture and a unique cantilever K-wiring technique used for its treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old man presented with pain, deformity, and limited range of movement of his right elbow joint and a non-healing wound over the olecranon after he had a road traffic accident 5 weeks back. The patient had been initially treated in a local hospital where he tested positive for COVID-19 and was managed conservatively. Radiographs revealed lateral condyle and medial epicondyle humerus fracture and an unreduced anterior dislocation of the right elbow joint. CONCLUSION: Neglected fracture-dislocation of the elbow is challenging and is further complicated by comminuted fragments with loss of bone stock. A unique use of multiple Kirschner wires in a cantilever fashion provides a good fixation alternative for such cases.","output":"Multiple Cantilever K-wiring Technique for Severely Comminuted Articular Fragments in Neglected Distal Humerus Fracture with Anterior Elbow Dislocation: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Parents who receive a diagnosis of a severe, life-threatening CHD for their foetus or neonate face a complex and stressful decision between termination, palliative care, or surgery. Understanding how parents make this initial treatment decision is critical for developing interventions to improve counselling for these families. METHODS We conducted focus groups in four academic medical centres across the United States of America with a purposive sample of parents who chose termination, palliative care, or surgery for their foetus or neonate diagnosed with severe CHD. RESULTS Ten focus groups were conducted with 56 parents (Mage = 34 years; 80% female; 89% White). Results were constructed around three domains: decision-making approaches; values and beliefs; and decision-making challenges. Parents discussed varying approaches to making the decision, ranging from relying on their \\"gut feeling\\" to desiring statistics and probabilities. Religious and spiritual beliefs often guided the decision to not terminate the pregnancy. Quality of life was an important consideration, including how each option would impact the child (e.g., pain or discomfort, cognitive and physical abilities) and their family (e.g., care for other children, marriage, and career). Parents reported inconsistent communication of options by clinicians and challenges related to time constraints for making a decision and difficulty in processing information when distressed. CONCLUSION This study offers important insights that can be used to design interventions to improve decision support and family-centred care in clinical practice.","output":"Parents' decision-making for their foetus or neonate with a severe congenital heart defect."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Given the opioid epidemic in the US, it is vital that clinicians who prescribe opioids for pain management to do so in an evidence-based manner, eg considering all pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic options, assessing risk of opioid use disorder prior to initiating opioids. Continuing education regarding the evidence-based prescribing of opioids is now required for US healthcare providers who prescribe opioids. A blueprint of the content to be included in continuing education programs was developed by the US Food and Drug Administration and updated in 2018. METHODS: To understand the baseline knowledge and confidence of healthcare professionals in prescribing opioids for pain management, we posed 27 unique knowledge-based questions and 1 confidence question to clinician participants before or during 2 continuing educational programs that were based respectively on the 2016 and 2018 FDA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) educational blueprints for pain management. RESULTS: Overall, 5571 clinicians completed these programs, including 1925 physicians (1516 [79%] identifying as primary care), 1181 physician assistants, 737 advanced practice nurses, 719 nurses, and 479 pharmacists. Responses to pretest questions in both programs indicated profound and persistent gaps in knowledge, particularly in definitions and mechanisms of pain, general principles of pharmacologic analgesic therapy, and specific aspects of opioid analgesic therapy and addiction. Participants in both programs also expressed limited confidence in their abilities to incorporate patient engagement techniques into pain management or develop a treatment plan for a patient with chronic pain. DISCUSSION: These data support an ongoing need for comprehensive clinician-based education as outlined in the FDA REMS educational blueprint, especially given recent data of escalating overdose deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Pain Management and Opioid Therapy: Persistent Knowledge Gaps Among Primary Care Providers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The growing use of therapeutic proteins requires accurate measurement techniques for measuring biophysical and structural changes during manufacturing. This is particularly true for PEGylation of proteins, because characterization of PEGylation reactions and products can often be difficult because of the relatively small impact on protein structure, the lack of an accessible PEG chromophore, and the heterogeneous final product mixtures. Intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy is one potential solution because of its relatively high sensitivity to small changes in protein structure and its suitability for online or at-line measurements. Here we use PEGylation of lysosome as a model system to determine the efficacy of polarized Excitation Emission Matrix (pEEM) spectroscopy as a rapid tool for characterizing the structural variability of the lysozyme starting materials and PEGylated products with PEG to protein ratio (PPR). Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) showed that as PPR increased from 0 to 2.8, the hydrodynamic radius increased from ~2.2 to 4.8 nm. pEEM measurements provided several sources of information: Rayleigh scatter identified size changes and aggregate/particle formation, and fluorescence emission to assessed chemical and structural change. PEGylation induced sufficient physicochemical changes in lysozyme which produced changes in the pEEM spectra largely due to changes in hydrophobic environment for tryptophan residues close to a PEG attachment site. These significant spectral changes when modelled using conventional multivariate analysis methods were able to easily discriminate the raw product solutions according to degree of PEGylation and were also able to predict PPR with reasonable accuracy (RMSEC ~10%, REP<20%) considering the reference Size Exclusion Chromatography method error of ~7.2%. Variable selection of the pEEM data, suggest that equivalent predictions could be made with faster and simpler 2D spectra making the method a more viable online measurement method.

Published literature shows Remdesivir has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against numerous RNA viruses and has been recently recognized as a promising therapy against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: A systematic search was conducted for full length manuscripts published between inception and July 19th, 2020 focussing on efficacy and safety of Remdesivir in COVID-19. The primary outcomes were defined as mortality rate and median days to recovery based on the available pooled data. The secondary outcome was adverse events rate and drug discontinuation rate. Statistical Analysis: All outcomes were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software package (Bio stat, Englewood, NJ, USA). Results: A total of 1,895 patients from 9 studies were included in this qualitative synthesis. In patients treated with Remdesivir, the mean recovery time was 15.84 days (95% CI 11.68C20, SE 2.12; I(2) = 97.24) and the pooled mortality rate was 11.3% (95% CI 7.9C16%; I(2) = 74.85). However, treatment with Remdesivir was associated with adverse effects (55.3%, 95% CI 31.5C76.9%; I(2) = 97.66) eventually warranting the discontinuation of the drug (17.8%, 95% CI 8.6C33.1%; I(2) = 95.64). The meta-analysis of three clinical trials indicated that administration of Remdesivir significantly reduces the mortality compared to the placebo (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.58C0.84, p  0.001; I(2) = 16.6). Conclusions and Relevance: The result of contemporary meta-analysis suggests mortality benefit with Remdesivir in COVID-19 and median recovery time was over 2 weeks. The pooled mortality with Remdesivir was found to be very low, and this analysis can shed light on this potential treatment for COVID-19 patients.","output":"Mortality Benefit of Remdesivir in COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an emergency public health issue and home quarantine can prevent the transmission Quarantine restricts the peoples mobility and it has a silent impact on physical, psychological and economical aspect The purpose was to explore the impact of home quarantine among the general population in Bangladesh This was a descriptive type of cross sectional survey with 600 samples from different district of Bangladesh by convenient sampling with a structured and language validated questionnaire The results indicate the huge impact of home quarantine Among 600 participants, 71 7% (n=430) showed impact on their psychological health, 48 5% (n=291) physical health and 82 5% (n=495) on their economy Study showed strong association between gender and psychological impact (p&lt;0 01) and very strong association between living area and their psychological impact (p&lt;0 00) There has also very strong association between their occupation and impact on their economy (p&lt;0 00) Home quarantine has a progressive negative impact on the individuals psychological health, physical health and their economy Individuals gender, living area and occupations are strongly associated with those negative impacts due to home quarantine Supporting agency should take initiative to mitigate this all negative impacts of home quarantine and need to develop protocol for maintaining for health during quarantine time ? 2021, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan - Faculty of Publich Health All rights reserved","output":"Impact of home quarantine due to covid-19 among bangladeshi population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Simplified topological maps can preserve the topology of regions within an area and provide a variety of ways to display geographic variables while granting equal weight to all regions Canada's topology lends itself well to displaying information with topological maps The first COVID-19 cases in Canada were identified in January 2020;the virus spread through much of the country in March, with a peak from April to May and a lull or trough in June-August, followed by a larger peak from October to November Although Canada's most populous provinces saw the most cases per 100,000 persons, nearly every province experienced peaks from COVID-19 Atlantic Canada and the northern territories experienced the shortest and smallest peaks, with the highest being a November outbreak in Nunavut Cases in central Canada remained moderate to high for much of the year, while western Canada experienced high peaks near the end of the year","output":"Using Topological Maps to Explore the COVID-19 Pandemic in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The international law of mobility has by and large been focused on the question of immigration Its emphasis has therefore been on what I will call, for convenience's sake, the host state It is there that some of the most intense dilemmas around the question of mobility have arisen in a context of populism, xenophobia, and racism The state of nationality is not invisible in that context, but this has not typically been the primary variable in trying to understand and assess the normative challenges of global mobility The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has refocused attention on distinct patterns of mobility, particularly return mobility, of nationals to their country of origin as well as limitations on leaving that country in the first place The state of nationality has increasingly been asked to mediate demands for security and public health that are extra-territorial and that implicate its nationals in sometimes far-flung locations I argue that the pandemic is a further opportunity to shift attention onto the state of nationality as a locus of key decisions concerning transnational mobility and thus to rebalance our sense of what goes into the global \\"mobility equation \\" Copyright ?

Our results suggest three conditionshigh ionic concentration, presence of hydrophobic fatty acids, and low temperaturefavor the attachment of S protein and RBD to hydrophobic surfaces. Increasing the temperature within an hour from 0 to 25 C results in S protein detachment, suggesting that freezing can cause structural changes in the S protein, affecting its binding kinetics at higher temperature. At all the conditions, RBD exhibits lower dissociation capabilities than the full-length S trimer protein, indicating that the separated RBD formed stronger attachment to hydrophobic surfaces compared to when it was included in the S protein.","output":"Binding behavior of spike protein and receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus at different environmental conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a novel disease that mostly affects the respiratory system but as the number of cases is rising significantly around the world, more extra-respiratory manifestations are being reported among which are various dermatologic manifestations","output":"Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis secondary to COVID-19 infection: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19, was first detected in China in December 2019 and has rapidly spread throughout the world.

Our understanding of the epidemiology, clinical presentation, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 has evolved rapidly as they did with HIV. Epidemiologically, there are similarities between the two viruses including asymptomatic spread, disproportionate impact on persons of color, need for rapid diagnostic testing, and lack of a cure or vaccine. PLWH do not appear generally to have an increased incidence of COVID-19 infection or a more severe course of disease. Clinical trials to identify potential treatment and prevention options for COVID-19 have included antiretrovirals used to treat HIV that have not been efficacious. Public health responses overlap between the two pandemics including the need for behavior change and containment strategies such as contact tracing.

for short and long-term follow-up care of the majority of COVID-19 patients. Nonetheless, they experience many barriers to fulfilling this role. The PRICOV-19 study investigates how GP practices in 38 countries are organized during the COVID-19 pandemic to guarantee safe, effective, patient-centered, and equitable care. Also, the shift in roles and tasks and the wellbeing of staff members is researched. Finally, PRICOV-19 aims to study the association with practice- and health care system characteristics. It is expected that both characteristics of the GP practice and health care system features are associated with how GP practices can cope with these challenges. This paper describes the protocol of the study. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, data are collected through an online questionnaire sent to GP practices in 37 European countries and Israel. The questionnaire is developed in multiple phases, including a pilot study in Belgium. The final version includes 53 items divided into six sections: patient flow (including appointments, triage, and management for routine care); infection prevention; information processing; communication; collaboration and self-care; and practice and participant characteristics. In the countries where data collection is already finished, between 13 and 636 GP practices per country participated in the study. Questionnaire data are linked with OECD and HSMR data regarding national policy responses to the pandemic and analyzed using multilevel models considering the system- and practice-level. DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, the PRICOV-19 study is the largest and most comprehensive study that examines how GP practices function during the COVID-19 pandemic. Its results can significantly contribute to better preparedness of primary health care systems across Europe for future major outbreaks of infectious diseases.

Here we demonstrate that LSECtin can interact with two HCV receptors, DC-SIGNR and CD81, through its central ectodomain. Furthermore, cells expressing LSECtin specifically can be attached by the naturally occurring HCV in the sera of infected individuals. This binding was found to be mediated by the HCV E2 glycoprotein and could be efficiently inhibited by EGTA but not by mannan treatment. The present study suggests that LSECtin interaction with DC-SIGNR might contribute to HCV binding to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells.

Numerous water adsorbents have been used in ABAWH devices to convert molecule to liquid water. However, it is still challenging to harvest water from the air in cold winter, owing to the water adsorption of sorbents decreasing significantly at low temperature. Herein, we designed and fabricated an ABAWH device by integrating composited ionic liquids (CILs) with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) photothermal materials on the surface of cotton rod fibers. CILs extract water from the air. CNTs enable light-to-heat conversion and drive the solar evaporation process. Importantly, the cotton rods offer a backbone porous structure to maintain its internal temperature at 20 C under solar irradiation, and thus promote the water adsorption performance of CILs at low environmental temperature. Freshwater is successfully harvested under environment temperature of 6 C, 30% RH and solar irradiation intensity of 0.6 kW m-2. The water yield can achieve 1.49 kg per m2 per day in an outdoor environment.

To robustly examine whether increases in digital technology use are associated with increases in psychological distress during the pandemic it is crucial to (1) collect objective data on digital technology use and (2) account for potential confounding caused by pandemic-related stressors. METHODS: We conducted a four-wave panel study of U.S. young adults (N=384; Mage = 24.5  5.1; 57% female) from August-November of 2020. Participants provided screenshots of their iPhone \\"Screen Time\\" application and completed measures assessing current mental health status (depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation) and pandemic-related impacts on well-being. We used random-intercept multilevel models to examine the within- and between-person associations between mental health, objective digital technology use, and pandemic-related stressors. RESULTS: Multilevel analyses revealed that none of the objectively-measured digital technology use variables were positively associated with depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation at the within- or between-person levels. In contrast, pandemic-related impacts on mental health had by far the largest effects on depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. LIMITATIONS: The convenience-based sample and use of single-item measures of pandemic-related impacts are limitations of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Current speculations about the direct harms of digital technology use on mental health may be unfounded and risk diverting attention from a more likely cause: pandemic-related distress.","output":"Objectively measured digital technology use during the COVID-19 pandemic: Impact on depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation among young adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study aimed to determine the incidence of social responsibility and teamwork on the investigative skills of teachers, and responds to the institutional educational problem.

On one hand, diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19. On the other hand, new onset diabetes and severe metabolic complications of pre-existing diabetes, including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) have been observed in patients with COVID-19. In this report, we describe two patient with diabetes mellitus who presented to our hospital with DKA. We also reviewed almost all published cases of DKA that had been precipitated by COVID-19. METHODS: Two patients were admitted with DKA, who were diagnosed to have COVID-19 on the basis of real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Detailed history, anthropometry, laboratory investigations, imaging studies, clinical course and management outcomes were documented. RESULTS: First patient (30-year-male) had undiagnosed diabetes and no other comorbidities, and COVID-19 precipitated DKA. He also had COVID-19-associated pneumonia. Second patient (60-year-male) had long duration hypertension with no prior history of diabetes and developed cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He was also diagnosed with COVID-19 (RT-PCR assay) and DKA in the hospital. CVA and COVID-19 could have precipitate DKA. Both patients responded well to treatment and were discharged in a stable condition. CONCLUSIONS: These cases show that COVID-19 can precipitate DKA in a significant number of patients. DKA can occur in patients with pre-existing diabetes or newly diagnosed diabetes. As COVID-19 and diabetes are prevalent conditions, high degree of suspicion is required to diagnose DKA timely in order to improve the prognosis of COVID-19-related diabetic ketoacidosis.","output":"Diabetic ketoacidosis precipitated by COVID-19: A report of two cases and review of literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 100 million people, causing 2 million deaths globally.

In this study, a hybrid fuzzy decision making model was proposed to evaluate the disaster preparedness of hospitals. This model was developed using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP)-fuzzy decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL)-technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions (TOPSIS) techniques and aimed to determine a ranking for hospital disaster preparedness. FAHP is used to determine weights of six main criteria (including hospital buildings, equipment, communication, transportation, personnel, flexibility) and a total of thirty-six sub-criteria regarding disaster preparedness. At the same time, FDEMATEL is applied to uncover the interdependence between criteria and sub-criteria. Finally, TOPSIS is used to obtain ranking of hospitals. To provide inputs for TOPSIS implementation, some key performance indicators are established and related data is gathered by the aid of experts from the assessed hospitals. A case study considering 4 hospitals from the Turkish healthcare sector was used to demonstrate the proposed approach.

This strategy was developed in response to: i) concerns regarding transmission of infection in the healthcare setting, ii) avoiding overwhelming the healthcare system with COVID-19 patients, iii) providing patients with expedited access to specialists, and iv) reducing the burden on the emergency department and urgent care. METHODS: The COVID-19 clinic staff is comprised of a dedicated nurse, administrative assistant, and four infectious diseases (ID) physicians who aim to see patients within 24 hours of referral via virtual clinics 5 days a week. An ID physician initially assesses each patient in a direct telemedicine visit and answers their questions, assesses disease severity, provides both symptom management and emotional support, and education about self-isolation and transmission-based precautions. The patients are then triaged to daily nursing phone calls and follow up visits as needed. RESULTS: Over a period of 12 weeks (March 27 to June 16, 2020), the clinic has seen 179 patients. To assess the impact of the clinic, patients are asked to complete a 6-point verbal patients satisfaction survey after their visit. Of the 133 patients who have completed the survey to date, the vast majority reported high satisfaction with their encounters with the COVID-19 physician, with a mean score of 4.8 or higher on all six questions (on a scale of 1 to 5). When asked Did you feel comfortable talking to your COVID-19 ID physician? on a scale of 1 to 5, the average score was 4.9.

Unfortunately, the results have been controversial, and further studies are needed to better understand not only the roles but also the balance of these parameters, which are crucial data to improve prevention and treatment. As COVID-19 has a well-determined phasic progression and rapidly deteriorates approximately seven days after the onset of symptoms, it is extremely necessary to detect the clinical signs that are predictive of the outcome as early as possible. To this end, in this preliminary study, we evaluated the data relating to the monocyte intracellular TNF- expression and lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood collected from patients at admission and every day of hospitalization until day 7. Our findings point to a modulation of the different cellular mediators of the immune system, which probably play a key role in the outcome of the coronavirus disease 2019. ABSTRACT: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was recognized as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Several studies have explored the changes and the role of inflammatory cells and cytokines in the immunopathogenesis of the disease, but until today, the results have been controversial. Based on these premises, we conducted a retrospective assessment of monocyte intracellular TNF- expression (iTNF-) and on the frequencies of lymphocyte sub-populations in twenty-five patients with moderate/severe COVID-19. We found lymphopenia in all COVID-19 infected subjects compared to healthy subjects. On initial observation, in patients with favorable outcomes, we detected a high absolute eosinophil count and a high CD4+/CD8+ T lymphocytes ratio, while in the Exitus Group, we observed high neutrophil and CD8+ T lymphocyte counts. During infection, in patients with favorable outcomes, we observed a rise in the lymphocyte count, in the monocyte and in Treg lymphocyte counts, and in the CD4+ and in CD8+ T lymphocytes count but a reduction in the CD4+/CD8+ T lymphocyte ratio. Instead, in the Exitus Group, we observed a reduction in the Treg lymphocyte counts and a decrease in iTNF- expression.

The aim of this study was to determine the incremental value of cardiovascular vulnerability - defined by the number of cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes - in predicting the risk of escalation of care towards hospital referral in primary care patients with clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Methods Data were retrospectively collected from three large Dutch primary care registries with routine care data of approximately 850,000 people. A prognostic prediction model was developed in two databases to assess the incremental value of cardiovascular vulnerability. Data from the first wave of COVID-19 infections in the Netherlands (March 1, 2020 to June 1, 2020) was used for derivation. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to predict hospital referral within 90 days follow-up after first consultation in consecutive adult patients seen in primary care for COVID-19 symptoms. Age, sex, the interaction between age and sex, and the number of underlying cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes (0, 1, or <1) were pre-specified as predictors prior to the analyses. The model was (i) compared to a simpler model without the predictor number of cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes and (ii) externally validated in COVID-19 confirmed patients during the second wave (June 1, 2020 to April 15, 2021) in all three databases. Results There were 5,475 patients included for model development and 6.8% had the primary outcome hospital referral. The model with number of cardiovascular diseases included as a predictor performed better than a model without this predictor (likelihood ratio test p<0.001). Older male patients with multiple cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes had the highest predicted risk of hospital referral, reaching risks above 15-20% in these patients. The model was externally validated in a population of 16,693 COVID-19 patients. The observed risk was lower in this temporal validation cohort (4.7% versus 6.8%). The temporally validated c-statistic was 0.747 (95%CI 0.729-0.764) and the model showed good calibration. Conclusion In this general population study, risk of clinical deterioration after suspected or confirmed COVID-19 was on average 5.1% in the development and validation cohorts combined. This risk increased with age and was higher in males compared to females. Importantly, patients with concurrent cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes had higher predicted risks.

Amidst the millions of individuals affected directly by the pandemic, pronounced sex differences in the susceptibility and response to SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence has highlighted the potential importance of autoimmune activation in modulating not only the acute response but also recovery trajectories following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Given that immune-inflammatory activity can be sex-biased in the setting of severe COVID-19 illness, we deliberately examined sex-specific autoimmune reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of extreme clinical disease. Methods. We used a bead-based array containing over 90 autoantigens previously linked to a range of classic autoimmune diseases to assess autoantibody (AAB) titers in 177 participants. All participants had confirmed evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection based on presence of positive anti-nucleocapsid IgG serology results (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, Illinois). We used multivariate analysis to determine whether sex-bias was associated with increased rates of AABs reactivity and symptom burden after SARS-CoV2 infection. Results. 82.4% of AABs reactivity was associated with being male compared to 17.6% with female. We found a diversity of AABs responses that exhibited sex-specific patterns of frequency distribution as well as associations with symptomatology and symptom burden. Conclusion. Our results reveal a remarkable sex-specific prevalence and selectivity of AAB responses to SARS-CoV-2. Further understanding of the nature of triggered and persistent AAB activation among men and women exposed to SARS-CoV-2 will be essential for developing effective interventions against immune-mediated sequelae of COVID-19.","output":"Paradoxical Sex-Specific Patterns of Autoantibodies Response to SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the process for linking electronic medical record (EMR) and administrative data in Alberta and examine the advantages and limitations of utilising linked data for hypertension surveillance. METHODS: De-identified EMR data from 323 primary care providers contributing to the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) in Alberta were used. Mapping files from each contributing provider were generated from their EMR to facilitate linkage to administrative data within the provincial health data warehouse. Deterministic linkage was conducted using valid personal healthcare number (PHN) with age and/or sex. Characteristics of patients and providers in the linked cohort were compared with population-level sources. Criteria used to define hypertension in both sources were examined. RESULTS: Data were successfully linked for 6307 hypertensive patients (96.2% of eligible patients) from 49 contributing providers. Non-linkages from invalid PHN (n=246) occurred more for deceased patients and those with fewer primary care encounters, with differences due to type of EMR and patient EMR status. The linked cohort had more patients who were female, >60 years and residing in rural areas compared to the provincial healthcare registry. Family physicians were more often female and medically trained in Canada compared to all physicians in Alberta.

The objective of this study was to explore health system resilience at the sub-national level in Uganda with regard to strategies for dispensing of antiretrovirals during Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. METHODS We conducted a qualitative case-study of eight districts from Eastern Uganda (Mbale, Sironko, Manafwa, Bulambuli, Bududa) and Western Uganda (Kabarole, Kyegegwa, Kyenjonjo) purposively selected due to having a relatively high HIV burden. Between June and September 2020, we conducted key informant interviews with district health team leaders (n=9), with ART clinic managers (n=36), representatives of PEPFAR implementing organizations (n=6) and six focus group discussions with recipients of HIV/AIDS care (48 participants). Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic approach. RESULTS Five broad strategies for distributing antiretrovirals during lockdown emerged in our analysis: accelerating home-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) deliveries,;extending multi-month dispensing from three to six months for stable patients;leveraging the Community Drug Distribution Points (CDDPs) model for ART refill pick-ups at outreach sites in the community;an increased reliance on health information systems, including geospatial technologies, to support ART refill distribution in unmapped rural settings. District health teams reported benefiting from the Covid-19 outbreak response funding to deliver ART refills to homesteads in rural communities. CONCLUSION Although Covid-19 lockdown undoubtedly impeded access to facility-based HIV services, it unraveled new possibilities and innovations in the distribution of antiretrovirals in the predominantly rural settings of our case-study districts.

METHOD A classification of epilepsy using International League Against Epilepsy classification was made and an investigation of causes was carried out. RESULTS Of those 162 new patients diagnosed as having epilepsy in Bach Mai Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam, from February 2002 to February 2004 (male 84, female 78), there were 58 cases of generalized epilepsy: 22 symptomatic and 36 idiopathic or cryptogenic. A total of 90 patients were diagnosed as having localization-related epilepsy: 53 as symptomatic and 37 as idiopathic or cryptogenic. A total of 14 cases were also considered as not epileptic after strict review of both the history and the examination data. CONCLUSION Concerning the causes, the following were noted: (i) the rate of infectious diseases and trauma as causes of epilepsy was considerably higher in Vietnam than in developed countries; (ii) certain infectious diseases could be prevented if vaccinations and public health knowledge were improved; and (iii) the number of trauma cases, mainly due to traffic accidents, would likely be reduced if the traffic system was improved.","output":"Causes of childhood epilepsy in Vietnam: cases in Bach Mai Hospital."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the first area to report the outbreak, China used to be the front line of the battle against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

DESIGN: Multicenter case series. SETTING: Three tertiary care hospitals in Massachusetts, Georgia, and Virginia. PATIENTS: Eight patients with clinical myoclonus in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS & MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Outcomes in patients with myoclonus were variable, with one patient who died during the study period and five who were successfully extubated cognitively intact and without focal neurologic deficits. In five cases, the myoclonus completely resolved within 2 days of onset, while in three cases, it persisted for 10 days or longer. Seven patients experienced significant metabolic derangements, hypoxemia, or exposure to sedating medications that may have contributed to the development of myoclonus. One patient presented with encephalopathy and developed prolonged myoclonus in the absence of clear systemic provoking factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that myoclonus may be observed in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infected patients, even in the absence of hypoxia.

From a series of 31 patients admitted for brain surgery, three were confirmed as infected by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Case description We present the clinical outcomes of these three COVID-19 patients, who underwent an intra-cerebral biopsy in our department during April of 2020. All suffered from a diffuse intra-parenchymal hemorrhage post-operatively. Unfortunately, we were not able to identify a clear etiology of these post-operative complications. It could be hypothesized that an active COVID-19 infection status may be related to a higher bleeding risk. The remaining 28 neuro-oncological non-COVID patients underwent uneventful surgery during the same period. Conclusions This case series reports the previously unreported and unexpected outcomes of COVID-19 patients suffering from acute hemorrhage after intra-cerebral biopsy procedures.

Nav1.6 epilepsy-causing mutations are spread over the entire channel's structure and only 10 % of mutations have been characterized at the molecular level, with most of them being gain of function mutations. In this study, we analyzed three previously uncharacterized Nav1.6 epilepsy-causing mutations: G214D, N215D and V216D, located within a mutation hot-spot at the S3-S4 extracellular loop of Domain1. Voltage clamp experiments showed a 6-16 mV hyperpolarizing shift in the activation mid-point for all three mutants. V216D presented the largest shift along with decreased current amplitude, enhanced inactivation and a lack of persistent current. Recordings at hyperpolarized potentials indicated that all three mutants presented gating pore currents. Furthermore, trafficking experiments performed in cultured hippocampal neurons demonstrated that the mutants trafficked properly to the cell surface, with no significant differences regarding surface expression within the axon initial segment or soma compared to wild-type. These trafficking data suggest that the disease-causing consequences are due to only changes in the biophysical properties of the channel. Interestingly, the patient carrying the V216D mutation, which is the mutant with the greatest electrophysiological changes as compared to wild-type, exhibited the most severe phenotype. These results emphasize that these mutations will mandate unique treatment approaches, for normal sodium channel blockers may not work given that the studied mutations present gating pore currents.

The first describes the propensity to form connections, while the second defines the propensity to attract them. We derive analytically the epidemic threshold considering the time scale driving the evolution of contacts and the contagion as comparable. The solutions are general and hold for any joint distribution of activity and attractiveness. The theoretical picture is confirmed via large-scale numerical simulations performed considering heterogeneous distributions and different correlations between the two variables. We find that heterogeneous distributions of attractiveness alter the contagion process. In particular, in the case of uncorrelated and positive correlations between the two variables, heterogeneous attractiveness facilitates the spreading. On the contrary, negative correlations between activity and attractiveness hamper the spreading.

Many radiological findings have shown that X-ray and CT imaging scans are an effective solution to assess disease severity during the early stage of COVID-19. Many artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnosis works have rapidly been proposed to focus on solving this classification problem and determine whether a patient is infected with COVID-19. Most of these works have designed networks and applied a single CT image to perform classification; however, this approach ignores prior information such as the patients clinical symptoms. Second, making a more specific diagnosis of clinical severity, such as slight or severe, is worthy of attention and is conducive to determining better follow-up treatments. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL) based dual-tasks network, named FaNet, that can perform rapid both diagnosis and severity assessments for COVID-19 based on the combination of 3D CT imaging and clinical symptoms. Generally, 3D CT image sequences provide more spatial information than do single CT images. In addition, the clinical symptoms can be considered as prior information to improve the assessment accuracy; these symptoms are typically quickly and easily accessible to radiologists. Therefore, we designed a network that considers both CT image information and existing clinical symptom information and conducted experiments on 416 patient data, including 207 normal chest CT cases and 209 COVID-19 confirmed ones. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the additional symptom prior information as well as the network architecture designing. The proposed FaNet achieved an accuracy of 98.28% on diagnosis assessment and 94.83% on severity assessment for test datasets. In the future, we will collect more covid-CT patient data and seek further improvement.","output":"FaNet: fast assessment network for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia based on 3D CT imaging and clinical symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Indonesia has an estimated 61.4 million current smokers, and the smoking prevalence among adults is persistently high while that among youth is increasing.

A 5-month-old male of 2.7 kg body weight diagnosed with Bartter syndrome was admitted to the general paediatric ward with acute severe hypokalaemia and urinary tract infection. The main challenge was the inability to administer drugs through intravenous route due to compromised body size. Therefore, we shifted the route of administration to the nasogastric tube/oral route. A total of 2 mL of concentrated intravenous potassium chloride (4 mEq potassium) were dissolved in distilled water and administered through nasogastric tube.

A lack of accessible transportation is often cited as a barrier to employment in higher wage jobs for people with disabilities, but little is known about the intraurban commuting patterns of employed people with disabilities in relation to their wage earnings. Our study compares wages and commute times between workers with and without disabilities in the New York metropolitan region and identifies the intraurban zones where residents experience higher inequities in wage earnings and commute times. We obtained our data from the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) of the American Community Survey (ACS) for the 2008C2012 time period. We used linear mixed-effects models and generated separate models with log hourly wage or one-way commute time as the dependent variable. We find significant differences in wages and commute times between workers with and without disabilities at the scale of the metropolitan region as well as by intraurban zone. At the metropolitan scale, disabled workers earn 16.6% less and commute one minute longer on average than non-disabled workers. High commute and wage inequalities converge in the center, where workers with disabilities are more likely to use public transit, earn 17.1% less, and travel nearly four minutes longer on average than workers without disabilities. These results suggest that transport options are less accessible and slower for disabled workers than they are for non-disabled workers. Our findings indicate a need for more accessible and quicker forms of transportation in the center along with an increased availability of centrally located and affordable housing to reduce the disability gap in wages and commute times. We also find that workers with disabilities generally seek higher wages in exchange for longer commute times, but the results differ by race/ethnicity and gender. Compared to white men, minority workers earn much less, and white and Hispanic women have significantly shorter commute times.

The sequence of events that leads to release of filovirus particles from cells is poorly understood. Two contrasting mechanisms have been proposed, one proceeding via a submarine-like budding with the helical nucleocapsid emerging parallel to the plasma membrane, and the other via perpendicular rocket-like protrusion. Here we have infected cells with Marburg virus under BSL-4 containment conditions, and reconstructed the sequence of steps in the budding process in three dimensions using electron tomography of plastic-embedded cells. We find that highly infectious filamentous particles are released at early stages in infection. Budding proceeds via lateral association of intracellular nucleocapsid along its whole length with the plasma membrane, followed by rapid envelopment initiated at one end of the nucleocapsid, leading to a protruding intermediate. Scission results in local membrane instability at the rear of the virus. After prolonged infection, increased vesiculation of the plasma membrane correlates with changes in shape and infectivity of released viruses. Our observations demonstrate a cellular determinant of virus shape. They reconcile the contrasting models of filovirus budding and allow us to describe the sequence of events taking place during budding and release of Marburg virus. We propose that this represents a general sequence of events also followed by other filamentous and rod-shaped viruses.","output":"Electron Tomography Reveals the Steps in Filovirus Budding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Cathepsins are proteases found in all animals as well as other organisms.

Cathepsins have been identified as therapeutic targets in the search for new drugs against a number of human pathologies, including cancer, Alzheimer's, and osteoporosis. A number of natural products have been reported as selective inhibitors of some cathepsins. Chemical structure of natural products as inhibitors of cathepsins can be very diverse. Some peptidic natural products are inhibitors of the cysteine protease cathepsins such as E-64 isolated from Aspergillus, which is a cathepsin B inhibitor, or more recently the marine cyanobacterial metabolite gallinamide A which is a selective inhibitor of human cathepsin L. Also amino acid derivatives have been reported as inhibitors of cathepsin A.

Silent and dyspneic hypoxemic patients had similar PaCO2 (34.26.8 mmHg vs. 33.55.7 mmHg, P=0.47) but different respiratory rates (24.65.9 bpm vs. 28.611.3 bpm respectively, P=0.002). Even when CXR was severely abnormal, 25% of the population was silent hypoxemic. Twenty-six point five percent and 38.6% of silent and dyspneic patients were admitted to the ICU respectively (P=0.082). Mortality rate was 17.6% and 29.7% (log-rank P=0.083) in silent and dyspneic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Silent hypoxemia is remarkably present in COVID-19.

METHODS Human subconjunctival fibroblasts were obtained from the three groups of patients. Different concentrations of TGF-2 were added to the fibroblasts for 1, 3, and 5 days. The proliferation of the fibroblasts was determined by CCK-8 assays. Real-time PCR and western blotting were performed to analyze the mRNA and protein levels of LDLr. The uptake of DiI-labeled LDL was determined by confocal microscopy. RESULTS The results revealed that under TGF-2 exposure, fibroblast proliferation was positively correlated with LDLr expression (all p<0.001). The LDLr mRNA and protein levels were affected by TGF-2 in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner in the RGSFs, GSFs and HSFs. The maximal expression of LDLr after TGF-2 stimulation was consistent with the peak uptake of DiI-LDL, which was obviously highest in the RGSFs, followed by the GSFs, and then the HSFs (all p<0.05). All 3 groups took up DiI-LDL in a similar time-dependent manner, with maximal uptake at 6 h following DiI-LDL incubation (all p<0.05). In addition, there were significant differences in the LDLr protein levels in the subconjunctival tissues isolated from the glaucoma patients during reoperation, the glaucoma patients during first filtering surgery and the control patients at day 3 (p<0.05). The highest protein expression of LDLr was observed in the RG group. CONCLUSION These data suggested that the RGSFs had the highest LDLr expression and the highest peak uptake of LDL among three groups. The LDLr-drug-LDL delivery system could potentially be used for targeted delivery of antimetabolite agents in anti-scarring therapy for glaucoma patients after filtering surgery.","output":"Differential Effects of TGF-2 on the Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor Expression in Three Types of Human Subconjunctival Fibroblasts."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The concepts of allostatic load and allostatic processes can help psychologists understand how health trajectories are influenced by stressful childhood experiences in the family. This paper describes psychological pathways and two key allostatic mediators, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the immune system, through which stressful early rearing conditions may influence adult mental and physical health. The action of meshed gears is introduced as a metaphor to illustrate how responses occurring within a brief time frame, for example, immediate reactions to stressors, can influence developmental and health processes unfolding over much longer spans of time. We identify early-developing psychological and biological response patterns that could link chronic stressors in childhood to later health outcomes. Some of these \\"precursor outcomes\\" (e.g., heightened vigilance and preparedness for threats; enhanced inflammatory and humoral responses to infectious microorganisms) appear to be aimed at protection from immediate dangers; they may reflect \\"adaptive trade-offs\\" that balance short-term survival advantages under harsh rearing conditions against disadvantages manifested later in development.

METHOD: Participants in the EAT 2010C2018 (Eating and Activity over Time) study were invited to complete the C\\\\EAT (COVID\\\\19 EAT) survey in AprilCMay 2020. There were 720 respondents to the survey (age: 24.7  2.0 years). Psychological distress, stress, stress management, financial difficulties, and food insecurity during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic were examined as cross\\\\sectional correlates of disordered eating in 2020. Open\\\\ended questions assessed the perceived impact of the pandemic on eating behaviors. RESULTS: Low stress management was significantly associated with a higher count of extreme unhealthy weight control behaviors (UWCBs). Food insecurity, higher depressive symptoms, and financial difficulties were significantly associated with a higher count of less extreme UWCBs. Higher stress and depressive symptoms were significantly associated with greater odds of binge eating. Six themes pertaining to disordered eating during the pandemic emerged: (a) mindless eating and snacking; (b) increased food consumption; (c) generalized decrease in appetite or dietary intake; (d) eating to cope; (e) pandemic\\\\related reductions in dietary intake; and (f) re\\\\emergence or marked increase in eating disorder symptoms. DISCUSSION: Psychological distress, stress management, financial difficulties, and abrupt schedule changes may have contributed to disordered eating during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

Yet, different beliefs could have different implications for individuals emotional responses, which in turn could relate to different behaviours and specifically to either a greater or lesser compliance with social distancing and health-protective measures. In the present research, we investigated the links between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, emotions (anger, anxiety, and hope), attitudes towards government restrictions, and self-reported compliant behaviour. Results of a cross-sectional survey amongst a large UK sample (N = 1,579) provided support for the hypothesis that COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs showed a polarizing relationship with compliant behaviour through opposing emotional pathways. The relation was mediated by higher levels of anger, themselves related to a lesser perceived importance of government restrictions, and simultaneous higher levels of anxiety, related to a greater perceived importance. Hope was also related to conspiracy beliefs and to greater perceived importance but played a weaker role in the mediational model. Results suggest that the behavioural correlates of conspiracy beliefs might not be straightforward, and highlight the importance of considering the emotional states such beliefs might elicit when investigating their potential impact. ?

The aim of this study was to explore anxiety levels among adults and children in the UAE and to identify potential risk and protective factors for well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey we collected data from 2200 self-selected, assessed volunteers and their children. Demographic information, knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using the (GAD-7) scale, emotional problems in children using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), worry and fear about COVID-19, coping mechanisms and general health information were collected. Descriptive analysis was carried out to summarize demographic and participant characteristics, Chi-square analysis to explore associations between categorical variables and anxiety levels and multivariable binary logistic regression analysis to determine predictors of anxiety levels in adults and emotional problems in children. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of GAD in the general population was 71% with younger people (59.8%) and females (51.7%) reporting highest levels of anxiety. Parents who were teachers reported the highest percentage of emotional problems in children (26.7%). Adjusted multivariable logistic regression for GAD-7 scores showed that being female, high levels of worry associated with COVID-19, intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine and smoking were associated with higher levels of anxiety. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression for SDQ showed that higher emotional problems were reported for children in lower and higher secondary education, and parents who had severe anxiety were seven times more likely to report emotional problems in their children. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the psychological impact of COVID-19 among adults and children in the UAE and highlights the significant association between parental and child anxiety.

The dearth of evidence supporting the safety of laparoscopy for these patients led to a comparison of outcomes between LC and open colectomy (OC) for patients with American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) classifications 3 and 4. METHODS Data for all ASA 3 and 4 patients who underwent elective LC were reviewed from a prospectively maintained laparoscopic database. The patients who underwent LC were matched with OC patients by age, gender, diagnosis, year, and type of surgery. Estimated blood loss, operation time, time to return of bowel function, length of hospital stay, readmission rate, and 30-day complication and mortality rates were compared using chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Wilcoxon tests as appropriate. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS In this study, 231 LCs were matched with 231 OCs. The median age of the patients was 68 years, and 234 (51%) of the patients were male. There were 44 (19%) conversions from LC to OC. More patients in the OC group had undergone previous major laparotomy (5 vs. 15%; p < 0.001). Estimated blood loss, return of bowel function, length of hospital stay, and total direct costs were decreased in the LC group. Wound infection was significantly greater with OC (p = 0.02). When patients with previous major laparotomy were excluded, the two groups had similar overall morbidity. The other benefits of LC, however, persisted. CONCLUSION The findings show that LC is a safe option for patients with a high ASA classification. The LC approach is associated with faster postoperative recovery, lower morbidity rates, and lower hospital costs than the OC approach.","output":"Laparoscopic versus open colectomy for patients with American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) classifications 3 and 4: the minimally invasive approach is associated with significantly quicker recovery and reduced costs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study compared the therapeutic effects of transdermal testosterone gel (TTG) application at 4 and 6 weeks before controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) in women with poor ovarian response (POR).

Opioid-free anaesthesia (OFA) is a multimodal anaesthesia associating hypnotics, NMDA antagonists, local anaesthetics, anti-inflammatory drugs and -2 agonists. Proofs of the effect of OFA on reducing opioid-related adverse effects after major or intermediate non-cardiac surgery are still scarce. We hypothesised that the reduced opioid consumption allowed by OFA compared with standard of care will be associated with a reduction of postoperative opioid-related adverse events.

Furthermore, complementary to ACE2, both sialic acid (SA) molecules and CD147 proved relevant host receptors for SARS-CoV-2 entry, which explains the viral attack to multiple types of cells, including erythrocytes, endothelium and neural tissue. Several authors advocated that cell ferroptosis may be the core and final cell degenerative mechanism. Methods: a literature research was performed in several scientific search engines, such as PubMed Central, Cochrane Library, Chemical Abstract Service. More than 500 articles were retrieved until mid-December 2021, to highlight the available evidence about the investigated issues. Results: based on COVID-19 literature data, we have highlighted a few pathophysiological mechanisms, associated with virus-based cation dysmetabolism, multi-organ attack, mitochondria degeneration and ferroptosis. Our suggested elucidated pathological sequence is: a) spike protein subunit S1 docking with sialylated membrane glycoproteins/receptors (ACE2, CD147), and S2 subunit fusion with the lipid layer; b) cell membrane morpho-functional changes due to the consequent electro-chemical variations and viroporin action, which induce an altered ion channel function and intracellular cation accumulation; c) additional intracellular iron concentration due to a deregulated hepcidin-ferroportin axis, with higher hepcidin levels. Viral invasion may also affect erythrocytes/erythroid precursors, endothelial cells and macrophages, through SA and CD147 receptors, with relative hemoglobin and iron/calcium dysmetabolism.

Timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for the optimal management of pertussis, especially in severe cases. Methods Nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum specimens were obtained from patients suspected of having pertussis on the day of hospitalization at Shanghai Children's Medical Center from December 01, 2016, to November 30, 2017. The specimens were tested with the FilmArray Respiratory Panel, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that detects 16 viruses, Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae), and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae). Results Among the 140 children studied, 50.0% (70/140) were detected with a single pathogen, 45.0% (63/140) were detected with multiple pathogens, and 5.0% (7/140) had no detected pathogens. Forty-nine (35%, 49/140) patients tested positive for B. pertussis. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (Para) and rhinovirus/enterovirus (Rhino/Entero) were the most prevalent pathogens in patients with pertussis-like syndrome. No significant differences between the groups with pertussis and pertussis-like syndrome were observed regarding the clinical symptoms.

Method: An online survey of speech therapists in Hong Kong was conducted between February and March in 2020. The survey comprised up to 15 questions to assess participants' demographics, existing service delivery in telepractice, perception, and their training and knowledge on telepractice. Results: One hundred thirty-five speech (n = 135) speech language pathologists responded to the survey. About one-third (34.8%; n = 47) of participants reported having provided services through telepractice, whereas 72.3% of them started in <3 months and half of them considered it was less effective than face-to-face service. Among the other participants (n = 88), 83% of them indicated that unsuitable patient type and age as the main reason for not providing telepractice. The majority of participants had no prior training for delivering telepractice, and focused on technology when asked about their desired training. Knowledge of participants on telepractice was found only to align fairly with international guidelines. Discussions: The survey findings suggested that telepractice provision in Hong Kong was different from that of other countries where telepractice has been well established, due to the accelerated emergence by the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: The study showed how the development of telepractice would be like in a short time frame, and findings on perception and desired training could be a reference for a better establishment of this model of service.","output":"The Implementation of Telepractice in Speech Language Pathology in Hong Kong During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, COVID-19 were detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China.

Relative to paper records, websites enable governments to shape public understanding in quick, scalable, and permissible ways. During the Trump administration, website changes indicative of climate denial prompted civil society organizations to develop tools for tracking online government information sources. We in the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative (EDGI) illustrate how five data visualization techniques can be used to document and analyze changes to government websites. We examine a large sample of websites of US federal environmental agencies and show that between 2016 and 2020: 1) the use of the term climate change decreased by an estimated 38%; 2) access to as much as 20% of the Environmental Protection Agencys website was removed; 3) changes were made more to Cabinet agencies websites and to highly visible pages.

The impacts of the COVID-19 have spanned across the globe and rightly qualify to be a transboundary disaster. When looked through the lens of transboundary risks, COVID-19 is not the first of its kind. Health and nonhealth transboundary risks are on the rise during recent years due to the integration of socioeconomic and development processes at the regional and global scales. The paper presents various past experiences of transboundary disasters, their impacts, and important lessons related to risk reduction. It highlights the need for recognition of transboundary risks and advocates putting in place an integrated risk reduction framework from international to the regional, national, and local levels and across multiple sectors, which entails building the capacity of institutions and revamping of information and decision support systems. The paper suggests that the current risk management frameworks are not adequate in addressing the transboundary risks. There is a need for risk assessments to take into consideration the new and emerging risks and move to stochastic risk assessments from deterministic risk assessments. Transparent and timely sharing of the risk information is of paramount importance in addressing systemic risks spanning across borders. The paper further argues that countries such as India and Japan have the potential to lead the formulation and implementation of a risk reduction framework that can effectively address transboundary risks given their emerging role in the Asia region and beyond.","output":"Mitigating transboundary risks by integrating risk reduction frameworks of health and DRR:A perspective from COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already caused hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide in a few months.

Therefore, the occurrence of specific comorbidities associated with reninCangiotensin system (RAS) imbalance mediated by the interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and desintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 17 (ADAM17), along with specific genetic factors mainly associated with type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) expression, could be decisive for the clinical outcome of COVID-19. Indeed, the exacerbated ADAM17mediated ACE2, TNF-, and IL-6R secretion emerges as a possible underlying mechanism for the acute inflammatory immune response and the activation of the coagulation cascade. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the main pathophysiological aspects of ACE2, ADAM17, and TMPRSS2 host proteins in COVID-19.

Therefore, we monitored patients admitted with respiratory infections (RI) in 9 Berlin hospitals from 7.12.2009 to 12.12.2010 according to different case definitions (CD) and determined the proportion of cases with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1). We compared the sensitivity and specificity of CD for capturing pandemic pH1N1 cases. METHODS: We established an RI-surveillance restricted to adults aged  65 years within the framework of a pH1N1 vaccine effectiveness study, which required active identification of RI-cases. The hospital information-system was screened daily for newly admitted RI-patients. Nasopharyngeal swabs from consenting patients were tested by PCR for influenza-virus subtypes. Four clinical CD were compared in terms of capturing pH1N1-positives among hospitalized RI-patients by applying sensitivity and specificity analyses. The broadest case definition (CD1) was used for inclusion of RI-cases; the narrowest case definition (CD4) was identical to the SARI case definition recommended by ECDC/WHO. RESULTS: Over the study period, we identified 1,025 RI-cases, of which 283 (28%) met the ECDC/WHO SARI case definition. The percentage of SARI-cases among internal medicine admissions decreased from 3.2% (calendar-week 50-2009) to 0.2% (week 25-2010). Of 354 patients tested by PCR, 20 (6%) were pH1N1-positive. Two case definitions narrower than CD1 but -in contrast to SARI- not requiring shortness of breath yielded the largest areas under the Receiver-Operator-Curve. Heterogeneity of proportions of patients admitted with RI between hospitals was significant. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive surveillance of RI cases was feasible in a network of community hospitals. In most settings, several hospitals should be included to ensure representativeness. Although misclassification resulting from failure to obtain symptoms in the hospital information-system cannot be ruled out, a high proportion of hospitalized PCR-positive pH1N1-patients (45%) did not fulfil the SARI case-definition that included shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Thus, to assess influenza-related disease burden in hospitals, broader, alternative case definitions should be considered.","output":"Lessons from a one-year hospital-based surveillance of acute respiratory infections in Berlin- comparing case definitions to monitor influenza"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spillover of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to North American white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) has been documented.

Subcutaneous (SC) hydration is a relevant method for parenteral hydration, but clinical trials on the subject have methodological shortcomings compared to updated standards. DESIGN: Assessor-blinded, non-inferiority RCT to explore if SC is a safe alternative to intravenous (IV) hydration. PARTICIPANTS: Eligible patients were: Admitted patients 65 years or older with a need for parenteral hydration. The targeted sample size was 67 patients in each group. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomised to parenteral hydration via an IV or SC catheter during a 24 hours observation period. The non-randomised catheter (inactive) was placed as a sham on the patient, thereby blinding the caregivers and outcome assessors. MEASUREMENT: Our primary outcome was the proportion of patients reporting at least one adverse effect with a non-inferiority calculation using a 20% margin. RESULTS: We included 51 patients, with 24 randomised to SC and 27 to IV. We were unable to reach our target sample size due to challenges in recruitment, time limitation, and COVID-19. For the outcome of adverse effects, SC was non-inferior to IV (p = 0.012). Time spent on inserting the catheters was shorter with SC (p = 0.001).

However, the impact of risk perceptions and changes to daily life on weight loss has not been explored. This study aimed to examine how COVID-19 and perception of risk interacted with weight loss attempts in adults participating in a behavioural weight management programme. Forty-eight participants completed a semi-structured interview exploring the impact of COVID-19 on their weight management experience. Interviews were completed via telephone and analysed using a thematic approach. Reaction to perceived risk varied, but most participants reported the knowledge of increased risk promoted anxiety and avoidance behaviours. Despite this, many reported it as a motivating factor for weight loss. Restrictions both helped (e.g., reduced temptation) and hindered their weight loss (e.g., less support). However, there was consensus that the changes to everyday life meant participants had more time to engage with and take control of their weight loss. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to explore the impact of COVID-19 on participation in a weight management programme started during the pandemic in the United Kingdom. Restrictions had varying impacts on participant's weight loss. How risk is perceived and reported to participants is an important factor influencing engagement with weight management.

The intervention program consisted of two weekly sessions and each session lasted for 90 min. Parents in the intervention group would join a Facebook Page of Antibiotic Use, this online platform would allow participants to build a social network. A total of 48 parents had participated in the program. Parental knowledge and attitude were measured before and after the program using the Parental Perception on Antibiotics (PAPA) scale and the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) to assess differences between and within the intervention and control groups. RESULTS: All parents in the intervention group had an understanding that antibiotics could be effective at treating some infections only, as compared to 40% in the control group. All parents in the intervention group and 85% of the control group disagreed that they should reduce the dose of antibiotics when their children were recovering. The test was statistically significant (p = 0.039) at p < 0.05. There were a significant difference and a strong negative correlation between peer support on Facebook and the parents belief that antibiotics could be stopped when their children felt better, with Pearson coefficient of ? 0.78 at p < 0.001.

Results: Thirty-two CABG, 12 valve surgery, 6 aortic surgery, 4 CABG + valve surgeries were performed. During the postoperative follow-up of I I patients, who were suspicious of COVID-19, 8 of them displayed respiratory problems and partial oxygen depletion and required continuous positive airway pressure. The hospitalization duration of COVID-19-suspicious patients were approximately 5 days longer than that of normal patients. In one of the patient, who was treated positive for COVID-19, acute coronary syndrome developed and CABG was performed following the treatment. Conclusion: During the pandemic period, acute cardiac diseases needing urgent surgery could be misdiagnosed because of similar symptoms with COVID-19 and the health care practitioners concentrated with the COVID-19 primarily. On the other hand, pandemic fear could cause delayed admission to the hospital and increased postoperative mortality and morbidity. When a COVID-19 positive or -suspicious patient undergo open-heart surgery, problems resulting from both COVID-19 infection and cardiopulmonary bypass-associated systemic effects could arise. The combination of these two cases could worsen the complications.","output":"Management of Cardiac Surgery in a Pandemic Region Hospital: Precautions, Results and Experiences During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic compelled states to limit free movement, in order to protect at-risk and more vulnerable groups, particularly older adults.

Researchers have been able to produce vaccines, however, it is as recent as December 2020, that the use of the same has been initiated, though all such products are still being studied for their long-term safety and efficacy, since the virus is fast mutating. The discovery of specific antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 also has not seen the light of the day. Thus, the strategy to control the pandemic is largely focused on use of supplements and nutraceuticals, mostly plant based. These products can be used as preventive as well as to mitigate the symptoms and thereby provide therapy. Such products are ahead of other pharmacological candidates, as they are comparatively cheaper, easily available locally and the adverse reactions are negligible, if any. The nutraceuticals being used work as immunomodulators, thereby manipulating the immune response in mitigating the infection. They assist in regulating not only inflammation but also mediate the immune response to cater to preventing damage to respiratory system, the major concern in COVID-19. Many nutraceuticals have been found to benefit the disease conditions under various viral attacks, though detailed study on SARS-CoV-2 is underway for many such products. The current review focuses on presenting the nutraceuticals which have been evaluated for their antiviral properties. The antiviral effects are mediated through direct inhibition to the entry of the virus into host cells or through the indirect modulation of the immune system, thereby enhancing the recovery of patients.

App-based interventions offer a promising platform for intervention delivery. This trial aims to pilot a theory-driven, app-based intervention that promotes brisk walking among people living with and beyond cancer. The primary aim is to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of study procedures before conducting a larger randomised controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: This is an individually randomised, two-armed pilot RCT. Patients with localised or metastatic breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer, who are aged 16 years or over, will be recruited from a single hospital site in South Yorkshire in the UK. The intervention includes an app designed to encourage brisk walking (Active 10) supplemented with habit-based behavioural support in the form of two brief telephone/video calls, an information leaflet, and walking planners. The primary outcomes will be feasibility and acceptability of the study procedures. Demographic and medical characteristics will be collected at baseline, through self-report and hospital records. Secondary outcomes for the pilot (assessed at 0 and 3 months) will be accelerometer measured and self-reported physical activity, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference, and patient-reported outcomes of quality of life, fatigue, sleep, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, and habit strength for walking. Qualitative interviews will explore experiences of participating or reasons for declining to participate. Parameters for the intended primary outcome measure (accelerometer measured average daily minutes of brisk walking ( 100 steps/min)) will inform a sample size calculation for the future RCT and a preliminary economic evaluation will be conducted.

The FOS was used at 0, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7%. The cycle included 340 broilers distributed into 4 batteries, with 85 broiler chickens in each battery. There were 5 replicates with 17 broiler chickens each, and the analyses were triplicated. The studied parameters were production performance, antioxidant status, hematological measurements, cellular and humoral immune response, intestinal acidosis, intestinal microbial counts, and volatile fatty acid (VFA) level in the hindgut. Results showed that broiler chickens fed 0.7% of FOS had significantly higher body weight gain than the control group and the groups fed 0.3% and 0.5% of FOS. Supplementing broiler feed with FOS at all levels increased the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and reduced the malondialdehyde of the sera (P = 0.015 and 0.025, respectively). Liver catalase enzyme in the broiler chickens fed 0.5 and 0.7% of FOS was higher than that of the control group and the group fed 0.3% of FOS (P = 0.001). However, the liver MDA of the control group was higher than that of all the other groups (P = 0.031). The total WBC and heterophils % were the highest after supplementing broilers with 0.7% FOS (P = 0.004 and 0.003, respectively) at 3 wks of age. Conversely, lymphocytes and monocytes were the lowest for the 0.7% FOS group (P = 0.030 and 0.020, respectively). Dietary 0.05 and 0.7% of FOS induced the highest cellular response compared to the other treatments (P = 0.020). Thymus, bursa of Fabricious, and spleen weights were enhanced after FOS supplementation, which indicates a higher specific cellular response. To conclude, FOS prebiotic at all levels can be utilized safely to enhance the antioxidant activity and the cellular immune response of broiler chickens. Using 0.7% of FOS resulted in higher body weight of broilers.

We investigated the antiviral effects of Paulownia tomentosa flowers, an herbal medicine used in some provinces of P. R. China for the treatment of skin rashes and blisters. Dried flowers of P. tomentosa were extracted with methanol and tested for antiviral activity against enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CAV16), the predominant etiologic agents of hand, foot, and mouth disease in P. R. China. The extract inhibited EV71 infection, although no effect was detected against CAV16 infection. Bioactivity-guided fractionation was performed to identify apigenin as an active component of the flowers. The EC50 value for apigenin to block EV71 infection was 11.0 M, with a selectivity index of approximately 9.3. Although it is a common dietary flavonoid, only apigenin, and not similar compounds like naringenin and quercetin, were active against EV71 infection. As an RNA virus, the genome of EV71 has an internal ribosome entry site that interacts with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) and regulates viral translation. Cross-linking followed by immunoprecipitation and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that EV71 RNA was associated with hnRNPs A1 and A2. Apigenin treatment disrupted this association, indicating that apigenin suppressed EV71 replication through a novel mechanism by targeting the trans-acting factors. This study therefore validates the effects of Paulownia against EV71 infection.

A complex picture emerged for how the particle number concentrations (PN) and particle mass concentrations (PM, specifically PM10) were affected by the day of the week, the route selected, the meteorological conditions, and the traffic intensity.

DESIGN Quality improvement project, pre/post intervention design. METHODS This project implemented the HIYA! (HPV Immunization among Young Adults) Intervention in a private sports and family practice in central New Jersey. HIYA! implemented 10 pre-, during, and post-visit outcome measures during every family medicine visit with an 18 to 26-year-old patient for HPV. Data collection involved retrospective chart review of every eligible patient during the 12-week implementation period from 17 August to 06 November 2020 and during the same 12-week control period in 2019. RESULTS/FINDINGS One hundred sixteen charts from 2019 and 129 charts from 2020 were reviewed for assessment of HPV vaccination status and HPV vaccine initiation and/or completion. Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that participants in the control group were 84% less likely to be assessed for HPV vaccination status and were 91% less likely to initiate and complete HPV vaccination compared with the intervention group. CONCLUSION This QI project found HIYA! to be an effective and feasible strategy to improve HPV vaccination rates among 18 to 26-year-old patients in a family practice setting. IMPACT The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, and causes thousands of cancers annually. Although vaccination against HPV can prevent these cancers, vaccination rates remain low, particularly among young adults ages 18 to 26 years. The positive impact of HIYA! was evident based on its success despite the unique challenges presented during the implementation period due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"HPV immunization among young adults (HIYA!) in family practice: A quality improvement project."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted on healthcare delivery worldwide, affecting many services, including those for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) Aims: To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on worldwide IBD telephone advice-line services Methods: A mixed-methods 25-item online survey was distributed to IBD specialist nurses globally using IBD professional networks, email and social media Data were analysed using descriptive statistics (quantitative data) and content and thematic analysis (qualitative data) Findings: Across 21 countries, 182 IBD specialists participated With adjustments, all advice lines remained functional Call content changed, and call volume increased exponentially Strategies were recommended to maintain services IBD specialist nurses faced considerable challenges, including overwhelming workload, disrupted referral pathways, fragmented IBD clinical team support, isolation and greatly lowered morale Conclusions: To cope with similar future crises, advice-line training, resilience coaching and ringfencing of the IBD clinical team are essential Development of global guidelines for maintaining advice-line functionality in any scenario is recommended","output":"Inflammatory bowel disease advice lines during the COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective service evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Little is known about the effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on pregnant mothers and their infants.

As the number of affected patients increase rapidly, manual severity assessment becomes a labor-intensive task, and may lead to delayed treatment. Purpose: Using machine learning method to realize automatic severity assessment (non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 based on chest CT images, and to explore the severity-related features from the resulting assessment model. Materials and Method: Chest CT images of 176 patients (age 45.3$\\\\pm$16.5 years, 96 male and 80 female) with confirmed COVID-19 are used, from which 63 quantitative features, e.g., the infection volume/ratio of the whole lung and the volume of ground-glass opacity (GGO) regions, are calculated. A random forest (RF) model is trained to assess the severity (non-severe or severe) based on quantitative features. Importance of each quantitative feature, which reflects the correlation to the severity of COVID-19, is calculated from the RF model. Results: Using three-fold cross validation, the RF model shows promising results, i.e., 0.933 of true positive rate, 0.745 of true negative rate, 0.875 of accuracy, and 0.91 of area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The resulting importance of quantitative features shows that the volume and its ratio (with respect to the whole lung volume) of ground glass opacity (GGO) regions are highly related to the severity of COVID-19, and the quantitative features calculated from the right lung are more related to the severity assessment than those of the left lung. Conclusion: The RF based model can achieve automatic severity assessment (non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 infection, and the performance is promising.

The resulting endothelial injury induces widespread thrombosis and microangiopathy. Nevertheless, early specific markers of endothelial dysfunction and vascular redox status in COVID-19 patients are currently missing. METHODS: Observational study including ICU and non-ICU adult COVID-19 patients admitted in hospital for acute respiratory failure, compared with control subjects matched for cardiovascular risk factors similar to ICU COVID-19 patients, and ICU septic shock patients unrelated to COVID-19. FINDINGS: Early SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an imbalance between an exacerbated oxidative stress (plasma peroxides levels in ICU patients vs. controls: 1456.0  400.2 vs 436  272.1 mmol/L; P < 0.05) and a reduced nitric oxide bioavailability proportional to disease severity (5--nitrosyl-hemoglobin, HbNO in ICU patients vs. controls: 116.1  62.1 vs. 163.3  46.7 nmol/L; P < 0.05). HbNO levels correlated with oxygenation parameters (PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio) in COVID-19 patients (R(2) = 0.13; P < 0.05). Plasma levels of angiotensin II, aldosterone, renin or serum level of TREM-1 ruled out any hyper-activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or leucocyte respiratory burst in ICU COVID-19 patients, contrary to septic patients. INTERPRETATION: Endothelial oxidative stress with ensuing decreased NO bioavailability appears as a likely pathogenic factor of endothelial dysfunction in ICU COVID-19 patients. A correlation between NO bioavailability and oxygenation parameters is observed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These results highlight an urgent need for oriented research leading to a better understanding of the specific endothelial oxidative stress that occurs during SARS-CoV-2.

Both the 'U2' combination (anti-CD20 mAb ublituximab + the PI3K-CK1? inhibitor umbralisib) and BTK inhibition are highly active in treatment-na?ve (TN) and relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL, each having previously demonstrated superiority over standard chemoimmunotherapy. Here we report the results of the dose escalation of TG-1701 monotherapy and TG-1701+U2. Methods: Pts with R/R CLL and lymphoma were enrolled in a Ph 1 study initially evaluating dose escalation (DE) of oral TG-1701 QD continuously administered in 28-day cycles (100, 200, 300, and 400 mg). After characterizing the safety profile of TG-1701 monotherapy, we implemented a parallel DE arm of TG-1701+U2. Select dose levels of TG-1701 monotherapy were expanded in CLL, MCL and Waldenstr?m's (WM). All pts were treated until disease progression. The primary objectives are to characterize the safety profile and define the recommended Ph 2 doses for the drugs alone and in combination. Results: As of 03 February 2021, 123 pts were treated with TG-1701: 25 in the monotherapy DE arm, 61 in the 200 mg disease-specific cohorts (20 CLL [5 TN], 21 MCL [4 TN], 20 WM [8 TN]), 20 in the 300 mg CLL cohort (4 TN), and 17 in the 1701+U2 DE arm. The median # of prior therapies was 1 (range, 1 -10). All pts were BTKi-na?ve. All 123 pts were evaluable for safety. TG-1701 was well tolerated and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for monotherapy was not reached at 400 mg (demonstrating near 100% saturation of the BTK at all dose levels studied). Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) of clinical interest included atrial fibrillation (AF 4.0% of pts, G 3 in 1 case), G 3 hypertension (2.4%), and bleeding events (18.7%, all G1-2). No cases of ventricular tachyarrhythmia were reported. TEAEs leading to TG-1701 dose reduction occurred in 6.5% of pts. TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 1.6% of pts (AF, COVID-19). At the data cut-off, 119 pts were evaluable for response, including 40 in DE (Table). The median duration of response has not been reached among responders overall. The median follow-up (mFU range) was 15.9 mos (1.3 -28.6+) in DE and 8.5 mos (1.4 -15.6+) in disease-specific cohorts. Conclusions: TG1701 exhibits an encouraging safety and efficacy profile. The combination of 1701+U2 has been well tolerated and dose escalation continues. The combination shows enhanced depth of response over TG-1701 monotherapy. Recruitment to this study continues.

We aimed to examine neonatal imitation, a foundation of social cognition, in very preterm and full-term infants METHODS: In Strasbourg, France, between 2015 and 2018, we prospectively investigated the development of imitation skills. Very preterm (27 to 33 weeks of gestational age, n = 20) and full-term infants (n=20) were enrolled using four gestures: tongue protrusion, mouth opening, sequential finger movements and hand movements. All testing were performed in infants at term-equivalent age. Two independent and blinded observers coded the behaviour of each infant on video recording. Facial expressions or hand movements, similar to the one presented, were quantified and classified according to their timing. RESULTS A total of 37 out of 40 infants imitated at least one gesture. The very preterm and term infants did not differ in the presence of imitation or its timing for the four gestures tested. Very preterm infants displayed more imitation abilities for sequential finger movement. Tongue protrusion and sequential finger movement were the particularly strong imitated gesture in both groups.

This knowledge is important for the development of therapeutic approaches to control SARS-CoV-2 infection by permitting the screening for neutralizing antibodies and other agents that can block infection. This is particularly important for patients who are at high risk for severe outcomes related to COVID-19. The production of pseudotyped viral particles may seem like a daunting task for a non-virology laboratory without experience in the two most commonly used pseudotyping systems, namely retro/lentiviruses and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) which lacks the VSV envelope glycoprotein (VSVG). By incorporating the most up-to-date knowledge, we have developed a detailed, easy-to-follow novel protocol for producing SARS-CoV-2 spike-bearing pseudovirus using the VSV-G system. We describe the infection assay which uses GFP fluorescence as a measure of infection in a 24-well live imaging system. We present results of our optimization of the system to enhance viral infection levels through the over-expression of human ACE2 receptor and the overexpression of at least one of two proteases - TMPRSS2 or Furin, as well as, supplementation with Poloxamer 407 (P407) and Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as adjuvants.

In addition, we have used this system to show infection of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs).

METHOD: The psychiatry liaison database was searched for referrals of 17 year olds and under from April until August 2020. All referrals to all acute hospital sites in Lanarkshire received from any source were included. The only exclusion criteria applied were age over 17 and unavailable assessment information. patient's age; date, source and reason for referral; hospital site of assessment; outcome of assessment. RESULT: Between April and August 2020, the number of CAMHS A&E referrals increased every month except in July. The age range of CAMHS patients presenting to A&E were 12-17 years, with 17 being the most common age seen. 87% of referrals were from A&E. The two most common reasons for referrals were drug overdose and suicidal ideation. The most common outcome of assessment was a CAMHS referral. COVID-19 was a trigger for an adolescent's presentation to A&E in 31% of cases, the most common cause being struggling with the lockdown/restrictions. CONCLUSION: The mental health charity YoungMinds carried out several surveys throughout the COVID-19 pandemic's first wave. They demonstrated a detrimental effect on young people's mental health in the UK. YoungMinds surveys revealed that 32% and 41% of young people experienced much worse mental health due to COVID-19. The findings of NHS Lanarkshire were similar, with 31% of adolescents presenting to A&E as a result of COVID-19. No adolescent included in this review had contracted COVID-19 at any point. Their mental health was therefore impacted by the indirect effects of COVID-19 rather than the direct effects of infection. For the 31% of CAMHS presentations to A&E which were due to COVID-19, most young people struggled with the lockdown/restrictions. The number of presentations to A&E increased every month between April and August 2020 except for July. This could be due to people's initial fear of coming to hospital and catching COVID-19. However, as infection and death rates decreased towards the summer, people may have regarded hospitals as safer. The general increase in referrals every month may also be a reflection of the worsening of young people's mental health the longer the pandemic extended.","output":"The effects of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation of adolescents to acute mental health services in NHS Lanarkshire"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The timing of transmission plays a key role in the dynamics and controllability of an epidemic. However, observing generation timesthe time interval between the infection of an infector and an infectee in a transmission pairrequires data on infection times, which are generally unknown. The timing of symptom onset is more easily observed; generation times are therefore often estimated based on serial intervalsthe time interval between symptom onset of an infector and an infectee. This estimation follows one of two approaches: (i) approximating the generation time distribution by the serial interval distribution or (ii) deriving the generation time distribution from the serial interval and incubation periodthe time interval between infection and symptom onset in a single individualdistributions. These two approaches make differentand not always explicitly statedassumptions about the relationship between infectiousness and symptoms, resulting in different generation time distributions with the same mean but unequal variances. Here, we clarify the assumptions that each approach makes and show that neither set of assumptions is plausible for most pathogens. However, the variances of the generation time distribution derived under each assumption can reasonably be considered as upper (approximation with serial interval) and lower (derivation from serial interval) bounds. Thus, we suggest a pragmatic solution is to use both approaches and treat these as edge cases in downstream analysis. We discuss the impact of the variance of the generation time distribution on the controllability of an epidemic through strategies based on contact tracing, and we show that underestimating this variance is likely to overestimate controllability.","output":"On the relationship between serial interval, infectiousness profile and generation time"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Double membrane vesicles (DMVs) in coronavirus-infected cells feature pores that span both membranes.

The http://covid-webapp.numerusinc.com/ web app presented here fills this gap. METHODS: Our web app uses a model that explicitly identifies susceptible, contact, latent, asymptomatic, symptomatic and recovered classes of individuals, and a parallel set of response classes, subject to lower pathogen-contact rates. The user inputs a CSV file of incidence and, if of interest, mortality rate data. A default set of parameters is available that can be overwritten through input or online entry, and a user-selected subset of these can be fitted to the model using maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE). Model fitting and forecasting intervals are specifiable and changes to parameters allow counterfactual and forecasting scenarios. Confidence or credible intervals can be generated using stochastic simulations, based on MLE values, or on an inputted CSV file containing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimates of one or more parameters. RESULTS: We illustrate the use of our web app in extracting social distancing, social relaxation, surveillance or virulence switching functions (i.e., time varying drivers) from the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 epidemics in Israel, South Africa, and England. The Israeli outbreak exhibits four distinct phases: initial outbreak, social distancing, social relaxation, and a second wave mitigation phase. An MCMC projection of this latter phase suggests the Israeli epidemic will continue to produce into late November an average of around 1500 new case per day, unless the population practices social-relaxation measures at least 5-fold below the level in August, which itself is 4-fold below the level at the start of July. Our analysis of the relatively late South African outbreak that became the world's fifth largest COVID-19 epidemic in July revealed that the decline through late July and early August was characterised by a social distancing driver operating at more than twice the per-capita applicable-disease-class (pc-adc) rate of the social relaxation driver. Our analysis of the relatively early English outbreak, identified a more than 2-fold improvement in surveillance over the course of the epidemic. It also identified a pc-adc social distancing rate in early August that, though nearly four times the pc-adc social relaxation rate, appeared to barely contain a second wave that would break out if social distancing was further relaxed. CONCLUSION: Our web app provides policy makers and health officers who have no epidemiological modelling or computer coding expertise with an invaluable tool for assessing the impacts of different outbreak mitigation policies and measures. This includes an ability to generate an epidemic-suppression or curve-flattening index that measures the intensity with which behavioural responses suppress or flatten the epidemic curve in the region under consideration.","output":"A versatile web app for identifying the drivers of COVID-19 epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preservation of a robust circadian rhythmicity (particulsarly of the sleep/wake cycle), a proper nutrition and adequate physical exercise are key elements for healthy aging.

In the central nervous system, sleep disruption impairs several functions, among them, the clearance of waste molecules. The decrease of plasma melatonin, a molecule of unusual phylogenetic conservation present in all known aerobic organisms, plays a particular role as far as the endocrine sequels of aging. Every day, the late afternoon/nocturnal increase of melatonin synchronizes both the central circadian pacemaker located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei as well as myriads of peripheral cellular circadian clocks. This is called the \\"chronobiotic effect\\" of melatonin, the methoxyindole being the prototype of the endogenous family of chronobiotic agents. In addition, melatonin exerts a significant cytoprotective action by buffering free radicals and reversing inflammation via down regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, suppression of low degree inflammation and prevention of insulin resistance. Because of these properties melatonin has been advocated to be a potential therapeutic tool in COVID 19 pandemic. Melatonin administration to aged animals counteracts a significant number of senescence-related changes. In humans, melatonin is effective both as a chronobiotic and a cytoprotective agent to maintain a healthy aging. Circulating melatonin levels are consistently reduced in the metabolic syndrome, ischemic and non-ischemic cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders like the Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The potential therapeutic value of melatonin has been suggested by a limited number of clinical trials generally employing melatonin in the 2-10mg/day range. However, from animal studies the cytoprotective effects of melatonin need higher doses to become apparent (i.e. in the 100mg/day range). Hence, controlled studies employing melatonin doses in this range are urgently needed.","output":"Melatonin and healthy aging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Chile has one of the highest incidences of COVID-19 infection in the world. Primary care can play a key role in early detection and containment of the disease. There is a lack of information on the clinical profile of patients with suspected COVID-19 in primary care, and controversy on the effectiveness of rapid serologic tests in the diagnosis and surveillance of the disease. AIM: To assess the effectiveness of rapid serologic testing in detection and surveillance of COVID-19 cases in primary care. DESIGN & SETTING: A longitudinal study was undertaken, which was based on a non-random sample of 522 participants, including 304 symptomatic patients and 218 high-risk asymptomatic individuals. They were receiving care at four primary health clinics in an underserved area in Santiago, Chile. METHOD: The participants were systematically assessed and tested for COVID-19 with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serology at baseline, and were followed clinically and serologically for 3 weeks. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases were 3.5 times higher in symptomatic patients (27.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 22.1 to 32.8) compared with asymptomatic participants (7.9%; 95% CI = 4.3 to 11.6). Similarly, the immune response was significantly different between both groups. Sensitivity of serologic testing was 57.8% (95% CI = 44.8 to 70.1) during the third week of follow-up and specificity was 98.4% (95% CI = 95.5 to 99.7). CONCLUSION: Rapid serologic testing is ineffective for detecting asymptomatic or non-severe cases of COVID-19 at early stages of the disease, but can be of value for surveillance of immunity response in primary care. The clinical profile and immune response of patients with COVID-19 in primary care differs from those in hospital-based populations.","output":"Clinical and serological profile of asymptomatic and non-severe symptomatic COVID-19 cases: Lessons from a longitudinal study in primary care in Latin America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genomic sequencing helps us understand COVID-19 and its spread It can also help guide treatments in the future and see the impact of interventions In epidemics, genome structure is important for recognizing any small change in the COVID-19 behavior at any population scale to understand the spreading mechanism and whether different strains are emerging The viral spike (S) protein amino acid sequence viral genomic sequences and other mutated spike proteins are related to the advanced genome of mRNA We analyzed some major S protein mutation which was represented in a high percentage of all the analyzed sequences Spike-D614G mutation is a terrible phenomenon that has been spread in Europe in early February and has been started rapidly to become the dominant form in new regions In the United States, the genotypic distribution in California and Washington was similar to Asian countries, while other US states' distribution was comparable to Europe To gain insight into the D614G mutation consequences, homology modeling using a multi-template threading mechanism with ab initio structural refinement was performed for the S protein region The D614 model predicted a random coil structure in the Furin domain, and this mutation may confer a competitive advantage at the Furin binding domain that may contribute to the rise of the D614G virus mutant Due to resistance to any pandemic interventions, mutations should be evaluated in viewpoints of time and geographical situation in the wide phylogenetic domains to announce an early warning system for new mutations ? 2021 by the authors","output":"The specification of observed covid-19 in england: A review of auto-mutation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The full-length genomes of 11 infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) field isolates from three different types of the virus; Massachusetts (Mass), Connecticut (Conn) and California (CAL) isolated over a 41, 25 and 8 year period respectively, were sequenced and analyzed to determine the mutation rates and level of polymorphisms across the genome.

We divided the evaluation into 4 scenarios: Scenario -no dispatch, Scenario -dispatch of 4,599 medical staff, Scenario -dispatch of 16,000 staff, and Scenario -dispatch of 32,000 staff. METHODS: The extended Susceptible-Exposed- Infectious-Recovered-Death (SEIRD) model was adopted to quantify the effect of the dispatch of national medical teams to Wuhan on COVID-19 prevention and control. RESULTS: The dispatch dramatically cuts the channels for the transmission of the virus and succeeds in raising the cure rates while reducing the fatality rates. If there were no dispatch at all, a cumulative total of 158,881 confirmed cases, 18,700 fatalities and a fatality rate of 11.77% would have occurred in Wuhan, which are 3.2 times, 4.8 times and 1.5 times the real figures respectively.

METHODS Articles from January 2000 to November 2020 were identified through a comprehensive search that examined EMRs/EHRs and clinical variation or PowerPlans/SmartSets. Thirty-six articles met the inclusion criteria. Articles were examined for evidence for EMR-induced changes in variation and effects on health care outcomes and mapped to the quadruple aim of health care. RESULTS Most of the studies reported positive effects of EMR-related interventions (30/36, 83%). All of the 36 included studies discussed clinical variation, but only half measured it (18/36, 50%).

During the pandemic, physicians in our hospital have had to respond both to the issue of treating the patients and the increasing domestic burden associated with social disruption. The purpose of this study was to assess how much the burden on our doctors, especially female doctors, was increasing. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Physicians' Career Support Committee in Sapporo Medical University conducted a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire inquired about a wide range of subjects with regard to working style and family life during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was sent to all medical/dental physicians working in Sapporo Medical University. RESULTS: A total of 266 (42.7%) physicians in our hospital responded to our questionnaire and the data for 264 data were analyzed. The total numbers of males, females, and others, including those who did not want to specify, were 178 (67.4%), 82 (31.0%), and 4 (1.5%), respectively. Among them, 62 (23.5%) and 23 (8.7%) answered that their domestic burden was slightly or markedly increased. The increase in the domestic burden showed a significant difference between genders (p = 0.04). Even after correction for background differences using multivariate analysis, being female (p<0.001), having child dependents (p<0.001), and treating COVID-19 patients (p = 0.03) were significantly related to an increased domestic burden. Regarding family style, 58.1% of the physician-fathers were from two-income families (i.e., families with both parents in employment), and they answered that their partner mainly cared for the children. In contrast, 97.3% of physician-mothers were from two-income families, and 94.6% of the physician-mothers had to take care of children by themselves. CONCLUSION: Physician-mothers are caught in a dilemma between an increased home burden and clinical duties in the hospital, with a significantly higher ratio than physician-fathers during the pandemic. As we showed, female doctors could have not continued their careers and take responsible positions in the same way as male doctors.

The dysregulation of the inflammatory response in COVID-19 plays a very important role in disease progression. It has been observed that abnormal activity of Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-B) is directly associated with, inter alia, increased synthesis of proinflammatory factors. Therefore, this review paper focuses on the functions of NF-B in the development of SARS-CoV-2 infection and potential application of NF-B inhibitors in COVID-19 immunotherapy. A comprehensive literature search was performed using the MEDLINE/PubMed database. In the current review, it is highlighted that NF-B plays important functions in the modulation of an adaptive inflammatory response, including inducing the expression of proinflammatory genes. Increased activation of NF-B in SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed. The association between NF-B activation and the expression of SARS-CoV-2 structural and non-structural proteins were also reported. It was observed that modulation of NF-B using, e.g., traditional Chinese medicine or glucocorticosteroids resulted in decreased synthesis of proinflammatory factors caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to one of three regimen groups at a ratio of 1:1:1. The primary outcome of this study was admission to the intensive care unit. Secondary outcomes were intubation, in-hospital mortality, time to clinical recovery, and length of hospital stay (LOS). Between April 13 and August 9, 2020, a total of 336 patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the 3 treatment regimens including group I (hydroxychloroquine stat, prednisolone, azithromycin and naproxen; 120 patients), group II (hydroxychloroquine stat, azithromycin and naproxen; 116 patients), and group III (hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir (116 patients). The mean LOS in patients receiving prednisolone was 5.5 in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population and 4.4 days in the per-protocol (PP) population compared with 6.4 days (mITT population) and 5.8 days (PP population) in patients treated with Lopinavir/Ritonavir. RESULTS: The mean LOS was significantly lower in the mITT and PP populations who received prednisolone compared with populations treated with Lopinavir/Ritonavir (p = 0.028; p = 0.0007). We observed no significant differences in the number of deaths, ICU admission, and need for mechanical ventilation between the Modified ITT and per-protocol populations treated with prednisolone and Lopinavir/Ritonavir, although these outcomes were better in the arm treated with prednisolone.

Recent evidence suggesting that obesity leads to tissue-specific vitamin A deficiency led to an investigation of whether high-dose oral vitamin A, a treatment used for remediating vitamin A deficiency in developing countries, could correct obesity-associated tissue deficits. METHODS Adult C57BL/6 diet-induced obese mice were supplemented with vitamin A for 4 weeks. A subset of mice were then vaccinated with inactivated influenza virus and challenged. Following supplementation, tissue vitamin A levels, lung immune cell composition, blood inflammatory cytokines, antibody responses, and viral clearance were evaluated. RESULTS Supplementation significantly improved vitamin A levels in lung and adipose tissues in diet-induced obese mice. Additionally, supplementation decreased inflammatory cytokines in the blood and altered the lung immune environment. Importantly, vaccinated, vitamin A-treated diet-induced obese mice exhibited improved antibody responses and significantly reduced viral loads post challenge compared with PBS-treated mice. CONCLUSIONS Results demonstrate a low-cost intervention that may correct vitamin A tissue deficits and help control respiratory viral infections in individuals with obesity.","output":"Vitamin A Corrects Tissue Deficits in Diet-Induced Obese Mice and Reduces Influenza Infection After Vaccination and Challenge."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is giving rise to a wide range of clinical manifestations, which can affect all organs and systems.

The virus, which belongs to the coronavirus family (SARS-CoV-2), was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Full-length genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 showed 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV, with 96% identity to a bat coronavirus at the whole-genome level. COVID-19 has caused over 133,000 deaths and there are over 2 million total confirmed cases as of 15 April 2020. Current treatment plans are still under investigation due to a lack of understanding of COVID-19. One potential mechanism to slow disease progression is the use of antiviral drugs to either block the entry of the virus or interfere with viral replication and maturation. Currently, antiviral drugs, including chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and lopinavir/ritonavir, have shown effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Due to the high dose needed and narrow therapeutic window, many patients are experiencing severe side effects with the above drugs. Hence, repurposing these drugs with a proper formulation is needed to improve the safety and efficacy for COVID-19 treatment. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a family of natural carriers in the human body. They play a critical role in cell-to-cell communications. EVs can be used as unique drug carriers to deliver protease inhibitors to treat COVID-19. EVs may provide targeted delivery of protease inhibitors, with fewer systemic side effects. More importantly, EVs are eligible for major aseptic processing and can be upscaled for mass production. Currently, the FDA is facilitating applications to treat COVID-19, which provides a very good chance to use EVs to contribute in this combat.","output":"Repurposing Antiviral Protease Inhibitors Using Extracellular Vesicles for Potential Therapy of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proteases are involved in almost all biological processes, and therefore, aberrant activity of many of these enzymes is an important indicator of disease.

The patients immune response was analysed from two blood samples taken before and 4 - 5 weeks after the annual influenza vaccination. Individual antibody concentrations to three influenza virus strains (H3N2, H1N1, IB) were quantified via hemagglutination inhibition assays. By quantifying individual light exposure profiles (including daylight), we classified the patients into a low and a high light exposure group based on a median illuminance of 392.6 lux. The two light exposure groups did not differ in cognitive impairment severity, age or gender distribution. However, patients in the high light exposure group showed a significantly greater circadian rest-activity amplitude (i.e., more daytime activity and less nighttime activity) along with a significantly greater antibody titer increase to the H3N2 vaccine than patients in the low light exposure group, despite similar pre-vaccination concentrations. Sufficient seroprotective responses to all three influenza virus strains were attained for  75% of participants. These data provide first evidence for a potentially enhanced immune response in patients with dementia when they received more daily light.

The RCMs are relaxed to the prescribed lateral boundary conditions originating from a global model, effectively matching the driving model's overall atmospheric moisture flux divergence. As a consequence, excess oceanic evaporation results in positive precipitation biases over land due to forced internal recycling of moisture to maintain the overall flux divergence prescribed by the boundary conditions.

It has been proposed that the Ct value could help with clinical decisions regarding duration of isolation. We hypothesize that Ct values will correlate with symptom duration in a population of veterans with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We reviewed the records of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) or admitted to Audie L. Murphy VA Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. We looked at patients who received multiple SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR tests. We compared date of onset of symptoms and cycle threshold values from their initial test to another test ordered after 7, 10, and 20 days from symptom onset. We recorded the Ct value for the N2 and E genes. Patients were classified into mild, severe and critical based on Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. A Ct value of >30 as threshold for transmissible disease was used based on previously published studies. RESULTS: We identified 49 patients with more than two SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR tests. Patients with mild disease with tests less than or equal to ten days from symptom onset (n=10) had a mean Ct value 23.2 (5.6) and 26.0 (5.8) for the E and N2 genes. Patients with mild disease with tests greater than ten days from symptom onset (n=4) had mean Ct values of 26.0 (6.5) and 27.8 (6.8). When we stratified the patient population by disease severity, patients with severe and critical disease with tests less than ten days from symptom onset (n=24) had mean Ct values of 20.1 (7.3) and 23.4 (7.5). Patients with severe and critical disease greater than twenty days (n=6) had Ct values of 29.0 (5.1) and 31.1 (5.4). CONCLUSION: We found that Ct values increased with longer symptom duration. We currently use the CDC criteria to discontinue isolation at ten days for mild disease and twenty days for severe and critical disease.

Applying a scientifically based analysis to disease transmission and performing a site specific risk analysis to determine the design of the ventilation system can provide real and long term cost savings. Using a scientific approach and convincing data, this paper hypothetically illustrates how a ventilation system design can be optimized to potentially reduce infection risk to occupants in an isolation room based on a thorough risk assessment without necessarily increasing ventilation airflow rate. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed to examine the transport mechanism, particle path and a suggested control strategy for reducing airborne infectious disease agents. Most studies on the transmission of infectious disease particles have concentrated primarily on air changes per hour (ACH) and how ACH provides a dilution factor for possible infectious agents. Although increasing ventilation airflow rate does dilute concentrations better when the contaminant source is constant, it does not increase ventilation effectiveness. Furthermore, an extensive literature review indicates that not every exposure to an infectious agent will necessarily cause a recipient infection. The results of this study suggest a hypothesis that in an enclosed and mechanically ventilated room (e.g., an isolation room), the dominant factor that affects the transmission and control of contaminants is the path between the contaminant source and exhaust. Contaminants are better controlled when this path is uninterrupted by an air stream. This study illustrates that the ventilation system design, i.e., when it conforms with the hypothesized path principle, may be a more important factor than flow rate (i.e., ACH). A secondary factor includes the distance from the contaminant source. This study provides evidence and supports previous studies that moving away from the patient generally reduces the infection risk in a transient (coughing) situation, although the effect is more pronounced under higher flow rate. It is noted that future research is needed to determine the exact mode of transmission for most recently identified organisms.","output":"Role of air changes per hour (ACH) in possible transmission of airborne infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in China has become an urgent health and economic challenge.

In addition, SIT concentration (mM, X1), MEL concentration (mM, X2), and pH (X3) were selected as the critical factors. Particle size (nm, Y1) and zeta potential (mV, Y2) were assessed as responses. Characterization of the optimized formula for Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) was carried out. The optimized formula showed particle size and zeta potential values of 77.42 nm and 27.67 mV, respectively. When compared with SIT and MEL, the combination of SIT-MEL complex has shown anti-viral potential against isolate of SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 values of 8.439 M with significant improvement (p < 0.001). In addition, the complex showed IC50 in vitro 3CL-protease inhibition with IC50 7.216 M.

The in vitro database, adverse effects, and potential toxicities of these drugs are reviewed regarding their feasibility of clinical prescription for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. To obtain convincing recommendations, we referred to opinions from the US National Institute of Health regarding drugs repurposed for COVID-19 therapy. EXPERT OPINION: Although strong evidence of well-designed randomized controlled studies regarding COVID-19 therapy is presently lacking, remdesivir, teicoplanin, hydroxychloroquine (not in combination with azithromycin), and ivermectin might be effective antiviral drugs and are deemed promising candidates for controlling SARS-CoV-2. In addition, tocilizumab might be considered as the supplementary treatment for COVID-19 patients with cytokine release syndrome.

OBJECTIVES Assess whether patients without documented vascular risk factors or pre-existent cardiovascular disease have a higher relative risk of cancer 12 months after arterial thrombotic events (ATE), compared to unselected patients. PATIENTS/METHODS A population-based cohort study of Clalit Health Services (CHS) database included CHS members 25 years without prior cancer or ATE (n=2804584). An iterative matching process selected 10 potential controls chronologically for each consecutive exposed, age- and sex-matched (actual controls drawn 1:1 from a lot). Study exposure, ATE, was defined as ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction or systemic arterial thromboembolism during hospitalization. The outcome was newly-diagnosed cancer within 12 months, based on Israeli national cancer registry. Cox proportional hazards multivariate regression calculated hazard ratio (HR) for outcomes, adjusted for cancer risk factors. Analysis also performed for 3 subgroups: age50 years; no cardiovascular risk factors; no prior cardiovascular disease. RESULTS The full ATE and matched control cohorts included 43108 patients. The 12-month cumulative incidence of cancer (95% confidence interval) was 0.020 (0.019-0.022) in the ATE cohort and 0.012 (0.011-0.013) in controls, corresponding to an adjusted HR of 1.665 (1.489-1.862). The relative risk of cancer was high in all subgroups up to a HR of 3.754 (1.912-7.372) in patients without cardiovascular risk factors.

However, whether AKI is diagnosed in all the patients and the correlation between the outcomes of COVID-19 are not well understood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cohort study was conducted from February 4, 2020 to April 16, 2020 in Wuhan, China. All consecutive inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. AKI was defined according to the KDIGO 2012 criteria. The outcomes of patients with and without AKI and whether AKI was or was not recognized were compared. RESULTS: A total of 107 elderly patients were included in the final analysis. The median age was 70 (64C78) years, and 69 (64.5%) were men. Overall, 48 of 107 patients (44.9%) developed AKI during hospitalization. Meanwhile, 22 (45.8%) cases with AKI was not recognized (missed diagnosis) in this cohort. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed that survival was better in the non-AKI group than in the AKI group (log-rank, all P < 0.001); in the subgroups of the patients with AKI, the hospital survival rate decreased when AKI was not recognized. The survival of patients with recognized AKI was better than that of patients with unrecognized AKI (log-rank, all P < 0.001). According to the multivariate regression analysis, the independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality were AKI (recognized AKI vs non-AKI: HR = 2.413; 95% CI = 1.092C5.333; P = 0.030 and unrecognized AKI vs non-AKI: HR = 4.590; 95% CI = 2.070C10.175; P <0.001), C-reactive protein level (HR = 1.004; 95% CI = 1.000C1.008; P = 0.030), lactate level (HR = 1.236; 95% CI = 1.098C1.391; P < 0.001), and disease classification (critical vs severe: HR = 0.019; 95% CI = 1.347C26.396; P = 5.963).

The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly catastrophic for residential carceral and rehabilitation facilities that are high-risk settings for transmission of contagious diseases. Centralized provider-based viral testing employing conventional diagnostic techniques is labor-intensive and time consuming. There is a marked unmet need for quick, inexpensive, and simple viral testing strategies. We hypothesized that rehabilitation residents could successfully test themselves employing inexpensive, disposable, antigen-based lateral-flow tests and would be willing to self-isolate and self-report to health authorities if positive.Methods: We evaluated self-testing among 50 rehabilitation residents ages 18 and older in Pomona, California, where participants self-administered an influenza lateral-flow diagnostic test (without specimen collection) with the goal of appropriately observing a control line and completed two brief written surveys, one before self-administering the lateral-flow test and one after, to determine the overall feasibility of viral self-testing and to characterize attitudes comparing self-testing and provider-based testing.Findings: A total of 50 rehabilitation residents were enrolled in this study and all 50 conducted a lateral-flow test and answered the provided surveys. Among the participants, 96% (48 of 50) achieved a positive-control line from their lateral-flow test. Most participants, 83% (34 of 41) indicated that they would prefer to perform their own rapid test instead of having a health care provider administer the test. Notably, 98% (49 of 50) indicated that they would self-isolate if the lateral-flow test returned a positive indicator suggesting the presence of a viral infection and 96% (48 of 50) would report positive results to their corresponding public health department.Interpretation: Residents in a residential rehabilitation center were widely able to successfully self-administer standard lateral-flow antigen-based rapid diagnostic kits. Self-testing was strongly preferred over tests administered by a healthcare provider. Reassuringly, almost every resident indicated that they would report any positive test result to the health department and self-isolate accordingly. Self-testing offers a promising adjunct to centralized testing, potentially better enabling swift and effective management of life-threatening infectious outbreaks among those living in high-risk congregate living settings.Funding: This study was funded by a grant awarded to Benjamin Sievers from the Pitzer College Racial Justice Initiative.Declaration of Interest: None to declare.

In this study, we investigated ampicillin's ability, which is commonly used in dairy cattle disease treatment, to induce Cronobacter sakazakii into the VBNC state. After treatment with ampicillin, the counts of culturable cells decreased from 108 CFU/mL to an undetected level 7-30 days post-treatment. Meanwhile, viable cells were still approximately 104-105 cells/mL, and could be resuscitated under appropriate conditions. Fluorescence microscopy showed that VBNC cell maintained apparent cellular integrity, but that the morphology of VBNC cells differed visibly from that of normal cells. Moreover, the respiratory chain activity of VBNC cells were confirmed by flow cytometry (FCM) analysis, suggesting that cells in a VBNC state were physiologically active. Finally, transcriptomics analysis and real-time PCR (qPCR) validation were used to explore the underlying mechanisms of VBNC cell formation.

DESIGN: a population-based retrospective cohort study on prospectively collected data was conducted. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the cohort included all swab positive cases aged 40 years older (No. 18,286) among residents in the territory of the Milan's Agency for Health Protection (ATS-MI) up to 27.04.2020. Data on comorbidities were obtained from the ATS administrative database of chronic conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: to predict 30-day mortality risk, a multivariable logistic regression model, including age, gender, and the selected conditions, was developed following the TRIPOD guidelines. Discrimination and calibration of the model were assessed. RESULTS: after age and gender, the most important predictors of 30-day mortality were diabetes, tumour in first-line treatment, chronic heart failure, and complicated diabetes. The bootstrap-validated c-index was 0.78, which suggests that this model is useful in predicting death after COVID-19 infection in swab positive cases.

Other than age at the time of infection, the causes and correlates of severe illness in infants lacking known risk factors are poorly defined. We recruited a cohort of confirmed RSV-infected infants and simultaneously assayed the presence of resident airway microbiota and the molecular status of their airways using a novel method. Rigorous statistical analyses identified a molecular airway gene expression signature of severe illness dominated by excessive chemokine expression. Global 16S rRNA sequencing confirmed an association between H. influenzae and clinical severity. Interestingly, adjusting for H. influenzae in our gene expression analysis revealed an association between severity and airway lymphocyte accumulation. Exploring the relationship between airway gene expression and the time of onset of clinical symptoms revealed a robust, acute activation of interferon (IFN) signaling, which was absent in subjects with severe illness. Finally, we explored the relationship between IFN activity, airway gene expression and productive RSV infection using a novel in vitro model of bona fide pediatric human airway epithelial cells. Interestingly, blocking IFN signaling, but not IFN ligand production, in these cells leads to increased viral infection. Our data reveal that acute airway interferon responses are physiologically relevant in the context of infant RSV infection and may be a target for therapeutic intervention. Additionally, the airway gene expression signature we define may be useful as a biomarker for efficacy of intervention responses.","output":"Insufficiency in airway interferon activation defines clinical severity to infant RSV infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus described for the first time in China in December 2019. This virus can cause a disease that ranges in spectrum from asymptomatic to severe respiratory disease with multiorgan failure, and the most severe cases are associated with some comorbidities and patient age. However, there are patients who do not have those risk factors who still develop serious disease. In this study, we identified the presence of other respiratory viruses in positive cases of COVID-19 in Mexico to determine if any coinfections were correlated with more severe manifestations of COVID-19. We analysed 103 confirmed cases of COVID-19 using RT-qPCR for the detection of 16 other respiratory viruses.Of the cases analysed, 14 (13.6%) were cases of coinfection, and 92% of them never required hospitalization, even when comorbidities and advanced age were involved. There were not significant differences between the presence of comorbidities and the mean ages of the groups. These results suggest that coinfection is not related to more severe COVID-19 and that, depending on the virus involved, it could even lead to a better prognosis. We believe that our findings may lay the groundwork for new studies aimed at determining the biological mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs and for proposing corresponding strategies to limit the progression to severe cases of COVID-19.","output":"Weak association of coinfection by SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses with severe cases and death"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Myocardial injury is frequently detected in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) patients.

The purpose of this study is to test a computer-based intervention administered according to two different modalities (at the hospital and at home) using the tools CoRe and HomeCoRe, respectively, in participants with Mild or Major Neurocognitive Disorders. Methods: Non-inferiority, single-blind randomized controlled trial where 40 participants with Mild or Major Neurocognitive Disorders will be assigned to the intervention group who will receive cognitive telerehabilitation through HomeCoRe or to the control group who will receive in-person cognitive intervention through CoRe, with the therapist administering the same computer-based exercises. The rehabilitative program will last 6 weeks, with 3 sessions/week, each lasting ~45 min. All the participants will be evaluated on an exhaustive neuropsychological battery before (T0) and after (T1) the intervention; follow-up visits will be scheduled after 6 (T2) and 12 months (T3).

The aim of the present report is to describe a population with elevated levels of high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) and report on their management during the pandemic of COVID-19. Methods In this retrospective cohort, we collected data from all patients with hs-cTnT levels of >50 ng/mL admitted to Fribourg Hospital between February 15, 2020, and April 15, 2020. The primary diagnosis for troponin elevation was recorded. Echocardiographic, electrocardiographic, and coronary angiographic data were analyzed for signs of myocardial ischemia, infarction, or other cardiomyopathies. In-hospital follow-up was performed for deaths from all causes and for cardiac deaths. Propensity score matching was used in a subgroup analysis to match COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients ( n = 21 per group). Results Overall, 215 patients with high hs-cTnT levels were enrolled. The median age was 75 [65C83] years and 30% were women. 21 patients (10%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Of these, acute myocardial injury related to COVID-19 was the most commonly described cardiovascular manifestation during the pandemic peak. Median troponin values were not different between COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients (94 vs. 137, p = 0.14). The number of cardiological examinations was globally low (echocardiography 51% and coronary angiography 52%) in the context of the pandemic. Patients in the COVID-19 group underwent significantly less echocardiographic examinations (19 vs. 55%, p  0.01) and coronary angiographies (5 vs. 58%, p  0.01) than non-COVID-19 patients.

Anxiety is associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) nonadherence. It is crucial to understand the burden of anxiety and its sources among Asian Indian PLHIV during the COVID pandemic, but data are limited. METHODS: During the first month of government mandated lockdown, we administered an anxiety assessment via telephone among PLHIV registered for care at a publicly funded antiretroviral therapy (ART) center in Pune, India. Generalized anxiety was defined as GAD-7 score &#8805; 10. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were compared by anxiety status (GAD-7 score &#8805; 10 vs GAD-7 score < 10). Qualitative responses to an open-ended question about causes of concern were evaluated using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Among 167 PLHIV, median age was 44 years (IQR 40-50); the majority were cisgender women (60%) and had a monthly family income < 200 USD (81%). Prior history of tuberculosis and other comorbidities were observed in 38 and 27%, respectively. Overall, prevalence of generalized anxiety was 25% (n = 41). PLHIV with GAD-7 score &#8805; 10 had fewer remaining doses of ART than those with lower GAD-7 scores (p = 0.05). Thematic analysis indicated that concerns were both health related and unrelated, and stated temporally. Present concerns were often also projected as future concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of anxiety was high during COVID lockdown in our population of socioeconomically disadvantaged PLHIV in Pune and appeared to be influenced by concerns about ART availability. The burden of anxiety among PLHIV will likely increase with the worsening pandemic in India, as sources of anxiety are expected to persist.

However, more time at home may have resulted in some positive habits including an increase in cooking. The aim of this review was to assess dietary changes during the first lockdown. Themes and patterns were considered and associations with other lifestyle factors were assessed. Methods: Between June and July 2020, the PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases were searched, and results were screened for eligibility based on title, abstract, and full text. The inclusion criteria of this search included: papers published (or in pre-print) in the year 2020; studies that investigated the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on diet; papers published in English. Exclusion criteria were as follows: papers examining dietary changes in those following a structured diet based on diagnosed conditions or dietetic advice; literature, systematic, or narrative studies reviewing previous research. Researchers agreed on the study characteristics for extraction from final papers. Results: Four thousand three hundred and twenty-two studies were originally considered with 23 final full-text papers included. Four themes were identified: dietary patterns, dietary habits (favorable), dietary habits (unfavorable), and other (includes physical activity levels, weight gain). A total of 10 studies reported an increase in the number of snacks consumed, while six studies found that participants increased their meal number and frequency during quarantine. Eleven studies reported favorable changes in dietary habits with an increase in fresh produce and home cooking and reductions in comfort food and alcohol consumption. However, nine studies found a reduction in fresh produce, with a further six reporting an increase in comfort foods including sweets, fried food, snack foods, and processed foods. Two studies reported an increase in alcohol consumption. In eight studies participants reported weight gain with seven studies reporting a reduction in physical exercise. Conclusion: The effect of COVID-19 lockdown both negatively and positively impacted dietary practices throughout Europe and globally, and negative diet habits were associated with other poor lifestyle outcomes including weight gain, mental health issues, and limited physical activity.

AIM: We estimate the generation interval, serial interval, proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission and effective reproduction number of COVID-19. We illustrate that reproduction numbers calculated based on serial interval estimates can be biased. METHODS: We used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates, we obtained the serial interval, proportions of pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers. RESULTS: The mean generation interval was 5.20 days (95% credible interval (CrI): 3.78C6.78) for Singapore and 3.95 days (95% CrI: 3.01C4.91) for Tianjin. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48% (95% CrI: 32C67) for Singapore and 62% (95% CrI: 50C76) for Tianjin. Reproduction number estimates based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution. Sensitivity analyses showed that estimating these quantities from outbreak data requires detailed contact tracing information. CONCLUSION: High estimates of the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission imply that case finding and contact tracing need to be supplemented by physical distancing measures in order to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Notably, quarantine and other containment measures were already in place at the time of data collection, which may inflate the proportion of infections from pre-symptomatic individuals.","output":"Estimating the generation interval for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) based on symptom onset data, March 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In response to COVID-19, the UK National Health Service (NHS) extended influenza vaccination in 50-to 64-year-olds from at-risk only to all in this age group for the 2020/21 season. The objective of this research is to determine the cost-effectiveness of continuing to vaccinate all with a quadrivalent cell-based vaccine (QIVc) compared to returning to an at-risk only policy after the pandemic resolves. Methods: A dynamic transmission model, calibrated to match infection data from the UK, was used to estimate the clinical and economic impact of vaccination across 10 influenza seasons. The base case effectiveness of QIVc was 63.9% and the list price was GBP 9.94. Results: Vaccinating 50% of all 50-to 64-year-olds with QIVc reduced the average annual number of clinical infections (?682,000), hospitalizations (?5800) and deaths (?740) in the UK. The base case incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained (ICER) of all compared to at-risk only was GBP6000 (NHS perspective). When the cost of lost productivity was considered, vaccinating all 50-to 64-year-olds with QIVc became cost-saving. Conclusion: Vaccinating all 50-to 64-year-olds with QIVc is likely to be cost-effective. The NHS should consider continuing this policy in future seasons. ? 2021 by the authors.

In Italy, as elsewhere, this pandemic influenza struck in three successive and close waves with incredible speed in a very short time. The virus first arrived in a few Italian regions and gripped the country in an epidemic clamp. When the flu hit Ferrara, the health authorities began to claim that it was no more or less like the same disease that Ferrara had also experienced in the 19th century, although the population was not very willing to believe them. Moreover, the control measures were considered by all to be extremely mild, varying only the opening hours of cinemas and pharmacies and forbidding spitting on the ground; there was no disinfection of stores and streets and the dead were left at home for three days, unlike in larger cities. In 1918-19, Ferrara did much to contain the devastating effects of the war, especially in terms of saving lives. The largest Red Cross unit in Italy, later called Ospedale Nuovo, was built. Moreover, since Ferrara was the first hospital evacuation zone, it was necessary to build other hospitals in the city's schools in addition to the already existing ones, including the famous Ospedale Militare Neurologico di Villa Seminario, which was the first Italian neurological hospital of the Great War for veterans of the front line, intended for the specialised treatment of nervous disorders and psychosis caused by the war or by bombs. We have extracted the cases of death from the Register of Deaths of the Municipality of Ferrara. During the period January 1918 - June 1919, in addition to the number of deaths due to influenza, grippe or Spanish flu we also considered influenza-related complications affecting mortality and identified seven main groups of diseases by grouping them according to morbid forms and anatomical location. According to these criteria, 1,059 deaths were attributable to influenza or related causes during January-December 1918. This partly reflects the excess of deaths in the year 1918 of 1,279 over the average for the years 1916-1919, and 1920. The largest number of deaths was attributable to bronchopneumonia and pneumonia. However, an increase in mortality from other infectious diseases such as typhoid ileus, tuberculosis, malaria and smallpox was observed during the same period until January 2019, making up the shortfall in the total number of deaths recorded.","output":"Epidemiological and clinical features of Spanish flu in the city of Ferrara and in Italy.

Infectious diseases may be asymptomatic in some individuals but may lead to disastrous effects in others. Despite the advances in medicine, infectious diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide, especially in low-income countries. With the advent of mathematical tools, scientists are now able to better predict epidemics, understand the specificity of each pathogen, and identify potential targets for drug development. Artificial intelligence and its components have been widely publicized for their ability to better diagnose certain types of cancer from imaging data.

Methods: A web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs of the Punjab province of Pakistan. The generalized anxiety scale (GAD-7), patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Brief-COPE were used to assess anxiety, depression and coping strategies of the respondents. Results: The mean age of respondents (N = 398) was 28.67 {+/-} 4.15 years, with majority of medical doctors (52%). The prevalence of anxiety and depression were 21.4% and 21.9%, respectively.

To fight this threat, actors from both research and industry are constantly innovating to bring concrete solutions to improve security and malware protection. Traditional solutions such as signature-based anti viruses have shown their limits in front of massive proliferation of new malware, which are most often only variants specifically designed to bypass signature-based detection. Accordingly, it paves the way to the emergence of new approaches based on Machine Learning (ML) technics to boost the detection of unknown malware variants. Unfortunately, these solutions are most often underexploited due to the time and resource costs required to adequately fine tune machine learning algorithms. In reality, in the Android community, state-of-the-art studies do not focus on model training, and most often go through an empirical study with a manual process to choose the learning strategy, and/or use default values as parameters to configure ML algorithms. However, in the ML domain, it is well known admitted that to solve efficiently a ML problem, the tunability of hyper-parameters is of the utmost importance. Nevertheless, as soon as the targeted ML problem involves a massive amount of data, there is a strong tension between feasibility of exploring all combinations and accuracy.

Numerous ways are offered to detect COVID-19 such as swab test, CDC and RT-PCR tests. All of them can detect corona virus in different ways but they are not recommended by the reason of their limited availability, inaccurate results, high false-negative rate predicates, high cost and time consuming. Hence, medical radiography and Computer Tomography (CT) images were suggested as the next best alternative of RT -PCR and other tests for detecting Covid-19 cases. Recent studies found that patients with COVID-19 cases are present abnormalities in chest X-Ray images. Motivated by this, many researchers propose deep learning systems for COVID-19 detection. Although, these developed AI systems have shown quite promising results in terms of accuracy, they are closed source and unavailable to the research community. Therefore, in the present work, we introduced a deep convolutional neural network design (SAARSNet) designed to detect COVID-19 cases from chest X-Ray images. 1292 X-Ray images have been used to train and test the proposed model. the images have been collected from two open-source datasets. The input images are progressively resized into (220 by 150 by 3) in order to decrease the training time of the system and improve the performance of the SAARSNet architecture.

We also used the confusion metrics for evaluating the performance of SAARSNet CNN in an attempt to measure the true and false identifications of the classes from the tested images. With the proposed architecture promising results has been achieved in all of the three different scenarios. Although, there are some misclassified cases of COVID-19, the corresponding performance was best in detecting both Normal and Abnormal cases correctly.

Whether this is seen in re-operative ARS is unclear. We quantify the physiologic parameters of the GEJ at each step of robotic re-operative ARS and compare these to index ARS. METHODS Robotic ARS with hiatal hernia repair was performed on 195 consecutive patients with pathologic reflux utilizing EndoFLIP?, of which 26 previously had ARS. Intra-operative GEJ measurements, including cross-sectional area (CSA), pressure, DI, and high-pressure zone (HPZ) length were collected pre-repair, post-diaphragmatic re-approximation, post-mesh placement, and post-lower-esophageal sphincter (LES) augmentation. RESULTS Both cohorts were similar by sex and BMI and underwent similar procedures. The re-operative cohort was older (60.6  15.3 vs. 52.7  16.2 years, p = 0.03), had more frequent pre-operative dysphagia (69.2% vs. 42.6%, p = 0.01) and esophageal dysmotility on barium swallow (75.0% vs. 35.0%, p < 0.001) but lower rates of hiatal hernia on endoscopy (30.8% vs. 68.7%, p < 0.001) compared to index procedures. Among the re-operative cohort, the CSA decreased by 34 (IQR - 80, - 15) mm2 and DI 1.1 (IQR - 2.4, - 0.6) mm2/mmHg (both p < 0.001). Pressure increased by 11.2 (IQR 4.7, 14.9) mmHg and HPZ by 1.5 (1,2) cm (both p < 0.001). These changes were similar to those seen in index ARS.

Transplant recipients are vulnerable due to comorbidities and immunosuppressants that render them susceptible to infections. The information on COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients remains limited to small case series. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted, and 12 case series totalling 204 kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 were identified. Data were extracted, pooled and analysed. RESULTS: Most patients (74%) were men. The most frequent symptoms were fever (76%), cough (64%) and dyspnoea (43%). At admission, over 70% of the patients had abnormal radiological findings. Leukocyte counts were in the lower normal range. C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer were consistently increased. Treatments included lowering immunosuppression, hydroxychloroquine, antivirals, tocilizumab and intravenous immunoglobulins. Thirty-one percent of the patients were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), and 16% required intubation. The overall mortality was 21.2%. Patients who died were significantly older than those who survived (61  12 vs. 51  15, p < .01).

The most urgent need is to find effective treatments. We sought to determine whether hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) application may reduce the death risk of critically ill COVID-19 patients. In this retrospective study, we included 550 critically ill COVID-19 patients who need mechanical ventilation in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, from February 1, 2020 to April 4, 2020. All 550 patients received comparable basic treatments including antiviral drugs and antibiotics, and 48 of them were treated with oral HCQ treatment (200 mg twice a day for 7-10 days) in addition to the basic treatments. Primary endpoint is fatality of patients, and inflammatory cytokine levels were compared between HCQ and non-hydroxychloroquine (NHCQ) treatments. We found that fatalities are 18.8% (9/48) in HCQ group, which is significantly lower than 47.4% (238/502) in the NHCQ group (P<0.001). The time of hospital stay before patient death is 15 (10-21) days and 8 (4-14) days for the HCQ and NHCQ groups, respectively (P<0.05). The levels of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 were significantly reduced from 22.2 (8.3-118.9) pg mL-1 at the beginning of the treatment to 5.2 (3.0-23.4) pg mL-1 (P<0.05) at the end of the treatment in the HCQ group but there is no change in the NHCQ group. These data demonstrate that addition of HCQ on top of the basic treatments is highly effective in reducing the fatality of critically ill patients of COVID-19 through attenuation of inflammatory cytokine storm.

OBJECTIVE: To assess demographics, comorbid conditions, and clinical factors associated with critical illness and mortality among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at a public hospital in New York City (NYC) during the first month of the COVID-19 outbreak. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to NYC Health + Hospitals / Bellevue Hospital from March 9th to April 8th, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 337 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period. Primary analyses were conducted among those requiring supplemental oxygen (n = 270); half of these patients (135) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). A majority were male (67.4%) and the median age was 58 years. Approximately one-third (32.6%) of hypoxic patients managed outside the ICU required non-rebreather or non-invasive ventilation. Requirement of renal replacement therapy occurred in 42.3% of ICU patients without baseline end-stage renal disease. Overall, 30-day mortality among hypoxic patients was 28.9% (53.3% in the ICU, 4.4% outside the ICU). In adjusted analyses, risk factors associated with mortality included dementia (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 2.11 95%CI 1.50-2.96), age 65 or older (aRR 1.97, 95%CI 1.31-2.95), obesity (aRR 1.37, 95%CI 1.07-1.74), and male sex (aRR 1.32, 95%CI 1.04-1.70).

It has a negative impact on social union and access to public administrations and institutions that house people's socially stimulating groups of individuals. The suspension or reduction of activities in temples, childcare centers, schools, and social insurance administrations, as well as the shifting of needs in healthcare administrations to activities, focused on patients with respiratory side effects and cases associated and confirmed with COVID-19, endangers the quest for assistance, assurance, and alternatives. Each of these factors accentuates the consistency and disarray of previous conditions of viciousness. The length of time spent in touch with the attacker is a critical element at the social level. In addition, due to the reduction in the casualty's social contact with family members, the chances of the woman establishing and strengthening a socially supportive network of individuals, seeking assistance, and breaking free from the vicious cycle are reduced. Day by day, continuous interaction, especially in low-wage families living in cramped quarters with few rooms and a lot of traffic, reduces the chances for women to record demonstrations in a safe manner, discouraging them from making this option.

METHODS: The survey was conducted in two phases using a clustered sampling scheme. The first phase spanned May 1-3 and involved 709 participants. The second phase spanned June 11-14, 2020, and involved 646 participants. RESULTS: During the first phase, RT-PCR performed on nasopharyngeal swabs was positive at 0.14%. The serological tests were positive in 1.27% of the patients during the first phase and 2.79% during the second phase. People living in households with more than five members had a prevalence of 10.83% (95%CI: 1.58-74.27) higher than those living alone or with someone other. Considering the proportion of the positive serological test results with sex and age adjustments, approximately 2.37% (95%CI: 1.32-3.42) of the population had been cumulatively infected by mid-June 2020, which is equivalent to 16,670 people (95%CI: 9,267-24,074). Considering that 68 deaths from the disease in the residents of the city had been confirmed as at the date of the second phase of the survey, the infection fatality rate was estimated to be 0.41% (95%CI: 0.28-0.73).

Still, the impact of the preadmission dose on diuretic efficiency (DE) and prognosis in acute HF is not fully known. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted an observational and prospective study. All patients admitted for acute HF treated with intravenous diuretic and at least one criterion of congestion on admission were evaluated. Decongestion [physical examination, hemoconcentration, N\\\\terminal pro\\\\brain natriuretic peptide (NT\\\\proBNP) change, and lung ultrasound], DE (weight loss and urine output per unit of 40 mg furosemide), and urinary sodium were monitored on the fifth day of admission. DE was dichotomized into highClow based on the median value. A multivariate Cox regression analysis was conducted to find predictors of HF readmission or mortality. A total of 105 patients were included between July 2017 and July 2019. Mean age was 74.5  12.0 years, 64.8% were male, 33.3% had de novo HF, and mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 46  17%. Median follow\\\\up was 26 [15C35] months. Low DE based on weight loss was associated with a higher previous dose of furosemide (odds ratio [OR] 1.01 [1.00C1.02]), thiazide treatment before admission (OR 9.37 [2.19C40.14]), and lower diastolic blood pressure (OR 0.95 [0.91C0.98]) in the multivariate regression model. Only previous dose of furosemide (OR 1.01 [1.00C1.02]) and haemoglobin at admission (OR 0.76 [0.58C0.99]) were associated with low DE based on urine output in the multivariate analysis. The correlation between the previous dose of furosemide and DE based on weight loss was poor (r = ?0.12; P = 0.209) and with DE based on urine output was weak to moderate (r = ?0.33; P < 0.001). Low DE based on weight loss and urine output was associated with lesser decongestion measured by NT\\\\proBNP (P = 0.011; P = 0.007), hemoconcentration (P = 0.006; P = 0.044), and lung ultrasound (P = 0.034; P = 0.029), but not by physical examination (P = 0.506; P = 0.560). Survival and event\\\\free survival in acute decompensated HF (ADHF) were lower than in de novo HF; a preadmission dose of furosemide > 80 mg in ADHF identified patients with particularly poor prognosis (log\\\\rank < 0.001).

Many scientific publications were retrieved from the Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases via searching the word \\"propolis\\". The different extraction procedures, key biologically active compounds, biological properties, and therapeutic potential of propolis were analyzed. It was concluded that propolis possesses a variety of biological properties because of a very complex chemical composition that mainly depends on the plant species visited by bees and species of bees. Numerous studies found versatile pharmacological activities of propolis: antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, etc. In this review, the composition and biological activities of propolis are presented from a point of view of the origin and standardization of propolis for the purpose of the development of new pharmaceutical products on its base. It was revealed that some types of propolis, especially European propolis, contain flavonoids and phenolic acids, which could be markers for the standardization and quality evaluation of propolis and its preparations. One more focus of this paper was the overview of microorganisms sensitivity to propolis for further development of antimicrobial and antioxidant products for the treatment of various infectious diseases with an emphasis on the illnesses of the oral cavity. It was established that the antimicrobial activity of different types of propolis is quite significant, especially to Gram-negative bacteria and lipophilic viruses. The present study could be also of interest to the pharmaceutical industry as a review for the appropriate design of standardized propolis preparations such as mouthwashes, toothpastes, oral drops, sprays, creams, ointments, suppositories, tablets, and capsules, etc. Moreover, propolis could be regarded as a source for the isolation of biologically active substances. Furthermore, this review can facilitate partially overcoming the problem of the standardization of propolis preparations, which is a principal obstacle to the broader use of propolis in the pharmaceutical industry. Finally, this study could be of interest in the area of the food industry for the development of nutritionally well-balanced products.

Materials & methods: The study employed a quantitative cross-sectional online survey research design. Purposive sampling was used with an attempt to represent the entire nurses (i.e. nursing officers, nurse administrators and nursing teachers) and nursing students' group of India. The survey link including the questionnaires was shared to their email ID and they were invited to participate in the study. Data were collected using Psychological Preparedness for Disaster Threat Scale (PPDTS)-Modified, General Self Efficacy (GSE) Scale, Optimism Scale and Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRS). Totally 685 responses were received and 676 forms were completed which were analyzed using SPSS software (version 24). Results: The mean age of the subjects was 31.72+/-9.58 years. Around 20% of the subjects previously had some kind of psychological training and 4% of the subjects had taken care of persons with COVID-19. Findings revealed that mean score for PPDTS, GSE, BRCS and Optimism was 73.44+/-10.82, 33.19+/-5.23, 16.79+/-2.73 and 9.61+/-2.26 respectively indicating that the subjects had moderate level of psychological preparedness, self-efficacy and resilience but higher level of optimism. Psychological preparedness, self-efficacy, optimism and resilience were positively correlated to each other. Self- efficacy, optimism, and resilience emerged as predictors of psychological preparedness. Conclusion: The findings suggested that self-efficacy, optimism and resilience can be considered as predictors for psychological preparedness in pandemic management. Appropriate training could influence self-efficacy while programs addressing resilience and coping may strengthen psychological preparedness which can help in further management of ongoing pandemic.

Although the therapeutic effect of MSCs on sepsis is already known, researchers have not determined whether the cells from different sources require different therapeutic schedules or exert different curative effects. We assessed the biofunction of the administration of AF-MSCs and UC-MSCs in rats with caecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis. METHODS: CLP was used to establish a disease model of sepsis in rats, and intravenous tail vein administration of AF-MSCs and UC-MSCs was performed to treat sepsis at 6 h after CLP. Two phases of animal experiments were implemented using MSCs harvested in saline with or without filtration. The curative effect was measured by determining the survival rate. Further effects were assessed by measuring proinflammatory cytokine levels, the plasma coagulation index, tissue histology and the pathology of the lung, liver and kidney. RESULTS: We generated rats with medium-grade sepsis with a 30C40% survival rate to study the curative effects of AF-MSCs and UC-MSCs. MSCs reversed CLP-induced changes in proinflammatory cytokine levels and coagulation activation. MSCs ameliorated CLP-induced histological and pathological changes in the lung, liver and kidney. AF-MSCs and UC-MSCs functioned differently in different tissues; UC-MSCs performed well in reducing the upregulation of inflammatory cytokine levels in the lungs and inhibiting the inflammatory cell infiltration into the liver capsule, while AF-MSCs performed well in inhibiting cell death in the kidneys and reducing the plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level, an indicator of renal function.

The second glycoprotein of BCV, HE, which has been thought previously to be responsible for the hemagglutinating activity of BCV, is a less efficient hemagglutinin; it agglutinates mouse and rat erythrocytes, but in contrast to S protein, it is unable to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes, which contain a lower level of Neu5,9Ac2 on their surface. S protein is proposed to be responsible for the primary attachment of virus to cell surface. S protein is proposed to be responsible for the primary attachement of virus to cell surface receptors. The potential of S protein as a probe for the detection of Neu5,9Ac2-containing glycoconjugates is demonstrated.","output":"The S protein of bovine coronavirus is a hemagglutinin recognizing 9-O-acetylated sialic acid as a receptor determinant."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Critical shortages of personal protective equipment, especially N95 respirators, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to be a source of concern. Novel methods of N95 filtering face-piece respirator decontamination that can be scaled-up for in-hospital use can help address this concern and keep healthcare workers (HCWs) safe. METHODS: A multidisciplinary pragmatic study was conducted to evaluate the use of an ultrasonic room high-level disinfection system (HLDS) that generates aerosolized peracetic acid (PAA) and hydrogen peroxide for decontamination of large numbers of N95 respirators. A cycle duration that consistently achieved disinfection of N95 respirators (defined as &#8805;6 log10 reductions in bacteriophage MS2 and Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores inoculated onto respirators) was identified. The treated masks were assessed for changes to their hydrophobicity, material structure, strap elasticity, and filtration efficiency. PAA and hydrogen peroxide off-gassing from treated masks were also assessed. RESULTS: The PAA room HLDS was effective for disinfection of bacteriophage MS2 and G. stearothermophilus spores on respirators in a 2,447 cubic-foot (69.6 cubic-meter) room with an aerosol deployment time of 16 minutes and a dwell time of 32 minutes. The total cycle time was 1 hour and 16 minutes. After 5 treatment cycles, no adverse effects were detected on filtration efficiency, structural integrity, or strap elasticity. There was no detectable off-gassing of PAA and hydrogen peroxide from the treated masks at 20 and 60 minutes after the disinfection cycle, respectively.

SARS-CoV (2003) induces Cox-2 catalyzing the synthesis, from highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA), of eicosanoids and docosanoids that mediate both inflammation and thrombosis. HUFA balance between arachidonic acid (AA) and other HUFA is a likely determinant of net signaling to induce a healthy or runaway physiological response. AA levels are determined by non-protein coding regulatory polymorphisms that mostly affect the expression of FADS1, located in the FADS gene cluster on chromosome 11. Major and minor haplotypes in Europeans, and a specific functional insertion-deletion (Indel), rs66698963, consistently show major differences in circulating AA (>50%) and in the balance between AA and other HUFA (47-84%) in free living humans; the indel is evolutionarily selective, probably based on diet. The pattern of fatty acid responses is fully consistent with specific genetic modulation of desaturation at the FADS1-mediated 20:320:4 step. Well established principles of net tissue HUFA levels indicate that the high linoleic acid and low alpha-linoleic acid in populations drive the net balance of HUFA for any individual. We predict that fast desaturators (insertion allele at rs66698963; major haplotype in Europeans) are predisposed to higher risk and pathological responses to SARS-CoV-2 could be reduced with high dose omega-3 HUFA.","output":"Polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis pathway and genetics.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has provided guidelines on how to reduce the spread of the virus and one of the most important measures is social distancing. Maintaining a minimum of one meter distance from other people is strongly suggested to reduce the risk of infection. This has created a strong interest in monitoring the social distances either as a safety measure or to study how the measures have affected human behavior and country-wise differences in this. The need for automatic social distance estimation algorithms is evident, but there is no suitable test benchmark for such algorithms. Collecting images with measured ground-truth pair-wise distances between all the people using different camera settings is cumbersome. Furthermore, performance evaluation for social distance estimation algorithms is not straightforward and there is no widely accepted evaluation protocol. In this paper, we provide a dataset of varying images with measured pair-wise social distances under different camera positionings and focal length values. We suggest a performance evaluation protocol and provide a benchmark to easily evaluate social distance estimation algorithms. We also propose a method for automatic social distance estimation. Our method takes advantage of object detection and human pose estimation. It can be applied on any single image as long as focal length and sensor size information are known.

METHODS: This retrospective study included the first 200 patients admitted to a tertiary medical center with COVID-19. The electronic medical records were reviewed at least three weeks after admission. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: 200 patients were included (female sex: 102, African American: 102). The median BMI was 30a?kg/m2. The median age was 64a?years. Hypertension (76%), hyperlipidemia (46.2%), and diabetes (39.5%) were the three most common comorbidities. Fever (86%), cough (76.5%), and dyspnea (68%) were the three most common symptoms. 24% died during hospitalization (BMIa?<a?25a?kg/m2: 31.6%, BMI 25-34a?kg/m2: 17.2%, BMIa?&#8805;a?35a?kg/m2: 34.8%, pa?=a?0.03).

These symptoms are part of a syndrome of prolonged recovery from of COVID-19 which has been termed 'Post-Acute Covid Syndrome (PACS).' Many patients with PACS have been found to have persistent radiographic changes. It is not known whether these radiographic changes represent developing fibrosis, a developing inflammatory process such as organizing pneumonia, or both. In this study we sought to characterize the radiographic changes seen in patients with persistent pulmonary symptoms. Methods: The medical records of patients who presented to the pulmonary clinic at the Comprehensive COVID Center were reviewed. Computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed if obtained greater than 4 weeks after COVID diagnosis. If multiple CT scans were performed, the most recent scan was included. Radiographic abnormalities were categorized as inflammatory (ground-glass opacities or consolidation), fibrotic (traction bronchiectasis, reticulation, or honeycombing), both, or neither. Results: 33 patients were evaluated. During the acute phase of COVID infection 8 (24%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, 7 (21%) required mechanical ventilation, and 12 (36%) were admitted to the floor. 20 (61%) patients had CT that fit inclusion criteria. Of the 20 CT scans reviewed, 13 (65%) were abnormal. 10 (50%) scans demonstrated evidence of fibrosis, 11 (55%) scans demonstrated inflammatory changes, and 8 (40%) scans demonstrated both fibrosis and inflammatory changes. The average time from COVID diagnosis to recovery CT was 131 days. The average time from COVID diagnosis to scans with signs of fibrosis was 151 days, whereas the average time from COVID diagnosis to scans with inflammatory changes was 127 days. Conclusion: The etiology of persistent dyspnea in PACS is an area of active investigation, and radiographic patterns of injury may suggest underlying pathologic processes. Our study demonstrates abnormal radiographic findings, including evidence of both fibrotic and inflammatory parenchymal changes, in the majority of patients seen with PACS followed greater than 4 months after initial diagnosis. It is unknown if the ground glass opacities or consolidative changes are representative of post infectious organizing injury or fibrosis that is below the level of detection of CT resolution.

This study examined associations between average and intraindividual trajectories of stress, sleep duration, and sleep quality in college students before, during, and after transitioning to online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. One hundred and sixty-four first-year college students answered twice-weekly questionnaires assessing stress exposure and perception, sleep duration, and sleep quality from January until May, 2020 (N=4,269 unique observations). Results. Multilevel growth modeling revealed that prior to distance learning, student stress was increasing and sleep duration and quality were decreasing. After transitioning online, students stress exposure and perception trajectories immediately and continuously decreased;sleep quality initially increased but decreased over time;and sleep duration increased but then plateaued for the remainder of the semester. Days with higher stress exposure than typical for that student were associated with lower sleep quality, and both higher stress exposure and perception at the transition were linked with simultaneous lower sleep quality. Specific groups (e.g., females) were identified as at-risk for stress and sleep problems.Conclusion. Although transitioning to remote learning initially alleviated college students stress and improved sleep, these effects plateaued, and greater exposure to academic, financial, and interpersonal stressors predicted worse sleep quality on both daily and average levels. Environmental stressors may particularly dictate sleep quality during times of transition, but adaptations in learning modalities may help mitigate short-term detrimental health outcomes during global emergencies, even during a developmental period with considerable stress vulnerability.

This is particularly important for groups with higher rates of high-risk health conditions, including those aged 65 and over and people with disabilities. OBJECTIVE: We examined trust in information sources and associated adherence to COVID-19 public health recommendations among people with disabilities living in metropolitan, micropolitan, and noncore counties. METHODS: We recruited participants using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and screened for disability status (n = 408). We compared sociodemographic groups with t-tests, Pearson's correlations, and Chi-square, as appropriate. We used linear regression to examine factors associated with trust in information and compliance with CDC recommended COVID-19 practices. RESULTS: Nonmetro respondents had the lowest trust ratings among all demographic groups, and reported significantly less trust in most information sources. Respondents aged 65 and over reported the highest compliance with CDC recommended practices, while those from nonmetro areas reported the lowest. A regression model for adherence to CDC recommended practices was significant (F = 11.87, P &#8804; .001), and explained 33% of the variance. Specifically, increased adherence was associated with being over 65, female, and higher general trust scores.

The article aims to recommend ways of creating a road map for greater sustainability for cruise tourism in the Caribbean, the most tourism-dependent region of the world. Design/methodology/approach The main approach is via the frame of sustainable development pillars. The methodology involved interviews with tourism and cruise industry executives and content analysis of company documents of the Jamaica Tourist Board. Additional primary data were collected from a large cruise line serving the Caribbean market. This exercise was primarily to derive insights on their customer satisfaction data. Primary data were also collected on Covid testing by Baywest Medical in Montego Bay Jamaica. Findings It is clear from the data that the cruise industry in Jamaica has not maximized its potential. This is largely due to the posture of large private cruise lines, which have negotiated solely in favour of their bottom line. It was also found that Jamaica has suffered from its own slow approach to the diversification of its ports and surrounding communities. Additionally, another major finding revealed that the matter of visitors has been inadequately addressed;despite cruise line data indicating a need for safer, more seamless spaces. The major strength identified is the creation of \\"resilient corridors\\" in Jamaica, which have worked well in support of the return of stopover arrivals since 2021. In fact, reported Covid cases related to the corridor have a positivity rate of less than 1% while the national figure is 9.9% for the month of July 2021, according to the Ministry of Health and Wellness. Research limitations/implications This article highlights gaps in the current construct of Caribbean cruising and plots a path to bridging those gaps. The major limitation is that it focuses on the case of Jamaica. Future research should consider other islands in the region and seek to gather data directly from guests when the industry reopens, as opposed to the current approach of guest comments through cruise line documents. Practical implications The practical implications are that policy-makers will be able to apply the recommendations for creating a partnership of equals, greater port and product diversification, visitor safety improvement and optimizing the resilient corridors. This will have a significant economic impact arising from greater flows of guests and extended time spent on shore. Social implications The absence of cruising has had a major impact on the socioeconomics of communities in closeness, proximity to cruising, as evidenced in craft markets and ground transportation. These groupings are considered to be particularly vulnerable. Originality/value This paper is the first to excavate the specific hurdles, which must be tackled in the post-Covid era in Jamaica. It is of particular value to local policy-makers, local businesses and cruise lines serving the Caribbean region.","output":"Cruising on choppy seas: the revitalization of Jamaica as a cruise destination post COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chlorinated compounds such as sphingolipid-based organochlorine compounds are precursors for the formation of 3-monochlororopanediol (3-MCPD) esters in palm oil. This study evaluates the effects of several factors within the palm oil supply chain on the levels of sphingolipid-based organochlorine, which in turn may influence the formation of 3-MCPD esters during refining. These factors include application of inorganic chlorinated fertiliser in the oil palm plantation, bruising and degradation of oil palm fruits after harvest, recycling of steriliser condensate as water for dilution of crude oil during oil palm milling, water washing of palm oil and different refining conditions. It was observed that bruised and degraded oil palm fruits showed higher content of sphingolipid-based organochlorine than control. In addition, recycling steriliser condensate during milling resulted in elevated content of sphingolipid-based organochlorine in palm oil. However, the content of sphingolipid-based organochlorine compounds was reduced by neutralisation, degumming and bleaching steps during refining. Although water washing of crude palm oils (CPO) prior to refining did not reduce the content of sphingolipid-based organochlorine, it did reduce the formation of 3-MCPD esters through the removal of water-soluble chlorinated compounds. It was found that the use of inorganic chlorinated fertiliser in plantations did not increase the content of chlorinated compounds in oil palm fruits and extracted oil, and hence chlorinated fertiliser does not seem to play a role in the formation of 3-MCPD esters in palm oil. Overall, this study concluded that lack of freshness and damage to the fruits during transport to mills, combined with water and oil recycling in mills are the major contributors of chlorinated precursor for 3-MCPD esters formation in palm oil.","output":"Palm oil supply chain factors impacting chlorinated precursors of 3-MCPD esters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in an unprecedented pandemic that has been accompanied by a global health crisis Although the lungs are the main organs involved in COVID-19, systemic disease with a wide range of clinical manifestations also develops in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients One of the major systems affected by this virus is the cardiovascular system The presence of pre-existing cardiovascular disease increases mortality in COVID-19 patients, and cardiovascular injuries, including myocarditis, cardiac rhythm abnormalities, endothelial cell injury, thrombotic events, and myocardial interstitial fibrosis, are observed in some COVID-19 patients The underlying pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated cardiovascular complications is not fully understood, although direct viral infection of myocardium and cytokine storm have been suggested as possible mechanisms of myocarditis In this review, we summarize available data on SARS-CoV-2-related cardiac damage and discuss potential mechanisms of cardiovascular implications of this rapidly spreading virus","output":"Cardiovascular complications of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective.

Regulation of the expression of genes encoding immune checkpoint inhibitors has thus become an increasingly important field of study. Beyond transcription, gene expression is regulated at several post-transcriptional levels including pre-mRNA 3-end processing and mRNA translation. More specifically, the eIF4F translation initiation complex represents an important hub for oncogenic signaling in the etiology of different cancers. The eIF4A RNA helicase component of the eIF4F can be inhibited by the widely characterized small molecule inhibitor silvestrol. Here, we evaluated the effect of eIF4A inhibition with silvestrol on the translation of alternatively polyadenylated mRNAs in melanoma cell lines and activated T cells. We show that silvestrol can selectively inhibit the translation of alternatively polyadenylated isoforms of genes encoding key immune-related proteins. ABSTRACT: Targeting the translation initiation complex eIF4F, which binds the 5 cap of mRNAs, is a promising anti-cancer approach. Silvestrol, a small molecule inhibitor of eIF4A, the RNA helicase component of eIF4F, inhibits the translation of the mRNA encoding the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) transcription factor, which, in turn, reduces the transcription of the gene encoding one of the major immune checkpoint proteins, i.e., programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) in melanoma cells. A large proportion of human genes produce multiple mRNAs differing in their 3-ends through the use of alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites, which, when located in alternative last exons, can generate protein isoforms, as in the STAT1 gene. Here, we provide evidence that the STAT1, but not STAT1 protein isoform generated by APA, is required for silvestrol-dependent inhibition of PD-L1 expression in interferon--treated melanoma cells. Using polysome profiling in activated T cells we find that, beyond STAT1, eIF4A inhibition downregulates the translation of some important immune-related mRNAs, such as the ones encoding TIM-3, LAG-3, IDO1, CD27 or CD137, but with little effect on the ones for BTLA and ADAR-1 and no effect on the ones encoding CTLA-4, PD-1 and CD40-L. We next apply RT-qPCR and 3-seq (RNA-seq focused on mRNA 3 ends) on polysomal RNAs to analyze in a high throughput manner the effect of eIF4A inhibition on the translation of APA isoforms. We identify about 150 genes, including TIM-3, LAG-3, AHNAK and SEMA4D, for which silvestrol differentially inhibits the translation of APA isoforms in T cells. It is therefore crucial to consider 3-end mRNA heterogeneity in the understanding of the anti-tumor activities of eIF4A inhibitors.","output":"Differential Effects on the Translation of Immune-Related Alternatively Polyadenylated mRNAs in Melanoma and T Cells by eIF4A Inhibition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Face detection is to search all the possible regions for faces in images and locate the faces if there are any. Many applications including face recognition, facial expression recognition, face tracking and head-pose estimation assume that both the location and the size of faces are known in the image.

However, with the tremendous increase in images and videos with variations in face scale, appearance, expression, occlusion and pose, traditional face detectors are challenged to detect various\\"in the wild\\"faces. The emergence of deep learning techniques brought remarkable breakthroughs to face detection along with the price of a considerable increase in computation. This paper introduces representative deep learning-based methods and presents a deep and thorough analysis in terms of accuracy and efficiency. We further compare and discuss the popular and challenging datasets and their evaluation metrics. A comprehensive comparison of several successful deep learning-based face detectors is conducted to uncover their efficiency using two metrics: FLOPs and latency.

METHODS: We conducted a nationwide follow-up study. During the periods of March 26 to April 6, 2020 and June 26 to July 2, 2020, we used the internet to survey general workers aged 15 to 59 years in Japan.

The differences in outcomes of permanent and non-permanent workers were analyzed using propensity score analysis. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between unemployment and CES-D scores. RESULTS: We included 2351 subjects in the analysis. Changes in both CES-D scores and utility were not significantly different between the two groups. However, a significant difference was found regarding the rate of unemployment, which was associated with higher CES-D scores.

AIMS: This study sought to investigate patterns and predictors of DSM-5 PTSD in a treatment-seeking sample of African refugees. METHODS: Participants were 122 African refugees and asylum-seekers living in Italy who completed measures of trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify PTSD symptom profiles, and predictors of class membership were identified via multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Among participants, 79.5% had a probable diagnosis of PTSD. Three PTSD classes were identified by LCA: Pervasive (32.0%) with high probabilities of all symptoms, high-Threat (45.9%) with higher probabilities of intrusions and avoidance symptoms, moderate-Avoidance (22.1%) with high probability of thoughts/feelings avoidance. None of the examined variables (legal status, gender, age, education, months spent in Italy, number of traumatic events, employment) significantly predicted class membership with the relevant exception of reception conditions. Specifically, living in large reception centres (over 1,000 people) significantly predicted Pervasive PTSD class membership compared to high/Threat PTSD class and to moderate/Avoidance class. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for distinct patterns of PTSD symptomatology in refugees and asylum seekers. We identified three classes which present both qualitative and quantitative differences in symptoms: Pervasive class, high-Threat class and a new moderate class, characterised by avoidance symptoms. Reception conditions contributed to the emergence of the Pervasive PTSD profile characterised by the symptoms highest severity. These findings highlight that stressors in the post-migration environment, as inadequate reception conditions in large facilities, may have detrimental effect on refugees' mental health.

We reviewed the charts of SARS-CoV-2 patients with pneumonia and moderate to severely elevated CRP and worsening hypoxemia who were treated with early, short-term dexamethasone. METHODS We describe a series of 21 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were admitted to The Miriam Hospital in Providence, RI, and were treated with a short course of dexamethasone, either alone or in addition to current investigative therapies. RESULTS CRP levels decreased significantly following the start of dexamethasone from mean initial levels of 129.52 to 40.73 mg/L at time of discharge. 71% percent of the patients were discharged home with a mean length of stay of 7.8 days. None of the patients had escalation of care, leading to mechanical ventilation. Two patients were transferred to inpatient hospice facilities on account of persistent hypoxemia, in line with their documented goals of care. CONCLUSIONS A short course of systemic corticosteroids among inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 with hypoxic respiratory failure was well tolerated, and most patients had improved outcomes. This limited case series may not offer concrete evidence towards the benefit of corticosteroids in COVID-19.

The estimated prevalence in the United States is between 35,000 and 55,000 cases, and evidence suggests that the prevalence is increasing for IPF. Risk factors associated with pulmonary fibrosis include smoking, environmental exposures, gastroesophageal reflux disease, commonly prescribed drugs, diabetes mellitus, infectious agents, and genetic factors. The diagnosis requires a careful history and physical examination, characteristic physiological and radiological studies, and, in some cases, a surgical lung biopsy. The natural history of IPF is not known, but evidence supports the concept of a continuum of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias that may overlap in time. Most patients with IPF succumb to respiratory failure, cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, pulmonary embolism, infection, and other health problems. The median survival time for patients with IPF is less than 3 yr. Factors that predict poor outcome include older age, male gender, severe dyspnea, history of cigarette smoking, severe loss of lung function, appearance and severity of fibrosis on radiological studies, lack of response to therapy, and prominent fibroblastic foci on histopathologic evaluation. Conventional therapy (corticosteroids, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide) provides only marginal benefit. Lung transplantation should be considered for patients with IPF refractory to medical therapy. In light of the poor prognosis and lack of response to available anti-inflammatory therapy, alternative approaches to therapy are being pursued.

The criteria for compliance included HH behavior, procedure, duration, hand drying method, and the overall that counts them all. The observed influencing factors included different departments and areas and protection motivation. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression were performed. RESULTS: The compliance of overall criteria, HH behavior, procedure, duration, and hand drying method were 79.44%, 96.71%, 95.74%, 88.93%, and 88.42%, respectively, which were significantly different from each other (P < .001). Meanwhile, the overall and hand drying method compliance in semi-contaminated areas (odds ratio [OR]a?=a?1.829, P < .001; ORa?=a?2.149, Pa?=a?.001) and hygienic areas (ORa?=a?1.689, Pa?=a?.004; ORa?=a?1.959, Pa?=a?.015) were significantly higher than those in contaminated area.

The article analyses this process by an international comparison with other Western European countries, highlighting the intensity of hospital bed reduction in Italy, as a fundamental component of NHS rationalisation. Although it was based on solid grounds, international data suggest that hospital bed reduction was probably excessive, depriving the NHS of organisational slack. Moreover, de-hospitalisation would have been matched with a stronger development of primary and community care. The relative shortage of these services, along with the lack of integrated networks between hospital and non-hospital care, explains many difficulties experienced by hospitals in tackling Covid patients.

Each annual numbers of participants were 369, 283, 376, 495, 389, and 299, respectively. Participants included many repeaters. They mainly consisted of cancer patients in our hospital and their families. A high percentage of them were women by sex, 60's by age. Main cancer patients were newly diagnosed within 5 years &lt; over 5 years by periods after diagnosis, breast cancer by site (43 % other than 5 major cancers), and under treatment. In FY2019, their purposes of participation were mainly reported acquisition of professional information 67%, taking relaxation 54%, and meeting peers, exchanging information based on actual experience 45%. 74% of them answered that they have changed after participation, The way of thinking about cancer 73%, The way of thinking about life 66%, and How to deal with others 54%. Conclusion: The number of participants and the rate of evaluations have been steady. The useful program, activated their self-management and peer-support function, changes they felt after the participation as well might be factors. In the future, first, in response to their voices, we are considering the restart of the salon in the era of COVID-19. Second, according to their needs, we will provide proper information, relaxation, and promotion of peer support continuously. Finally, we aim at creating the salon where new participants with more various backgrounds can participate.","output":"P39-4 Activities report of a support program for cancer patients and their families at Jichi Medical University Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is a promising drug for prophylaxis and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.

The study here confronts this problem by developing a global analysis based on more than 160 countries. This paper proposes that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, healthcare spending and air pollution of nations are critical factors associated with fatality rate of COVID-19. The statistical evidence seems in general to support that countries with a low average COVID-19 fatality rate have high expenditures in health sector >7.5% of GDP, high health expenditures per capita >$2,300 and a lower exposure of population to days exceeding safe levels of particulate matter (PM(2.5)). Another relevant finding here is that these countries have lower case fatality rates (CFRs) of COVID-19, regardless a higher percentage of population aged more than 65 years. Overall, then, this study finds that an effective and proactive strategy to reduce the negative impact of future pandemics, driven by novel viral agents, has to be based on a planning of enhancement of healthcare sector and of environmental sustainability that can reduce fatality rate of infectious diseases in society.","output":"High health expenditures and low exposure of population to air pollution as critical factors that can reduce fatality rate in COVID-19 pandemic crisis: a global analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Different vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are approved in various countries, but few direct comparisons of the antibody responses they stimulate have been reported.

The high phenotypic plasticity typical of sessile, substrate-attached marine species may enhance their chances of survival and spread in a new region. Anthropogenic activities have changed marine habitats over a wide range of phenomena, including water temperature, community species composition, and the types of available substrates, creating new physical and biotic regimes that may contribute to the potential for successful species introduction. Here we examine ten species of sea anemones that have been introduced outside of their native range, and elucidate specific characteristics that are common among globally introduced sea anemones. Various life history strategies enable these species to survive and flourish through transport, introduction, establishment and spread, leading to the successful colonization of a new geographic area.

However, CEACAM1a is poorly expressed in neurons, and the extremely neurotropic MHV strain JHM.SD infects ceacam1a?/? mice and spreads among ceacam1a?/? neurons. Two proposed alternative MHV receptors, CEACAM2 and PSG16, also fail to account for neuronal spread of JHM.SD in the absence of CEACAM1a. JHM.SD has been reported to have an unusually labile spike protein, enabling it to perform receptor-independent spread (RIS), but it is not clear that the ability to perform RIS is fully responsible for the extremely neurovirulent phenotype.

In these multicellular eukaryotes, innate immunity implies the presence of cell surface receptors and intracellular receptors able to detect danger signal referred as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Membrane-associated pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), receptor-like kinases (RLKs), and receptor-like proteins (RLPs) are employed by these organisms for sensing different invasion patterns before triggering antimicrobial defenses that can be associated with a form of regulated cell death. Intracellularly, animals nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors or plants nucleotide-binding domain (NBD)-containing leucine rich repeats (NLRs) immune receptors likely detect effectors injected into the host cell by the pathogen to hijack the immune signaling cascade. Interestingly, during the co-evolution between the hosts and their invaders, key cross-kingdom cell death-signaling macromolecular NLR-complexes have been selected, such as the inflammasome in mammals and the recently discovered resistosome in plants. In both cases, a regulated cell death located at the site of infection constitutes a very effective mean for blocking the pathogen spread and protecting the whole organism from invasion. This review aims to describe the immune mechanisms in animals and plants, mainly focusing on cell death signaling pathways, in order to highlight recent advances that could be used on one side or the other to identify the missing signaling elements between the perception of the invasion pattern by immune receptors, the induction of defenses or the transmission of danger signals to other cells. Although knowledge of plant immunity is less advanced, these organisms have certain advantages allowing easier identification of signaling events, regulators and executors of cell death, which could then be exploited directly for crop protection purposes or by analogy for medical research.","output":"Cross Kingdom Immunity: The Role of Immune Receptors and Downstream Signaling in Animal and Plant Cell Death"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"India's wave is receding, but other countries are now battling to contain the variant that first emerged there, reports Michael Le Page","output":"Indian variant goes global"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we focus on a novel bioethical approach concerning the ethical implications of the Social Determinants of Health (SDs) in the time of COVID-19, offering a fresh interpretation of our agency and responsibility in the current pandemic era.

Moreover, due the centrality of the SDs in our bioethical assessmentsthat implies that our health does not exclusively depend on our choices, behaviors, and lifestylewe can affirm that we are not entirely responsible for our wellness or diseases.

In this sense, following the social connection model, we stress the importance of the concept of shared responsibility in collective decisions: if we make many decisions collectively, we are also collectively responsible of these decisions. Furthermore, to responsibly tackle the social inequalities that are the underlying cause of disparities in health outcomes, we propose two main strategies based on the Capability Approach: 1. empowering the individuals, especially the most vulnerable ones; and 2. designing preventive policies and interventions that provides an opportunity to address the disparities moving forward.

However, when placental microcalcifications are noticed earlier during pregnancy, they could suggest a major placental dysfunction with serious consequences for the fetus and mother. For better detectability of microcalcifications, we propose a new approach based on improving the clarity of details and the analysis of the placental structure using first and second order statistics, and fractal dimension.

METHODS: Confirmed disease was defined as any patient with a positive antigen test, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, or serology for SARS-CoV-2. We compared the characteristics of patients with mild disease (asymptomatic included) with those with moderate or severe disease (requiring admission). RESULTS: Of 2344 HIV-infected patients, 158 (82.9% male; median age, 46.5 years) were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 (infection rate, 6.74%; 95% confidence interval, 5.79 to 7.83). Thirty-nine individuals (24.7%) had moderate or severe disease, 43.7% had mild disease, and 31.6% were asymptomatic. Hypertension (23.4%) and obesity (15.8%) were the most prevalent comorbidities; 12.7% had at least 2 comorbidities. One hundred forty-five patients (97.3%) had RNA-HIV viral load of <50 copies per milliliter, and only 3 had CD4 cell count of <200 cells per cubic millimeter before infection.

Objective: To present a review of the literature and a proposal for COVID autopsy protocols. To contain the infection risk, a revision of all the protocols that until now have been applied to the examination of bodies that require autopsy services is required. Data source: Currently, the diagnosis and postmortem analysis of positive or suspected COVID-19 cases plays a crucial role in scientific research. A review of the main recommendations proposed by international scientific societies regarding the risk of infection during autopsy has been carried out. Scientific papers currently available via the PubMed NCBI search engine on COVID-19 postmortem diagnosis were also examined. Discussion: Throughout the history of medicine, the role of autopsy has been fundamental to the understanding of multiple pathogenic processes that are investigated postmortem through autopsy.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was one of the first drugs used to treat COVID-19 due to its supposed capacity of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in vitro. While its efficacy is debated, HCQ has been associated with QT interval prolongation and potentially Torsades de Pointes, especially in patients predisposed to developing drug-induced Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) as silent carriers of variants associated with congenital LQTS. If confirmed, these effects represent a limitation to the at-home use of HCQ for COVID-19 infection as adequate ECG monitoring is challenging. We investigated the proarrhythmic profile of HCQ with Multi-Electrode Arrays after exposure of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from two healthy donors, one asymptomatic and two symptomatic LQTS patients. We demonstrated that: I) HCQ induced a concentration-dependent Field Potential Duration (FPD) prolongation and halted the beating at high concentration due to the combined effect of HCQ on multiple ion currents. II) hiPSC-CMs from healthy or asymptomatic carriers tolerated higher concentrations of HCQ and showed lower susceptibility to HCQ-induced electrical abnormalities regardless of baseline FPD. These findings agree with the clinical safety records of HCQ and demonstrated that hiPSC-CMs potentially discriminates symptomatic vs. asymptomatic mutation carriers through pharmacological interventions. Disease-specific cohorts of hiPSC-CMs may be a valid preliminary addition to assess drug safety in vulnerable populations, offering rapid preclinical results with valuable translational relevance for precision medicine.","output":"Use of hiPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes to Rule Out Proarrhythmic Effects of Drugs: The Case of Hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many researchers in China have performed related clinical research. However, systematic reviews of the registered clinical trials are still lacking. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of clinical trials for COVID-19 to summarize their characteristics. METHODS: This study is based on the PRISMA recommendations in the Cochrane handbook. The Chinese Clinical Registration Center and the ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched to identify registered clinical trials related to COVID-19. The retrieval inception date was February 9, 2020. Two researchers independently selected the literature based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. RESULTS: A total of 75 registered clinical trials (63 interventional studies and 12 observational studies) for COVID-19 were identified. The majority of clinical trials were sponsored by Chinese hospitals. Only 11 trials have begun to recruit patients, and none of the registered clinical trials have been completed; 34 trials were early clinical exploratory trials or in the pre-experiment stage, 13 trials were phase III, and four trials were phase IV. The intervention methods included traditional Chinese medicine in 26 trials, Western medicine in 30 trials, and integrated traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine in 19 trials. The subjects were primarily non-critical adult patients (&#8805; 18 years old). The median sample size of the trials was 100 (IQR: 60-200), and the median length of the trial periods was 179 d (IQR: 94-366 d). The main outcomes were clinical observation and examinations. Overall, the methodological quality of both the interventional trials and observational studies was low. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive clinical trials on the treatment of COVID-19 using traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine are ongoing or will be performed in China. However, based on the uncertain methodological quality, small sample size, and long trial duration, we will not be able to obtain reliable, high-quality clinical evidence regarding the treatment of COVID-19 in the near future. Improving the quality of study design, prioritizing promising drugs, and using different designs and statistical methods are worth advocating and recommending for clinical trials of COVID-19 in the future.","output":"Systematic review of the registered clinical trials for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Several potential sources of proteins, peptides, and biopolymers, such as silk, chitin, and chitosan are utilized in industry and for biotechnology applications. Chitosan is an amino-polysaccharide derivative of chitin that consists of linear amino polysaccharides with d-glucosamine and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine units. Currently, the chief commercial sources of chitin and chitosan are crustacean shells that accumulate as a major waste product from the marine food industry. Existing chitin resources have some natural challenges, including insufficient supplies, seasonal availability, and environmental pollution. As an alternative, insects could be utilized as unconventional but feasible sources of chitin and chitosan. SCOPE AND APPROACH: This review focuses on the recent sources of insect chitin and chitosan, particularly from the Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Orthoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Dictyoptera, and Odonata orders. In addition, the extraction methods and physicochemical characteristics are discussed. Insect chitin and chitosan have numerous biological activities and could be used for food, biomedical, and industrial applications. KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Recently, the invasive and harmful effects of insect species causing severe damage in agricultural crops has led to great economic losses globally. These dangerous species serve as potential sources of chitin and are underutilized worldwide. The conclusion of the present study provides better insight into the conversion of insect waste-derived chitin into value-added products as an alternative chitin source to address food security related challenges.","output":"Recent insights into the extraction, characterization, and bioactivities of chitin and chitosan from insects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The immunological findings from autopsies, biopsies, and various studies in COVID-19 patients show that the major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 is excess immune response resulting in hyper-inflammation.

Joanna Briggs Institute's design-specific checklists were used to assess the risk of bias. Out of 122 records screened for eligibility, 42 articles were included in the final review. The review found that eventually, most mechanisms result in cytokine excess and up-regulation of Nuclear Factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) signaling as a common pathway of excess immune response. Molecules blocking NF-&#954;B or targeting downstream effectors like Tumour Necrosis Factor &#945; (TNF&#945;) are either undergoing clinical trials or lack specificity and cause unwanted side effects.

The daily trend of these parameters and COVID-19 variables from February 15th to April 25th, 2020, were considered. Asian countries show an increasing trend between infection rate and population density. A direct relationship between the time-lapse of the first infected case and the period of suspension of movement controls the transmissivity of COVID-19 in Asian countries. The increase in temperature has led to an increase in COVID-19 spread, while the decrease in humidity is consistent with the trend in daily deaths during the peak of the pandemic in European countries. Countries with 65F temperature and 5 mm rainfall have a negative impact on COVID-19 spread. Lower oxygen availability in the atmosphere, fine droplets of submicron size together with infectious aerosols, and low wind speed have contributed to the increase in total cases and mortality in Germany and France. The onset of the D614G mutation and subsequent changes to D614 before March, later G614 in mid-March, and S943P, A831V, D839/Y/N/E in April were observed in Asian and European countries. The results of the correlation and factor analysis show that the COVID-19 cases and the climatic factors are significantly correlated with each other.

The immune system has been recognized as playing a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of myocarditis, leading to an increased focus on immunosuppressive treatment strategies. Recent data have highlighted not only the fact that FM has significantly worse outcomes than non-FM, but that prognosis and management strategies of FM are heavily dependent on histological subtype, placing greater emphasis on the role of endomyocardial biopsy in diagnosis. The impact of subtype on severity and prognosis will likewise influence how aggressively the myocarditis is managed, including whether MCS is warranted. Many patients with refractory cardiogenic shock secondary to FM end up requiring MCS, with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation demonstrating favorable survival rates, particularly when initiated prior to the development of multiorgan failure.

We investigated the potential anti-coronavirus activities from an oral liquid of traditional medicine, Respiratory Detox Shot (RDS), which contains mostly herbal ingredients traditionally used to manage lung diseases. RESULTS: Here we report that RDS inhibited the infection of target cells by lenti-SARS-CoV, lenti-SARS-CoV-2, and hybrid alphavirus-SARS-CoV-2 (Ha-CoV-2) pseudoviruses, and by infectious SARS-CoV-2 and derived Ha-CoV-2 variants including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.429, B.1.2, B.1.494, B.1.1.207, B.1.258, and B.1.1.298.

But research has not yet examined whether science literacy actually enables this, nor what skills it would need to encompass to do so. In this report, we address three questions to outline what it should mean to be science literate in today's world: 1) How should we conceptualize science literacy? 2) How can we achieve this science literacy? and 3) What can we expect science literacy's most important outcomes to be? If science literacy is to truly enable people to become and stay informed (and avoid being misinformed) on complex science issues, it requires skills that span the \\"lifecycle\\" of science information. This includes how the scientific community produces science information, how media repackage and share the information, and how individuals encounter and form opinions on this information. Science literacy, then, is best conceptualized as encompassing three dimensions of literacy spanning the lifecycle: Civic science literacy, digital media science literacy, and cognitive science literacy. Achieving such science literacy, particularly for adults, poses many challenges and will likely require a structural perspective. Digital divides, in particular, are a major structural barrier, and community literacy and building science literacy into media and science communication are promising opportunities. We end with a discussion of what some of the beneficial outcomes could be-and, as importantly, will likely not be-of science literacy that furthers informed and critical engagement with science in democratic society.","output":"(Mis)informed about what?

Outdoor social gathering, with appropriate physical distancing, is often recommended. Group outdoor health walks (GOHW) are nature-based interventions that promote physical activity, positive emotions, and mental wellbeing. However, results of quantitative social health scales often do not match qualitative reports of enhanced social wellbeing. In this qualitative study, we explore older adults' experiences of a GOHW to learn how the walks might mitigate social isolation and promote social wellbeing. Methods: Eight individual or paired interviews were recorded among nine walkers six months after a 12-week GOHW. Analysis was conducted by a multi-disciplinary team. The coding frame included both a priori and emergent codes. An iterative process identified key themes. Results: Three themes illustrated the social dimensions of GOHW. First, individuals' social relatedness changed loneliness, social confidence and the quality of friendships, through mixing during and after the walks. Second, social support was experienced through emerging group cohesion and the supportive environment for inexperienced or physically challenged individuals. Tensions were also identified. Third, the social component of GOHW was related to walker wellbeing, by providing an opportunity to safely exercise outdoors, while the socializing helped them overcome their physical ailments and offered something to look forward to each week. Together these themes provide insight into the social elements of nature-based interventions, the mediating effects of group cohesion and social support, and the contribution to wellbeing. Conclusion: GOHWs mitigate social isolation by providing a low-risk social activity that develops and strengthens relationships among members of the walking group. Socializing, group cohesion and social support contribute to both physical and social wellbeing. With attention to physical distancing, GOHW may be beneficial in COVID times. Findings also can inform selection and development of social health measures for use in studies of nature-based interventions.","output":"Social isolation of older adults: A qualitative study of the effects of group outdoor healthwalks on socialwellbeing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has delivered a profound shock to global value chains (GVCs) To date, popular and academic press has predicted significant changes in GVC configurations due to COVID-19 (FT, 2020;Panwar, 2020) It has been argued that the pandemic has illuminated pre-existing underlying fragilities of GVCs (Silverthorne, 2020), and that lead firms are likely to respond by reshoring operations, vertically integrating, and reducing the geographic footprint of their networks","output":"Global value chains in the post-COVID world: Governance for reliability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Despite high prevalence of umbilical hernias an open anterior approach is still frequently performed. Mesh use, although necessary in recurrence prevention, may lead to more frequent surgical site infections, especially in obese patients. Intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) may promote intraperitoneal adhesions. Some of these limitations may be reconciled by transabdominal-preperitoneal repair (TAPP). AIM: To compare the feasibility, safety and efficacy of umbilical TAPP (u-TAPP) with ventral patch repair technique (VPR). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analysis included overweight/obese patients undergoing elective surgery for primary umbilical hernia (22 in VPR, 21 in u-TAPP). RESULTS: There were no differences between groups regarding size of the hernia defect. The mean width of the defect was 26 mm in VPR and 30 mm in u-TAPP (p = 0.185). The operation time was significantly shorter (p < 0.001) in VPR (43.1 11.6 min) than in u-TAPP (93.2 22.3 min). However, in VPR it was possible to place a much smaller area of synthetic mesh than in u-TAPP (34.3 vs. 164.2 cm(2); p < 0.001). After 30 days of follow-up, there was no recurrence in any of the groups. No significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding post-operative pain. CONCLUSIONS: TAPP technique in umbilical hernia repair allows for placement of a much larger mesh than an anterior approach surgery, and is closer to current recommendations, especially for patients with additional risk factors, such as obesity or coexistence of diastasis recti. TAPP allows a mesh to be introduced into the preperitoneal space, allowing one to avoid direct contact between the mesh and the intestines. Laparoscopic umbilical TAPP is feasible and safe, but the operation time is longer compared to open methods.","output":"Laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal repair (umbilical TAPP) versus open ventral patch repair for medium size umbilical hernias in overweight and obese patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and declared by the World Health Organization a global public health emergency. Among the severe outbreaks across South America, Uruguay has become known for curtailing SARS-CoV-2 exceptionally well. To understand the SARS-CoV-2 introductions, local transmissions, and associations with genomic and clinical parameters in Uruguay, we sequenced the viral genomes of 44 outpatients and inpatients in a private healthcare system in its capital, Montevideo, from March to May 2020. We performed a phylogeographic analysis using sequences from our cohort and other studies that indicate a minimum of 23 independent introductions into Uruguay, resulting in five major transmission clusters. Our data suggest that most introductions resulting in chains of transmission originate from other South American countries, with the earliest seeding of the virus in late February 2020, weeks before the borders were closed to all non-citizens and a partial lockdown implemented. Genetic analyses suggest a dominance of S and G clades (G, GH, GR) that make up >90% of the viral strains in our study. In our cohort, lethal outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly correlated with arterial hypertension, kidney failure, and ICU admission (FDR < 0.01), but not with any mutation in a structural or non-structural protein, such as the spike D614G mutation.

Huge number of studies tried to reveal the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 compared to the SARS-CoV-1, in order to suppress this high infection rate. Some of these studies showed that the mutations in the SARS-CoV-1 Spike protein might be responsible for its higher affinity to the ACE2 human cell receptor. In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo sampling to compare the binding affinities of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 stronger than SARS-CoV by 7 kcal/mol, due to enhanced electrostatic interactions. The major contributions to the electrostatic binding energies are resulting from the salt-bridges formed between R426 and ACE2-E329 in case of SARS-CoV and K417 and ACE2-D30 for SARS-CoV2. In addition, there is no significant contribution from a single mutant to the binding energies. However, these mutations induce sophisticated structural changes that enhance the binding energies.

The aims of this study were to compare the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of inpatients in the intensive-care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients. METHODS: We recruited 416 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and divided them into two groups: ICU (n = 35) and non-ICU (n = 381). Medical histories, laboratory findings, and echocardiography data were compared. RESULTS: The levels of myocardial injury markers in ICU vs non-ICU patients were as follows: troponin I (0.029 ng/mL [0.007C0.063] vs 0.006 ng/mL [0.006C0.006]) and myoglobin (65.45 g/L [39.77C130.57] vs 37.00 g/L [26.40C53.54]). Echocardiographic findings included ventricular wall thickening (12 [39%] vs 1 [4%]), pulmonary hypertension (9 [29%] vs 0 [0%]), and reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction (5 [16%] vs 0 [0%]). Overall, 10% of the ICU patients presented with right heart enlargement, thickened right-ventricular wall, decreased right heart function, and pericardial effusion. Cardiac complications were more common in ICU patients, including acute cardiac injury (21 [60%] vs 13 [3%]) (including 2 cases of fulminant myocarditis), atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmia (3 [9%] vs 3 [1%]), and acute heart failure (5 [14%] vs 0 [0%]). CONCLUSION: Myocardial injury marker elevation, ventricular wall thickening, pulmonary artery hypertension, and cardiac complications including acute myocardial injury, arrhythmia, and acute heart failure are more common in ICU patients with COVID-19. Cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients may be related more to the systemic response after infection rather than direct damage by coronavirus.","output":"Cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 in Shenzhen, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 lineages are continuously evolving.

AY.4.2 displays three additional mutations (T95I, Y145H and A222V) in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike when compared to the original Delta variant (B.1.617.2) and remains poorly characterized.

The AY.4.2 spike exhibited similar fusogenicity and binding to ACE2 than Delta. The sensitivity of infectious AY.4.2 to a panel of monoclonal neutralizing antibodies was similar to Delta, except for the anti-RBD Imdevimab, which showed incomplete neutralization. Sensitivity of AY.4.2 to sera from individuals having received two or three doses of Pfizer or two doses of AstraZeneca vaccines was reduced by 1.7 to 2.1 fold, when compared to Delta.

As the director of senior projects (first author) for the mechanical engineering program, this forced me into an unexpected situation. As many other engineering professors can attest, teaching laboratory intensive classes and design courses adds additional layers of complexity within the online delivery mode. The co-author who taught two other sections of senior design and the first author had to immediately devise a plan on how to continue to deliver a meaningful design experience to students online in the middle of the semester. While most programs in the country adjusted their capstone programs to face the unexpected pandemic, our program had its own set of challenges to overcome. The first concern for the authors was how to continue to provide a meaningful design experience to the students and the second one was how to complete the projects to meet the sponsors' expectations. That is why we decided to share our experience so we can generate more thoughts and discussions during the conference. Our first effort was to use our extensive engineering experience to challenge the senior students. Access to the machine shop was not allowed beginning halfway through the spring 2020 semester. During a normal academic year, student teams perform much of the fabrication and testing of their prototypes during the spring semester. Since access to the machine shop was not allowed, the focus of the program shifted towards a greater emphasis on analysis and technical writing. Another challenge is due to the model used for capstone projects at Mason in which 100% of the projects are externally sponsored by industry and government partners. In order to prepare the projects for the fall 2019 semester, authors worked side-by-side with the sponsors to agree on deliverables and top-level requirements in the preceding summer. Satisfying the needs of the sponsor, for nearly all projects, requires a significant 'hands on' component in terms of fabrication and subsequent testing. In prior iterations of the capstone course sequence, teams were expected to interface with the sponsors frequently, but the pandemic made sponsor-to-student interaction more difficult. We had to think of creative ways in which the student teams can meet the expectations of the sponsors who provided financial support. With the assistance and approval of the department leadership, we adjusted the course learning outcomes to suit the unforeseen design conditions of the capstone projects and provided a real-life learning experience in project management to the 59 senior students enrolled in the class. Although the modality of instruction changed and the access to campus was prohibited after the campus closure, the student teams were remarkable in coordinating the teamwork virtually. Because the students have worked together in teams before pandemic and knew their teammates, the aspect of teamwork progressed smoothly during the crucial early days of online learning in March 2020. Via extensive planning and adjustments to the course content and delivery, we successfully completed the two-semester long capstone program which concluded with a virtual capstone day in May 2020. This paper provides details on how the capstone program adapted to the Covid-19 pandemic at Mason while maintaining a rich learning experience.

Unfortunately, there is no medication that has been approved by the FDA, gone through controlled studies and demonstrated an effect on the virus for this global pandemic. Although there are cures for illnesses and developments made by leaps and bounds in our day, the strongest and most effective weapon that society has against this virus that is affecting not just health but also economics, politics, and social order, is the prevention of its spread. The main points in preventing the spread in society are hand hygiene, social distancing and quarantine. With increased testing capacity, detecting more COVID-19 positive patients in the community will also enable the reduction of secondary cases with stricter quarantine rules.","output":"COVID-19: Prevention and control measures in community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As the population of older adults increases, the complexity of care required to support those who choose to remain in the community amplifies. Anticipatory Care Planning (ACP), through earlier identification of healthcare needs, is evidenced to improve quality of life, decrease aggressive interventions, and prolong life. With patient acceptability of growing importance in the design, implementation, and evaluation of healthcare interventions, this study reports on the acceptability of a primary care based ACP intervention on the island of Ireland. METHODS: As part of the evaluation of a feasibility cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) testing an ACP intervention for older people at risk of functional decline, intervention participants [n = 34] were interviewed in their homes at 10-week follow-up to determine acceptability. The intervention consisted of home visits by specifically trained registered nurses who assessed participants health, discussed their health goals and plans, and devised an anticipatory care plan in collaboration with participants GPs and adjunct clinical pharmacist. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview data. The feasibility cRCT involved eight general practitioner (GP) practices as cluster sites, stratified by jurisdiction, four in Northern Ireland (NI) (two intervention, two control), and four in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) (two intervention, two control). Participants were assessed for risk of functional decline. A total of 34 patients received the intervention and 31 received usual care. FINDINGS: Thematic analysis resulted in five main themes: timing of intervention, understanding of ACP, personality & individual differences, loneliness & social isolation, and views on healthcare provision. These map across the Four Factor Model of Acceptability (4FMA), a newly developed conceptual framework comprising four components: intervention factors, personal factors, social support factors, and healthcare provision factors. CONCLUSION: Acceptability of this primary care based ACP intervention was high, with nurses home visits, GP anchorage, multidisciplinary working, personalized approach, and active listening regarded as beneficial. Appropriate timing, and patient health education emerged as vital.","output":"Acceptability of a nurse-led, person-centred, anticipatory care planning intervention for older people at risk of functional decline: A qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nucleotide skew analysis is a versatile method to study the nucleotide composition of RNA/DNA molecules, in particular to reveal characteristic sequence signatures. For instance, skew analysis of the nucleotide bias of several viral RNA genomes indicated that it is enriched in the unpaired, single-stranded genome regions, thus creating an even more striking virus-specific signature. The comparison of skew graphs for many virus isolates or families is difficult, time-consuming, and nonquantitative. Here, we present a procedure for a more simple identification of similarities and dissimilarities between nucleotide skew data of coronavirus, flavivirus, picornavirus, and HIV-1 RNA genomes. Window and step sizes were normalized to correct for differences in length of the viral genome. Cumulative skew data are converted into pairwise Euclidean distance matrices, which can be presented as neighbor-joining trees. We present skew value trees for the four virus families and show that closely related viruses are placed in small clusters. Importantly, the skew value trees are similar to the trees constructed by a classical model of evolutionary nucleotide substitution. Thus, we conclude that the simple calculation of Euclidean distances between nucleotide skew data allows an easy and quantitative comparison of characteristic sequence signatures of virus genomes. These results indicate that the Euclidean distance analysis of nucleotide skew data forms a nice addition to the virology toolbox.","output":"Euclidean Distance Analysis Enables Nucleotide Skew Analysis in Viral Genomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ImportanceWhile the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted regular hospital care and decreased overall volume of hospitalized patients, its impact on low-value care has not been investigated. ObjectiveTo examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on overuse rates. DesignA retrospective cohort study using Medicare fee-for-service claims. SettingAll outpatient and inpatient claims. ParticipantsMedicare beneficiaries aged 65 and over who met the criteria for one of 10 overuse measures were included, if they had a claim between January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020. ExposureClaims meeting overuse measure criteria over various time periods in 2020 were compared to the same period in the previous year: during the initial COVID-19 surge and shutdown (March 15 to May 2, 2020) and periods where states had high (if the mean 7-day case incidence was greater than 175 cases per 100,000 persons) or low COVID-19 incidence. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe overuse measures in this study had two components: a denominator encompassing a particular patient cohort and a numerator to capture overuse of each service among patients within this cohort. We report claim volumes for both the denominator cohorts and overuse numerators as well as their rate differences (2020 versus 2019) using incidence rate ratios (IRRs) estimated using Poisson regressions. ResultsThere were 2,053,792 patients in 2019 and 1,699,807 in 2020 included across all 10 measure cohorts, with 2,112,904 (61.0%) female patients and a mean (SD) age of 76.5 (8.1) years. Across the 10 measures, 302,379 (14.7%) patients had a claim meeting the overuse criteria in 2019 and 234,481 (13.8%) in 2020. The COVID-19 shutdown had a large impact on overall cohort volume; there were 2,341,017 patients during this period, a decrease of 52.3% from 4,912,453 patients in the corresponding 2019 period. Both overuse volume and rates declined in 2020 compared to 2019. In April 2020, there were 3,955 overuse procedure claims (including spinal fusion/laminectomy, carotid endarterectomy, knee arthroscopy, hysterectomy and vertebroplasty) compared to 14,663 in 2019; an IRR of 0.64 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.67; p <0.001). After the COVID-19 shutdown period, 2020 overuse rates were mostly similar to rates in the corresponding 2019 period. Conclusions and RelevanceThe COVID-19 shutdown period during March through May in 2020 had a drastic impact on both the overall volume of patients meeting one of 10 measure criteria and the rate of overuse for these patients. Overuse rates, however, returned to 2019 levels shortly after this shutdown period even as COVID incidence rose.","output":"Overuse in US Medicare during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sago palm (Metroxylon sagu Rottb.) grows in well-drained mineral soil and in peatland with high groundwater levels until complete submersion. However, the published information on nutrient uptake and carbohydrate content in sago palms growing under waterlogging remains unreported.

Several parameters were analyzed: Plant morphological growth traits, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and sugar concentration in the plant organ, including sucrose, glucose, starch, and non-structural carbohydrate. The analysis found that sago palm morphological growth traits were not significantly affected by extended waterlogging. However, waterlogging reduced carbohydrate levels in the upper part of the sago palm, especially the petiole, and increased sugar levels, especially glucose, in roots. Waterlogging also reduced N concentration in roots and leaflets and P in petioles. The K level was independent of waterlogging as the sago palm maintained a sufficient level in all of the plant organs. Long duration waterlogging may reduce the plant's economic value as the starch level in the trunk decreases, although sago palm can grow while waterlogged.","output":"Waterlogged Conditions Influence the Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, and Sugar Distribution in Sago Palm (Metroxylon sagu Rottb.) at Seedling Stages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This study assessed thyroid function in patients affected by the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), based on the hypothesis that the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 may influence thyroid function and/or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may directly act on thyroid cells, such as previously demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1 infection.

Repurposing it against coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a relatively newer concept and has been sparsely tested in vivo. The most common route of entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) is the nasopharynx. Averting colonization of the virus could be one of the best options to reduce the incidence of infection. PVP-I gargle and mouthwash were found to be effective in vitro rapid inactivation against SARS-CoV-2 on a smaller scale (Hassandarvish et al. in BDJ 1C4, 2020, Pelletier et al. in ENTJ 1C5, 2020). However, efficacy in humans is lacking. To assess the virucidal effect of PVP-I against SARS-CoV-2 located in the nasopharynx was the objective of this parallel armed randomized clinical trial. We screened all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases aged 18 years and above with symptoms. Written informed consent was obtained before randomization. Nasopharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2 was tested after single time application of PVP-I nasal irrigation (NI) at diluted concentrations of .4%, .5% and .6% and PVP-I nasal spray (NS) at diluted concentrations of .5% and .6%. All groups were compared to the corresponding controls (distilled water). The primary outcome was viral clearance in a repeat RT-PCR (qualitative), and the secondary outcome was the number of adverse events. Final data analysis was performed using the statistical software SPSS (Version 20). A total of 189 confirmed COVID-19 cases were randomized into seven groups: 27 patients in each group. Of all, 159 (84.1%) were male, and 30 (15.9%) were female. We observed a statistically significant proportion of nasopharyngeal clearance with all strengths of PVP-I NI and PVP-I NS compared to the corresponding controls. Additionally, 0.5% NI was significantly better than 0.5% NS for viral clearance (p = 0.018) and had the highest nasopharyngeal clearance among all strengths (n = 25, 92.6%). 0.6% NS is better than CNS and 0.5%NS in viral clearance. The only adverse event was nasal irritation recorded in two patients each in the 0.4% and 0.6% PVP-I NI groups (Tables 1 and 2). PVP-I NI and NS are proved as effective virucidal agent against SARS-CoV-2 in human body.

Simulation-based education (SBE) is an innovative addition to clinical experience which can begin to address the skills-based learning deficiency in order to help trainees meet their curriculum requirements and optimise the exposure required for a trainee to become a competent general urology consultant. Surgical simulation is an effective training tool but has a complex implementation process, requiring considerable planning tailored to specific educational targets, to ensure it is sustainable and reproducible. Methodology from the field of implementation science offers an invaluable approach to design an effective simulation-based training adjunct, as exemplified by the example of the UK Urology Simulation Boot Camp (USBC), a comprehensive training course which incorporates core technical and non-technical skills based on the current Joint Committee on Surgical Training (JCST) urological training curriculum to equip newly appointed urology trainees to work as competent junior registrars. Delivered annually in Leeds since 2015, the course has had excellent feedback and results in improving the urological knowledge of trainees, as well as increases in trainees confidence. This paper will provide a summary of how the course was designed, delivered, reproduced, sustained and evaluated. Its success is demonstrated by its incorporation into the UK urology training programme, and since 2018, it is now recommended to all new urology residents in the UK.

We included consecutive adult patients with severe COVID-19 defined as respiratory rate 30 breath per minute, oxygen saturation 93% on ambient air or arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen 300 mmHg. We excluded patients treated with other immunomodulant drugs, receiving low dose of corticosteroids and those receiving corticosteroids after 72h from admission. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality form hospital admission. The main exposure variable was corticosteroid therapy at dosage of 0.5 mg/kg of prednisone equivalents. It was introduced as binomial covariate in a logistic regression model for primary endpoint and inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score. RESULTS: Of 1717 patients with COVID-19 evaluated, 513 patients were included in the study; of these 170 (33%) were treated with corticosteroids. During the hospitalization 166 (34%) patients reached the primary outcome [60/170 (35%) in the corticosteroid group and 106/343 (31%) in the non-corticosteroid group]. At multivariable analysis corticosteroid treatment was not associated with lower 30-day mortality rate [aOR 0.59 (0.20-1.74), p=0.33]. After inverse probability of treatment weighting, corticosteroids were not associated to lower 30-day mortality [average treatment effect 0.05 (95% -0.02 to 0.09), p=0.12]. However, subgroup analysis revealed that in patients with PO(2)/FiO(2) < 200 mmHg at admission [135 patients, 52 (38%) treated with corticosteroids] corticosteroid treatment was associated to a lower risk of 30-day mortality [23/52 (44%) vs 45/83 (54%), aOR 0.20 (95%CI 0.04 to 0.90), p=0.036].

However, gathering information is crucial in emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for older adults, who are particularly vulnerable to the virus. This study aims to better understand the association between age and information-seeking patterns during the current pandemic. Two hundred and sixty-six participants (age range = 18 C 84, Mage = 38.86, female = 77.06%, received postsecondary education = 83.08%, born in Canada = 73.68%) completed an online study between May and August 2020. We found that older age was associated with more information-seeking time (b = .45, SE = .16, p < .001). We then investigated whether perceived worries of getting COVID-19 might provide insights into this association. Findings point to a partial mediation with a significant direct effect (b = .37, SE = .16, p = .02, 95% bootstrap CI=[.07, .68]), a marginally significant indirect effect (b = .08, SE = .04, p = .06, 95% bootstrap CI=[-.003, .18]) and a significant total effect (b = .46, SE = .16, p < .001, 95% bootstrap CI=[.14, .77]). That is, older adults engaged in more information-seeking than younger adults in contexts in which information-seeking was personally relevant as indicated by perceived worries. These findings shed light on key correlates of information-seeking in older adulthood and highlight the importance for government and health organizations to make suitable information accessible for older adults.","output":"Understanding the relationship between age and information-seeking in the context of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Population genetic diversity plays a prominent role in viral evolution, pathogenesis, immune escape, and drug resistance. Different mechanisms are responsible for creating and maintaining genetic diversity in viruses, including error-prone replication, repair avoidance, and genome editing, among others.

To estimate whether test positivity may assist in policy-making, it was explored in the first 60 to 90 epidemic days in six Latin American countries that reported their first COVID-19 case between February and March, 2020: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, and Uruguay. Test positivity (TP) is the percentage of test-positive individuals recorded on a given day out of all individuals tested on the same day. The epidemic data of the country infected last (Uruguay) was first analyzed to evaluate TP as well as: (i) the daily ratio of secondary over primary infections (apparent reproductive ratio or ARR); (ii) tests conducted per million inhabitants (TPMI), (iii) the temporal data on the number of active cases (all test-positive cases minus deaths and recovered patients), and (iv) that of recovered patients. Later, significant patterns identified in the first step were assessed in the six countries. The Uruguayan data indicated that (i) TP was positively correlated with the ARR (r=.92, p<0.01); (ii) TP informed more than the ARR: while major data departures revealed by the ARR were also detected by TP, TP exhibited patterns not shown by ARR; and (iii) three temporal stages were observed, which differed from one another in both TP and TPMI medians (P<0.01) and, together, revealed a negative relationships between TPMI and TP. The six Latin American countries showed that TP was positively correlated with deaths/million inhabitants or DMI (r=.62, p<0.01). The temporal analysis of policies revealed four patterns: (1) low testing and high DMI, (2) high testing and low DMI; (3) an intermediate pattern, and (4) high testing and high DMI (where isolation was not pursued).

This calls for systematic physical activity (PA) surveillance as a mechanism for assessing the problem and evaluating the effectiveness of related policies. Because countries tend to design their policy measures based on national surveillance data, here we present an inventory of existing national surveillance systems on PA, sedentary behaviour (SB) and sport participation (SP) among adult population in all European Union (EU) Member States. METHODS: As a part of the European Physical Activity and Sports Monitoring System (EUPASMOS) project, a questionnaire was constructed in the form of an on-line survey to collect detailed information on existing national surveillance systems on either PA, SB, or SP. National HEPA focal points from all 27 EU Member States were invited to answer the on-line questionnaire and data collection took part in the period May 2018CSeptember 2019. RESULTS: National monitoring of PA or SB or SP for adults has been established in 16/27 EU Member States, that host 33 different PA/SB/SP monitoring systems. Apart from 3 countries that are using accelerometers (Finland, Ireland and Portugal), surveillance is typically based on questionnaires. In most Member States these questionnaires have not been validated in the particular language and cultural setting. Next, specific domains and dimensions of PA, SB and SP assessed vary a lot across countries. Only 3 countries (the Netherlands, Portugal and Slovenia) are monitoring all three behaviours while covering most of the domains and dimensions of PA/SB/SP. Lastly, as half of the existing surveillance systems set an upper age limit, in 9/16 countries that are monitoring PA/SB/SP, no data for people older than 80 years are available. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic surveillance of PA is lacking among 11/27 EU countries, with even few monitoring SB and SP. Besides, existing surveillance systems typically fail to assess all dimensions and domains of PA/SB/SP with only three countries maintaining monitoring systems that encompass all three behaviours while covering most of the domains and dimensions of PA/SB/SP.

PURPOSE: While biologic medications have transformed the care and management of millions of patients, they are a large financial strain on the healthcare system. Biosimilar medications present a great opportunity to improve care affordability. However, despite streamlined approval processes and the potential for cost savings, the acceptance and adaptation of biosimilars have been slow. This descriptive report illustrates the preparation for, challenges, and execution of an enterprise-wide biosimilar conversion within a large healthcare system. The 3 phases of biosimilar conversion utilized at our institution included selection of a biosimilar, pharmacy and therapeutics (P&T) committee approval, and implementation. SUMMARY: When selecting a biosimilar, clinical data, medication safety, cost, institutional cost savings, payer coverage, patient assistance programs, and additional patient services should be taken into consideration to ensure patient care is not affected. Understanding and endorsement of biosimilar use by physician leadership, care managers, and pharmacists are crucial before implementation. P&T committee approval with clear delineation of the patient population (naive vs experienced), disease states, and whether the biosimilar would be the preferred medication should be obtained. Transparent communication of clear expectations to patients and coordination with the information technology (IT), contracting, and supply chain departments are necessary before the go-live date. Contracting and IT implementations should ideally take potential changes in biosimilar adaptation into consideration and have enough flexibility to account for these changes. Planned evaluations of patients' experiences with the change to the biosimilar should be incorporated as part of the implementation plan. CONCLUSION: The barriers to biosimilar adaptation are plentiful. Careful planning, clear communication, and coordination with all affected disciplines can ensure successful biosimilar conversion.","output":"Healthcare system conversion to a biosimilar: Trials and tribulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.

Methods: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort survey study to describe the methods used in dialysis units to prevent and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and also the association between these methods and the incidence of COVID-19 among hemodialyzed (HD) patients before the era of vaccination. The study population included all maintenance HD patients (n = 1569) in 14 dialysis units in the Pomeranian Voivodeship. Results: The group of 352 patients (199 men, 153 female) were confirmed for COVID-19. The absolute cumulative incidence in the studied period was 22.4%. It varied widely by dialysis units, ranging from 9.4% to 36.9%. Universal preventive methods were applied by all units. Different additional methods were implemented in some stations with varying frequency (36C86%). In order to quantify the scale of the applied additional preventive methods, we calculated a summary prevention index (PI), i.e., one point for one additional method. Lower incidence was found in centers applying dialysis in isolation of patients hospitalized due to diseases requiring hospitalization (17.42%  6.89 vs. 26.54  6.34; p = 0.028) and higher incidence in medium-size dialysis centers (ANOVA F: p = 0.017). Significant inverse correlation between PI and incidence was demonstrated as well (r = ?0.759; p = 0.002). Conclusions: The higher the number of implemented preventive measures, the lower the risk of COVID-19 infection in HD patients. Among applied procedures the isolation of hospitalized patients is of significant importance. The measures proved to be effective in prevention before the vaccination era should be continued, as the threat of SARS-CoV-2 still exists.","output":"Analysis of Experiences in Preventing COVID-19 in Hemodialysis Centers of the North of Poland before the Era of Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and the Oxford/AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) COVID-19 vaccines have shown excellent safety and efficacy in Phase III trials.

METHODS Seventeen physically active men (24.6  4.3 years) completed 2 30-minute submaximal exercise tests (conditions: upright and recumbent cycle ergometry). Executive function was assessed using the \\"color\\" and \\"word\\" Stroop task, preexercise (resting) and postexercise. Regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) to the prefrontal cortex was continuously monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy. RESULTS Significant improvements in executive function (Stroop color and word tasks) were observed after 30 minutes of exercise for both upright and recumbent cycling (P < .05). However, there were no differences in executive function between cycling conditions (P > .05). A significant increase in rSO2 was recorded immediately postexercise compared with preexercise for both conditions (P < .05), with a trend (P = .06) for higher peak rSO2 following recumbent cycling compared with upright cycling (81.9%  6.5% cf 79.7%  9.3%, respectively).

DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real time analysis. SETTING: 260 hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland between 17 January and 3 July 2020, with a minimum follow-up time of two weeks (to 17 July 2020). PARTICIPANTS: 651 children and young people aged less than 19 years admitted to 138 hospitals and enrolled into the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emergency Infections Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK study with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Admission to critical care (high dependency or intensive care), in-hospital mortality, or meeting the WHO preliminary case definition for MIS-C. RESULTS: Median age was 4.6 (interquartile range 0.3-13.7) years, 35% (225/651) were under 12 months old, and 56% (367/650) were male. 57% (330/576) were white, 12% (67/576) South Asian, and 10% (56/576) black. 42% (276/651) had at least one recorded comorbidity. A systemic mucocutaneous-enteric cluster of symptoms was identified, which encompassed the symptoms for the WHO MIS-C criteria. 18% (116/632) of children were admitted to critical care. On multivariable analysis, this was associated with age under 1 month (odds ratio 3.21, 95% confidence interval 1.36 to 7.66; P=0.008), age 10-14 years (3.23, 1.55 to 6.99; P=0.002), and black ethnicity (2.82, 1.41 to 5.57; P=0.003). Six (1%) of 627 patients died in hospital, all of whom had profound comorbidity. 11% (52/456) met the WHO MIS-C criteria, with the first patient developing symptoms in mid-March. Children meeting MIS-C criteria were older (median age 10.7 (8.3-14.1) v 1.6 (0.2-12.9) years; P<0.001) and more likely to be of non-white ethnicity (64% (29/45) v 42% (148/355); P=0.004). Children with MIS-C were five times more likely to be admitted to critical care (73% (38/52) v 15% (62/404); P<0.001). In addition to the WHO criteria, children with MIS-C were more likely to present with fatigue (51% (24/47) v 28% (86/302); P=0.004), headache (34% (16/47) v 10% (26/263); P<0.001), myalgia (34% (15/44) v 8% (21/270); P<0.001), sore throat (30% (14/47) v (12% (34/284); P=0.003), and lymphadenopathy (20% (9/46) v 3% (10/318); P<0.001) and to have a platelet count of less than 150  109/L (32% (16/50) v 11% (38/348); P<0.001) than children who did not have MIS-C.

However, laparoendoscopic single-site cholecystectomy (LESSC) is a controversial procedure. Its safety, cosmetic results, complications, post-operative pain and post-operative stay are not confirmed by multi-centre randomized controlled studies. OBJECTIVES This review examined the impact of LESSC versus conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC). The primary outcomes were conversional rate and intraoperative and post-operative complications, and other outcomes were cosmetic results, operative time, post-operative pain and post-operative stay. DATA SOURCES Pubmed, EMbase, Web of Science, Ovid, clinical trials of the US National Institutes of Health and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register were searched to identify all possible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS Two reviewers completed article search, and eligible data were entered into a computerized spreadsheet for analysis. RESULTS Nine studies were obtained using the search strategy. Patients accepting LESSC had a higher conversion rate than those having CLC (7.17 (3.00, 17.11) (P < 0.01)). There was no significant difference for total complications between the two groups (1.17 (0.76, 1.80) (P = 0.46)), but incidence of incisional hernia and haemorrhage (seroma) in the LESSC group was obviously higher than that in the CLC group. Operative time was much longer in the LESSC group (mean difference: 10.69 (3.14, 18.24) (P = 0.006)). Cosmetic results favoured LESSC; however, post-operative abdominal pain and post-operative stay were not significantly different between the two groups in most of the nine studies. CONCLUSIONS LESSC can be safely performed with better cosmetic results; however, it carries a higher conversion rate and a longer operative time, and offers no benefit in terms of post-operative abdominal pain and post-operative stay.

Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying fruit weight remain understudied, especially for perennial fruit tree crops such as cultivated loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.). Auxin is known to regulate fruit development, whereas its role and metabolism in fruit development remain obscure in loquat. In this study, we applied a multi-omics approach, integrating whole-genome resequencing-based quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping with an F1 population, population genomics analysis using germplasm accessions, transcriptome analysis, and metabolic profiling to identify the genomic regions potentially associated with fruit weight in loquat. We identified three major loci associated with fruit weight, supported by both QTL mapping and comparative genomic analysis between small- and big-fruited loquat cultivars. Comparison between two genotypes with contrasting fruit weight performance through transcriptomic and metabolic profiling revealed an important role of auxin in regulating fruit development, especially at the fruit enlarging stage. The multi-omics approach identified two homologs of ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 4 (EjEIN4) and TORNADO 1 (EjTRN1) as promising candidates controlling fruit weight. Moreover, three single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were closely associated with fruit weight. Results from this study provided insights from multiple perspectives into the genetic and metabolic controls of fruit weight in loquat.

To understand more about these functions in the context of PEDV M protein, forty host cell proteins interacting with the M protein were identified in the present study by exploiting the proximity-labeling enzyme APEX2 (a mutant soybean ascorbate peroxidase). Bioinformatic analysis showed that the identified host cell proteins were related to fifty-four signal pathways and a wide diversity of biological processes. Interaction between M and five of the identified proteins (RIG-I, PPID, NHE-RF1, S100A11, CLDN4) was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). In addition, knockdown of PPID and S100A11 genes by siRNA significantly improved virus production, indicating that the proteins encoded by the two genes were interfering with or down-regulating virus replication in infected cells.

The primary objective of this cross-sectional study was to elucidate trends on social media in the setting of surgical cancer care affected by the COVID-19 pandemic across the globe. METHODS: A public search of Twitter from April 1 to 30, 2020, was conducted, which yielded 996 posts related to COVID-19 and cancer. Two authors (E.J.K. and H.S.) individually reviewed all posts and recorded the post category, engagement, author category, and geographic location. Data were then analyzed through descriptive analyses. Only English-language posts were included, and any noncancer- or non-COVIDCrelated posts were excluded from the analysis. RESULTS: A total of 734 unique authors from 26 different countries wrote 996 relevant posts that averaged 12.0 likes, 4.7 retweets, and 0.5 hashtags per post. Only 2.3% (23 of 996) of posts included a video. Authors of the included tweets most frequently were friends and families of patients (183; 18.4%), academic institutions or organizations (182; 18.3%), and physicians (138; 13.9%).

Here we propose an entropy-rate based framework, based on combined topological-temporal regularities, for quantifying the predictability of any temporal network. We apply our framework on various model networks, demonstrating that it indeed captures the intrinsic topological-temporal regularities whereas previous methods considered only temporal aspects. We also apply our framework on 18 real networks of different types and determine their predictability. Interestingly, we find that for most real temporal networks, despite the greater complexity of predictability brought by the increase in dimension the combined topological-temporal predictability is higher than the temporal predictability. Our results demonstrate the necessity of incorporating both temporal and topological aspects of networks in order to improve predictions of dynamical processes.","output":"Predictability of real temporal networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has had serious and far-reaching consequences on every aspect of human life. As various countries went into lockdown, hospitality and tourism was badly affected and this has had an impact on hospitality and tourism education too. This paper aims to assess the impact of the pandemic on hospitality and tourism education in India and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies in support of the industry. The study also proposes recommendations for resilience-building. Design/methodology/approach: A pilot survey using semi-structured interviews was conducted and followed by a detailed questionnaire-based survey of industry representatives and educators. Selected industry leaders were also interviewed to understand the industry perspective on the pandemic, the new normal and the expectations of post pandemic graduates. The study focuses on four main areas C (1) existing interrelationships between industry and academia, (2) the efficiency of Internet-based education during the pandemic, (3) the new normal and the expectations of graduates and (4) recommendations for resilience-building. Findings: There is a perceived gap between academia and industry that needs to be bridged. We found that the pandemic is seriously affecting education with challenges ranging from technological issues, disparities and reduced enrolments to student behavioural issues. Most impacted was the practical training component in operational areas and especially in food production and services. It is now clear that education needs a shift in focus from the more traditional, operational aspects of hospitality and tourism to technological awareness, knowledge and soft skills development. The research also identified a need for better two-way communication and information exchange between industry and academia. In fact, the lessons learnt from the pandemic need to be communicated from industry to academia. This is important given that industry expects graduates to be adaptive, compassionate, able to multi-task, familiar with the principles of crisis management and proficient with technology. Originality/value: The study analyses possible long-term effects and implications for the workforce of the future as the industry struggles to respond to the pandemic. The study also suggests possible avenues and methods for industry and academia to form more symbiotic relationships and become more resilient. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospitality and tourism education in India and preparing for the new normal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused massive school closures worldwide and many schools were forced to adopt online teaching mode. Purpose: This survey study aims to examine the effectiveness of online teaching in physical education (PE) and support needed from the teachers perspective. Methods: Responses from 294 frontline PE teachers were collected via an online survey between 4 and 29 January 2021. Results: Four major findings were highlighted in our study. First, most teachers reported that online PE lessons were not effective to improve motor skill acquisition and physical activity level, the major reasons for which were lack of practical training, students lack of learning motivation/interest, and limited interpersonal interactions. Second, most teachers encountered difficulties in online teaching, with major difficulties comprising limited interpersonal interactions and difficult to retain students learning motivation/interest. Third, most teachers felt that online teaching was stressful due to the increased workload in preparation and safety concerns of the home-exercise programme. Fourth, many teachers suggested that schools or governments should provide online teaching kits, such as suggested online lesson plans or home activity recommendations, for their reference. Conclusions: In summary, the effectiveness of online teaching in PE during COVID-19 school closures was generally perceived to be low and difficult by the frontline PE teachers. Schools and governments should provide sufficient support, such as online teaching kits and concrete teaching guidelines, for PE teachers to develop creative and interactive online lessons, which will in turn benefit students in motor skill acquisition and physical activity level. ?

In addition, weather variability is increasing, causing, for example, a greater number of heat waves, many of which are more intense and last longer, and more floods and droughts. These changes are collectively increasing the number of injuries, illnesses, and deaths from a wide range of climate-sensitive health outcomes. Future health risks will be determined not just by the hazards created by a changing climate but also by the sensitivity of individuals and communities exposed to these hazards and the capacity of health systems to prepare for and effectively manage the attendant risks. These risks include deaths and injuries from extreme events (for example, heat waves, storms, and floods), infectious diseases (including food-, water-, and vectorborne illnesses), and food and water insecurity. These risks are unevenly distributed and both create new inequities and exacerbate those that already exist. Most of these risks are projected to increase with each additional unit of warming.

Using examples and argument, this opinion piece examines the nature of evidence. It defines evidence-based practice and considers how it has developed and become important to disaster risk reduction. A definition of what constitutes evidence is difficult to achieve but it must be made in relation to whether the data and information collected can usefully be interpreted and employed to change things for the better. Case histories from past and present centuries show that evidence can sometimes be argued over endlessly. In other cases it is roundly ignored. In yet other instances, false conclusions derived from evidence can become evidence in their own right. Nevertheless, there are situations in disaster risk reduction in which evidence is sorely needed but is clearly lacking. The effectiveness of counter-terrorism measures is one such area.

Understanding patterns of information flow in conversations is a critical step in assessing and improving communication quality. In this paper, we describe COnversational DYnamics Model (CODYM) analysis, a novel approach for studying patterns of information flow in conversations. CODYMs are Markov Models that capture sequential dependencies in the lengths of speaker turns. The proposed method is automated and scalable, and preserves the privacy of the conversational participants. The primary function of CODYM analysis is to quantify and visualize patterns of information flow, concisely summarized over sequential turns from one or more conversations. Our approach is general and complements existing methods, providing a new tool for use in the analysis of any type of conversation. As an important first application, we demonstrate the model on transcribed conversations between palliative care clinicians and seriously ill patients. These conversations are dynamic and complex, taking place amidst heavy emotions, and include difficult topics such as end-of-life preferences and patient values. We use CODYMs to identify normative patterns of information flow in serious illness conversations, show how these normative patterns change over the course of the conversations, and show how they differ in conversations where the patient does or doesnt audibly express anger or fear. Potential applications of CODYMs range from assessment and training of effective healthcare communication to comparing conversational dynamics across languages, cultures, and contexts with the prospect of identifying universal similarities and unique fingerprints of information flow.","output":"A general model of conversational dynamics and an example application in serious illness communication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we present a platform composed of a low-cost robot and a multi-agent system that uses deep learning algorithms, whose objective is to establish a negotiation process and persuasively sell items, maximising their price, thus gain.

Nakai) is widely planted in China and plays a key role in economy. In the autumn of 2016, five pear fruits showing symptoms of brown rot (Fig. 1A) were found in a Suancun farmer market in Kunming, Yunnan Province, China (2502' N; 10242' E). The incidence of this disease in postharvest pear fruits ranged from 2 % to 5 % in this city. Three fruit samples were taken to run further tests. The decayed area of the fruit was soft, brown, slightly sunken, and circular. Carrot baiting was used to isolate the pathogen from symptomatic tissue (Moller et al. 1968). Primary isolates were made by transferring ascospore drops from the tips of the perithecia formed on the carrot discs onto PDA plates. Single ascospore cultures were generated by transferring single ascospores to potatoe dextrose agar (PDA) plates. Cultures were incubated 7 days at 25C with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. In culture, mycelium was initially white, turned to a shallow celadon and gradually to grey-greenish later. Measurements were made 10 days after the formation of perithecia. Six pure cultures (lik-1~lik-6) were stored at -80 C in 15% glycerol and stored at the State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources of Yunnan Agricultural University. Four isolates (lik-1~lik-4) produced ascomatal bases that were submerged in the agar. Bases (Fig. 1E) were globose, black, 192.15 to 250.81 m wide, 192.94 to 251.31 m long, and had straight necks terminating in ostiolar hyphae (Fig. 1F) that were divergent, hyaline, and 74.19 to 116.33 m long. Asci were not observed. Ascospores (Fig. 1I) were ovoid, hat-shaped (dimensions 3.2 to 5.1  2.3 to 4.6 m). Conidiogenous cells were with enteroblastic conidium ontogeny, flask-shaped or tubular, 65.3 to 130.6 m long, and produced cylindrical, straight aseptate conidia (8.5 to 18  2.5 to 3.5 m) (Fig.1 G). All isolates produced dark brown, 10.07 to 13.08 8.51 to 11.64 m aleurioconidia (Fig. 1H). Two (lik-1, lik-3) of six isolates were used for molecular identification and genomic DNA was extracted using the CTAB method (Lee & Taylor 1990). The primers ITS1 and ITS4, EF1F and EF2R were used to amplify and sequence the rDNA-ITS and TEF-1 regions (Thorpe et al. 2005; Jacobs et al. 2004). The sequences of rDNA-ITS of the isolates lik-1 and lik-3 (GenBank Accession Nos: MF153994, MF153993) showed 99.49% similarity to AF395679 (C. fimbriata isolate CMW2219). Additionally, the TEF-1 sequences of isolates lik-1 and lik-3 (GenBank Accession Nos: KY708912, KY708915) showed 100% identify to MF347676 (C. fimbriata isolate CM18). Based on symptoms, morphological characteristics, rDNA-ITS and TEF1- sequence analysis and pathogenicity, this fungus was identified as C. fimbriata. Pathogenicity tests were conducted using 2 isolates (lik-1, lik-3) and repeated three times. Three fresh pear fruits were disinfected with 75% alcohol, then they were wounded with a 2 mm hole punch and inoculated with 200 L conidia suspension of the fungus (approximately 2.0  106 conidia / mL) on the fruit surface. After inoculation pear fruits were incubated in boxes at 25C with a relative humidity of 80% and a 12-h light / 12-h dark cycle. Three pear fruits that served as controls were wounded by punching a 2 mm hole into the skin and inoculated with 200 L sterile distilled water. Symptoms of rot were observed one week after inoculation (Fig.1 B). The diameter of the external lesion varied from 1.5 to 2.5 cm, on average 1.9 cm. When pears were cut, the white pulp had turned black and was rotting (Fig.1 C, D). The pathogen re-isolated from all inoculated symptomatic tissue was identical to the isolates originally obtained from the pear fruits at the market by morphology and ITS analysis. No symptoms developed on the control. The pathogenicity assay showed that C. fimbriata was pathogenic on pears. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. fimbriata on pear in China.

In 2003 and 2012, the world experienced two major coronavirus outbreaks, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), causing major respiratory tract infections. At present, there is neither a vaccine nor a cure for COVID-19. The severe COVID-19 symptoms of hyperinflammation, catastrophic damage to the vascular endothelium, thrombotic complications, septic shock, brain damage, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and acute neurological and psychiatric complications are unprecedented. Many COVID-19 deaths result from the aftermath of hyperinflammatory complications, also referred to as the \\"cytokine storm syndrome\\", endotheliitus and blood clotting, all with the potential to cause multiorgan dysfunction. The sphingolipid rheostat plays integral roles in viral replication, activation/modulation of the immune response, and importantly in maintaining vasculature integrity, with sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) and its cognate receptors (SIPRs: G-protein-coupled receptors) being key factors in vascular protection against endotheliitus. Hence, modulation of sphingosine kinase (SphK), S1P, and the S1P receptor pathway may provide significant beneficial effects towards counteracting the life-threatening, acute, and chronic complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

One of the important findings in this area is that murine double minute 2 (MDM2) oncogene is a negative regulator of wild-type p53. In tumors, expressing wild-type p53, inhibition of MDM2 expression will stabilize p53 and allow it to perform its proapoptotic function, while simultaneously preventing MDM2 from exerting its p53-independent oncogenic effects. The intracellular levels of p53 are tightly regulated by MDM2, as it is a key player in autoregulatory feedback loop under nonstressed conditions. The p53-MDM2 relationship is vital not only for essential functions of the cell, but it also appears to be an integrated part of the complex cellular network which supports the importance of this affair and is a hallmark for its coexistence.

We examined the willingness to accept the vaccine and reasons for vaccine hesitancy, and identified some factors associated with the vaccine hesitancy among the socio-economically disadvantaged urban population from Delhi, India. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of a randomly selected sample of 1539 households from 31 urban clusters. Data on socio-demographics, health beliefs, and willingness to accept the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were collected through a face-to-face interviewer-administered, pre-tested questionnaire from an adult member. Vaccine acceptance/hesitancy was analysed by various socio-demographic and health belief variables. Multinomial regressions were carried out to identify the factors associated with the vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: Overall, 64.9% (95% CI: 62.5 to 67.3) of the respondents would accept the vaccine, 17.4% (95% CI: 15.6 to 19.4) were undecided, and 17.7% (95% CI: 15.8 to 19.7) would not accept the vaccine. The reasons for not accepting the vaccine were: belief that they had immunity (12.9%), the corona was a hoax (11.8%), the vaccine was not necessary (7.4%), and did not want to disturb the natural bodily systems by the vaccine (5.6%). The undecided group mainly would like to wait and see (37.7%), decide when the vaccine become available (11.6%), will take if everyone in their community takes (10.4%). Multinomial logistic regression identified older age, low perceived susceptibility of contracting COVID-19, low perceived severity of COVID-19, low self-efficacy to protect against COVID-19, and unawareness and non-use of Arogyasetu App as significant predictors of vaccine hesitancy. CONCLUSIONS: Two-thirds of Delhis low-income groups would accept the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

Transmission from infected patients to healthcare personnel has also been observed and is irredeemable with present technology. Genetic studies on MERS-CoV have shown that ORF 1ab encodes replicase polyproteins and play a foremost role in viral infection. Therefore, ORF 1ab replicase polyprotein may be used as suitable target for disease control. Viral activity can be controlled by RNA interference (RNAi) technology, a leading method for post transcriptional gene silencing in a sequence specific manner. However, there is a genetic inconsistency in different viral isolates; it is a great challenge to design potential RNAi (miRNA and siRNA) molecules which can silence the respective target genes rather than any other viral gene simultaneously. In current study four effective miRNA and five siRNA molecules for silencing of nine different strains of MERS-CoV were rationally designed and corroborated using computational methods, which might lead to knockdown the activity of virus. siRNA and miRNA molecules were predicted against ORF1ab gene of different strains of MERS-CoV as effective candidate using computational methods. Thus, this method may provide an insight for the chemical synthesis of antiviral RNA molecule for the treatment of MERS-CoV, at genomic level.","output":"Design of potential RNAi (miRNA and siRNA) molecules for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) gene silencing by computational method."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To explore a modified CT scoring system, its feasibility for disease severity evaluation and its predictive value in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods: This study was a multi-center retrospective cohort study. Patients confirmed with COVID-19 were recruited in three medical centers located in Beijing, Wuhan and Nanchang from January 27, 2020 to March 8, 2020. Demographics, clinical data, and CT images were collected. CT were analyzed by two emergency physicians of more than ten years' work experience independently through a modified scoring system. Final score was determined by average score from the two reviewers if consensus was not reached. The lung was divided into 6 zones (upper, middle, and lower on both sides) by the level of trachea carina and the level of lower pulmonary veins. The target lesion types included ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, overall lung involvement, and crazy-paving pattern. Bronchiectasis, cavity, pleural effusion, etc., were not included in CT reading and analysis because of low incidence. The reviewers evaluated the extent of the targeted patterns (GGO, consolidation) and overall affected lung parenchyma for each zone, using Likert scale, ranging from 0-4 (0=absent; 1=1%-25%; 2=26%-50%; 3=51%-75%; 4=76%-100%). Thus, GGO score, consolidation score, and overall lung involvement score were sum of 6 zones ranging from 0-24. For crazy-paving pattern, it was only coded as absent or present (0 or 1) for each zone and therefore ranging from 0-6. Results: A total of 197 patients from 3 medical centers and 522 CT scans entered final analysis. The median age of the patients was 64 years, and 54.8% were male. There were 76(38.8%) patients had hypertension and 30(15.3%) patients had diabetes mellitus. There were 75 of the patients classified as moderate cases, as well as 95 severe cases and 27 critical cases. As initial symptom, dry cough occurred in 170 patients, 134 patients had fever, and 125 patients had dyspnea. Reparatory rate, oxygen saturation, lymphocyte count and CURB 65 score on admission day varied among patients with different disease severity scale. There were 50 of the patients suffered from deterioration during hospital stay. The median time consumed for each CT by clinicians was 86.5 seconds. Cronbach's alpha for GGO, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, and overall lung involvement between two clinicians were 0.809, 0.712, 0.678, and 0.906, respectively, showing good or excellent inter-rater correlation. There were 193 (98.0%) patients had GGO, 147 (74.6%) had consolidation, and 126(64.0%) had crazy-paving pattern throughout clinical course. Bilateral lung involvement was observed in 183(92.9%) patients. Median time of interval for CT scan in our study was 7 days so that the whole clinical course was divided into stages by week for further analysis. From the second week on, the CT scores of various types of lesions in severe or critically patients were higher than those of moderate cases. After the fifth week, the course of disease entered the recovery period. The CT score of the upper lung zones was lower than that of other zones in moderate and severe cases. Similar distribution was not observed in critical patients. For moderate cases, the ground glass opacity score at the second week had predictive value for the escalation of the severity classification during hospitalization. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.849, the best cut-off value was 5 points, with sensitivity of 84.2% and specificity of 75.0%. Conclusions: It is feasible for clinicians to use the modified semi-quantitative CT scoring system to evaluate patients with COVID-19. Severe/critical patients had higher scores for ground glass opacity, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, and overall lung involvement than moderate cases. The ground glass opacity score in the second week had an optimal predictive value for escalation of disease severity during hospitalization in moderate patients on admission. The frequency of CT scan should be reduced after entering the recovery stage.","output":"[Spatial and temporal distribution and predictive value of chest CT scoring in patients with COVID-19]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The hypothesis of the study was that a multidisciplinary approach involving experienced specialists in diffuse parenchymal lung disease might improve the diagnosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia","output":"The Diagnostic Yield of the Multidisciplinary Discussion in Patients With COVID-19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: An efficient surface cleaning strategy would first target cleaning to surfaces that make large contributions to the risk of infections. METHODS: In this study, we used data from the literature about methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and developed an ordinary differential equations based mathematical model to quantify the impact of contact heterogeneity on MRSA transmission in a hypothetical 6-bed intensive care unit (ICU). The susceptible patients are divided into two types, these who are cared by the same nurse as the MRSA infected patient (Type 1) and these who are not (Type 2). RESULTS: The results showed that the mean MRSA concentration on three kinds of susceptible patient nearby surfaces was significantly linearly associated with the hand-touch frequency (p < 0.05). The noncompliance of daily cleaning on patient nearby high-touch surfaces (HTSs) had the most impact on MRSA transmission. If the HTSs were not cleaned, the MRSA exposure to Type 1 and 2 susceptible patients would increase 118.4% (standard deviation (SD): 33.0%) and 115.4% (SD: 30.5%) respectively. The communal surfaces (CSs) had the least impact, if CSs were not cleaned, the MRSA exposure to Type 1 susceptible patient would only increase 1.7% (SD: 1.3). The impact of clinical equipment (CE) differed largely for two types of susceptible patients. If the CE was not cleaned, the exposure to Type 1 patients would only increase 8.4% (SD: 3.0%), while for Type 2 patients, it can increase 70.4% (SD: 25.4%). CONCLUSIONS: This study provided a framework to study the pathogen concentration dynamics on environmental surfaces and quantitatively showed the importance of cleaning patient nearby HTSs on controlling the nosocomial infection transmission via contact route.","output":"Quantifying the relative impact of contact heterogeneity on MRSA transmission in ICUs - a modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Under social-distancing directives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, universities faced the problem of how to teach without providing access to the university installations.

DESIGN: Simulation agent based modeling study. SETTING: Simulated population based on real world US county. PARTICIPANTS: The simulation included 100 000 agents, with a representative distribution of demographics and occupations. Networks of contacts were established to simulate potentially infectious interactions though occupation, household, and random interactions. INTERVENTIONS: Simulation of standard covid-19 vaccination versus delayed second dose vaccination prioritizing the first dose. The simulation runs were replicated 10 times. Sensitivity analyses included first dose vaccine efficacy of 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% after day 12 post-vaccination; vaccination rate of 0.1%, 0.3%, and 1% of population per day; assuming the vaccine prevents only symptoms but not asymptomatic spread (that is, non-sterilizing vaccine); and an alternative vaccination strategy that implements delayed second dose for people under 65 years of age, but not until all those above this age have been vaccinated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative covid-19 mortality, cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections, and cumulative hospital admissions due to covid-19 over 180 days. RESULTS: Over all simulation replications, the median cumulative mortality per 100 000 for standard dosing versus delayed second dose was 226 v 179, 233 v 207, and 235 v 236 for 90%, 80%, and 70% first dose efficacy, respectively. The delayed second dose strategy was optimal for vaccine efficacies at or above 80% and vaccination rates at or below 0.3% of the population per day, under both sterilizing and non-sterilizing vaccine assumptions, resulting in absolute cumulative mortality reductions between 26 and 47 per 100 000. The delayed second dose strategy for people under 65 performed consistently well under all vaccination rates tested. CONCLUSIONS: A delayed second dose vaccination strategy, at least for people aged under 65, could result in reduced cumulative mortality under certain conditions.","output":"Public health impact of delaying second dose of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 covid-19 vaccine: simulation agent based modeling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Epidemics of hospitalization for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occur annually during the Christmas holidays, and COPD exacerbations commonly coincide with respiratory viral infections. OBJECTIVE To compare the incidence and determinants of COPD exacerbations occurring between the Christmas holiday period and the remainder of the winter season. METHODS Seventy-one subjects with COPD of mixed severity faxed daily symptom diaries to a computer monitoring system from December 1, 2006, to April 30, 2007. Possible exacerbations prompted a home visit for assessment, spirometry and specimen collection for virological testing. RESULTS Study subjects submitted a total of 95.4% of possible daily symptom diary sheets by fax. Of 114 possible COPD exacerbations detected using the faxed diaries, 110 met the Anthonisen criteria for true exacerbations. A total of 47 exacerbations (mean 6.7/week) occurred during the Christmas holiday period, while 63 exacerbations (mean 4.3/week) occurred during the remainder of winter. Of the Christmas period exacerbations and of those in the balance of winter, 21 (44%) and 20 (32%), respectively, coincided with respiratory viral infections. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of COPD exacerbations during the Christmas period was greater than during the rest of winter in 2006/2007 and peaked immediately before Christmas - in contrast to hospital presentation for COPD, which peaked during the Christmas week. No clear role of respiratory viral infections in the increased rate of exacerbations during the Christmas period was established in the present study. COPD patients were highly compliant with daily symptom reporting using faxed daily diaries, which permitted nearly complete detection of all exacerbations that occurred at incidence.","output":"The Christmas season as a risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper critically considers the operation and objective of Japans creative industry policy and suggests how to redesign it to align it with recent attention to cultural diversity.

Different approaches have been proposed to classify and evaluate driving performance to ensure road safety. However, most of the techniques are based on neural networks which work like a black box and make the logical reasoning behind the classification decision unclear. In this paper, we propose a rule-based machine learning technique using a sequential covering algorithm to classify the driving maneuvers from time-series data. In the sequential covering algorithm, the impact of each rule is measured as the metrics of coverage and accuracy, where the coverage and accuracy indicate the amount of covered and correctly identified instances in a maneuver class, respectively. The final ruleset for each maneuver class is formed with only the significant rules. In this way, the rules are learned in an unsupervised manner and only the best performance of the rules are included in the ruleset. The set of rules is also optimized by pruning based on the performance of the test data. Application of the proposed system is beneficial compared to the traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches which typically require a larger dataset and higher computational time and complexity.","output":"Driving maneuver classification from time series data: a rule based machine learning approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background:Bacterial co-pathogens are commonly identified in viral respiratory tract infections such as influenza and are an im- portant cause of morbidity and mortality, necessitating timely diagnosis and antibacterial therapy1-3.

This study aims to define the debates around the diagnosis of infectious diseases and their associated issues. After looking at the side effects of Infectious Diseases, it becomes difficult to distinguish the types of Infectious Diseases and their severities. It is difficult to detect the efficiency in treating a patient record and predicting the length of medicine because the indeterminacy, false components, amplitude term (A-term), phase term (P-term), and sub parametric values are commonly rejected in terms of practical evaluation. This paper introduces the Complex Neutrosophic Hypersoft (CNHS) set and CNHS mapping with its inverse mapping to overcome these limitations. This theory will be more flexible in three ways. First, it includes indeterminacy and falsity components, which will utilise parametric values to analyse data in all three dimensions of the patient's illness: positive, indeterminant, and negative. Secondly, for easier understanding, it separates the various attributes into distinct attribute-valued sets. Third, it provides for a large range of membership function values by expanding membership to the unit circle on an Argand plane and introducing an additional term known as the P-term to account for the periodic character of the data. To correctly analyse the problem, these principles can be coupled with scientific modelling. This study demonstrates a correlation between symptoms and treatments. A table with a fuzzily defined gap between 0 and 1 is created for different types of infectious diseases. The computation is based on CNHS mapping in order to properly detect the condition and select the appropriate prescription for each patient's ailment. Eventually, a generalised CNHS mapping is offered, which can assist a doctor in releasing the chronology of the patient's health status and predicting the time frame of therapy until the sickness is cleared.","output":"Infectious Diseases Diagnosis and Treatment Suggestions Using Complex Neutrosophic Hypersoft Mapping"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a case of COVID\\\\19 in kidney transplant patient in Thailand.

SARS-CoV-2 encodes a Spike (S) protein that binds to human ACE2 receptor to mediate cell entry. A species with a human-like ACE2 receptor could therefore be at risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2. We compared between 132 mammalian ACE2 genes and between 17 coronavirus S proteins. We showed that while global similarities reflected by whole ACE2 gene alignments are poor predictors of high-risk mammals, local similarities at key S protein-binding sites highlight several high-risk mammals that share good ACE2 homology with human. Bats are likely reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2, but there are other high-risk mammals that share better ACE2 homologies with human. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are closely related to bat coronavirus. Yet, among host-specific coronaviruses infecting high-risk mammals, key ACE2-binding sites on S proteins share highest similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV and between SARS-CoV and Civet-CoV. These results suggest that direct coronavirus transmission from bat to human is unlikely, and that rapid adaptation of a bat SARS-like coronavirus in different high-risk intermediate hosts could have allowed it to acquire distinct high binding potential between S protein and human-like ACE2 receptors.","output":"Predicting mammalian species at risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 from an ACE2 perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are many young people who experience mental health and wellbeing challenges.

We sought to describe the extent to which pandemic-related changes in service delivery and access affected use of primary care for children overall and by equity strata in the 9 months after pandemic onset in Manitoba and Ontario. METHODS: We performed a population-based study of children aged 17 years or less with provincial health insurance in Ontario or Manitoba before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (Jan. 1, 2017CNov. 28, 2020). We calculated the weekly rates of in-person and virtual primary care well-child and sick visits, overall and by age group, neighbourhood material deprivation level, rurality and immigrant status, and assessed changes in visit rates after COVID-19 restrictions were imposed compared to expected baseline rates calculated for the 3 years before pandemic onset. RESULTS: Among almost 3 million children in Ontario and more than 300 000 children in Manitoba, primary care visit rates declined to 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77C0.82) of expected in Ontario and 0.82 (95% CI 0.79C0.84) of expected in Manitoba in the 9 months after the onset of the pandemic. Virtual visits accounted for 53% and 29% of visits in Ontario and Manitoba, respectively. The largest monthly decreases in visits occurred in April 2020. Although visit rates increased slowly after April 2020, they had not returned to prerestriction levels by November 2020 in either province. Children aged more than 1 year to 12 years experienced the greatest decrease in visits, especially for well-child care. Compared to prepandemic levels, visit rates were lowest among rural Manitobans, urban Ontarians and Ontarians in low-income neighbourhoods. INTERPRETATION: During the study period, the pandemic contributed to rapid, immediate and inequitable decreases in primary care use, with some recovery and a substantial shift to virtual care. Postpandemic planning must consider the need for catch-up visits, and the long-term impacts warrant further study.","output":"Pediatric primary care in Ontario and Manitoba after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic: a population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The first cases of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus were reported in China in December 2019. The disease has since spread globally. Many countries have instated measures to slow the spread of the virus. Information about the spread of the virus in a country can inform the gradual reopening of a country and help to avoid a second wave of infections. Our study focuses on Denmark, which is opening up when this study is performed (end-May 2020) after a lockdown in mid-March. METHODS: We perform a phylogenetic analysis of 742 publicly available Danish SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and put them into context using sequences from other countries. RESULTS: Our findings are consistent with several introductions of the virus to Denmark from independent sources. We identify several chains of mutations that occurred in Denmark. In at least one case we find evidence that the virus spread from Denmark to other countries. A number of the mutations found in Denmark are non-synonymous, and in general there is a considerable variety of strains. The proportions of the most common haplotypes remain stable after lockdown. CONCLUSION: Employing phylogenetic methods on Danish genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2, we exemplify how genetic data can be used to trace the introduction of a virus to a country. This provides alternative means for verifying existing assumptions. For example, our analysis supports the hypothesis that the virus was brought to Denmark by skiers returning from Ischgl. On the other hand, we identify transmission routes which suggest that Denmark was part of a network of countries among which the virus was being transmitted. This challenges the common narrative that Denmark only got infected from abroad. Our analysis concerning the ratio of haplotypes does not indicate that the major haplotypes appearing in Denmark have a different degree of virality.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 transmission routes from genetic data: A Danish case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 mRNA vaccines were shown to be highly efficacious in preventing the disease in randomized controlled trials; nonetheless, evidence on the real-world effectiveness of this vaccine is limited. Study objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of BNT162b2 vaccine in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality. METHODS: This historical cohort study included members of a large health provider in Israel that were vaccinated with at least one dose of BNT162b2. The primary outcome was incidence rate of a SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed with rt-PCR, between 7 to 27 days after second dose (protection-period), as compared to days 1 to 7 after the first dose, where no protection by the vaccine is assumed (reference-period). RESULTS: Data of 1,178,597 individuals vaccinated with BNT162b2 were analyzed (mean age 47.7 years [SD=18.1], 48.4% males) of whom 872,454 (74.0%) reached the protection period. Overall, 4514 infections occurred during the reference period compared to 728 during the protection period, yielding a weighted mean daily incidence of 54.8 per 100,000 (95%CI: 26.1-115.0 per 100,000) and 5.4 per 100,000 (95%CI: 3.5-8.4 per 100,000), respectively. The vaccine effectiveness in preventing infection was 90% (95%CI:79%- 95%) and 94% (95%CI:88%-97%) against COVID-19. Among immunosuppressed patients, vaccine effectiveness against infection was 71% (95%CI:37%-87%). The adjusted hazard ratios for hospitalization in those infected were 0.82 (95%CI:0.36-1.88), 0.45 (95%CI:0.23-0.90), and 0.56 (95%CI:0.36-0.89) in the age groups 16-44, 45-64 and 75 and above, respectively.

Age was found to have an influence on several biochemical parameters that may be related to growth, a developing immune system, and differences in diet. Seasonal differences in diet of coastal brown hyenas also had an overall significant effect on lipemia values, and differences in stress due to varying capture methods could be associated with an increase in glucose and creatinine kinase. Comparisons among hyena species from published data were inconclusive, as some samples may have been derived from captive populations and individuals. Sera were tested for antibodies against 18 pathogens. Antibodies were not detected for most pathogens, but the proportion of sera containing antibodies against canine adenovirus-1 (CAV-1) and canine adenovirus-2 (CAV-2) was 65% and 84%, respectively. There was no effect of sex, age, year of sampling, or contact with domestic dogs, indicating that CAV-1 or CAV-2 may be enzootic. The prevalence of antibodies to canine distemper virus (CDV) was 43%, and older brown hyenas were 6.9 times more likely to have been exposed to CDV, adjusting for year of sampling and degree of estimated contact with domestic dogs, suggesting epizootic outbreaks.

In many cases, and for a variety of reasons, NSAGs perform some form of governance in these territories, which can include the maintenance of order or the provision of justice, health care, or social services. The significance of such measures became particularly apparent when in 2020 not only governments but also armed groups took steps to halt the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. This article examines key legal issues that arise in these contexts. First, it analyzes the extent to which international humanitarian law protects the life and dignity of persons living under the control of NSAGs, rebutting doubts as to whether this field of international law has a role in regulating what is sometimes called rebel governance. Second, it provides a brief overview of aspects of the lives of people in armed group-controlled territory that are addressed by international humanitarian law and aspects that instead fall into the realm of human rights law. Third, the article discusses whether and to what extent human rights law can be said to bind NSAGs as a matter of law and flags issues that need further attention in current and future debates. ?

Bats are also major hosts for biological agents responsible for zoonoses, such as coronaviruses (CoVs). The islands of the Western Indian Ocean are identified as a major biodiversity hotspot, with more than 50 bat species. In this study, we tested 1,013 bats belonging to 36 species from Mozambique, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Reunion Island and Seychelles, based on molecular screening and partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene. In total, 88 bats (8.7%) tested positive for coronaviruses, with higher prevalence in Mozambican bats (20.5%  4.9%) as compared to those sampled on islands (4.5%  1.5%). Phylogenetic analyses revealed a large diversity of - and -CoVs and a strong signal of co-evolution between CoVs and their bat host species, with limited evidence for host-switching, except for bat species sharing day roost sites. These results highlight that strong variation between islands does exist and is associated with the composition of the bat species community on each island.

This legal research is carried out by making an inventory of various primary and secondary legal materials so as to obtain relevant and critical studies of the legal issues discussed. The results of this legal research are that the discretion made by government officials can be justified legally if it is relevant to several provisions contained in legislation for the realization of good emergency governance;and the existence of a circular letter is legally valid if it is in accordance with the laws and regulations and the General Principles of Good Governance by understanding that a circular is not a product of rules that are in the order of national legislation. Thus, a circular does not have strong and binding legal legitimacy. Therefore, the researcher recommends the criteria and classification of the parameters of discretion in the form of a circular as outlined in the form of a Supreme Court Regulation.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is less frequent and less severe in children than in adults. This study analyzed the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection among all children aged <18 years in the Apulia region of southern Italy and the characteristics of the infected children. Clinical and demographic data were collected through the national platform for COVID-19 surveillance. Of the 166 infected children in the Apulia region, 104 (62.6%) were asymptomatic, 37 (22.3%) had mild infections, 22 (13.3%) had moderate infections, and 3 (1.8%) had severe infections. Only ten children (6.0%) were hospitalized, but none required intensive care support and none died. SARS-CoV-2 infection was transmitted mainly from parents or relatives to children. Because of school closure during the lockdown, infection was unlikely to have been transmitted among children. It is unclear whether school reopening would enhance virus spread, leading the Italian government to develop guidelines for safe school reopening. The actual role of children in virus transmission remains unclear. A sensitive surveillance system, prompt identification of cases, testing, and contact tracing will be key to reducing the further spread of infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Children in Southern Italy: A Descriptive Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To identify the ways in which healthcare information and communication technologies can be improved to address the challenges raised by the COVID-19 pandemic.

PN has been shown to induce either classic apoptosis or alternative caspase-independent forms of cell death in many tumor models. The therapeutical potential of PN has been increased by chemical design and synthesis of more soluble analogues including dimethylaminoparthenolide (DMAPT). This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms of both PN and analogues action in tumor models, highlighting their effects on gene expression, signal transduction and execution of different types of cell death. Recent findings indicate that these compounds not only inhibit prosurvival transcriptional factors such as NF-B and STATs but can also determine the activation of specific death pathways, increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and modifications of Bcl-2 family members. An intriguing property of these compounds is its specific targeting of cancer stem cells.

To reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), public health officials recommend against touching one's face, as the virus is transmitted through mucous membranes in the mouth, nose and eyes. Students, office workers, medical personnel and people on trains were found to touch their faces between 9 and 23 times per hour. This paper introduces FaceGuard, a system that utilizes deep learning to predict hand movements that result in touching the face, and provides sensory feedback to stop the user from touching the face. The system utilizes an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to obtain features that characterize hand movement involving face touching. Time-series data can be efficiently classified using 1D-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with minimal feature engineering;1D-CNN filters automatically extract temporal features in IMU data. Thus, a 1D-CNN based prediction model is developed and trained with data from 4,800 trials recorded from 40 participants. Training data are collected for hand movements involving face touching during various everyday activities such as sitting, standing, or walking. Results showed that while the average time needed to touch the face is 1,200 ms, a prediction accuracy of more than 92% is achieved with less than 550 ms of IMU data. As for the sensory response, the paper presents a psychophysical experiment to compare the response time for three sensory feedback modalities, namely visual, auditory, and vibrotactile. Results demonstrate that the response time is significantly smaller for vibrotactile feedback (427.3 ms) compared to visual (561.70 ms) and auditory (520.97 ms). Furthermore, the success rate (to avoid face touching) is also statistically higher for vibrotactile and auditory feedback compared to visual feedback. These results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting a hand movement and providing timely sensory feedback within less than a second in order to avoid face touching.","output":"FaceGuard: A Wearable System To Avoid Face Touching"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemic propels international efforts to understand incidence of rare side effects.","output":"Global project gears up to study vaccine safety."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the past, many assumptions were made about the benefits and perils of online learning In addition, many conversations were had as to which populations of students were best suited for and most accepting of online coursework With the dramatic shift online forced upon us by the onset of COVID, some of these assumptions were tested Several assumptions are discussed in this paper Current US university data reporting is reviewed and a case study examining the way some of these assumptions are playing out in an online CS I course are examined There is much we can learn from our online teaching during the pandemic, here we examine a few of the discoveries that have come to light ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Examining Ways COVID-19 Adaptation Derailed our Assumptions about Online Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This invited commentary discusses the article by Richards et al. describing differences in rates of on-time HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening in 2018 among enrollees in different insurance plans.

To assess the current state of mathematical models for the global spread of infectious diseases, we reviewed the literature highlighting common approaches and good practice, and identifying research gaps. We followed a scoping study method and extracted information from 78 records on: modelling approaches; input data (epidemiological, population, and travel) for model parameterization; model validation data. We found that most epidemiological data come from published journal articles, population data come from a wide range of sources, and travel data mainly come from statistics or surveys, or commercial datasets. The use of commercial datasets may benefit the modeller, however makes critical appraisal of their model by other researchers more difficult. We found a minority of records (26) validated their model. We posit that this may be a result of pandemics, or far-reaching epidemics, being relatively rare events compared with other modelled physical phenomena (e.g. climate change). The sparsity of such events, and changes in outbreak recording, may make identifying suitable validation data difficult. We appreciate the challenge of modelling emerging infections given the lack of data for both model parameterisation and validation, and inherent complexity of the approaches used. However, we believe that open access datasets should be used wherever possible to aid model reproducibility and transparency.

METHODS: A single-centre retrospective observational study was conducted of all orthopaedic oncologic patients undergoing surgical evaluation from March to June 2020. Patients were prioritized as level 0-IV, 0 being elective and IV being emergent. Only priority levels 0 to III were included. Delay duration was measured in days and resulting morbidities were categorized into seven groups: prolonged pain/disability; unplanned preoperative radiation and/or chemotherapy; local tumour progression; increased systemic disease; missed opportunity for surgery due to progression of disease/lost to follow up; delay in diagnosis; and no morbidity. RESULTS: Overall, 25 patients met inclusion criteria. There were eight benign tumours, seven metastatic, seven primary sarcomas, one multiple myeloma, and two patients without a biopsy proven diagnosis. There was no priority level 0, two priority level I, six priority level II, and 17 priority level III cases. The mean duration of delay for priority level I was 114 days (84 to 143), priority level II was 88 days (63 to 133), and priority level III was 77 days (35 to 269). Prolonged pain/disability and delay in diagnosis, affecting 52% and 40%,respectively, represented the two most frequent morbidities. Local tumour progression and increased systemic disease affected 32% and 24% respectively. No patients tested positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 related delays in surgical management led to major morbidity in this studied orthopaedic oncologic patient population. By understanding these morbidities through clearer hindsight, a thoughtful approach can be developed to balance the risk of COVID-19 exposure versus delay in treatment, ensuring optimal care for orthopedic oncologic patients as the pandemic continues with intermittent calls for halting surgery.

The implications of the COVID-19 pandemic reaches far beyond the immediate mortality and morbidity aspects caused by the virus directly. There are many indirect effects of the outbreak that affect health through various pathways. This includes secondary consequences of COVID-19 on long-term health and wellbeing, including consequences due to delayed prevention, diagnosis, and medical treatment. Within the Population Health Information Research Infrastructure (PHIRI), best available evidence for research on health and well-being of populations as impacted by COVID-19 is generated and facilitated by a research infrastructure on population health. It supports research across Europe through the identification, access, assessment and reuse of population health and non-health data to underpin public health policy decisions. PHIRI is a practical use case and lays the foundation for ultimately developing a Distributed Infrastructure on Population Health (DIPoH). The joint workshop aims to raise the awareness and ensure a better understanding of the complexity of the wider effects of COVID-19 on population health across Europe. To provide insights of how the wider impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could be assessed, tools and methodological approaches gained within PHIRI and WHO are presented. Knowledge and expertise developed across Europe is shared in this workshop which is key to supported countries to address the COVID-19 crisis. The workshop will begin with a presentation on monitoring the wider effects of COVID-19 on population health as set out by the WHO. This will be followed, after a short introduction on PHIRI, by three presentations which highlight key activities of assessing the wider impact of COVID-19 by PHIRI. The first on research methodologies evaluated across Europe to assess the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 on population wellbeing, morbidity and mortality across European countries. The second at COVID-19 impacts in specific subgroups and risk settings by conducting research through four use cases of immediate relevance. This facilitates research by making scalable, reproducible methods available within PHIRI. Finally, the third on insights in possible future health impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak by foresight and modelling scenarios for national situations as well as the provision of research capacity to strengthen the evidence-informed policy decisions on direct/indirect effects of COVID-19 will be presented. Exchange with the audience will facilitate knowledge and opinion exchange through an interactive Mentimeter poll during the session, to offer the delegates to share, in real time, their perspectives on selected questions based on the four presentations. KEY MESSAGES: The main outputs will support European countries to develop tools and methodologies for measuring the wider impacts of COVID-19 on population health within and across countries. The results will support the exchange of knowledge and expertise across Europe by facilitating insights in the assessment of direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 on population health.","output":"3.B.

The main object of this systematic review was to assess the relationship between the ABO blood group and the occurrence and severity of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search using appropriate MeSH terms was performed through Medline and PubMed. The outcomes considered were the prevalence of the blood group O vs non-O types in SARS-CoV-2 infected and non-infected subjects, and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection according to ABO group. The methodological quality of the studies included in the analysis was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the overall quality of the available evidence using the GRADE system. Benchmarks used to evaluate the effect size were odd ratios (ORs) for case control studies and risk ratios (RRs) for cohort studies. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included in the analysis. Overall, individuals with group O had a lower infection rate compared to individuals of non-O group (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.86). However, the difference in the effect size was significantly lower in cohort studies compared to case control studies. No evidence was found indicating an effect of the O type on the disease severity in the infected patients. DISCUSSION: We have found low/very low evidence that group O individuals are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to those in the non-O group. No evidence was found indicating an effect of the O type on disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"ABO blood group and COVID-19: an updated systematic literature review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In patients with severe forms of COVID-19, thromboelastometry has been reported to display a hypercoagulant pattern. However, an algorithm to differentiate severe COVID-19 patients from nonsevere patients and healthy controls based on thromboelastometry parameters has not been developed.

A healthy control (HC, n = 9) group was also examined. Blood samples from all participants were tested by extrinsic (EXTEM), intrinsic (INTEM), non-activated (NATEM) and functional assessment of fibrinogen (FIBTEM) assays of thromboelastometry. The thrombodynamic potential index (TPI) was also calculated. Severe COVID-19 patients exhibited a thromboelastometry profile with clear hypercoagulability, which was significantly different from the NS and HC groups. Nonsevere COVID-19 cases showed a trend to thrombotic pole. The NATEM test suggested that nonsevere and severe COVID-19 patients presented endogenous coagulation activation (reduced clotting time and clot formation time). TPI data were significantly different between the NS and S groups. The maximum clot firmness profile obtained by FIBTEM showed moderate/elevated accuracy to differentiate severe patients from NS and HC.

Objectives In France, a lockdown was enforced from March 17 to May 11, 2020. It was renewed with differents modalities from April 3 to May 3, 2021. Our objective was to compare the epidemiology of hand and wrist trauma injuries during these periods to a control period, with the hypothesis of a decreased incidence of hand and wrist trauma. Methods Patients consulting at a trauma emergency center of a university hospital labeled SOS-Mains were included during lockdowns, and were compared with a control group who consulted during an equivalent period in 2019. We retrospectively collected demographic and clinical data in relation to hand and wrist injuries. Results During lockdowns, there was an increase in these injuries relative to the total number of patients (from 16% to 22% et 18%). We found a decrease during the first lockdown in the number of fractures, amputations, burns, infections, injuries secondary to a work accident and isolated wounds but a significantly higher proportion of tendon and vasculonervous injuries in the first lockdown (12% vs 4%).

In this study, we carried out a systematic analysis of clinical characteristics in COVID-19 patients to determine potential risk factors for cardiac injury complicated COVID-19 virus infection. METHODS: We systematically searched relevant literature published in Pubmed, Embase, Europe PMC, CNKI and other databases. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA 16.0. RESULTS: We analysed 5726 confirmed cases from 17 studies. The results indicated that compared with non-cardiac-injured patients, patients with cardiac injury are older, with a greater proportion of male patients, with higher possibilities of existing comorbidities, with higher risks of clinical complications, need for mechanical ventilation, ICU transfer and mortality. Moreover, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimer, NT-proBNP and blood creatinine in patients with cardiac injury are also higher while lymphocyte counts and platelet counts decreased. However, we fortuitously found that patients with cardiac injury did not present higher clinical specificity for chest distress (P = 0.304), chest pain (P = 0.334), palpitations (P = 0.793) and smoking (P = 0.234). Similarly, the risk of concomitant arrhythmia (P = 0.103) did not increase observably either. CONCLUSION: Age, male gender and comorbidities are risk factors for cardiac injury complicated COVID-19 infection. Such patients are susceptible to complications and usually have abnormal results of laboratory tests, leading to poor outcomes. Contrary to common cardiac diseases, cardiac injury complicated COVID-19 infection did not significantly induce chest distress, chest pain, palpitations or arrhythmias.

Objective: To describe individuals' concerns regarding violence in the context of the pandemic, experiences of pandemic-related unfair treatment, prevalence of and reasons for firearm acquisition, and changes in firearm storage practices due to the pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study used data from the 2020 California Safety and Well-being Survey, a probability-based internet survey of California adults conducted from July 14 to 27, 2020. Respondents came from the Ipsos KnowledgePanel, an online research panel with members selected using address-based sampling methods. Responses were weighted to be representative of the adult population of California. Main Outcomes and Measures: Topics included worry about violence for oneself before and during the pandemic; concern about violence for someone else due to a pandemic-related loss; experiences of unfair treatment attributed to the pandemic; firearm and ammunition acquisition due to the pandemic; and changes in firearm storage practices due to the pandemic. Results: Of 5018 invited panel members, 2870 completed the survey (completion rate, 57%). Among respondents (52.3% [95% CI, 49.5%-55.0%] women; mean [SD] age, 47.9 [16.9] years; 41.9% [95% CI, 39.3%-44.6%] White individuals), self-reported worry about violence for oneself was significantly higher during the pandemic for all violence types except mass shootings, ranging from a 2.8 percentage point increase for robbery (from 65.5% [95% CI, 62.8%-68.0%] to 68.2% [95% CI, 65.6%-70.7%]; P = .008) to a 5.6 percentage point increase for stray bullet shootings (from 44.5% [95% CI, 41.7%-47.3%] to 50.0% [47.3%-52.8%]; P < .001). The percentage of respondents concerned that someone they know might intentionally harm themselves was 13.1% (95% CI, 11.5%-15.3%). Of those, 7.5% (95% CI, 4.5%-12.2%) said it was because the other person had experienced a pandemic-related loss. An estimated 110a?000 individuals (2.4% [95% CI, 1.1%-5.0%] of firearm owners in the state) acquired a firearm due to the pandemic, including 47a?000 new owners (43.0% [95% CI, 14.8%-76.6%] of those who had acquired a firearm). Of owners who stored at least 1 firearm in the least secure way, 6.7% (95% CI, 2.7%-15.6%) said they had adopted this unsecure storage practice in response to the pandemic. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analysis of findings from the 2020 California Safety and Well-being Survey, the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increases in self-reported worry about violence for oneself and others, increased firearm acquisition, and changes in firearm storage practices.

We have investigated the properties for image guidance using fiducial markers implanted through minimally invasive bronchoscopy. METHODS Two fiducial marker types were implanted endobronchially in 10 patients undergoing radical radiation treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (eight using Visicoil linear fiducial markers [IBA Dosimetry GmbH, Schwarzenbruck Germany] and two using superDimension and superLock two-band markers [Covidien Inc., Minneapolis, MN]). Patients underwent four-dimensional computed tomography imaging for treatment planning and after completion of treatment to investigate marker movement. As part of the image guidance assessment, megavolt electronic portal images (EPIs) were acquired in addition to kilovolt planar and CBCT (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) images. RESULTS In two of 10 patients (both receiving Visicoil markers), marker migration was observed before treatment. In patients with stable markers, both types were clearly visible in planar kilovolt imaging; however, in EPIs the markers could be detected only in selected beam directions in which bony interference was minimal. Diagnostic computed tomography scanning was able to demonstrate the markers with clarity, but significant starring artifacts were observed in CBCT. This was particularly problematic in patients with some lateral component of tumor motion during breathing. CONCLUSIONS The potential for fiducial migration must be considered and investigated if bronchoscopic implantation of fiducial markers is performed. The choice of marker is a compromise between trying to minimize CBCT artifacts while enabling visualization in EPI imaging, which is an ideal tool to verify gated radiotherapy delivery.","output":"Practical Assessment of Bronchoscopically Inserted Fiducial Markers for Image Guidance in Stereotactic Lung Radiotherapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Collaborative learning is a teaching method that brings together students to discuss a topic important for a given course or curriculum and solve a related problem or create a product.

Since chest computed tomography (CT) images of COVID-19 patients contain abundant pathological features closely related to this disease, rapid detection and diagnosis based on CT images is of great significance for the treatment of patients and blocking the spread of the disease. In particular, the segmentation of the COVID-19 CT lung-infected area can quantify and evaluate the severity of the disease. However, due to the blurred boundaries and low contrast between the infected and the non-infected areas in COVID-19 CT images, the manual segmentation of the COVID-19 lesion is laborious and places high demands on the operator. Quick and accurate segmentation of COVID-19 lesions from CT images based on deep learning has drawn increasing attention. To effectively improve the segmentation effect of COVID-19 lung infection, a modified UNet network that combines the squeeze-and-attention (SA) and dense atrous spatial pyramid pooling (Dense ASPP) modules) (SD-UNet) is proposed, fusing global context and multi-scale information. Specifically, the SA module is introduced to strengthen the attention of pixel grouping and fully exploit the global context information, allowing the network to better mine the differences and connections between pixels. The Dense ASPP module is utilized to capture multi-scale information of COVID-19 lesions. Moreover, to eliminate the interference of background noise outside the lungs and highlight the texture features of the lung lesion area, we extract in advance the lung area from the CT images in the pre-processing stage. Finally, we evaluate our method using the binary-class and multi-class COVID-19 lung infection segmentation datasets. The experimental results show that the metrics of Sensitivity, Dice Similarity Coefficient, Accuracy, Specificity, and Jaccard Similarity are 0.8988 (0.6169), 0.8696 (0.5936), 0.9906 (0.9821), 0.9932 (0.9907), and 0.7702 (0.4788), respectively, for the binary-class (multi-class) segmentation task in the proposed SD-UNet. The result of the COVID-19 lung infection area segmented by SD-UNet is closer to the ground truth compared to several existing models such as CE-Net, DeepLab v3+, UNet++, and other models, which further proves that a more accurate segmentation effect can be achieved by our method.

We summarized existing knowledge about epidemiology, pathogenesis, genetics, diagnostic tests and therapy in this somewhat neglected entity in pediatric rheumatology. Since etiopathogenesis of IgA vasculitis is complex, with factors other than galactose-deficient IgA(1)-containing immune complexes also being important, and may involve numerous interactions between environmental and genetic factors, genomics alone cannot explain the entirety of the risk for the disease. The incidence of IgAV and nephritis varies worldwide and may be a consequence of overlapping genetic and environmental factors. In addition to the role of the HLA class II genes, some studies have pointed to the importance of non-HLA genes, and modern geostatistical research has also indicated a geospatial risk distribution, which may suggest the strong influence of different environmental factors such as climate, pathogen load, and dietary factors. The application of modern geostatistical methods until recently was completely unknown in the study of this disease, but thanks to the latest results it has been shown that they can help us a lot in understanding epidemiology and serve as a guide in generating new hypotheses considering possible environmental risk factors and identification of potential genetic or epigenetic diversity. There is increasing evidence that an integrative approach should be included in the understanding of IgA vasculitis, in terms of the integration of genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and epigenetics. This approach could result in the discovery of new pathways important for finding biomarkers that could stratify patients according to the risk of complications, without an invasive kidney biopsy which is still the gold standard to confirm a diagnosis of nephritis, even if biopsy findings interpretation is not uniform in clinical practice. Ultimately, this will allow the development of new therapeutic approaches, especially important in the treatment of nephritis, for which there is still no standardized treatment.","output":"New Insights and Challenges Associated With IgA Vasculitis and IgA Vasculitis With NephritisIs It Time to Change the Paradigm of the Most Common Systemic Vasculitis in Childhood?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has long latent period, strong infectivity, and non-specific symptoms and signs in the upper respiratory tract. Some initial neurological symptoms appear, including dizziness, headache, seizures, slurred speech, disturbance of consciousness, and limb paralysis among a few COVID-19 patients, which share similar manifestations with central nervous system (CNS) infection. Improving the diagnostic efficiency of suspected CNS infection patients on the basis of preventing and controlling COVID-19 plays a key role in preventing nosocomial and cross infections. This study intends to formulate a hospital emergency management system of fastlane treatment of CNS infection for epidemic prevention and control, aiming at providing references and guidelines for the government and medical institutions to improve the efficiency of treating CNS infection patients in the clinical practice during COVID-19. Observations: This study formulated a framework of a fastlane treatment of CNS infection based on the cooperation of resources and experience, aiming at the key and difficult problems faced by the hospital emergency management system during the COVID-19 outbreak in Changsha, China. The main problem of formulating the hospital emergency management system is efficiently identifying whether CNS infection was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The framework improves the efficiency of diagnosing and treating CNS infections by standardizing the diagnosis and treatment process of patients in emergency observation and strengthening the management of inpatient wards, aiming at assisting medical staff during clinical practice. Conclusions and Relevance: The hospital emergency management system of a fastlane treatment of CNS infection for epidemic prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak is a professional and multisystem project, which needs the cooperation of various resources and the experience of clinical leadership.","output":"Differential Diagnosis and Hospital Emergency Management for Fastlane Treatment of Central Nervous System Infection Under the COVID-19 Epidemic in Changsha, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, it was investigated whether integration of microwave-heating into the pretreatment step of persimmon juice processing allows the concomitant production of both functional juice and added-value solid residue from the Diospyros Kaki Jiro cultivar. In this direction, persimmon pulp was treated under three different microwave-heating conditions (0.7, 4.2, and 8.4 kJ/g) prior to enzymatic maceration and compared to the non-heated material. Irrespective of microwave energy employed, the proposed hybrid treatment was highly efficient in terms of juice yield (70% w/w). The mildest heating conditions resulted in juice and residue that were both of inferior quality. Intensification of the microwave energy reduced the microbial load of the juice up to 2-log without compromising the content in total soluble solids, sugars, and L-ascorbic acid. Under the most drastic conditions, the juice was enriched in gallic acid, polyphenols, and potent DPPH() scavengers, but its orange color faded and was more acidic. In parallel, the solid juice residue retained pro-vitamin A carotenoids (~278 g retinol activity equivalents) and low-methoxy pectin (9 g/100 g DW).

Immun system disregulation and possible autoinflammatory and autoimmune mechanisms are responsible for higher amount cytokines release from immune cells. Although there is no clear treatment of Covid-19 infection yet, it is argued that some disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may be effective in addition to anti-viral treatments. These drugs (antimalarial drugs, colchicum dispert, biologics) have been well known to rheumatologists for years, because they have been used in the treatment of many inflammatory rheumatologic diseases, so now all eyes are on rheumatologists. Another important issue is whether DMARDs, which can cause severe immunosuppression, pose a risk for Covid-19 infection and whether they are discontinued beforehand. Although there are insufficient data on this subject, considering the risk of disease reactivation, patients may continue their DMARDs treatment under the supervision of the rheumatologist. In this article, the possible immunological mechanisms in the pathogenesis of Covid-19 infection and the efficacy and safety of various DMARDs used in the treatment have been discussed with a rheumatologist perspective in the light of recent literature data.","output":"Perfect storm: a rheumatologist's point of view on COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Public health emergencies may significantly impact emergency medical services responses to cardiovascular emergencies.

Methods and Results We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study using Los Angeles County emergency medical services registry data for adult patients with paramedic provider impression (PI) of OHCA or STEMI from February through May in 2018 to 2020. After March 19, 2020, weekly counts for PI-OHCA were higher (173 versus 135; incidence rate ratios, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.19a??1.37; P<0.001) while PI-STEMI were lower (57 versus 65; incidence rate ratios, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78a??0.97; P=0.02) compared with 2018 and 2019. After adjusting for seasonal variation in PI-OHCA and decreased PI-STEMI, the increase in PI-OHCA observed after March 19, 2020 remained significant (P=0.02). The proportion of PI-OHCA who received defibrillation (16% versus 23%; risk difference [RD], -6.91%; 95% CI, -9.55% to -4.26%; P<0.001) and had return of spontaneous circulation (17% versus 29%; RD, -11.98%; 95% CI, -14.76% to -9.18%; P<0.001) were lower after March 19 in 2020 compared with 2018 and 2019.

However, there are few computational methods to effectively predict them. Bond-to-bond propensity analysis, a recently developed method, has successfully predicted allosteric sites for a diverse group of proteins with only the knowledge of the orthosteric sites and the corresponding ligands in 19 of 20 cases.

Objective task performance scores were evaluated. RESULTS Task completion times and performance scores were significantly different between novices and experts for the peg transfer (P = 0.02, P = 0.008 respectively), pattern cut (P < 0.001, P < 0.001 respectively) and ligating loop (P = 0.038, P = 0.035 respectively).

First, we use the statistical value of life, which in Canada is about C$7 million, to optimise over a single variable, which is the sum of the economic cost and the value of lives lost. Our second method is to calculate the Pareto optimal front when we look at the two variables -- deaths and economic costs. In both cases we find that, for most parameter values, the optimal policy is to adopt an initial shutdown level which reduces the reproduction number of the epidemic to close to 1. This level is then reduced once a vaccination program is underway. Our model also indicates that an oscillating policy of strict and mild shutdowns is less effective than a policy which maintains a moderate shutdown level.","output":"Optimal shutdown strategies for COVID-19 with economic and mortality costs: BC as a case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Even though most of its energy generation comes from renewable sources, Brazil is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the world, due to intense farming and deforestation of biomes such as the Amazon Rainforest, whose preservation is essential for compliance with the Paris Agreement.

However, the heterogeneity of tandem occlusion etiology has been strongly neglected in previous studies. We retrospectively investigated patients with acute ischemic stroke atherothrombotic tandem occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS All consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke with atherothrombotic tandem occlusions treated with mechanical thrombectomy in our center between September 2009 and April 2015 were analyzed. They were compared with patients with acute ischemic stroke with dissection-related tandem occlusion and isolated intracranial occlusion treated during the same period. Comparative univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted, including demographic data, safety, and rates of successful recanalization and good clinical outcome. RESULTS Despite comparable baseline severity of neurologic deficits and infarct core extension, patients with atherothrombotic tandem occlusions were older (P < .001), were more frequently smokers (P < .001), and had globally more cardiovascular risk factors (P < .001) than the other 2 groups of patients. The patients with atherothrombotic tandem occlusions had significantly longer procedural times (P < .001), lower recanalization rates (P = .004), and higher global burden of procedural complications (P < .001). In this group, procedural complications (OR = 0.15, P = .02) and the TICI 2b/3 reperfusion scores (OR = 17.76, P = .002) were independently predictive factors of favorable clinical outcome.

By using two COVID-19 hamster models, pulmonary immune responses were analyzed to characterize effects of single or combinatorial treatments. Pulmonary viral burden was reduced by anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody treatment, and similar or increased by dexamethasone alone. Dexamethasone exhibited strong anti-inflammatory effects and prevented fulminant disease in a severe disease model. Combination therapy showed additive benefits with both anti-viral and anti-inflammatory potency. Bulk and single-cell transcriptomic analyses confirmed dampened inflammatory cell recruitment into lungs upon dexamethasone treatment, and identified a specifically responsive subpopulation of neutrophils, thereby indicating a potential mechanism of action.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number and type of referrals made to the adult psychiatric liaison nursing service (PLNS) at University Hospital Hairmyres, NHS Lanarkshire.MethodWe collated all of the archived referrals made by our local emergency department to the PLNS at University Hospital Hairmyres for adults (aged 18C65 years) during the period of the first COVID-19 national lockdown (April-July 2020) and the corresponding period one-year prior (April-July 2019) to analyse differences in referral numbers and demographics. Additionally, for referrals made during 2020, we conducted a qualitative review of electronic records to determine the reason for referral, contributory stressors to presentation, and in particular any effect from COVID-19.ResultA total of 549 referrals were made over the study period, with 320 in 2019 and 229 in 2020, a decrease of almost 30%. In 2019, referrals fell each month from April (n = 89) to July (n = 74), while this trend was reversed in 2020, rising from April (n = 45) to near-usual levels by July (n = 68). Compared to baseline, referrals in April 2020 were for a higher proportion of men (62.2%). On qualitative analysis, 26 records (11.3%) could not be found. Otherwise, the most common reasons for referral were suicidal ideation (43.3%) and/or deliberate self-harm (39.9%). Many patients presented with comorbid substance misuse (54.2%) and the majority were not known to community services (64.5%). COVID-19 was implicated in 48 referrals (23.6%), but only 2 of these arose as a direct result of infection.ConclusionWe have observed clear differences in the pattern of referrals made to the adult PLNS during the first COVID-19 national lockdown. COVID-19 was implicated in a minority of referrals, but most were related to secondary effects of lockdown restrictions rather than COVID-19 infection. Possible reasons for fewer referrals during this time could be non-presentation through fears of contracting COVID-19 or altruistic avoidance of putting pressure on the NHS.

The European pear (Conference) showed distinct fruit shape index and pedicel structural properties compared with the oriental pears (Akizuki, Yali, and Nanguoli). The fruit size positively correlated with pedicel length, fiber area, pedicel diameter, the area percentage of the cortex, and the area percentage of phloem; however, fruit firmness and soluble solids concentration are showed a stronger positive correlation with xylem area, pith area, the area percentage of xylem, the area percentage of sieve tube, and the area percentage of pith. Pedicel elements, including pith, fiber, and cortex, likely play a certain role in the fruit growth due to the variations of their characteristics demonstrated in the four pear species. The porosity, the ratio of the surface area to the volume, and the spatial arrangement of the vessels showed significant variations across the pear species, indicating the distinction of the hydraulic conductance of the pedicels.

Several enzymatic or mechanical procedures have been proposed to process AT with the aim to isolate cells that can be locally implanted. How AT is processed may impact its properties. Thus, we compared AT processed by centrifugation (C-AT) to microfragmentation (MF-AT). Focusing on MF-AT, we subsequently assessed the impact of synovial fluid (SF) alone on both MF-AT and isolated AT-MSC to better understand their cartilage repair mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MF-AT and C-AT from the same donors were compared by histology and qRT-PCR immediately after isolation or as ex vivo cultures using a micro-tissue pellet system. The in vitro impact of SF on MF-AT and AT-MSC was assessed by histological staining and molecular analysis. RESULTS: The main AT histological features (i.e., increased extracellular matrix and cellularity) of the freshly isolated or ex vivo-cultured MF-AT persisted compared to C-AT, which rapidly deteriorated during culture. Based on our previous studies of HOX genes in MSC, we investigated the involvement of Homeobox Protein HOX-B7 (HOXB7) and its target basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF) in the molecular mechanism underlying the improved performance of MF-AT. Indeed, both these biomarkers were more prominent in freshly isolated MF-AT compared to C-AT. SF alone preserved the AT histological features of MF-AT, together with HOXB7 and bFGF expression. Increased cell performance was also observed in isolated AT-MSC after SF treatment concomitant with enhanced HOXB7 expression, although there was no apparent association with bFGF. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that MF has a positive effect on the maintenance of AT histology and may trigger the expression of trophic factors that improve tissue repair by processed AT.

PRISMA criteria were followed. RESULTS: Twenty-one works were selected. Identified topics: effectiveness of protective equipment/devices (PE) (n = 3), universal wearing of facemasks plus other protective measures in the community (n = 3), impact of infection control measures on hospitals and epidemiological tracing (n = 3), development of new PE (n = 2), sanitisation of facemasks (n = 4), clinical guidance (n = 4) and questionnaires (n = 2). DISCUSSION: It seems that the effectiveness of PE, namely facemasks, is not fully known. Universal wearing of facemasks may be simultaneously recommended with other protective measures. Nosocomial and community infections seem to be preventable. New PE, methods of facemask sanitisation and clinical guidance are emerging, but caution is recommended regarding their adoption, revision and monitoring by international boards and institutions. Questionnaires are useful tools for collecting citizens' opinions on implementing public health measures, and thus contribute to mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Universal wearing of facemasks in the community is likely to be recommended during the COVID-19pandemic. Since SARS-COV-2 is highly contagious, a set of measures should be considered.

The paramedic contacted an on-call triage cardiologist and decided whether admission was necessary and, if so, which regional hospital was most appropriate (figure 1). The study objective was defined as the percentage of patients not referred to the hospital after EMS consultation. Safety of the triage method was defined in the non-referred patients in the intervention as the percentage of MACE (death and acute coronary syndrome) 30 days after non-referral. Results: In the intervention group 1755 patients (age 6915 years, 53% men), and in the control group 1629 patients (age 6815 years, 53% men) were consulted by the EMS during the HART-c study. In the intervention group 11.4% of patients consulted to the EMS were left at home, compared to 5.5% in the control group (figure 2). Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the effect of the triage intervention. The model was corrected for gender, age and seasonal changes. The chance of being left at home after EMS consultation was 2.29 (95% CI 1.73-3.02, p<0.001) times higher in the intervention group compared to the control. All patients left at home in the intervention group and their GP's were contacted for adverse events, after case-by-case review the MACE rate was <1%. Furthermore a decrease in interhospital transfers was seen, from 206 in the intervention to 173 in the control. Conclusion: Implementation of an innovative triage method successfully increased the percentage of patients with cardiac symptoms safely left at home.","output":"Results from HART-c: innovations in prehospital triage for acute cardiac symptoms, a multicentre prospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The feasibility of implementing a computerized adaptive test (CAT) system in routine clinical care in ophthalmology has not been assessed. We evaluated the implementation of a glaucoma-specific CAT (GlauCAT) in outpatients at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Institute. METHODS: In this implementation study (July 2020CApril 2021), 216 adults (mean  SD age 64.8  15.3 years; 56.0% women) completed six adaptive GlauCAT quality of life (QOL) tests on an internet-enabled tablet at the clinic. A real-time printable report summarizing domain scores was shared with physicians prior to consultation. The implementation was evaluated using Proctor's outcomes: acceptability (patient satisfaction); appropriateness (independent complete rate [%]); feasibility (acceptance rate [%]; completion time); and fidelity (percentage of patients discussing GlauCAT results with their physician). Physician barriers/facilitators were explored using open-ended questions. RESULTS: Patients mean  SD satisfaction score was 3.5  0.5 of 4, with >95% of patients willing to recommend it to others. Of the 216 (89.2%) patients accepting to participate, 173 (80%) completed GlauCAT independently. Patients took 8 minutes and 5 seconds (median) to complete all 6 GlauCAT tests. Almost two-thirds (n = 136/216) of the patients reported discussing their GlauCAT results with their doctor. Physicians described the GlauCAT summary report as helpful and user-friendly, although lack of time and uncertainty about how to action information were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Pilot implementation of six GlauCAT QOL tests in glaucoma outpatient clinics was feasible and acceptable. Integration of GlauCAT with electronic medical records (EMRs) and evaluation of long-term implementation outcomes are needed. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: GlauCAT's multiple outcomes and low test-taking burden makes it attractive for measuring glaucoma-specific QOL in routine clinical care.","output":"Implementation of an Online Glaucoma-Specific Quality of Life Computerized Adaptive Test System in a US Glaucoma Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reports of tuberculosis (TB) outbreaks among schoolchildren have increased in recent years in countries across the Western Pacific Region.

In this paper, we propose a method of Correlation aware unsupervised Anomaly detection via Deep Gaussian Mixture Model (CADGMM), which captures the complex correlation among data points for high-quality low-dimensional representation learning. More specifically, the relations among data samples are correlated firstly in forms of a graph structure, in which, the node denotes the sample and the edge denotes the correlation between two samples from the feature space. Then, a dual-encoder that consists of a graph encoder and a feature encoder, is employed to encode both the feature and correlation information of samples into the low-dimensional latent space jointly, followed by a decoder for data reconstruction. Finally, a separate estimation network as a Gaussian Mixture Model is utilized to estimate the density of the learned latent vector, and the anomalies can be detected by measuring the energy of the samples. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","output":"Correlation-Aware Deep Generative Model for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reliable and rapid detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in laboratory setting is critical to control the pandemic.

This case study explores professors' experiences of flexibility in e-learning design and continuous assessment and their perception of the risks and opportunities that more flexibility implies for student persistence and dropout. In-depth interviews with 18 full professors, who are the e-learning designers of undergraduate courses at the Open University of Catalonia (UOC), were analyzed, employing qualitative content analysis. According to the professors, the main causes for dropout are student-centered, yet they are connected to learning design: workload and time availability, as well as students' expectations, profiles, and time management skills. In the professors' view, flexibility has both positive and negative effects. Some are conducive to engagement and persistence: improvement of personalized feedback, formative assessment, and module workload. Others generate resistance: more flexibility may increase workload, procrastination, dropout, and risk of losing professorial control, and may threaten educational standards and quality. Untangling the tensions between dropout and flexibility may enhance learning design and educational practices that help prevent student dropout. Stakeholders should focus on measures perceived as positive, such as assessment extension, personalized feedback and monitoring, and course workload calibration.

We applied evidence-based methods to investigate the role of preclinical studies in predicting human DILI using two anti-diabetic drugs from the same class, but with different toxicological profiles: troglitazone (withdrawn from US market due to DILI) and rosiglitazone (remains on US market). Evidence Stream 1: A systematic literature review of in vivo studies on rosiglitazone or troglitazone was conducted (PROSPERO registration CRD42018112353). Evidence Stream 2: in vitro data on troglitazone and rosiglitazone were retrieved from the US EPA ToxCast database. Evidence Stream 3: troglitazone- and rosiglitazone-related DILI cases were retrieved from WHO Vigibase. All three evidence stream analyses were conducted according to evidence-based methodologies and performed according to pre-registered protocols. Evidence Stream 1: 9288 references were identified, with 42 studies included in analysis. No reported biomarker for either drug indicated a strong hazard signal in either preclinical animal or human studies. All included studies had substantial limitations, resulting in \\"low\\" or \\"very low\\" certainty in findings. Evidence Stream 2: Troglitazone was active in twice as many in vitro assays (129) as rosiglitazone (60), indicating a strong signal for more off-target effects. Evidence Stream 3: We observed a fivefold difference in both all adverse events and liver-related adverse events reported, and an eightfold difference in fatalities for troglitazone, compared to rosiglitazone. In summary, published animal and human trials failed to predict troglitazone's potential to cause severe liver injury in a wider patient population, while in vitro data showed marked differences in the two drugs' off-target activities, offering a new paradigm for reducing drug attrition in late development and in the market.

For statistical comparison, Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U-test were used. Results: In all, 75 patients were included per cohort. In the FVP cohort, chronic heart disease (36/75, 48.0% vs. 16/75, 21.3%, p<0.01) and diabetes mellitus (23/75, 30.7% vs. 10/75, 13.3%, p<0.01) were more prevalent, hospital LOS (18.5+/-15.5 days vs. 13.0+/-8.5 days, p<0.01) was higher. Disease progression (17/75, 22.7% vs. 10/75, 13.3%, p=0.13), 14-day all-cause death (9/75, 12.0% vs. 10/75, 13.3%, p=0.8) and need for mechanical ventillation (8/75, 10.7% vs. 4/75, 5.3%, p=0.22) were similar between groups.

In the United States, women experience high rates of interpersonal violence throughout their lifetime. Among Latinas, interpersonal violence is also highly prevalent however the wide variation of interpersonal prevalence rates among Latinas is problematic. The aims of this systematic review of the literature were to (1) document the prevalence rates of violence among Latinas, (2) determine the types of violence that Latinas are most impacted by, and (3) assess the prevalence rates of interpersonal across Latina subethnicities. The research was based on seven databases including PsycArticles, PsycCRITIQUES, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, Social Services Abstracts, Social Work Abstracts, and PubMED for articles published from January 2007 up to July 2017. The following key words were used in the search: (Latinas OR Latinos OR Hispanics) AND (victim OR victimization) AND (domestic violence OR intimate partner violence OR Interpersonal Violence). We identified 41 articles in our search that reported rates of interpersonal violence which ranged from 1% to 83% with intimate partner violence and domestic violence being the most prevalent. Interpersonal violence was found to be more prevalent among individuals who identified as Mexican. Based on the findings, it is clear that efforts should be focused on conducting a lager national survey of interpersonal violence among Latinas.

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 342 consecutive patients with thoracic ESCC who underwent R0 subtotal esophagectomy. All patients underwent subcarinal lymph node dissection. The efficacy index (frequency of metastasis to a particular lymph node station multiplied by the 5-year disease-specific survival rate of patients with metastasis to the station) was calculated for the subcarinal lymph node station, and the prognostic impact of dissecting this station was estimated with reference to the main tumor location. Independent predictive factors for pathological subcarinal lymph node metastasis were analyzed using a proportional hazards model. RESULTS The overall frequency of metastasis to the subcarinal lymph nodes was 7.0 % (2.4, 8.9, and 5.8 % in patients with upper, middle, and lower thoracic ESCC, respectively). The efficacy index for the middle thoracic esophagus was 2.9, and that for the upper and lower thoracic esophagus was 0.0. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was significantly lower in patients with pathological subcarinal lymph node metastasis than those without (23.1 vs. 67.5 %, respectively; log-rank p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, clinical T stage (T2-T4) was the independent predictive factor for pathological subcarinal lymph node metastasis (p = 0.021).

Describe whether there were changes in end-of-life care ratings after the pandemic started Importance Given strained resources and visitation restrictions, families might have perceived lower-quality end-of-life (EOL) care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective(s) We compared families ratings of EOL care before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s) Next-of-kin (NOKs) of patients who died in the ICUs of a two-hospital healthcare system between July 2019 and April 2021 were asked to complete a modified Bereaved Family Survey (BFS). We compared care quality reports for patients who died before and during the pandemic using single-item questions and two measures derived from the BFS: Respectful Care and Communication (5 items, alpha = 0.82) and Emotional and Spiritual Support (3 items, alpha = 0.77). Multivariable regression was used to adjust for demographic and clinical characteristics. Results Of 1,029 patients who died in the ICU during the study period, 133 of 388 (34%) NOKs completed the survey before the pandemic and 181 of 639 (28%) during the pandemic. Among those for whom surveys were received, pandemic decedents had higher sequential organ failure assessment score on ICU admission (8.0 vs 6.0, p < 0.01), fewer palliative care consultations (28% vs 40%, p = 0.03), and fewer advance directives (30% vs 44%, p < 0.01) than decedents before the pandemic. In multivariate analysis, NOKs of pandemic decedents more frequently reported that they were notified of impending death (90.6% vs 79.7%, p < 0.01).

Objectives: The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the safety of CQ and HCQ from malarial and non-malarial randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Methods: : The primary outcomes were the frequencies of serious adverse events (SAEs), retinopathy, and cardiac complications. Search strategies were applied to MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CENTRAL, Scopus, and Trip databases. We used random-effects model to pool results across studies and Peto one-step odds ratio (OR) for event rates below 1 %. Both-armed zero-event studies were excluded from the meta-analyses. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system to evaluate the certainty of evidence. Results: : Ninety-two RCTs were included. We found no significant difference between CQ/HCQ and control (placebo or non-CQ/HCQ) in the frequency of SAEs (OR: 0.98, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.71C1.36, 25 trials, 11,605 participants, moderate certainty of evidence). No clear relationship was observed between CQ/HCQ and retinopathy (OR: 1,63, 95 % CI: -0.4C6.57, 5 trials, 344 participants, very low certainty of evidence).

The goal of this review is to enumerate the reports that describe dual deaths of both a pregnant woman and her newborn from a herpesvirus infection. A total of 15 reports were found in the medical literature, of which five described pregnant women with HSV encephalitis and 10 described women with disseminated HSV infection. When the virus was typed, most cases of dual mother/newborn deaths were caused by HSV-2. Of interest, in two situations caused by HSV-1, the pregnant woman probably acquired her primary HSV-1 infection from one of her children and not by sexual transmission. Complete genomic sequencing was performed on one set of HSV-1 isolates collected from mother (blood) and newborn (blood and skin). The mothers strain and the newborns skin strain were 98.9% identical. When the newborns two strains were compared, they were 97.4% identical. Only one mother was tested by the HerpeSelect IgG antibody kit. During the nine days of her undiagnosed disseminated infection preceding her death, her serology was negative.

This study aims to present the authors experience with one client who was interviewed afterwards about the experience. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 10 walking therapy sessions of 60-min duration were conducted with the patient. After the sessions, both the patient and therapist were interviewed about their experience. The resulting interviews with both patient and therapist were thematically analysed independently by both authors. Findings: There were common themes to both the client and therapists account following thematic analysis. These were: modelling and normalising in the real world, replacing what COVID-19 had taken away from the TC experience, changes at home, therapist disclosure, outcomes and good endings and being outside of the clinical environment.

However, the beneficial effects by interferon- treatment in MS, although suggested to depend mainly on immunomodulation, might lend support to a viral involvement in the pathogenesis. The human herpesviruses have attracted interest since their recurrent modes of infection share some similarity with the relapsing-remitting course of MS, most members are readily detected within the brain, and several of these viruses may induce demyelination within the central nervous system in human hosts as well as in animal models. Accumulated diagnostic and epidemiological data are compatible with a role for the herpesviruses as possible cofactors rather than etiological agents, and recent studies showing early neuronal damage in MS patients focus attention on the neurotropic -herpesviruses.

Cox proportional hazards and competing risks analyses were conducted to analyze the impact of corticosteroids on mortality and SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance, respectively. We performed a propensity score (PS) matching analysis to control confounding factors.RESULTSOf 774 eligible patients, 409 patients received corticosteroids, with a median time from hospitalization to starting corticosteroids of 1.0 day (IQR 0.0-3.0 days) . As compared with usual care, treatment with corticosteroids was associated with increased rate of myocardial (15.6% vs. 10.4%, P = 0.041) and liver injury (18.3% vs. 9.9%, P = 0.001), of shock (22.0% vs. 12.6%, P < 0.001), of need for mechanical ventilation (38.1% vs. 19.5%, P < 0.001), and increased rate of 28-day all-cause mortality (44.3% vs. 31.0%, P < 0.001).

However, it is not feasible for every country to have its own MSB. If countries are able to pool their resources, a regional MSB is a viable solution. This paper describes the methodology, costing and lessons learnt of establishing and maintaining an MSB over a 3-year period, for a Southern Africa Development Community region. METHODS: A national reference laboratory in South Africa was granted funding for setting up the MSB; it possessed experienced staff and suitable resources. Two additional full-time personnel were employed to carry out the activities of this project. Strict protocols for donor/patient blood sample screening, smear preparation, mass staining, quality control and slide validation were followed. Slides from the MSB were used for training and proficiency testing purposes. The initial and recurrent yearly costs to set up and maintain the MSB were calculated. RESULTS: Over 35 months, 154 batches (26,623 slides) were prepared; the majority were Plasmodium falciparum. Ninety-two percent (141/154) of batches passed internal quality control, and 89% (93/104) passed external validation. From these slides, two training slide sets and six proficiency testing slide sets were sent out. The initial years cost to establish an MSB was calculated at approximately $165,000, and the recurrent year-on-year cost was $130,000. CONCLUSIONS: The key components for maintaining a high-quality MSB are consistent funding, competent staff and adherence to standardized protocols. Travel to malaria-endemic areas for access to non-falciparum malaria species, and dilution of P. falciparum blood to desired parasite densities, are extremely useful to ensure variety.

Examination of chronological age effects further revealed that news veracity detection among more elderly older adults depended on interactions between individual CISDA components and news content.

Up to our knowledge this is the first study assessing the safety of SIPES cholecystectomy in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) done by surgical residents. Aims: To determine the feasibility, safety, and expediency of SIPES cholecystectomy in children with SCD performed by surgical residents. Materials and Methods: Retrospective study of all SIPES cholecystectomies performed in our unit from April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2018. We compared the outcome of SIPES cholecystectomy done by fellows and residents. SIPES Covidien 5-12 mm port was inserted through umbilicus. Long 50 cm laparoscope, straight regular instruments, and transabdominal gallbladder traction suture were used in all patients. The cystic duct and artery were identified and divided. The gallbladder is then dissected off the liver and extracted from the abdomen through the port. Results: Forty-three SCD patients underwent SIPES cholecystectomy for 7 years. Mean HbS was 37.56%. Mean age was 10 years. Twenty-four cases (56%) and 19 (44%) were performed by 8 fellows and 10 residents, respectively. Nine other procedures were done simultaneously with cholecystectomy and were excluded from the mean operative time (MOT). The MOT for all cases was 85 minutes, 78 minutes for fellows and 94 minutes for residents (P value is <.001). One extra port was inserted in 2 patients at the beginning of the series. Conclusion: SIPES cholecystectomy in children with SCD is safe and feasible if done by residents under supervision. Stepwise training is essential in this challenging surgery.

Materials and methods: Cross-sectional study in a convenience sample of professionals from 30 health centers and 30 nursing homes from the primary care management division of the Healthcare Area of Leon. The work center, type of profession, COVID-19 infection, level of exposure, compliance with preventive measures, isolation (if required) and diagnostic tests carried out were collected. The determination of infection was made by differentiated rapid diagnostic test (dRDT), using a finger-stick whole-blood sample. The association of variables with infection was assessed by multivariable non-conditional logistic regression. The true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was calculated according to two scenarios for RDT (Sensitivity=0.6 and Specificity=0.985; Sensitivity=0.8 and Specificity=1). Results: The true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was between 4.9% - 11.0%. The observed prevalence was 5.9%, being higher in nursing home compared to primary care centers (9.5% vs. 5.5%). No statistically significant differences were observed by sex, type of professional, level of exposure or compliance with preventive measures. Conclusions: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this group is low. A high number of professionals remain susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore protective measures should be taken, especially in nursing home professionals.

The aim of this study was to explore the impact of these changes on Neonatal Nurses globally. Methods: We conducted a thematic analysis on written reflections by neonatal nurses worldwide, exploring their experiences of COVID-19. Twenty-two reflections were analysed from eleven countries. Results: Thematic analysis revealed 4 main themes relating to the nurses' role: 1) protector 2) challenges to human quality of care 3) vulnerability and 4) resilience. The measures taken as protector were described as compromising the human qualities of care fundamental to their role. This tension, together with other new challenges, heightened feelings of vulnerability. Concurrently, nurses identified role resilience, including resourcefulness and peer support, which allowed them to navigate the global pandemic. Conclusion: By identifying global challenges and strategies to overcome these, neonatal nurses may be better equipped as the pandemic continues.

Gaps in TM education and training of laboratory staff exist in most African countries. We assessed the status of the training and education of laboratory staff working in blood facilities in Africa. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study using a self-administered pilot-tested questionnaire was performed. The questionnaire comprised 26 questions targeting six themes. Blood facilities from 16 countries were invited to participate. Individually completed questionnaires were grouped by country and descriptive analysis performed. RESULTS: Ten blood establishments and two blood banks from eight African countries confirmed the availability of a host of training programs for laboratory staff; the majority of which were syllabus or curriculum-guided and focused on both theoretical and practical laboratory skills development. Training was usually preplanned, dependent on student and trainer availability and delivered through lecture-based classroom training as well as formal and informal on the job training. There were minimal online didactic and self-directed learning. Teaching of humanistic values appeared to be lacking. CONCLUSION: We confirmed the availability of diverse training programs across a variety of African countries. Incorporation of virtual learning platforms, rather than complete reliance on didactic, in-person training programs may improve the education reach of the existing programs.

Control of gene expression is a vital element of virus replication. Coordinate expression of groups of virus genes results in successive phases of gene expression.

Viruses make use of the biochemical apparatus of their host cells to express their genetic information as proteins and, consequently, utilize the appropriate biochemical language recognized by the cell. Thus viruses of prokaryotes produce polycistronic mRNAs, while viruses with eukaryotic hosts produce more monocistronic mRNAs. Some viruses of eukaryotes do produce polycistronic mRNA to assist with the coordinate regulation of multiple genes. Viruses rely on specific cis- and trans-acting mechanisms to manipulate the biology of their host cells, and to enhance and coordinate the expression of their genetic information.

We used Pearson's Chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression to evaluate relationships. RESULTS: Of 452 Michigan NHs contacted via e-mail, 145 (32.1%) opened the survey and of these, 143 (98.6%) responded. Sixty-eight percent of respondents indicated their response plan addressed most issues. NHs reported receiving rapidly changing guidance from many sources. Two-thirds reported shortages of personal protective equipment and other supplies. Half (50%) lacked sufficient testing resources with only 36% able to test residents and staff with suspected COVID-19. A majority (55%) experienced staffing shortages. Sixty-three percent experienced resignations, with front-line clinical staff more likely to resign, particularly in facilities caring for COVID-19 patients (P < .001). Facilities adapted quickly, creating COVID-19 units (78%) to care for patients on site. To reduce isolation, NHs facilitated communication via phone calls (98%), videoconferencing (96%), and window visits (81%). A majority continued to provide requisite therapies (90%).

Six different analytical kits for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection were used. Positivity rates, inter-assay agreement and kinetic models were determined. A high inter-individual and an inter-methodology variability was observed. Assays targeting total antibodies presented higher positivity rates and reached the highest positivity rates sooner compared with assays directed against IgG. The inter-assay agreement was also higher between these assays. The stratification by disease severity showed a much-elevated serological response in hospitalized versus non-hospitalized patients in all assays. In this 10-month follow-up study, serological assays showed a clinically significant difference to detect past SARS-CoV-2 infection with total antibody assays presenting the highest positivity rates.

To do this, mice were exposed to 24 h-long ultradian light-dark cycles with different durations of pulses: T2 cycle (1 h of light/1 h of dark) and T7 cycle (3.5 h of light/3.5 h of dark). Exposure to light not only promotes NREM and REM sleep and inhibits wake, but also drastically alters alertness and modifies sleep depth. These effects are modulated by circadian time, appearing especially during early subjective night, and their kinetics is highly dependent on the duration of pulses, suggesting that in the case of pulses of longer duration, the homeostatic process could overtake light direct influence for shaping sleep and waking distribution.","output":"Direct Effects of Light on Sleep under Ultradian Light-Dark Cycles Depend on Circadian Time and Pulses Duration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To assess whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA vaccination is associated with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation or early pregnancy outcomes. METHODS This retrospective cohort study included patients who underwent controlled ovarian hyperstimulation or single euploid frozen-thawed embryo transfer at a single academic center. Patients fully vaccinated with a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine were compared with unvaccinated patients who cycled during the same time period. The primary outcome was the fertilization rate for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and the clinical pregnancy rate for frozen-thawed embryo transfer. Secondary outcomes for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation included eggs retrieved, mature oocytes retrieved, mature oocytes ratio, blastulation rate, and euploid rate. Secondary outcomes for frozen-thawed embryo transfer included pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, biochemical pregnancy loss rate, and clinical pregnancy loss rate. RESULTS Among 222 vaccinated patients and 983 unvaccinated patients who underwent controlled ovarian hyperstimulation cycles between February and September 2021, there was no association on adjusted analysis between COVID-19 vaccination and fertilization rate (=0.020.02, P=.20) or any of the secondary outcomes assessed: eggs retrieved (=0.010.57, P=.99), mature oocytes retrieved (=0.260.47, P=.58), mature oocytes ratio (=0.020.01, P=.12), blastulation rate (=0.020.02, P=.27), or euploid rate (=0.050.03, P=.08).

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES (1) Is there a difference in quality of life between patients in the COVID-19 period group (March 23, 2020 to May 4, 2020) and patients in a reference period group (from the same period in 2018 or 2019)? (2) Is there a difference in pain, hand function, anxiety, depression, and illness perception between patients in the COVID-19 period group and patients in the reference period group? METHODS This study was part of a large cohort study with routine outcome measures of patients with hand and wrist conditions. To answer our research questions, we analyzed two samples, because not all PROMs were sent to participants at the same time points after treatment. The first sample consisted of all participants who completed PROMs on quality of life, pain, and hand function at their final follow-up time point, which was either 3, 6, or 12 months post-treatment. The second sample consisted of participants who completed PROMs 3 months post-treatment on anxiety, depression, and illness perception. Each sample consisted of two groups: a COVID-19 period group and a reference period group. We included 1613 participants in the first sample (COVID-19 period group: n = 616; reference period group: n = 997) and 535 participants in the second sample (COVID-19 period group: n = 313; reference period group: n = 222). The primary outcome was quality of life, expressed in the EuroQol 5-Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) index score. Secondary outcomes were the other domains on the EQ-5D, as well as pain, hand function, anxiety, depression, and illness perception. RESULTS We found no between-group differences in the EQ-5D index score (standardized mean difference 0.035; p = 0.98). Furthermore, there were no between-group differences in PROM scores for hand function, anxiety, or depression. There were, however, a few small differences in subdomain items regarding pain and illness perception, but we believe in aggregate that these are unlikely to make a clinically important difference in our main finding. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown had no influence on quality of life and had little influence on secondary outcomes in participants who were part of the Hand-Wrist Study Cohort. This finding implies that PROMs data collected during this period can be used with confidence in clinical research. Our findings indicate that when a pandemic like this occurs again, we can continue to use PROMs for analysis in clinical research or routine outcome measures.

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) driven smartphone apps can help alleviate such issues, allowing for in situ recordings. Implementing such an app is not trivial, necessitates strict regulatory and legal requirements, and requires short development cycles to appropriately react to abrupt changes in the pandemic. Based on an existing app framework, we developed Corona Health, an app that serves as a platform for deploying questionnaire-based studies in combination with recordings of mobile sensors.

Results Nations with a higher proportion of people age 65+ had a higher fatality rate (p = 0.00014). Delaying policy enactment led to a higher case fatality rate (p = 0.0013). A 10% delay time to act resulted in a 3.7% higher case fatality rate. This study found that delaying policies for international travel restrictions, public information campaigns, and testing policies increased the fatality rate. Tests also impacted the case fatality rate, and nations with 10% more cumulative tests per million people resulted in a 2.8% lower mortality rate. Citizens of nations who can access more destinations without the need to have a prior visa have a significant higher mortality rate than those that need a visa to travel abroad (p = 0.0040).

Prevalence of Diabetes in adult population in India ranges from 10.9 to 14.2% in urban area and 3.0C7.8% in rural area. Glycemic control is an important factor in preventing the complications associated with diabetes. HBA1c is the indicator of long-term glycemic control and slight variation in it significantly alters the risk of diabetic complications. Thus, the aim of this study was to study the change in HBA1c levels due to lock down in patients with diabetes. METHODS: 307 patients with diabetes who had attended our endocrine OPD in last 3 months before nationwide 68 days lockdown from 24 March 2020 to 31 May 2020, and had recent HBA1c report in past and willing to participate were included in the study after informed consent from 2nd June 2020 to 14th June 2020 when first phase of Unlock started, to identify the change in HBA1c levels during the lockdown period in our patients with diabetes.

Recent clinical guidelines have supported the use of corticosteroids or remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19. However, uncertainty remains about which patients are most likely to benefit from treatment with either drug; such knowledge is crucial for avoiding preventable adverse effects, minimizing costs, and effectively allocating resources. This study presents a machine-learning system with the capacity to identify patients in whom treatment with a corticosteroid or remdesivir is associated with improved survival time. METHODS: Gradient-boosted decision-tree models used for predicting treatment benefit were trained and tested on data from electronic health records dated between December 18, 2019, and October 18, 2020, from adult patients (age &#8805;18 years) with COVID-19 in 10 US hospitals. Models were evaluated for performance in identifying patients with longer survival times when treated with a corticosteroid versus remdesivir. Fine and Gray proportional-hazards models were used for identifying significant findings in treated and nontreated patients, in a subset of patients who received supplemental oxygen, and in patients identified by the algorithm. Inverse probability-of-treatment weights were used to adjust for confounding. Models were trained and tested separately for each treatment. FINDINGS: Data from 2364 patients were included, with men comprising slightly more than 50% of the sample; 893 patients were treated with remdesivir, and 1471 were treated with a corticosteroid. After adjustment for confounding, neither corticosteroids nor remdesivir use was associated with increased survival time in the overall population or in the subpopulation that received supplemental oxygen. However, in the populations identified by the algorithms, both corticosteroids and remdesivir were significantly associated with an increase in survival time, with hazard ratios of 0.56 and 0.40, respectively (both, P = 0.04).

METHODS: This was a qualitative study using in-depth interviews. Patients with suspected COVID-19 infection who used CoSMoS Telegram bot to monitor their COVID-19 symptoms and doctors who conducted the telemonitoring via CoSMoS dashboard were recruited. Universal sampling was used in this study. We stopped the recruitment when data saturation was reached. Patients and doctors shared their experiences using CoSMoS, its utility and usability for COVID-19 symptoms monitoring. Data were coded and analysed using thematic analysis.

The first three quarter years of 2020 were characterized by an unprecedented reduction of elective inpatient services and a prioritization of intensive care capacity for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. This also resulted in clear consequences for the services provided in cardiac surgery. In addition, during the course of the year the personnel in hospitals were confronted with a plethora of amendments in the legal framework conditions. Nevertheless, the modified German diagnosis-related groups (G-DRG) system 2021 was calculated by the Institute for the Remuneration System in Hospitals (InEK). This article describes and assesses the most important amendments of the modified G-DRG system 2021 for cardiac, thoracic and vascular surgery. Methods: Analysis of the relevant diagnoses, procedures and G-DRG structures in the system versions for 2020 and 2021 based on the information published by the InEK and the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM). Results: Expansions of the relevant classification systems for diagnoses (ICD-10-GM 2021) and procedures (OPS 2021) lead to an increase in specific coding of essential interventions and operations in cardiovascular surgery. Within the framework of the adaptation of the G-DRG structures, the condensation of the previous fixed rates for heart transplantation to G-DRG A05Z and devaluation of coronary bypass operations and reconstructive vascular interventions are particularly important. Conclusion: For cardiovascular surgery there are manifold amendments with sometimes substantial repercussions for the case proceeds. Additionally, for many German hospitals the effects of the corona pandemic are not yet finally foreseeable. A further increasingly more urgent influencing factor particularly affecting vascular medicine is the increasing pressure to promote outpatient treatment.

We find that in a small, open economy sectors where human capital, R&D and trade interact, and enable absorption, tend to grow fastest.","output":"The Role of Human Capital in Structural Change and Growth in an Open Economy: Innovative and Absorptive Capacity Effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global response to infectious diseases has seen a renewed interest in the use of community engagement to support research and relief efforts. From a perspective rooted in the social sciences, the concept of vulnerability offers an especially useful analytical frame for pursuing community engagement in a variety of contexts. However, few have closely examined the concept of vulnerability in community engagement efforts, leading to a need to better understand the various theories that underline the connections between the two. This literature review searched four databases (covering a total of 537 papers), resulting in 15 studies that analyze community engagement using a framing of vulnerability, broadly defined, in the context of an infectious disease, prioritizing historical and structural context and the many ways of constituting communities. The review identified historical and structural factors such as trust in the health system, history of political marginalization, various forms of racism and discrimination, and other aspects of vulnerability that are part and parcel of the main challenges faced by communities. The review found that studies using vulnerability within community engagement share some important characteristics (e.g., focus on local history and structural factors) and identified a few theoretical avenues from the social sciences which integrate a vulnerability-informed approach in community engagement. Finally, the review proposes an approach that brings together the concepts of vulnerability and community engagement, prioritizing participation, empowerment, and intersectoral collaboration.","output":"Community engagement and vulnerability in infectious diseases: A systematic review and qualitative analysis of the literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human connection is universally important, particularly in the context of serious illness and at the end of life. The presence of close family and friends has many benefits when death is close. Hospital visitation restrictions during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic therefore warrant careful consideration to ensure equity, proportionality, and the minimization of harm. The Australian and New Zealand Society for Palliative Medicine COVID-19 Special Interest Group utilized the relevant ethical and public health principles, together with the existing disease outbreak literature and evolving COVID-19 knowledge, to generate a practical framework of visiting restrictions for inpatients receiving palliative and end-of-life care. Expert advice from an Infectious Diseases physician ensured relevance to community transmission dynamics. Three graded levels of visitor restrictions for inpatient settings are proposed, defining an appropriate level of minimum access. These depend upon the level of community transmission of COVID-19, the demand on health services, the potential COVID-19 status of the patient and visitors, and the imminence of the patients death. This framework represents a cohesive, considered, proportionate, and ethically robust approach to improve equity and consistency for inpatients receiving palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic and may serve as a template for future disease outbreaks.","output":"An Ethical Framework for Visitation of Inpatients Receiving Palliative Care in the COVID-19 Context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized immunotherapy against various cancers over the last decade. The use of checkpoint inhibitors results in remarkable re-activation of patients immune system, but is also associated with significant adverse events. In this review, we emphasize the importance of cell-type specificity in the context of immune checkpoint-based interventions and particularly focus on the relevance of macrophages. Immune checkpoint blockade alters the dynamic macrophage phenotypes and thereby substantially manipulates therapeutical outcome. Considering the macrophage-specific immune checkpoint biology, it seems feasible to ameliorate the situation of patients with severe side effects and even increase the probability of survival for non-responders to checkpoint inhibition. Apart from malignancies, investigating immune checkpoint molecules on macrophages has stimulated their fundamental characterization and use in other diseases as well, such as acute and chronic infections and autoimmune pathologies. Although the macrophage-specific effect of checkpoint molecules has been less studied so far, the current literature shows that a macrophage-centered blockade of immune checkpoints as well as a stimulation of their expression represents promising therapeutic avenues. Ultimately, the therapeutic potential of a macrophage-focused checkpoint therapy might be maximized by diagnostically assessing individual checkpoint expression levels on macrophages, thereby personalizing an effective treatment approach for each patient having cancer, infection, or autoimmune diseases.","output":"The Role of Immune Checkpoint Molecules on Macrophages in Cancer, Infection, and Autoimmune Pathologies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging global health emergency caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

In particular, cyber-enabled AM systems have recently become widely applied in many real-world applications. It significantly improves the flexibility and productivity of AM but poses the system under high risks of cyber-physical attacks. For example, cyber-physical attack could maliciously tamper the product design and process parameters, which, in turn, leads to significant alteration of the desired properties in AM products. Therefore, there is an urgent need in incorporating advanced technologies to improve the cyber-physical security for the cyber-enabled AM systems. In this study, two common types of cyber-physical attacks regarding the G-code security were investigated, namely, unintended design modifications and intellectual property theft. To effectively secure the G-code against these two attacks, a new methodology is developed in this study, which consists of a novel blockchain-based data storage approach and an effective asymmetry encryption technique. The proposed method was also applied to a real-world AM case for ensuring the cyber-physical security of the face shield fabrication, which is critical during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the proposed methodology, malicious tampering can be accurately detected in time, and meanwhile, the risk of unauthorized access of the G-code file is greatly eliminated as well. ? 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Honor is a cultural mindset focused on protecting oneself and ones family by maintaining reputation. To demonstrate honor, people may take matters into their own hands in contexts in which this is possible. Indeed, during the pandemic, Americans (Studies 1, 2) who valued honor acted independently of governmental measures because they preferred relying on themselves (N = 1,179). This was not the case for Iranians (Study 3), for whom higher honor values increased adherence to public health guidelines.

While remote working has several benefits, one of its downsides is to create information and communication technology (ICT) demands (e.g., feeling obligated to stay connected). While previous studies have revealed the harmful effects of ICT, very few have investigated the impact of ICT demands on three specific related psychosocial factors. In such a context, this study aims to shed light on the relationship between ICT demands, mental fatigue, psychological distress and well-being. 2. Material and Method. The study was conducted during the first wave of COVID-19 in 2020 in Canada. The data was collected from 320 workers who provided online consent and completed the survey on a voluntary basis. Ethical approval from the research ethics committee of Laval University was obtained. Hayes Process add-on for SPSS was used to test parallel mediation analyses. The study used validated measures to assess ICT demands, mental fatigue, psychological distress, and well-being. 3. Results and Conclusions. The results reveal that mental fatigue and psychological distress significantly mediate the negative relationship between ICT demands and well-being. In a context where many organizations are now considering adopting telecommuting on a permanent or hybrid basis, these findings suggest that special attention must be paid to sufficiently supported workers in their remote work to mitigate the adverse effects on psychological health.","output":"Remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic: How do digital technology use affects mental fatigue, psychological distress and well-being?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: This article describes the impact of the pandemic on physical medicine and rehabilitation in a COVID-19 referral center of a developing country.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTINGS: Field area of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. PARTICIPANTS: More than 30 000 individuals irrespective of their age, sex, acute/past COVID-19 infection participated in the serosurvey which covered all the 75 Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHCs) across 48 wards and 7 zones of the city. Study also involved healthcare workers (HCWs) from COVID-19/non-COVID-19 hospitals. INTERVENTIONS: Seropositivity of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was measured as a mark of COVID-19 infection. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Seropositivity was used to calculate cumulative incidence. Correlation of seropositivity with available demographic detail was used for valid and precise assessment of the pandemic situation. RESULTS: From 30 054 samples, the results were available for 29 891 samples and the crude seropositivity is 17.61%. For all the various age groups, the seropositivity calculated between 15% and 20%. The difference in seropositivity for both the sex group is statistically not significant. The seropositivity is significantly lower (13.64%) for HCWs as compared with non-HCWs (18.71%). Seropositivity shows increasing trend with time. Zone with maximum initial cases has high positivity as compared with other zones. UPHCs with recent rise in cases are leading in seropositivity as compared with earlier and widely affected UPHCs.

In this work, we utilize a nested active learning (AL) workflow to efficiently parameterize and contextualize an ABM of systemic inflammation used to examine sepsis. Contextual parameter space was examined using four parameters external to the model's rule set. The model's internal parameterization, which represents gene expression and associated cellular behaviors, was explored through the augmentation or inhibition of signaling pathways for 12 signaling mediators associated with inflammation and wound healing. We have implemented a nested AL approach in which the clinically relevant (CR) model environment space for a given internal model parameterization is mapped using a small Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The outer AL level workflow is a larger ANN that uses AL to efficiently regress the volume and centroid location of the CR space given by a single internal parameterization. We have reduced the number of simulations required to efficiently map the CR parameter space of this model by approximately 99%.

Inspection of the discordant peptides shows the utility of PeCorA for the direct and indirect detection of regulated post-translational modifications (PTMs) and also for the discovery of poorly quantified peptides. The exclusion of poorly quantified peptides before protein quantity summarization decreased false-positives in a benchmark data set.

METHODS: A total of 6.467 patients hospitalized with the COVID-19 diagnosis were included in the study. Patients diagnosed with AP based on the Atlanta criteria were identified. Etiological factors were determined in patients who developed acute pancreatitis and compared with the etiological factors in 315 patients with non-COVID-19, hospitalized with the diagnosis of AP before the COVID-19 pandemic. AP was detected in 0.1% of patients with COVID-19.

The reference theories used that are relevant to the theme of this research include the theory of the spread and transmission of the COVID-19 virus through the air and the HVAC system, the theory of the oceanarium, and other supporting theories. Based on the results of the analysis and discussion, it is concluded that several design indicators can be used as the basis for the concept of a design strategy, namely: 1) The importance of natural air ventilation;2) HVAC system used;3) Limiting the duration of visits in a closed room;3) Design of a separate building mass;4) Minimizing direct contact between visitors and managers and visitors with visitors;5) Maintain distance between visitors, visitors and operators.

There was an anxiety that biologic therapies, especially anti-B-cell depletion strategies, could lead to more severe disease course and lack of protective antibodies formation. Information about the course of COVID-19 in patients with certain rheumatic diseases is still lacking. Objectives: To examine clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with Sjogren's syndrome treated with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab). Methods: Single center observational study. Diagnosis of SjS was based on ECR/EULAR 2016 criteria. COVID-19 diagnosis was based on positive PCR test even without clinical symptoms and/or typical clinical features (CT signs, fever and anosmia). Rituximab was administrated in two 1000 mg infusions 14 days apart for the 1st course, then 500 mg every 6 months. Results: 19 patients were included, 18 women and 1 man. Median age was 55 years (29-70 years), and median rituximab treatment duration was 24 months (1-48 months). Five patients had concomitant RA (2 patients), SLAE (1 pt), Systemic sclerosis (2 patients). Patients with RA took baricitinib and methotrexate as well. 3 patients had MALT-lymphoma anamnesis (24, 38 and 24 months before the diagnosis of COVID-19). Only 3 patients had chronic ischemic heart disease and/or arterial hypertension. 12 patients were PCR positive, 6 negative and in 1 the test was not done. 11 patients had full and 4 partial B-cell depletion in peripheral blood. Five patients had <20% lung involvement on CT, 2 patients -20-40% and 4 patients -40-60%. Three patients with 40-60% lung involvement required hospitalization due to marked shortness of breath and long febrile period, 2 of them received anti-IL6 treatment and neither of them required mechanical lung ventilation (either non-invasive or invasive). Seventeen patients were treated at home and recovered in 10-24 days. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG were measured in 9 patients, 6 (66.7%) of them were positive. Conclusion: It seems that neither SjS itself nor anti-CD20 therapy predisposes patients to severe course of COVID-19. Presumably risk factors such as age, diabetes or anamnesis of cardiovascular diseases have far more significant impact on COVID-19 severity. Data hints that anti-CD20 therapy might negatively affect the formation of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity, but further investigation is required to determine that with any degree of certainty.","output":"The course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with sjogren's syndrome treated with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is primarily transmitted from human to human via droplets and aerosols. While transmission via contaminated surfaces is also considered possible, the overall risk of this transmission route is assumed to be low. Nevertheless, transmission through contaminated drinking glasses may pose an increased risk as the glass is in direct contact with the mouth and oral cavity. Using human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) as surrogate for SARS-CoV-2, this study examined coronavirus stability on glass, inactivation by dishwashing detergents, and virus elimination by a manual glass scrubbing device. Infectious HCoV-229E was recovered from glass up to 7 and 21 days storage under daylight and dark conditions, respectively. Near complete inactivation of HCoV-229E (>4 log(10) reduction) was observed after incubation with two common dishwashing detergents at room temperature for 15 s, whereas incubation at 43 C for 60 s was necessary for a third detergent to achieve a similar titer reduction. The virus was efficiently removed from contaminated drinking glasses using a manual glass scrubbing device in accordance with German standard DIN 6653-3. The results confirm that coronaviruses are relatively stable on glass, but indicate that common manual dishwashing procedures can efficiently eliminate coronaviruses from drinking glasses.","output":"Coronaviruses are stable on glass, but are eliminated by manual dishwashing procedures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly spread throughout the world and caused a large global pandemic which drastically changed our everyday lives. As the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, a number of its characteristics showed enormous inter-individual and inter-population differences. Earlier genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified potential key genes and genetic variants associated with the risk and prognosis of COVID-19, but the underlying biological interpretation is largely unclear. Our previous work described genomic data generated through non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) based on low-coverage massively parallel whole-genome sequencing of total plasma DNA of pregnant women in Slovakia as a valuable source of population specific data. In the present study, we have performed a literature search of studies and used NIPT data to determine the population allele frequency of risk COVID-19 variants that have been reported in GWAS studies to date. We also focused on variants located in the ACE2 gene, encoding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is hypothesized to be a possible genetic risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Allele frequencies of identified variants were compared with six world populations from the gnomAD database to detect significant differences between populations. We interpreted variants and searched for functional consequences and clinical significance of variants using publicly available databases. Finally, 2 COVID-19 risk variants were found that showed statistically significant differences in population allele frequencies - rs383510 and rs1801274.

Particularly, where the 4(th) industrial revolution is expected to fundamentally change the economy, society, and financial systems, it may also create opportunities for a zero-carbon future. Therefore, in the context of UK's legally binding commitment to achieve a net-zero emissions target by 2050, we analyse the role of economic growth, R&D expenditures, financial development, and energy consumption in causing carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions. Employing the bootstrapping bounds testing approach to examine short- and long-run relationships, our analysis is based on historical data from 1870 to 2017. The results suggest the existence of cointegration between CO(2) emissions and its determinants. Financial development and energy consumption lead to environmental degradation, but R&D expenditures help to reduce CO(2) emissions. The estimated environmental effects of economic growth support the EKC hypothesis. While a U-shaped relationship is found between financial development and CO(2) emissions, the nexus between R&D expenditures and CO(2) emissions is analogues to the EKC. In the context of the efforts to tackle climate change, our findings suggest policy prescriptions by using financial development and R&D expenditures as the key tools to meet the emissions target.","output":"UK's net-zero carbon emissions target: Investigating the potential role of economic growth, financial development, and R&D expenditures based on historical data (1870C2017)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & AIM: COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic with high rates of morbidity and mortality, and an uncertain prognosis leading to an increased risk of infection in health providers and limited hospital care capacities. In this study, we have proposed a predictive, interpretable prognosis scoring system with the use of readily obtained clinical, radiological and laboratory characteristics to accurately predict worsening of the condition and overall survival of patients with COVID -19. METHODS: This is a single-center, observational, prospective, cohort study. A total of 347 patients infected with COVID-19 presenting to the Tanta university hospital, Egypt, were enrolled in the study, and clinical, radiological and laboratory data were analyzed. Top-ranked variables were identified and selected to be integrated into a Cox regression model, building the scoring system for accurate prediction of the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: The six variables that were finally selected in the scoring system were lymphopenia, serum CRP, ferritin, D-Dimer, radiological CT lung findings and associated chronic debilitating disease. The scoring system discriminated risk groups with either mild disease or severe illness characterized by respiratory distress (and also those with hypoxia and in need for oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation) or death. The area under the curve to estimate the discrimination performance of the scoring system was more than 90%. CONCLUSION: We proposed a simple and clinically useful predictive scoring model for COVID-19 patients.

The lack of a potent 3CL(pro) inhibitor and the availability of the X-ray crystal structure of 3CL(pro) (PDB-ID 6LU7) motivated us to perform computational studies to identify commercially available potential inhibitors. A combination of modeling studies was performed to identify potential 3CL(pro) inhibitors from the protease inhibitor database MEROPS (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/merops/index.shtml).

METHODS: Sera from 98 SSc-patients, 110 patients with other chronic inflammatory rheumatic disorders, 97 patients with autoimmune liver diseases, 57 patients with toxic or chronic viral liver diseases and 36 healthy controls were analyzed. A luminometric bioassay was established with Huh-7-cells constitutively expressing the AT(1)R. Patients sera were also tested by commercially available ELISA for anti-AT(1)R, -ET(A)1- and by an in-house ELISA for antiCtopo-I-abs. RESULTS: Fifty-two percent of the SSc-patients had functionally active anti-AT(1)R-abs with stimulatory (34%) or inhibitory capacity (18%). They were present also in up to 59% of patients with other rheumatic diseases but only 22% of healthy individuals (sensitivity 52%, specificity 53%). The functionally active antibodies detected by the luminometric assay did not correlate with anti-AT(1)R-, -ET(A)1- or -topo-I-abs measured by ELISA, but there was a strong correlation between anti-topo-I-, AT(1)R-, and -ET(A)1-ab reactivity measured by ELISA. Sensitivities of 55%, 28% and 47% and specificities of 66%, 87%, and 99% were calculated for these anti-AT(1)R-, -ET(A)1-, and anti-topo-I-abs, respectively. Functionally active abs did not correlate with disease severity or any organ manifestation. In contrast, abs to topo-I, AT(1)R, and ET(A)1 were associated with digital ulcers, pulmonary- and esophageal manifestation. CONCLUSIONS: Functionally active anti-AT(1)R-abs can be detected in SSc-patients but do not correlate with disease activity. They are not specific for this disease and occur also in other autoimmune disorders and even viral or toxic diseases. Also, the vascular antibodies detected by ELISA are not SSc-specific but correlated with disease manifestations. In contrast, anti-topo-I-abs were confirmed to be a highly specific biomarker for both, diagnosis and organ manifestations of SSc.","output":"Functionally Active Antibodies to the Angiotensin II Type 1-Receptor Measured by a Luminometric Bioassay Do Not Correlate With Clinical Manifestations in Systemic Sclerosis: A Comparison With Antibodies to Vascular Receptors and Topoisomerase I Detected by ELISA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper presents some solutions to modeling the global spread of coronaviruses on the basis of some factors affecting such spread The goal hereof was to select the best machine learning model to predict the COVID-19 pandemic Statistical data was also processed by artificial neural networks, including population density and immunity, the number of infected people, and other parameters and their interdependencies The paper investigates the dynamic processes of the stochastic spread of coronaviruses as affected by virologists' late or ineffective action Viral spread was predicted by two methods: the first is based on describing the epidemiological states (health, infection, illness, recovery, death) with different probabilities of transitions between the states;the second is based on testing computer learning models Pandemic spread modeling enabled the research to derive the numbers of susceptible, recovering, and infected patients as a function of time, and to find when the infected population numbers would peak Analysis of the produced modeling solutions shows that viral spread may occur in a variety of manners, which is largely in line with the real-world observations ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Testing the Applicability of IT Instrumentation to Projecting the Spread of Viral Epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory disease, has infected over 34,000,000 people since the end of 2019, killed over 1,000,000, and caused worldwide social and economic disruption.

The psychometric properties of the Portuguese version of the FCV-19S were evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis and Rash analysis. Additionally, the association of the FCV-19S with sociodemographic and pandemic-related variables was investigated using the two-sample t-test, one-way analysis of variance, and logistic regression. RESULTS: The unidimensional factor structure of the Portuguese version of the FCV-19S was confirmed, and the scale showed good internal consistency reliability. The FCV-19S properties tested from the Rasch analysis were satisfactory. Women and those with lower education levels had higher scores of fear. Moreover, significantly higher levels of fear were observed among those being in an at-risk group for COVID-19, having family members or friends diagnosed or with death confirmed by COVID-19, and not being confident that they would receive adequate care from the public health services in case of COVID-19 infection.

Transpl Infect Dis 2011: 13: 448C455. xx: 000C000. All rights reserved Abstract: A simple clinical screening (CS) tool for respiratory virus (RV) infection was introduced and evaluated in a single hematology ward, as part of a strategy to reduce nosocomial RV infection. Up to 6 clinical symptoms or signs were scored and a predefined threshold score of 2 prompted paired nose/throat swab (NTS) collection for RV testing. The criterion standard for RV infection was positive immunofluorescence (IF) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 7 and 15 viruses, respectively. The tool was shown to be most beneficial at excluding infection at a threshold score of 1 (negative predictive value [NPV] 89%, [95% confidence interval 78C96%], sensitivity 85% [70C94%], specificity 35% [27C43%]), compared with a score of 2 (NPV 85% [76C91%], sensitivity 63% [46C77%], specificity 57% [48C65%]) at a prevalence of 22%. The tool's ability to diagnose infection was limited (positive predictive value 27% and 29% at thresholds 1 and 2). The sensitivity of IF compared with PCR was 45% for the 7 viruses common to both, and 23% for the extended virus panel detected by PCR. An algorithm incorporating CS, paired NTS collection at a threshold of 1 symptom or sign, and sensitive testing including PCR can guide infection control measures in hospitalized hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.","output":"Evaluation of a clinical scoring system and directed laboratory testing for respiratory virus infection in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biocides are commonly used as spray- or trigger-type formulations, thus dermal and respiratory exposure to biocide aerosol is unavoidable. However, little is known about the impact of aerosolization on the local toxicity of biocides on the skin or the airway.

Three biocides, 1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one (BIT), 2-phenoxyethanol (PE), and 2-phenylphenol (OPP), most widely used in the market were selected. When the biocide was treated in aerosols, toxicity to the skin epidermis and upper airway tissue became significantly attenuated compared with the direct application as determined by the higher tissue viabilities. This was further confirmed in histological examination, wherein the tissue damages were less pronounced. LC-MS/MS and GC/MS analysis revealed that concentrations of biocides decreased during aerosolization. Importantly, the toxicity of biocides treated in 3 m (median mass aerodynamic diameter (MMAD)) aerosols was stronger than that of 5 m aerosol, suggesting that the aerosol particle size may affect biocide toxicity. Collectively, we demonstrated that aerosolization could affect the local toxicity of biocides on the skin epidermis and the upper airway.","output":"Local Toxicity of Biocides after Direct and Aerosol Exposure on the Human Skin Epidermis and Airway Tissue Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A phage library displaying 1010 variants of the fibronectin type III (FN3) domain was affinity selected with the biotinylated form of the receptor binding domain (RBD, residues 319-541) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein.

While pairwise tests failed to identify a monobody pair that could bind simultaneously to the RBD, one monobody could simultaneously bind to the RBD with the ectodomain of the cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). All four monobodies successfully bound the RBD after overexpression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as fusions to the Fc domain of human IgG1.","output":"FN3-based monobodies selective for the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in adults associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) infection is increasingly reported in published literature, although published reports remain sparse.

The early identification of MIS plays a crucial role in the prompt initiation of suitable treatment. Therefore, differential diagnosis and exclusion of other causes of illness are of priority. We believe that MIS in children treatment guidelines can be reformed in a way to include MIS in adults as well.","output":"Severe Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Associated With SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 in a 31-Year-Old Male Patient: The First Clinical Case Report From the Republic of Cyprus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Severe adverse events (AEs), such as Guillain\\\\Barr syndrome (GBS) occur rarely after influenza vaccination. We identify highly associated AEs with GBS and develop prediction models for GBS using the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports following trivalent influenza vaccination (FLU3). METHODS: This study analyzed 80 059 reports from the US VAERS between 1990 and 2017. Several AEs were identified as highly associated with GBS and were used to develop the prediction model. Some common and mild AEs that were suspected to be underreported when GBS occurred simultaneously were removed from the final model. The analyses were validated using European influenza vaccine AEs data from EudraVigilance. RESULTS: Of the 80 059 reports, 1185 (1.5%) were annotated as GBS related. Twenty\\\\four AEs were identified as having strong association with GBS. The full prediction model, using age, sex, and all 24 AEs achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 85.4% (90% CI: [83.8%, 86.9%]). After excluding the nine (e.g., pruritus, rash, injection site pain) likely underreported AEs, the final AUC became 77.5% (90% CI: [75.5%, 79.6%]). Two hundred and one (0.25%) reports were predicted as of high risk of GBS (predicted probability >25%) and 84 actually developed GBS. CONCLUSION: The prediction performance demonstrated the potential of developing risk\\\\prediction models utilizing the VAERS cohort. Excluding the likely underreported AEs sacrificed some prediction power but made the model more interpretable and feasible. The high absolute risk of even a small number of AE combinations suggests the promise of GBS prediction within the VAERS dataset.","output":"Prediction of post\\\\vaccination Guillain\\\\Barr syndrome using data from a passive surveillance system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mobility restriction is the most effective measure to control the spread of infectious disease at its early stage, especially if a cure and vaccine are not available. When control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) required strong precautionary measures, lockdowns were necessarily implemented in countries around the globe. Public health risk communication about the justification and scope of a lockdown was challenging as it involved a conflict between solidarity and individual liberty and a trade-off between various values across groups with different socioeconomic statuses. In the study, we examined public responses to the government-announced circuit breaker (a local term for lockdown) at four-time points in Singapore: (1) entry, (2) extension, (3) exit of lockdown phase 1 and (4) entry of lockdown phase 2. METHODS: We randomly collected 100 comments from the relevant articles on new organisations Facebook and Instagram pages and conducted preliminary coding. Later, additional random 20 comments were collected to check the data saturation. Content analysis was focused on identifying themes that emerged from the responses across the four-time points. RESULTS: At the entry, public support for the lockdown was prevalent; yet most responses were abstract with uncertainty. At six weeks of lockdown, initial public responses with uncertainty turned into salient narratives of their lived experiences and hardship with lockdown and unmasking of societal weaknesses caused by COVID-19. At the entry to phase 2, responses were centred on social-economic impact, disparity, and lockdown burnout with the contested notion of continuing solidarity. A temporal pattern was seen in the rationalisation of the lockdown experience from trust, anxiety, attribution of pandemic and lockdown, blaming of non-compliant behaviours, and confusion. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicated a temporal evolution of public responses from solidarity, attribution of the sustained pandemic, increasing ambiguity towards strong precautionary measures, concerns about economic hardship and mental well-being to worsened social vulnerability, where the governments restrictive policies were questioned with anxiety and confusion. Public health risk communication in response to COVID-19 should be transparent and address health equity and social justice to enhance individual and collective responsibility in protecting the public from the pandemic.","output":"Contested solidarity and vulnerability in social media-based public responses to COVID-19 policies of mobility restrictions in Singapore: a qualitative analysis of temporal evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The common good and public service are important to gain public trust especially in the midst of a pandemic of misinformation about vaccines and miracle therapies being spread on social media.

We hereby present the results of a pivotal study we ran in our centre just before the COVID19 pandemic. Methods: This was a prospective study including all adult cystic fibrosis patients who underwent lung transplant (LuTx) from September 2017 to August 2019. Patients were randomized into two groups;patients assigned to the first arm (intervention) received a home medical assistant (HMA) system device, to which a pulse oximeter and a spirometer with reusable turbine were integrated;they were asked to perform a spirometry and register their SpO2 at rest and on effort on a twice-weekly basis. All the data were digitally transmitted to our centre, where physiotherapists and physicians were able to analyse them real-time. Both the groups received traditional hospital-based follow-up. Results: 32 patients were enrolled, 16 in each group. No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups (see Table 1).With reference to the telemonitoring group:- Adherence to telemonitoring significantly decreased during the 12months period of follow up (see figure 1).- Hospital reported data were consistent with the last being registered with the HMA device.- Of note, two patients were requested to anticipate their hospital routine visit because of a FEV1 decrease being reported on their HMA device, in order to rule out possible acute lung allograft dysfunction.- 13 out of 16 patients reported a high degree of satisfaction with the telemonitoring experience. Conclusion: The COVID19 pandemic highlighted the necessity to investigate alternative practices to treat chronically ill individuals. In our study, telemonitoring proved to be a valuable tool to improve quality health care to LuTx recipients, especially for those who live far from the transplant centre. We are now implementing this approach scheduling online video consultations. Further research should be focused on standardizing quality of telemedicine services.","output":"Telemonitoring: An Opportunity to Improve Multidisciplinary Care in Lung Transplanted Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resilience of food systems is key to ensuring food security through crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented shock that reveals varying levels of resilience of increasingly interconnected food systems across the globe. We contribute to the ongoing debate about whether increased connectivity reduces or enhances resilience in the context of rural Pacific food systems, while examining how communities have adapted to the global shocks associated with the pandemic to ensure food security. We conducted 609 interviews across 199 coastal villages from May to October 2020 in Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Tuvalu to understand community-level impacts and adaptations during the first 5C10 months of the COVID-19 crisis. We found that local food production practices and food sharing conferred resilience, and that imported foods could aid or inhibit resilience. Communities in countries more reliant on imports were almost twice as likely to report food insecurity compared to those least reliant. However, in places dealing with a concurrent cyclone, local food systems were impaired, and imported foods proved critical. Our findings suggest that policy in the Pacific should bolster sustainable local food production and practices. Pacific states should avoid becoming overly reliant on food imports, while having measures in place to support food security after disasters, supplementing locally produced and preserved foods with imported foods when necessary. Developing policies that promote resilient food systems can help prepare communities for future shocks, including those anticipated with climate change.","output":"Local practices and production confer resilience to rural Pacific food systems during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aumento na incidncia de infec??es bacterianas nosocomiais e infec??es fngicas invasivas (IFI) j foi descrito em pacientes com COVID-19.

The aim is to fill the gaps in Nigeria's insolvency and business recovery laws by recommending a model for the sustenance of oil firms and to suggest the reform of the gaps identified in the existing laws and the extant literature on the subject. The paper opted for conceptual legal review, comparative legal and policies analyses of solvency and business recovery legislations in Nigeria, Malaysia, India, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States. These nations were designated for this study because their insolvency and business recovery legal regime are business rescued driven, not winding up centred.

An efficient, scaleable manufacturing process for griffithsin active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is essential for particularly cost-sensitive products such as griffithsin -based topical microbicides for HIV-1 prevention in resource poor settings. Our previously published purification method used ceramic filtration followed by two chromatography steps, resulting in a protein recovery of 30%. Our objective was to develop a scalable purification method for griffithsin expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana plants that would increase yield, reduce production costs, and simplify manufacturing techniques. Considering the future need to transfer griffithsin manufacturing technology to resource poor areas, we chose to focus modifying the purification process, paying particular attention to introducing simple, low-cost, and scalable procedures such as use of temperature, pH, ion concentration, and filtration to enhance product recovery. RESULTS: We achieved >99% pure griffithsin API by generating the initial green juice extract in pH 4 buffer, heating the extract to 55C, incubating overnight with a bentonite MgCl(2) mixture, and final purification with Capto? multimodal chromatography. Griffithsin extracted with this protocol maintains activity comparable to griffithsin purified by the previously published method and we are able to recover a substantially higher yield: 88  5% of griffithsin from the initial extract. The method was scaled to produce gram quantities of griffithsin with high yields, low endotoxin levels, and low purification costs maintained. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology developed to purify griffithsin introduces and develops multiple tools for purification of recombinant proteins from plants at an industrial scale. These tools allow for robust cost-effective production and purification of griffithsin. The methodology can be readily scaled to the bench top or industry and process components can be used for purification of additional proteins based on biophysical characteristics.","output":"Improving the large scale purification of the HIV microbicide, griffithsin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Second-hand smoke is a neglected public health issue.

METHODS: A dynamic transmission model that extended the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered framework by incorporating asymptomatic, presymptomatic and waiting-to-be-diagnosed patients was constructed to conduct the cost-effectiveness analysis from the healthcare system perspective. To estimate epidemic parameters, the model was first calibrated to the observed epidemic curve in Wuhan from 23 January to 19 March 2020. Following the calibration, the infected compartment was replaced by 3 severity-defined health states to reflect differential costs and quality of life associated with disease gravity. Costs and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) outcomes of 9 million simulated people were accrued across time to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of remdesivir. As robustness checks, an alternative modelling technique using decision tree, additional epidemic scenarios representing different epidemic intensities, and 1-way parameter variations were also analysed. RESULTS: Remdesivir treatment cost CN97.93 million more than standard of care. Also, the net QALY gain from 5-day remdesivir treatment was 6947 QALYs. As such, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was CN14 098/QALY, substantially lower than the gross domestic product per capita threshold.

The most frequent thyroid hormonal findings in patients with COVID-19, particularly in individuals with severe disease, are similar to those present in the non-thyroidal illness syndrome and require no intervention. Subacute thyroiditis has also been reported during COVID-19 infection. Diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism during the COVID-19 pandemic may follow usual practice; however, should avoid frequent laboratory tests in patients with previous controlled disease. Well-controlled hypo and hyperthyroidism are not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection or severity. Newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism during the pandemic should be preferably treated with antithyroid drugs (ATDs), bearing in mind the possibility of rare side effects with these medications, particularly agranulocytosis, which requires immediate intervention. Definitive treatment of hyperthyroidism (radioiodine therapy or surgery) may be considered in those cases that protective protocols can be followed to avoid COVID-19 contamination or once the pandemic is over. In patients with moderate Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) not at risk of visual loss, glucocorticoids at immunosuppressive doses should be avoided, while in those with severe GO without COVID-19 and at risk of vision loss, intravenous glucocorticoid is the therapeutic choice. Considering that most of the thyroid cancer cases are low risk and associated with an excellent prognosis, surgical procedures could and should be postponed safely during the pandemic period.

Here we show that, for interim estimates of VE, this characteristic burstiness in SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics may introduce a strong positive bias in VE. Specifically, we generate null models of vaccine effectiveness, i.e., random models with burstiness that over longer times converge to exactly zero VE, but that for interim times frequently produce apparent VE near 100%. As an example, by following the relevant clinical trial protocol, we can reproduce recently reported interim outcomes from an ongoing phase 3 clinical trial of a RNA based vaccine candidate.

Robust innate responses characterized by increases in activated CD14(+) CD16(+) monocytes and cytokine responses were observed as early as 2 days after symptom onset. Cellular and humoral severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2-specific adaptive responses were detectable in all patients. Infectious virus shedding was limited to the first week after symptom onset. A strong innate response, characterized by mobilization of activated monocytes during the first days of infection and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, was detectable even in patients with mild disease.

We describe the detailed viral and immune profiles of the first five patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 and quarantined in Geneva, Switzerland. Viral loads peaked at the very beginning of the disease, and infectious virus was shed only during the early acute phase of disease. No infectious virus could be isolated by culture 7 days after onset of symptoms, while viral RNA was still detectable for a prolonged period. Importantly, we saw that all patients, even those with mild symptoms, mount an innate response sufficient for viral control (characterized by early activated cytokines and monocyte responses) and develop specific immunity as well as cellular and humoral SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive responses, which already begin to decline a few months after the resolution of symptoms.","output":"Daily Viral Kinetics and Innate and Adaptive Immune Response Assessment in COVID-19: a Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) evades antiviral immunity through the expression of viral proteins that block detection, signaling, interferon (IFN) induction, and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. Weak induction of type I IFNs is associated with a hyperinflammatory response in patients that develop severe COVID-19. Here we uncover a role for cellular nucleic acid-binding protein (CNBP) in restricting SARS-CoV-2. Typically, CNBP resides in the cytosol and, in response to RNA sensing pathways, undergoes phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and IFN enhancer DNA binding to turn on IFN gene transcription. In SARS-CoV-2-infected cells CNBP coordinates IFN gene transcription. In addition, CNBP binds SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA directly. CNBP competes with the nucleocapsid (N) protein and prevents viral RNA and nucleocapsid protein from undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) forming condensates critical for viral replication. Consequently, cells and animals lacking CNBP have higher viral loads and CNBP-deficient mice succumb rapidly to infection. Altogether, these findings identify CNBP as a key antiviral factor for SARS-CoV-2, functioning both as a regulator of antiviral IFN gene expression and a cell intrinsic restriction factor that disrupts LLPS to limit viral replication and spread.","output":"CNBP restricts SARS-CoV2 by regulating IFN and disrupting RNA-protein condensates (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and confinement with movement restriction measures were applied in Spain. Postnatal mental disorders are common but frequently undiagnosed, being a risk period to develop anxiety and depression symptoms. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of confinement as depressive and anxiety symptoms in pregnant women (PrW) and puerperal women (PuW) mental health, as well as obstetric and perinatal outcomes during this period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The self-administered survey consists of a total of 28 questions, the first 16 providing contextual information and the following ones corresponding to the GHQ-12 that has been evaluated in a binomial form. A logistic regression model has been used to assess whether the contextual variables acted as a protective or risk factor and its fitting has been represented by a receiver operating curve. RESULTS: Of the 754 PrW interviewed, 58.22% were screened positive. Confinement time for these was 54.93  9.75 days. The risk factors that were identified after the refinement have been to have a worse general state of health, to be sadder and to be more nervous. Among the protectors have been found to have a higher Apgar 10 score and induction of labor. The area under the adjusted regression adjustment curve was 0.8056. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms with strict confinement measures. PrW and PuW must be considered a risk group to develop mental health disorders during disruption circumstances. Using a mental health screening tool could help to identify a group of patients with more risk and to carry out a careful monitoring to allow adequate management.","output":"GESTACOVID project: psychological and perinatal effects in Spanish pregnant women subjected to confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted adults with chronic diseases, and their health care delivery Patterns of COVID-19-related preventive behaviors practiced by cancer survivors are unknown, including practices related to canceling doctor's appointments We evaluated COVID-19-related preventive behaviors among cancer survivors in the United States (US) METHODS: We used nationally-representative data of 10,760 US adults from the COVID-19 Impact Survey We defined cancer survivors as those with a self-reported diagnosis of cancer (n=854,7 6%) We present frequencies and 2-tests to evaluate COVID-19-related preventive behaviors among cancer survivors We estimated determinants of canceling doctor's appointments among cancer survivors using Poisson regression models RESULTS: Cancer survivors were more likely to practice preventive behaviors, including social distancing (93%, 2-p-value&lt;0 001), wear a face mask (93%, 2-p-value&lt;0 001), and avoid crowded areas (84%, 2-p-value&lt;0 001) compared to other adults Cancer survivors were more likely to cancel doctor's appointments (41%, 2-p-value&lt;0 001) whereas they were less likely to cancel other social activities such as work(19%, 2-p-value&lt;0 001) and school-related(13%, 2-p-value&lt;0 001) activities After adjustment for covariates, while non-Hispanic(NH)-Black cancer survivors were less likely to cancel a doctor's appointment compared to NH-White cancer survivors, those aged 18-29, females, and with at least one comorbid condition cancer survivors were more likely CONCLUSION: Cancer survivors are adhering to recommended preventive behaviors Cancer survivor's continuity of care may be impacted by COVID-19 specifically young adults, females, and those with existing comorbid conditions IMPACT: Insights into cancer survivors whose care may be most impacted by COVID-19 will be valuable towards surveillance and survivorship of US cancer survivors","output":"Examining COVID-19 Preventive Behaviors among Cancer Survivors in the United States: an analysis of the COVID-19 Impact Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 continues to have a major impact on healthcare and social systems throughout the world. As the clinical and epidemiological features of COVID\\\\19 have many parallels with influenza, it is important to ensure optimal management of both respiratory diseases as we anticipate their continued co\\\\circulation. In particular, there is a need to ensure that effective surveillance and diagnostic capacities are in place to monitor these and other respiratory viruses, as this will underpin decisions on the appropriate clinical management of the respective diseases. As such, we propose a series of key recommendations for stakeholders, public health authorities, primary care physicians and surveillance bodies that will help mitigate the combined risks of concurrent influenza epidemics and the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. We advocate the judicious use of influenza vaccines and antivirals, particularly among groups at high risk of complications, with healthcare workers also considered a priority for vaccination. It is likely that the increased use of emerging technologies such as telemedicine and contact tracing will permanently change our approach to managing infectious disease. The use of these technologies, alongside existing pharmaceutical strategies, will ensure that we achieve a holistic approach to the global public health measures needed to deal with the combined threat of influenza and COVID\\\\19. Ensuring that this approach is optimal will be key as we move from a reactive pandemic response towards preparing for the long\\\\term management of the remarkable clinical burden associated with these respiratory pathogens.","output":"Influenza and COVID\\\\19: What does co\\\\existence mean?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is commonly used, but many physicians have limited knowledge of CAM despite its widespread use. Therefore, this study sought to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of medical students on complementary and alternative medicine in the management of COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 150 medical students from three Federal Universities in South West, Nigeria. A self-administered semi-structured online Google Forms questionnaire was used to collect information. Chi-squared and Fisher's exact test was used to analyze the bivariate relationship between KAP status and sociodemographic characteristics. Spearman's correlation coefficient matrix was computed to determine the association between knowledge, attitude, CAM, age, and religiosity practice. RESULTS: The median age was 22 years (interquartile range: [IQR]: 21-23 years). Median self-rated score for religion was 4.00 (IQR: 3.00-4.25). Median knowledge score was 4.00 (IQR: 3.75-5.00), median attitude score 2.75 (IQR: 2.38-3.00) and median practice score 2.00 (IQR: 1.00-2.00). Thirty-seven respondents (24.7%) were considered to have poor knowledge about CAM use in COVID-19 while the rest (75.3%) had good knowledge. Thirty-eight (25.3%) had a poor attitude towards using CAM in COVID-19 and 112 (74.7%) had a good attitude. CONCLUSION: Medical students have good knowledge and a positive attitude towards CAM modalities as adjunct management for COVID-19. However, their practices do not reflect wide acceptability. There is a need for clinical trials on the efficacy of CAM as an adjunct treatment for COVID-19 to further inform its use.","output":"Knowledge, Attitude and Practice of Nigerian Medical Students towards Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Covid-19 Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The web is the infinite source of information, and its right there for you to tap.

Here we introduce the inter-layer mutual confirmation mechanism into the information-disease interacting dynamics on multiplex networks. In our model, an individual increases the information transmission rate and willingness to adopt protective measures once he confirms the authenticity of news and severity of disease from neighbors status in multiple layers. By using the microscopic Markov chain approach, we analytically calculate the epidemic threshold and the awareness and infected density in the stationary state, which agree well with simulation results. We find that the increment of epidemic threshold when confirming the aware neighbors on communication layer is larger than that of the contact layer. On the contrary, the confirmation of neighbors' awareness and infection from the contact layer leads to a lower final infection density and a higher awareness density than that of the communication layer. The results imply that individuals' explicit exposure of their infection and awareness status to neighbors, especially those with real contacts, is helpful in suppressing epidemic spreading.","output":"Asymmetrically interacting dynamics with mutual confirmation from multi-source on multiplex networks"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(O,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"consultation/30.md","filePath":"consultation/30.md"}'),R={name:"consultation/30.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
