The low incidence of vascular complications in GCK-MODY makes it a natural paradigm for interrogating molecular mechanisms promoting vascular health under prolonged hyperglycemia. Clinical rate of misdiagnosis has remained high, and a reliable serum lipid biomarker that precedes genetic screening can facilitate correct diagnosis and treatment. Herein, we comprehensively quantitated 565 serum lipids from 25 classes in 105 subjects (42 nondiabetic controls, 30 GC K-MODY patients, 33 drug-na?ve, and newly-onset T2D patients). At false-discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, several phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and plasmalogen PCs were specifically increased in GCK-MODY, while triacylglycerols (TAGs) and diacylglycerols (DAGs) were reduced. Correlation matrices between lipids uncovered coregulation between plasmalogen PCs (PCps) and glycerolipid precursors was distinctly enhanced in GCK-MODY compared to T2D. Strengthened positive correlations between serum PCps and circulating HDLs was specifically observed in hyperglycemic subjects (i.e. T2D and GCK-MODY) compared to normglycemic controls, suggesting that HDL-PCps may elicit distinct physiological effects under hyperglycemia. Amongst GCK-MODY patients, individuals harboring variants of GCK mutations with elevated PCps also exhibited higher HDLs. Isolated HDLs displayed localized increases (p < 0.05) in very-long-chain PUFA-PCs and PCps in GCK-MODY. Protein analyses revealed elevated levels of HDL-resident ATGL (P = 0.003) and CEPT1 (P < 0.0001), which mediate critical steps of PCps production along the TAG-DAG-PC axis, in GCK-MODY relative to T2D. A panel of four lipids differentiated GCK-MODY from T2D with AUC of 0.950 (95% CI 0.903C9.997). This study provides the first evidence that enhanced recruitment of CEPT1 and ATGL onto HDLs essentially underlie the atheroprotective profiles associated with GCK-MODY. Resultant increases in the production of HDL-PCps and PUFA-PCs provides an active, circulating form of protection towards the vasculature of GCK-MODY, thereby lowering the incidence of vascular complications despite chronic exposure to hyperglycemia since birth.","output":"Localized increases in CEPT1 and ATGL elevate plasmalogen phosphatidylcholines in HDLs contributing to atheroprotective lipid profiles in hyperglycemic GCK-MODY"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"HER2 transmembrane receptor is an important target in immunotherapy treatment of breast and gastroesophageal cancer.

Thus, we conducted this study to identify potential biomarkers for objectively diagnosing depression and explore the role of gut microbiota in the onset of depression. METHODS: Major depressive disorder (MDD) patients (n=56) and demographic data-matched healthy controls (HCs) (n=56) were included in this study. The gut microbiota in fecal samples and inflammation-related factors in serum were measured. Both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed to identify the differential gut microbiota and inflammation-related factors. RESULTS: Finally, 46 differential operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (60.9% OTUs belonging to Firmicutes) and ten differential inflammation-related factors were identified. Correlation analysis showed that there were significant correlations between 14 differential OTUs (9 OTUs belonging to Firmicutes and 5 OTUs belonging to family Lachnospiraceae under Firmicutes) and seven differential inflammation-related factors. Meanwhile, 14 differential OTUs (9 OTUs belonging to Firmicutes and 5 OTUs belonging to family Lachnospiraceae under Firmicutes) and five differential inflammation-related factors (adiponectin, apolipoprotein A1, alpha 1-antitrypsin, neutrophilicgranulocyte count/white blood cell count and basophil count) were significantly correlated to depression severity.

We compared cardiac and inflammatory parameters of a sub-section of the 2020 cohort who presented with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with the remainder of the cohort. RESULTS: Referrals significantly increased between February and June 2020 compared to 2019 (19.8/30 days versus 3.9/30 days). Frequency of coronary artery aneurysms (11/79 (13.9%) versus 7/47 (14.9%)) or severe coronary artery aneurysms (6/79 (7.6%) versus 3/47 (6.4%)) was similar between 2020 and 2019, respectively.

GRDDSs are also highly effective in enhancing the bioavailability of the drug that exhibits window absorption in specific segments of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Famotidine (FMT), an H2 receptor antagonist, is an example of these drugs. FMT is a slightly water-soluble drug but well soluble in an acidic medium. This research aims to formulate FMT gastro-retentive floating tablets (FMT-GRFTs) to improve the bioavailability and therapeutic activity of the drug and increase patients' adherence to treatment. In addition, the in vitro release behavior of the prepared FMT-GRFTs was quantitatively analyzed using the DDSolver software to assist in selecting the successful formulation that was then evaluated in vivo. METHODS The direct compression technique prepared numerous tablet formulations and was subjected to the pre-and post-compression evaluation. Data of FMT dissolution in the simulated gastric medium was analyzed by various kinetic models built in the DDSolver program. In addition, the simulated pharmacokinetics (AUC, MDT, and MRT), R2 adjusted, AIC, MSC, correlation of the residuals, and similarity factor (f2) were also generated. RESULTS The results revealed that FMT release from the candidate formula (FH3) fitted to the first-order kinetic model, with a high value of R2 adjusted and MSC and a low AIC. The release behavior exhibited the Fickian diffusion mechanism. The similarity factor showed no significant difference (p < 0.05) of the test sample compared to the reference product. Nevertheless, the simulated pharmacokinetic parameter, AUC, proved a two-fold enhancement in FMT bioavailability, with a significant increment in the MDT and MRT compared with the reference product. The FT-IR spectroscopy analysis indicated the absence of drug-excipients/polymer interaction. The in vivo X-ray studies on rabbits confirmed that the floating tablets showed nearly eight hours of gastric residence. CONCLUSION DDSolver software was helpful in deciding the optimized formulation of FMT floating tablets.

INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We used an online questionnaire to examine attitudes and assessed recommendations with 50 clinical scenarios. Overall 80% of scenario recommendations were accepted. Acceptance did not vary by provider characteristics but did vary by ventilator mode (high-frequency oscillatory ventilation 83%, pressure-regulated volume control 82%, pressure control 75%; p = 0.002) and variable adjusted (ranging from 88% for peak inspiratory pressure and 86% for FIO2 changes to 69% for positive end-expiratory pressure changes). Acceptance did not vary based on child size/age. There was a preference for smaller positive end-expiratory pressure changes but no clear granularity preference for other variables. CONCLUSIONS Although overall acceptance rate for scenarios was good, there was little consensus regarding the size/scale of ventilator setting changes for children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome.

The most severe class of PBDs-Zellweger spectrum disorder (ZSD)-is caused by mutations in peroxin genes that result in both non-functional peroxisomes and mitochondrial dysfunction. It is unclear, however, how defective peroxisomes contribute to mitochondrial impairment. In order to understand the molecular basis of this inter-organellar relationship, we investigated the fate of peroxisomal mRNAs and proteins in ZSD model systems. We found that peroxins were still expressed and a subset of them accumulated on the mitochondrial membrane, which resulted in gross mitochondrial abnormalities and impaired mitochondrial metabolic function. We showed that overexpression of ATAD1, a mitochondrial quality control factor, was sufficient to rescue several aspects of mitochondrial function in human ZSD fibroblasts. Together, these data suggest that aberrant peroxisomal protein localization is necessary and sufficient for the devastating mitochondrial morphological and metabolic phenotypes in ZSDs.","output":"The biochemical basis of mitochondrial dysfunction in Zellweger Spectrum Disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of effective vaccines for COVID-19 has been welcomed by the world with great optimism.

This study included 262 people (81 diabetic and 181 non-diabetic persons) that took two doses of BNT162b2 (PfizerCBioNTech) mRNA vaccine. Both T2DM and non-diabetic individuals had a robust response to vaccination as demonstrated by their high antibody titers. However, both SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralizing antibodies titers were lower in people with T2DM. The mean (  1 standard deviation) levels were 154  49.1 vs. 138  59.4 BAU/ml for IgG and 87.1  11.6 vs. 79.7  19.5% for neutralizing antibodies in individuals without diabetes compared to those with T2DM, respectively.

Meanwhile, live vaccination conferred sterile protection against homologous challenge with the P. yoelii 17XL virulent strain for the long-term. Analysis of the immune response induced by live vaccination showed that cross-reactive antibodies against PbA antigens were generated.

METHODS: Masks were placed on a head mannequin connected to a lung simulator, using a collecting filter placed after the mannequin airway. Certified, commercial and custom-made masks were tested at three different distances between the emitter and the mannequin: 40 cm, 80 cm and 120 cm. Two patterns of breathing were used, simulating normal and polypneic respiration. A solution of methylene blue was nebulized with a jet nebulizer and different mask-distance-breathing pattern combinations were tested. The primary endpoint was the inhaled fraction, defined as the amount of methylene blue detected with spectrophotometry expressed as percent of the amount detected in a reference condition of zero distance and no mask. FINDINGS: We observed a significant effect of distance (p < 0.001), pattern of breathing (p = 0.040) and type of mask (p < 0.001) on inhaled fraction. All masks resulted in lower inhaled fraction compared to breathing without mask (p < 0.001 in all comparisons), ranging from 41.1%  0.3% obtained with a cotton mask at 40 cm distance with polypneic pattern to <1% for certified FFP3 and the combination of FFP2 + surgical mask at all distances and both breathing pattern conditions. DISCUSSION: Distance, type of device and breathing pattern resulted in highly variable inhaled fraction.

While neural networks can be trained to detect COVID-19, doing so requires large amounts of labeled data, which are expensive to collect and code. One approach is to use semi-supervised neural networks to detect COVID-19 based on a very small number of labeled images. This paper explores how well such an approach could work.

Patients with de novo and metachronous high-volume disease have a robust survival benefit with the addition of docetaxel to hormonal therapies. Patients with synchronous low-volume disease have a more modest survival benefit from docetaxel and there is no evidence of survival benefit with docetaxel in patients with metachronous low-volume disease. Integration of biomarkers may refine treatment selection regardless of volume of disease. Docetaxel and cabazitaxel also impart an OS benefit in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The choice of chemotherapy in mCRPC depends on treatment received in mHSPC setting. Docetaxel remains the first line chemotherapy in castration-resistant patients who have not received it in mHSPC followed by cabazitaxel, otherwise cabazitaxel can be deployed without docetaxel retreatment.

Since the importation of SARS-CoV-2 in South Africa, with the first reported COVID-19 case on the 5th of March 2020, South Africa has observed 3 consecutive COVID-19 epidemic waves. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has played a significant role in the resurgence of COVID-19 epidemic waves in South Africa and across the globe. South Africa has a unique observation of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, with distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages dominating certain epidemic periods. This unique observation allows for an investigation of the detected SARS-CoV-2 lineages' impact on COVID-19 transmissibility and severity through analysis of epidemiological data. In this study, inferential statistical analysis was conducted on South African COVID-19 epidemiological data to investigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the South African COVID-19 epidemiology. The general methodology in this study involved the collation of South African COVID-19 epidemiological data, the regression and normalisation of the epidemiological data, and inferential statistical analysis. This study shows that the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in an increase in COVID-19 transmissibility and severity in South Africa. The Delta SARS-CoV-2 VOC resulted in increased COVID-19 transmissibility in the South African population by 53.9 to 54.8 % more than the Beta SARS-CoV-2 VOC and the predominantly B.1.1.54, B.1.1.56 C.1 SA SARS-CoV-2 lineage cluster. The Beta SARS-CoV-2 VOC resulted in more severe COVID-19 in South Africa than the Delta SARS-CoV-2 VOC. While, both the Beta and Delta SARS-CoV-2 VOC resulted in more severe COVID-19 than the initial SARS-CoV-2 lineages detected in the South African first epidemic wave period. The Delta, Beta SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, and the predominantly B.1.1.54, B.1.1.56 C.1 SA SARS-CoV-2 lineage cluster were observed to cause similar COVID-19 hospital case fatality and discharge rates in South African hospitals.","output":"The Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Lineages (Variants) on the COVID-19 Epidemic in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article introduces and discusses a corpus-assisted study that sets out to identify and analyse how self-mention is employed in science communication associated with COVID-19 research disseminated to the general public by leading universities in the United Kingdom (the UK) and the United States of America (the USA).

We sought to explore the physical, mental, and social health impacts of the pandemic on older adults and their coping techniques. Materials and Methods: We conducted 25 semi-structured interviews with a sub-sample of participants in an ongoing sedentary behavior reduction intervention. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, and iterative coding was used to extract key themes. Results: Most participants reported an increase in sedentary behavior due to limitations on leaving their home and increased free time to pursue seated hobbies (e.g., reading, knitting, tv). However, many participants also reported increased levels of intentional physical activity and exercise, particularly outdoors or online. Participants also reported high levels of stress and a large decrease in in-person social connection. Virtual connection with others through phone and video was commonly used to stay connected with friends and family, engage in community groups and activities, and cope with stress and social isolation. Maintenance of a positive attitude and perspective gained from past hardships was also an important coping strategy for many participants.

Understanding the mechanisms of substance use behaviours, including those used to cope with COVID-19-related stressors, is imperative to curate targeted prevention efforts. To that end, we examined substance use prevalence and its associations with socio-demographic characteristics, preventive behaviours, and mental health amongst US social work students. We collected data from 457 students across all degree levels (BSW, MSW and PhD) from July to August 2020 through an online survey, to examine thirty-day patterns of substance use behaviours related to cigarettes, electronic vapour products, alcohol, binge drinking and marijuana. Univariate and bivariate analyses revealed high rates of substance use behaviours, particularly alcohol use (71 per cent), binge drinking (35 per cent) and marijuana use (25 per cent). Findings also revealed significant associations amongst substance use, socio-demographic characteristics, and mental health. Amongst other implications, our study should encourage social work programmes to promote positive coping strategies amongst students and foster substance abuse prevention efforts, both to mitigate health risk behaviours and to enhance student well-being, both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The Perfect Storm?

Which is more relevant for their potent protective effects is unclear, but isolated T-cell responses without seroconversion in healthy household members of COVID-patients suggest that T-cell responses effectively protect against clinical infection. Oncological patients have an outsize risk of unfavorable outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore were prioritized when vaccines first became available, although the quality of their immune response to vaccination was expected to be sub-optimal, as subsequent studies have confirmed. Inherently, patients with anti-CD19 CAR-T-mediated B-cell aplasia would be incapable of generating humoral responses, so that assessment of the vaccine-induced cellular immunity was all the more important to gauge whether the vaccine can induce meaningful protection. A salient difference between T-cell and humoral responses is the former's relative impassiveness to mutations of the antigen, as is more relevant than ever since the advent of the omicron variant. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess in a cohort of juvenile CD19 CAR-T patients with enduring B-cell aplasia, the immune cell composition and spike protein-specific T-cell responses before and after the first and second doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. Study design: The prospective study included all patients aged >12 years diagnosed with multiply relapsed B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and treated with anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T19) therapy in our center. The primary endpoint was the detection of cell-mediated and humoral response to vaccine (flow cytometry and anti-S immunoglobulin G, respectively). Secondary endpoints included the incidence of vaccine-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events, GvHD exacerbation, relapse and the influence of the vaccine on CAR-T cells and lymphocyte subset. Results: Even though half of the patients exhibited sub-normal lymphocyte counts and marginal CD4/CD8 ratios, after two vaccinations all showed brisk T-cell responsiveness to spike protein, predominantly in the CD4 compartment, which was quantitatively well within the range of healthy controls. No severe vaccine-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events, GvHD exacerbation or relapse was observed in our cohort. Conclusion: We posit that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induce meaningful cellular immunity in patients with isolated B-cell deficiency due to anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy.","output":"Immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in young patients with anti-CD19 CAR-T-induced B-cell aplasia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For Japan in 2021, COVID-19-related disruption was again the dominant storyline.

Only few of those in need for treatment seek professional help. Therefore, easily accessible interventions are required. While several evidence-based internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) have been proposed, little is known about medical students' attitudes towards using them. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the views of medical students on IMIs as well as facilitators and barriers to use them and gain first insights into their preferences for tailored IMIs. METHODS: We conducted four focus groups with 26 medical students enrolled at a German medical school in March 2020. Focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed following established approaches for qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Medical students valued IMIs for their low-threshold and flexible access, their potential to bridge waiting times and as a first step towards face-to-face-therapy. However, medical students preferred face-to-face interventions in case of severe mental health problems. The main disadvantages named by students included difficulties to find or decide on suitable IMIs based on clear quality criteria, fear of a misdiagnosis and lack of personalisation and human interaction. Some students also questioned the effectiveness of IMIs. Easy handling, flexible use, data safety and easily understandable terms of use were believed to facilitate the uptake of IMIs, whereas technical problems, frequent notifications, required internet access, need to register, lack of anonymity, high time expenditure and costs were reported to hinder their use. Most students did not prefer IMIs tailored to medical students but rather wanted to use IMIs suitable for students of all disciplines. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest overall positive views regarding IMIs for mental health promotion but concerns regarding their use for severe mental disorders and acute crises.

Utilizing comprehensive healthcare data on more than 45 percent of the German population from January 2019 through December 2020, we investigated post COVID-19 in children/adolescents and adults. Methods: From a total of 38 million individuals, we identified all patients with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 through June 30, 2020. A control cohort was assigned using 1:5 exact matching on age, sex, and propensity score matching on prevalent medical conditions. COVID-19 and control cohorts were followed for incident morbidity outcomes documented at least three months after the date of COVID-19 diagnosis, which was used as the index date for both groups. Overall, 96 pre-defined outcomes were aggregated into 13 diagnosis/symptom complexes and three domains (physical health, mental health, physical/mental overlap domain). We used Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95%-confidence intervals (95%-CI). Results: The study population included 157,134 individuals (11,950 children/adolescents and 145,184 adults) with confirmed COVID-19. COVID-19 and control cohort were well-balanced regarding covariates. For all health outcomes combined, incidence rates (IRs) in the COVID-19 cohort were significantly higher than those in the control cohort in both children/adolescents (IRR=1.30, 95%-CI=[1.25-1.35], IR COVID-19=436.91, IR Control=335.98) and adults (IRR=1.33, 95%-CI=[1.31-1.34], IR COVID-19=615.82, IR Control=464.15). The relative magnitude of increased documented morbidity was similar for the physical, mental, and physical/mental overlap domain. In the COVID-19 cohort, incidence rates were significantly higher in all 13 diagnosis/symptom complexes in adults and in ten diagnosis/symptom complexes in children/adolescents. IRR estimates were similar for the age groups 0-11 and 12-17. Incidence rates in children/adolescents were consistently lower than those in adults. Among the specific outcomes with the highest IRR and an incidence rate of at least 1/100 person-years in the COVID-19 cohort in children and adolescents were malaise/fatigue/exhaustion (IRR=2.28, 95%-CI=[1.71-3.06], IR COVID-19=12.58, IR Control=5.51), cough (IRR=1.74, 95%-CI=[1.48-2.04], IR COVID-19=36.56, IR Control=21.06), and throat/chest pain (IRR=1.72, 95%-CI=[1.39-2.12], IR COVID-19=20.01, IR Control=11.66). In adults, these included dysgeusia (IRR=6.69, 95%-CI=[5.88-7.60], IR COVID-19=12.42, IR Control=1.86), fever (IRR=3.33, 95%-CI=[3.01-3.68], IR COVID-19=11.53, IR Control=3.46), and dyspnea (IRR=2.88, 95%-CI=[2.74-3.02], IR COVID-19=43.91, IR Control=15.27).

Forty-five late-gestation Holstein-Friesian cows (second pregnancy) were allocated randomly to 1 of 3 groups with 15 cows/group: group C6 (6 daily i.v. injections of butaphosphan at 10 mg/kg of body weight (BW) and cyanocobalamin at 5 g/kg of BW in the last 2 wk of gestation); group C3 (3 daily i.v. injections of butaphosphan at 10 mg/kg of BW and cyanocobalamin at 5 g/kg of BW in the last week of gestation); and group C0 (equivolume daily i.v. injections of 0.9% NaCl solution). Serum biochemical analysis was performed on jugular venous blood samples that were periodically obtained a.p. and postpartum (p.p.). Health status and milk production were monitored p.p. Serum cyanocobalamin concentration increased in groups C6 and C3 p.p. Multiple daily i.v. injections of Catosal before parturition increased p.p. glucose availability, as evaluated by p.p. serum glucose concentration, and decreased peripheral fat mobilization and ketone body formation, as evaluated by p.p. serum nonesterified fatty acid and -OH butyrate concentrations.

In this sense, we carried out a national epidemiological surveillance program in Brazil from April to October 2021. Genotyping by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and sequencing were performed to monitor the dynamics and dissemination of VOCs in samples from 15 federative units. Delta VOC was first detected on June 2021 and took sixteen weeks to replace Gamma. To assess the transmissibility potential of Gamma and Delta VOCs, we studied the dynamics of RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) score in the dominance period of each variant. The data suggest that Delta VOC has a higher transmission rate than Gamma VOC. We also compared relevant symptom patterns in individuals infected with both VOCs. The Delta-infected subjects were less likely to have low oxygen saturation or fatigue, altered results on chest computed tomography, and a propensity for altered X-rays.

Building on our previous genetic initiative implementationresearch findings from key stakeholders in primary care, severalcritical areas were identified for improvement: an enhanced clinicianeducation and feedback mechanism and a more robust integration ofgenetics in the electronic health record (EHR). To address these areas,we implemented three key enhancements: the Genomic Ambassadorprogram, Genomic Indicator, and Care Pathway.Population Genetic Testing Program Evolution: After the conclusionof our pilot population genetic testing program, DNA-10 K, theprimary care genetics program shifted to merging our two previousprimary care projects, the Genetic Wellness Assessment (GWA) andDNA-10 K. The GWA is a targeted family history tool. Patients seen fortheir annual physical exam at one of 14 primary care sites (InternalMedicine, Family Medicine, OB/GYN) qualified for this program. Thesepatients complete the GWA and are then offered a 74 gene nextgenerationsequencing panel assessing pharmacogenetics, hereditarycancer, and cardiovascular risk, as well as a low-pass whole genomeassay to assess fun facts and traits (e.g., ancestry, cilantropreference). The test is the same panel used in DNA-10 K and had anout-of-pocket cost of $175. The merged program started on January 20,2020. COVID-19 offered an opportunity to challenge our implementationand determine if we have been able to sustainably embedgenetics in primary care in the face of newchallenges encountered byour primary care physicians.Enhancements: The Genomic Ambassador program is an educationand feedback forum consisting of 8 volunteer primary care clinicians.This group met once a month, and the clinicians received a stipend fortheir efforts. The meetings had alternating focuses between geneticseducation and program feedback. The genetic education sessionsincluded basic scientific information, clinical cases, and practicalinformation about clinical decision support tools in our EHR. Thefeedback sessions were used to hear directly from the clinicians whatwas working and was not working, and solicit solutions for theproblems identified. These sessions were especially helpful in understandingthe additional pressure on the practices due to COVID-19.After the ambassadors completed eight months of the program, theywere trained to become peer-to-peer educators in their practices. Genomic Indicators and Care Pathways are tools available in the EPICEHR. Genomic indicators are structured as discrete groupings such asBRCA1 pathogenic variant. They are automatically assigned to apatient when their genetic results have resulted in the EHR. TheGenomics indicators have been linked to a short summary andexternal links to provide clinicians with real-time genetic educationalopportunities. Additionally, genomic indicators are used to assign acare pathway to patients. Care pathways are a structured tool that laysout the recommended path a patient takes for screening after apathogenic, or likely pathogenic, variant has been identified. To date,we have only developed a care pathway for breast cancer screening. Itis currently being used to track how well patients adhere torecommendations and identify areas of improvement. Preliminarywork has begun on a care pathway for familial hypercholesterolemia.These enhancements are awork-in-progress and will need continuousevaluation and improvement to increase our patient populationsunderstanding, access, and use of genomic testing and follow-upservices.Conclusion: As a course of regular business, we reviewed ourutilization metrics for 2020, there were 130,364 patients whoqualified for the merged program from 1/20/2020 to 12/31/2020.Weekly completion rates for the GWA component ranged from 39.9%to 54.5%, with a mean of 46.8%, similar to previous versions of GWA.The weekly totals for patients completing testing ranged from 11 to113, with a mean of 50. At the end of 2020, through this program andt e DNA-10 K program, 12,350 patients had completed testing withtheir results integrated into the EHR. We believe this data highlightsthe progress made in making genetics a routine part of our healthsystems primary care.The Genomic Ambassador program, Genomic Indicator, and CarePathwaywere critical enhancements to the current program and likelycontributed to its ability to continue through COVID-19. Theseadditions provided an education mechanism, a feedback forum, andmade our EHR integration more robust.

The aim of this study was to evaluate how imaging volumes and imaging types in radiology departments have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic across different locations. Methods: Imaging volumes in the Aseer region (in the south of Saudi Arabia) across main hospitals were reviewed retrospectively including all cases referred from different locations (outpatient, inpatient and emergency departments). Data for years 2019 and 2020 were compared. The mean monthly cases were compared using a t-test. Results: The total imaging volumes in 2019 were 205,805 compared to 159,107 in 2020 with a 22.7% overall reduction. A substantial decline was observed in both the April to June and the July to September periods of approximately 42.9% and 44.4%, respectively. With respect to location, between April and June, the greatest decline was observed in outpatient departments (76% decline), followed by emergency departments (25% decline), and the least impact was observed in inpatient departments, with only 6.8% decline over the same period.

Loss of cerebral autoregulation may render patients with AIS vulnerable to decreases in mean arterial pressure (MAP). OBJECTIVE To determine whether a fall in MAP during intervention under general anesthesia (GA) affects functional outcome. METHODS This subgroup analysis included patients from the MR CLEAN trial treated with thrombectomy under GA. The investigated variables were the difference between MAP at baseline and average MAP during GA (MAP) as well as the difference between baseline MAP and the lowest MAP during GA (LMAP). Their association with a shift towards better outcome on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) after 90 days was determined using ordinal logistic regression with adjustment for prognostic baseline variables. RESULTS Sixty of the 85 patients treated under GA in MR CLEAN had sufficient anesthetic information available for the analysis. A greater MAP was associated with worse outcome (adjusted common OR (acOR) 0.95 per point mm Hg, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.99). An average MAP during GA 10 mm Hg lower than baseline MAP constituted a 1.67 times lower odds of a shift towards good outcome on the mRS. For LMAP this association was not significant (acOR 0.97 per mm Hg, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.00, p=0.09).

MAJOR OUTCOMES: Clinical course and laboratory features of the first reported case of COVID\\\\19 (the illness caused by SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) in Australia; isolation, whole genome sequencing, imaging, and rapid sharing of virus from the patient. RESULTS: A nasopharyngeal swab and sputum collected when the patient presented to hospital were each positive for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). Inoculation of Vero/hSLAM cells with material from the nasopharyngeal swab led to the isolation of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 virus in culture. Electron microscopy of the supernatant confirmed the presence of virus particles with morphology characteristic of viruses of the family Coronaviridae. Whole genome sequencing of the viral isolate and phylogenetic analysis indicated the isolate exhibited greater than 99.99% sequence identity with other publicly available SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 genomes. Within 24 hours of isolation, the first Australian SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 isolate was shared with local and overseas reference laboratories and major North American and European culture collections. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to rapidly identify, propagate, and internationally share our SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 isolate is an important step in collaborative scientific efforts to deal effectively with this international public health emergency by developing better diagnostic procedures, vaccine candidates, and antiviral agents.","output":"Isolation and rapid sharing of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) from the first patient diagnosed with COVID\\\\19 in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conferences are a mainstay of most scientific disciplines, where scientists of all career stages come together to share cutting-edge ideas and approaches.

This study addresses the cytological features of the infection and highlights the more influential inflammatory components. The correlation between pathological variables and clinical data is also analyzed. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of the cytopathological features of BAL in 20 COVID-19 patients and 20 members of a matched cohort from a critical ICU who had acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by other pulmonary conditions. RESULTS: A comparison of the controls (n = 20) and the COVID-19 patients (n = 20) revealed that the latter had a higher neutrophil count (median, 63.8% of the cell count) with lower percentages of macrophages and lymphocytes. An increase in the expression of CD68-positive, monocytic multinucleated giant cells (MGCs) was reported; megakaryocytes were not detected on CD61 staining. Perls staining showed isolated elements. In situ RNA analysis demonstrated scattered chromogenic signals in type II pneumocytes. An ultrastructural analysis confirmed the presence of intracytoplasmic vacuoles containing rounded structures measuring 140 nm in diameter (putative viral particles). In COVID-19 patients, the clinicopathological correlation revealed a positive correlation between lactate dehydrogenase values and MGCs (r = 0.54). CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of BAL samples might be implemented as a routine practice for the evaluation of COVID-19 patients in ICUs in the appropriate clinical scenario.

Although the consumption of these plastics protects our life during this crisis, it is pivotal to move toward plastic recycling processes and environmentally friendly and sustainable alternatives, like bio-based degradable plastics with a circular economy perspective. This review article collected scattered information and provided a future perspective on how worldwide COVID-19 disruption can perform as a catalyst to improve plastic and medical waste management. Additionally, this paper illustrates the most effective disinfection technologies for COVID-19 wastes, such as high/low heat technologies and chemical disinfection, and PPE reusing processes, including dry heat, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, ozone, and UV light during the outbreak. In this vein, medical waste treatment facilities must be more automatic, with a minimum of personnel involved. Moreover, some recent valid guidelines from different international organizations and countries, future outlook, and practical recommendations that could be effective during this epidemic or even in the post-pandemic world for plastic and medical waste management were provided. Ultimately, governments should improve their waste management because of the potential of pathogen transmission or increased plastic and medical waste generation and try to enhance the environmental knowledge of society.

Neurologists must weigh up the need to start or continue disease-modifying treatments against the risk of infection, the risk of complications from the infection, and the risk of multiple sclerosis activity. Since this is an unprecedented situation, most decisions are being made on the basis of a theoretical approach and the criteria of each neurologist. AIMS The aim of this study is conduct a literature search to collect available evidence on the relationship between disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis and SARS-CoV-2 infection. This evidence, together with the experience of the authors in the management of patients with multiple sclerosis during the pandemic, will make it possible to offer some proposals for the treatment and follow-up of patients in this epidemiological context. DEVELOPMENT After the literature search and our experience in the management of patients, a number of proposals for treatment are established for each drug, which must necessarily be individualised for each patient, since, in these exceptional circumstances, their peculiarities can affect the prognosis. CONCLUSIONS The neurologist should be aware of current evidence to assess the risk-benefit of starting, maintaining and stopping disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis during the pandemic.","output":"[EMCAM (Multiple Sclerosis Autonomous Community of Madrid) document for the management of patients with multiple sclerosis during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The term globalization doesnt refer to a current epoch of world history, but to an undulated process interrupted by harsh setbacks. Its phases of upswing are characterized by exponential growth. They end when tipping points arrive. For globalization inevitably has its winners and losers, these phases are paralleled by processes of fragmentation in other countries, macro-regions and societies. The article provides a sketch of both types of processes, illustrated by examples from world history. It thereby shows that they must not be considered mere byproducts of technological development in transport and communication, but also depend on institutions that guarantee International Public Goods (IPGs), above all safety, stability and connectivity. Only great powers can provide this type of goods, for only they have the resources to do so, then again for only they are confronted with a volunteers dilemma. Moreover globalization depends on a grand narrative that marginalizes competing schools of thought. Crises emerge either when transactions driving the process reach a tipping point, or when great powers decline and are no longer ready or able to provide IPGs. Now critical discourses emerge and become hegemonic in the face of successive crises undermining the grand narrative. This results in social division between cosmopolitans and populists. Both big players currently face different dilemmas conditioned by their positions as hegemonic power (USA) and freerider (China), in each case causing them to act neo-isolationist. The result: IPGs are no longer guaranteed, globalization is in crisis.

A diagnosis of infertility has a negative impact on the individual's well-being and it can increase the risk of anxious-depressive symptoms, stress, and low self-esteem. Data associated with infertility-related Quality of Life (QoL) are lacking in men. Little is known about mens experience of infertility and its treatments during the pandemic. Among the variables potentially associated with infertility-related QoL, the role of obsessive beliefs is neglected, although preliminary studies considered perfectionistic traits. METHOD: One hundred and fifty-one participants were included. Eighty men (mean age: 40.83 years) were attending a MAR pathway. Of these, 50 men (67.5%) were undergoing homologous MAR and 30 men (37.5%) were undergoing heterologous MAR. A control group consisting of 71 subjects (mean age: 36.69 years), paired by age, marital status, and number of children, was drawn from the general population. The Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire-46, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-20, and the Fertility Quality of Life Questionnaire were administered. RESULTS: High levels of anxiety, depression and stress were moderately associated with lower infertility-related Quality of Life. For men undergoing homologous MAR, perfectionism beliefs represented a vulnerability factor for a lower fertility-related QoL, while for men undergoing heterologous MAR, high thought control beliefs represented a risk factor for a lower fertility-related QoL. CONCLUSIONS: A focus on the obsessive beliefs should be included in the psychological treatment of infertile men, specifically perfectionism in homologous MAR and control of thoughts in heterologous MAR. Therefore, psychological assessment and support interventions should be personalized according to the MAR pathway and be focused on mens cognitive features in order to improve their QoL during the MAR pathway.","output":"Fertility-Related Quality of Life in Men Undergoing Medically Assisted Reproduction During the Pandemic: Perfectionism and Thought Control Beliefs Moderate the Effects of the Type of Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of the study was to examine the quality of life and illness acceptance among ESRD patients with the moderating effects of death anxiety.

Consistent with prior research, we found that people's creativity, on aggregate, remained constant or improved across an ideation session. However, people's beliefs did not match this reality. We consistently found that people expected their creativity to decline over time. We refer to this misprediction as the creative cliff illusion. Study 1 found initial evidence of this effect across an ideation task. We found further evidence in a sample with high domain-relevant knowledge (study 2), when creativity judgments were elicited retrospectively (study 3), and across a multiday study (study 5). We theorized the effect occurs because people mistakenly associate creativity (the novelty and usefulness of an idea) with idea production (the ability to generate an idea). Study 4 found evidence consistent with this mechanism. The creative cliff illusion was attenuated among those with high levels of everyday creative experience (study 6) and after a knowledge intervention that increased awareness of the effect (study 7). Demonstrating the impact of creativity beliefs on downstream performance, study 8 found that declining creativity beliefs negatively influenced task persistence and creative performance, suggesting that people underinvest in ideation.

OBJECTIVE: Evaluate changes in health screening rates before and during the pandemic. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of health maintenance and disease management screening rates among primary care patients before and during the pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: Over 150,000 patients of a large, academic health system. MAIN MEASURES: Six quality measures were analyzed: colon cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, diabetes Hgb A1C, diabetes eye, and diabetes nephropathy monitoring. Based on US Preventative Services Task Force screening guidelines, we determined which patients were due for at least one of the quality measures. We tracked completion rates during three time periods: pre-pandemic (January 1CMarch 3, 2020), stay-at-home (March 4CMay 8, 2020), and phased reopening (May 9CJuly 8, 2020). Differences in quality measure completion rates were evaluated using mixed-effects logistic regression models. KEY RESULTS: Compared to pre-pandemic rates, completion of all health screenings declined during the stay-at-home period: mammograms (OR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.31C0.37), cervical cancer (OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.76C0.91), colorectal cancer (OR: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.23C0.28), diabetes eye (OR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.29C0.41), diabetes Hgb A1c (OR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.37C0.46), and diabetes nephropathy (OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.41C0.53). During phased reopening, completion of all quality measures increased compared to the stay-at-home period, except for cervical cancer screening (OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.76C0.92). There was a persistent reduction in completion of all quality measures, except for diabetic nephropathy monitoring (OR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.89C1.09), during phased reopening compared to pre-pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare screening rates were reduced during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic and did not fully recover to pre-pandemic rates by July 2020.

METHODS Patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) undergoing intravenous thrombolysis and/or mechanical thrombectomy were selected from our single-center prospective registry. The time to perform reperfusion therapy were compared between patients admitted from March 2019 to February 2020 (pre-COVID-19 group) and those from March 2020 to February 2021 (with-COVID-19 group). Patients in the with-COVID-19 group were further divided into three 4-month-long subgroups (first-phase: March to June 2020; second-phase: July to October 2020; third-phase: November 2020 to February 2021), and the time delay of reperfusion therapy were compared between these subgroups. RESULTS Of 1,260 patients with AIS hospitalized in the study period, 265 patients were examined. Compared with the pre-COVID-19 group (133 patients; median age, 79 years), the with-COVID-19 group (132 patients; median age, 79 years) had a longer median door-to-imaging time (25 min vs. 27 min, P=0.04), and a longer door-to-groin puncture time (65 min vs. 72 min, P=0.02).

How does one understand the practices and outputs of science in such a dynamic, ever-changing world - and particularly in an emergency situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic, where scientific knowledge has been regarded as bedrock for decisive social interventions? We argue that key to answering this question is to consider the role of the activity of reification within the research process. Reification consists in the identification of more or less stable features of the flux, and treating these as constituting stable things. As we illustrate with reference to biological and biomedical research on COVID-19, reification is a necessary component of any process of inquiry and comes in at least two forms: (1) means reification (phenomena-to-object), when researchers create objects meant to capture features of the world, or phenomena, in order to be able to study them; and (2) target reification (object-to-phenomena), when researchers infer an understanding of phenomena from an investigation of the epistemic objects created to study them. We note that both objects and phenomena are dynamic processes and argue that have no reason to assume that changes in objects and phenomena track one another.

METHODS: A total of 46 patients with COVID-19 (10 severe, 36 nonsevere) were examined. To build the prediction model, a set of 27 severe and 151 nonsevere clinical laboratory records and computerized tomography (CT) records were collected from these patients.

METHODS: This cross-sectional, survey-based study collected demographic and exposure data from physical therapists from April to May 2020. All physical therapists working in an inpatient and outpatient care in Italy were eligible. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed among all eligible physical therapists to collect (1) demographic characteristics, (2-3) personal- and work-related exposures, and (4) signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Factors associated with a COVID-19 positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) were explored through logistic regression models and multivariate methods. RESULTS: A total of 15,566 respondents completed the survey, with a response rate of 43.3%, achieving high statistical precision (99% CI, 1% type I error). Among physical therapists who received NPS testing, 13.1% (95% CI = 12.1-14.1%) had a positive result, with a peak reached in March 2020 (36%). The top five symptoms were fatigue and tiredness (69.1%), loss of smell (64.5%), aches and pains (60.8%), loss of taste (58.3%), and headache (51.1%). No symptoms were reported by 8.9%.

Interestingly, when the m1 domain of the homologous M protein from mouse hepatitis virus is inserted into the G protein reporter, the chimeric protein is not efficiently retained in the Golgi complex, but transported to the cell surface. Although it possesses three of the four residues we identified as important in the avian m1 sequence, other residues in the membrane-spanning domain from the mouse protein must prevent efficient recognition of the polar face within the lipid bilayer of the cis Golgi.","output":"Retention of a cis Golgi protein requires polar residues on one face of a predicted alpha-helix in the transmembrane domain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current societal and technological changes have added to the ethical issues faced by people with cerebral palsy.

Incorporating virtual reality into lesson plans allows education to focus not only on learning knowledge but also on knowledge and skills integration. In simulation education, learning environments are designed to approximate actual clinical situations, allowing students to practice skills in virtual clinical situations continuously. In addition, clinical lecturers may observe the students' practice process and provide feedback. Furthermore, through experiencing and practicing clinical procedures, students gain critical clinical judgment, skills, and teamwork operation competences, which may be applied in the real world. In Taiwan, the majority of nurse practitioner training is implemented in hospitals, and clinical training is done using hands-on and face-to-face teaching strategies within a mentorship framework. Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this hospital-based training model has been significantly challenged. However, this represents an opportunity to migrate the nurse practitioner training model toward technology-based simulation education. Developing more virtual-reality-based lesson plans centered on clinical situations may help students complete training that is normally conducted in hospital teaching environments. Through repetitive practice in virtual reality settings, students may obtain comprehensive knowledge and clinical skills that will help relieve the subsequent stress of clinical practicum work and promote care quality and patient safety.","output":"[Virtual Reality Skills Training Trends in Nurse Practitioner Education]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Following a 30-year development process, RTS,S/AS01(E) (GSK, Belgium) is the first malaria vaccine to reach Phase IV assessments. The World Health Organization-commissioned Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP) is coordinating the delivery of RTS,S/AS01(E) through routine national immunization programmes in areas of 3 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The first doses were given in the participating MVIP areas in Malawi on 23 April, Ghana on 30 April, and Kenya on 13 September 2019. The countries participating in the MVIP have little or no baseline incidence data on rare diseases, some of which may be associated with immunization, a deficit that could compromise the interpretation of possible adverse events reported following the introduction of a new vaccine in the paediatric population. Further, effects of vaccination on malaria transmission, existing malaria control strategies, and possible vaccine-mediated selective pressure on Plasmodium falciparum variants, could also impact long-term malaria control. To address this data gap and as part of its post-approval commitments, GSK has developed a post-approval plan comprising of 4 complementary Phase IV studies that will evaluate safety, effectiveness and impact of RTS,S/AS01(E) through active participant follow-up in the context of its real-life implementation. METHODS: EPI-MAL-002 (NCT02374450) is a pre-implementation safety surveillance study that is establishing the background incidence rates of protocol-defined adverse events of special interest. EPI-MAL-003 (NCT03855995) is an identically designed post-implementation safety and vaccine impact study. EPI-MAL-005 (NCT02251704) is a cross-sectional pre- and post-implementation study to measure malaria transmission intensity and monitor the use of other malaria control interventions in the study areas, and EPI-MAL-010 (EUPAS42948) will evaluate the P. falciparum genetic diversity in the periods before and after vaccine implementation. CONCLUSION: GSKs post-approval plan has been designed to address important knowledge gaps in RTS,S/AS01(E) vaccine safety, effectiveness and impact. The studies are currently being conducted in the MVIP areas. Their implementation has provided opportunities and posed challenges linked to conducting large studies in regions where healthcare infrastructure is limited. The results from these studies will support ongoing evaluation of RTS,S/AS01(E)s benefit-risk and inform decision-making for its potential wider implementation across sub-Saharan Africa.

Therefore, this study attempts to review the Bangladeshi COVID-19-related suicide studies for the first time. Methods: For conducting a systematic review, the PRISMA guideline was adhered. Bangladeshi literatures concerning the COVID-19 pandemic related to either suicide case or suicidal behavior were identified within 1 to 10 April 2021, from the databases like PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, etc. Finally, a total of 9 literatures were included in this review. Results: Four literatures were cross-sectional studies assessing the prevalence and risk factors of suicidal behavior, and the rest five were retrospective suicide studies concerned with either case study (n=3) or case-series study (n=2). The prevalence of suicidal ideation was identified to be ranging between 5% and 19.0%, whereas the rate increased over time of the pandemic inception. Significant risk factors concerning suicidal behavior included the factors related to (i) socio-demographic variables: female gender, being divorced or widows or widowers or single in marital status, having lower levels of education, being urban residence, belonging to higher socioeconomic class, being unemployed, and having no children, (ii) behavior and health-related variables: lack of physical exercise, cigarette smoking, alcohol consuming, abnormal sleep status, more exposure to social media, and suffering from the higher number of physical health problems;(iii) COVID-19 pandemic-related variables: lower knowledge of COVID-19, lack of preventive COVID-19 behaviors, higher levels of COVID-19 fear, living in highly COVID-19 infected area, higher economic loss due to the pandemic, and experiencing relatives or acquaintances' death by the COVID-19;(iv) psychopathological variables: depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, suicidal thought history, suicide attempt history, and family with a history of suicide.

Mexico, a LMIC, is a country with a high COVID-19 mortality in which there has been a very limited governmental response to help mitigate such COVID-related disruptions. This study analyzes the association of the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis in Mexico with four wellbeing indicators: income, employment, anxiety, and food security. Methods: : It uses pooled cross-sectional data (n=5,453) of five monthly nationally representative surveys collected between April and August 2020. Probit models are estimated to assess the association of the pandemic with job loss and anxiety;a multinomial logistic regression is estimated for food security, and an ordinary least squares regression assesses the association between the pandemic and changes in households income. Results: : Females were significantly associated with worse outcomes for the 4 wellbeing measures with an average reduction of 2.3% in household income compared to pre-COVID-19 levels, an increased probability (6.4 pp) if being in a household that had lost jobs, decreased probability of food security (6.9 pp), and an increased risk of anxiety symptoms (8.5 pp). In addition, those with lower SES and household with children also reported worse outcomes for employment, income and food security. The month variable was also statistically significant in these models suggesting that as more months of the pandemic elapsed the effects persisted.

OBJECTIVES/GOALS: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed longstanding anti-Asian racism in the US. Yet, effects of discrimination on Asian American health are unknown, partly because diverse Asian American populations are analyzed in aggregate. We aim to understand how perceived discrimination affects healthcare utilization among different Asian American subgroups. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We examine the association of perceived discrimination with healthcare utilization using the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS). In the CHIS, respondents reported whether they wouldve gotten better medical care if they belonged to a different race. We examine the association between these responses and physician visits within the past year, in the survey years 2003, 2004 and 2016-2017. We adjust for covariates based on the Andersen Health Behavior model. Subsequent modeling examines potential mediating and moderating factors such as limited English proficiency, immigration status, income, and survey year. Asian American subgroups analyzed include Asian Indian, Korean, Chinese, Filipino, Vietnamese, Japanese, and other Asian. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Results will highlight how perceived discrimination incentivizes or disincentivizes certain Asian subgroups to utilize healthcare. Asian American subgroups have differing and diverse experiences with discrimination due to their historical and cultural differences; results will elucidate how discrimination affects these subgroups. Results will be compared to non-Hispanic Whites, who represent the racial group least likely to experience discrimination in the US. Mediation and moderation analysis will help understand how traditionally cited factors for healthcare utilization interact with perceived discrimination on Asian Americans.

Forty patients (60 years old) who underwent hip surgery were randomly assigned to multicomponent home-based rehabilitation (MHR) and home exercise groups. The MHR program included strength, endurance, balance, and breathing exercises; modifications to the home environment; education on assistive device use; pressure ulcer care; nutrition management; and motivational counseling. The MHR group received 24 visits from rehabilitation staff for 8 weeks (3 times a week), while the home exercise group received home exercises focusing on strengthening described in the leaflet. The rehabilitation staff prescribed the intensity of exercise at the first visit, and the home exercise group exercised without supervision after that for 8 weeks. Both groups received a 10-min phone call once a week for overall counseling to ensure high adherence to home exercises. Among the 40 participants, 29 (72.5%) completed the trial. The primary outcomes were balance and mobility. Balance was assessed using the functional reach test (FRT), and the timed up-and-go test (TUG) was used to assess balance and mobility. Data were analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle.

Its horizontal pattern resembles that of the interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO) in the Pacific and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) in the Atlantic Ocean, which could affect global precipitation and temperature over the globe. Here, we demonstrate that the GMV could be driven by the AMO through atmospheric teleconnections and atmosphere-ocean coupling processes. Observations reveal a strong negative correlation when AMO leads GMV by approximately 4-8 years. Pacemaker experiments using a climate model driven by observed AMO signals reveal that the tropical Atlantic warm SST anomalies of AMO initiate anomalous cooling in the equatorial central-eastern Pacific through atmospheric teleconnections. Anticyclonic anomalies in the North and South Pacific induce equatorward winds along the coasts of North and South America, contributing to further cooling. The upper-ocean dynamics plays a minor role in GMV formation but contributes to a delayed response of the IPO to the AMO forcing. The possible impact of the GMV on AMO was also tested by prescribing only Pacific SST in the model; however, the model could not reproduce the observed phase relationship between the AMO and the GMV.

We analyzed 620 samples collected from the Johns Hopkins Health System during March 11-31, 2020, comprising 28.6% of the total cases in Maryland and Washington, DC. From these samples, we generated 114 complete viral genomes. Analysis of these genomes alongside a subsampling of over 1000 previously published sequences showed that the diversity in this region rivaled global SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity at that time and that the sequences belong to all of the major globally circulating lineages, suggesting multiple introductions into the region. We also analyzed these regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes alongside detailed clinical metadata and found that clinically severe cases had viral genomes belonging to all major viral lineages. We conclude that efforts to control local spread of the virus were likely confounded by the number of introductions into the region early in the epidemic and the interconnectedness of the region as a whole.","output":"Genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 during early introduction into the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has catalyzed the rapid adoption of telemedicine which encompasses synchronous and asynchronous interactions between patients and providers.

We measured soluble ACE2 (sACE2) and sACE levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 114 hospital-treated COVID-19 patients compared with 10 healthy controls; follow-up samples after four months were analyzed for 58 patients. Associations between sACE2 respectively sACE and risk factors for severe COVID-19, outcome, and inflammatory markers were investigated. Levels of sACE2 were higher in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls, median 5.0 (interquartile range 2.8-11.8) ng/ml versus 1.4 (1.1-1.6) ng/ml, p < .0001. sACE2 was higher in men than women but was not affected by other risk factors for severe COVID-19. sACE2 decreased to 2.3 (1.6-3.9) ng/ml at follow-up, p < .0001, but remained higher than in healthy controls, p = .012. sACE was marginally lower during COVID-19 compared with at follow-up, 57 (45-70) ng/ml versus 72 (52-87) ng/ml, p = .008.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether physician-delivered prevention messages affect knowledge and information-seeking behavior of Black and Latinx individuals and whether this differs according to the race/ethnicity of the physician and tailored content. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. (Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04371419; American Economic Association RCT Registry, AEARCTR-0005789). SETTING: United States, 13 May 2020 to 26 May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 14 267 self-identified Black or Latinx adults recruited via Lucid survey platform. INTERVENTION: Participants viewed 3 video messages regarding COVID-19 that varied by physician race/ethnicity, acknowledgment of racism/inequality, and community perceptions of mask wearing. MEASUREMENTS: Knowledge gaps (number of errors on 7 facts on COVID-19 symptoms and prevention) and information-seeking behavior (number of web links demanded out of 10 proposed). RESULTS: 7174 Black (61.3%) and 4520 Latinx (38.7%) participants were included in the analysis. The intervention reduced the knowledge gap incidence from 0.085 to 0.065 (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.737 [95% CI, 0.600 to 0.874]) but did not significantly change information-seeking incidence. For Black participants, messages from race/ethnicity-concordant physicians increased information-seeking incidence from 0.329 (for discordant physicians) to 0.357 (IRR, 1.085 [CI, 1.026 to 1.145]). LIMITATIONS: Participants' behavior was not directly observed, outcomes were measured immediately postintervention in May 2020, and online recruitment may not be representative. CONCLUSION: Physician-delivered messages increased knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms and prevention methods for Black and Latinx respondents. The desire for additional information increased with race-concordant messages for Black but not Latinx respondents. Other tailoring of the content did not make a significant difference.

RESULTS: Valid responses were received from 36 hospitals. Most of these programmes offered both in-person and online therapy. The most common aim of these interventions was emotional regulation, which was treated by psychoeducational and cognitive-behavioural techniques in individual interventions. Group interventions mainly used psychoeducation and mindfulness. Only half of the teams that offered in-person interventions received training in the proper use of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Several hospitals in Spain have developed mental health interventions for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, deploying a wide range of therapeutic modalities and techniques. The rapid implementation of these programmes during the pandemic suggests that safety may not have received sufficient attention.

Many of the OADs exert an exposure-response relationship but still, a 'one-size fits-all' dose is used, ignoring interindividual variability. Several of these OADs share similar mechanisms of actions and thus target the same cancer and has resulted in a substantial research focus on comparing the health benefit of each. However, significantly less is known about the cost-benefit associated with OADs. This paper will provide a protocol to systematically review studies that have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of OADs and their associated individualised dosing interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Systematic review methodology will be applied to identify, select and extract data from published economic evaluation (costs and outcomes/benefits) studies of OADs and their associated individualised dosing interventions. Bibliographic databases (eg, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE) will be used to perform the systematic literature search (between 1 January 2000 and October 2020). Only full economic evaluations will be included, but no restrictions on study outcomes will be applied. The quality of included primary studies will be assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist for reporting economic evaluations. Studies with low-quality evidence will be excluded. A narrative synthesis of the results from the included studies will be undertaken, with a subgroup analysis where appropriate. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This systematic review will not require ethics approval as there will not be any collection of primary data. Findings of this review will be disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals, presentations at workshops or conferences and sharing through a media release. Findings from this review will provide evidence to direct and inform policy-makers where cost-neutral strategies may be effective or where dose individualising strategies may be economically beneficial. Additionally, gaps will be identified in the current literature to inform future-related research. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER CRD42020218170.

Funding for other treatments, in particular new treatments, may become more constrained than previously expected. Therefore, a robust health technology assessment (HTA) system is vital. Many clinical trials carried out during the pandemic may have been temporarily halted, while others may have had to change their protocols. Even trials that continue as normal may experience external changes as other aspects of the healthcare service may not be available to the patients in the trial, or the patients themselves may contract COVID-19. Consequently, many limitations are likely to arise in the provision of robust HTAs, which could have profound consequences on the availability of new treatments. Therefore, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics Review Group wishes to discuss these issues and make recommendations for applicants submitting to HTA agencies, in ample time for these HTAs to be prepared and assessed. We discuss how the pandemic may affect the estimation of the treatment effect, costs, life-years, utilities, discontinuation rates, and methods of evidence synthesis and extrapolation. In particular, we note that trials conducted during the pandemic will be subject to a higher degree of uncertainty than before. It is vital that applicants clearly identify any parameters that may be affected by the pandemic.

METHODS: The DEA-Malmquist was used to evaluate the total factor productivity of medical and health institutions in 31 provinces. A fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) was used for configuration analysis of determinants affecting technical efficiency. RESULTS: The average total factor productivity (TFP) of those institutions was 0.965, namely TFP declined averagely by 3.5% annually. The efficiency change and the technical change were 0.998 and 0.967, respectively. The realization paths of high technical efficiency are composed of high fatality rate and high financial allocation-led, high population density and high GDP-led. Low dependency ratio and low financial allocation-led, low fatality rate and low financial allocation-led are the main reasons for low technical efficiency. CONCLUSION: Due to advanced medical technology and economic development, major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong have attracted a large number of high-level health personnel, achieving long-term and stable health business growth.

In this Perspective, we posit that cells of the innate immune system use the presence of oxidized lipids as a generic indicator of threat to the host. Similarly to how pathogen-associated molecular patterns represent general indicators of microbial encounters, oxidized lipids may be the most common molecular feature of an injured tissue. Therefore, microbial detection in the absence of oxidized lipids may indicate encounters with avirulent microorganisms. By contrast, microbial detection and detection of oxidized lipids would indicate encounters with replicating microorganisms, thereby inducing a heightened inflammatory and defensive response. Here we review recent studies supporting this idea. We focus on the biology of oxidized phosphocholines, which have emerged as context-dependent regulators of immunity. We highlight emerging functions of oxidized phosphocholines in dendritic cells and macrophages that drive unique inflammasome and migratory activities and hypermetabolic states. We describe how these lipids hyperactivate dendritic cells to stimulate antitumour CD8(+) T cell immunity and discuss the potential implications of the newly described activities of oxidized phosphocholines in host defence.","output":"Innate immune detection of lipid oxidation as a threat assessment strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although most inbred mouse strains are highly susceptible to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection, the inbred SJL line of mice is highly resistant to its infection. The principal receptor for MHV is murine CEACAM1 (mCEACAM1). Susceptible strains of mice are homozygous for the 1a allele of mCeacam1, while SJL mice are homozygous for the 1b allele. mCEACAM1a (1a) has a 10- to 100-fold-higher receptor activity than does mCEACAM1b (1b). To explore the hypothesis that MHV susceptibility is due to the different MHV receptor activities of 1a and 1b, we established a chimeric C57BL/6 mouse (cB61ba) in which a part of the N-terminal immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain of the mCeacam1a (1a) gene, which is responsible for MHV receptor function, is replaced by the corresponding region of mCeacam1b (1b). We compared the MHV susceptibility of these chimeric mice to that of SJL and B6 mice. B6 mice that are homozygous for 1a are highly susceptible to MHV-A59 infection, with a 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) of 10(2.5) PFU, while chimeric cB61ba mice and SJL mice homozygous for 1ba and 1b, respectively, survived following inoculation with 10(5) PFU. Unexpectedly, cB61ba mice were more resistant to MHV-A59 infection than SJL mice as measured by virus replication in target organs, including liver and brain. No infectious virus or viral RNA was detected in the organs of cB61ba mice, while viral RNA and infectious virus were detected in target organs of SJL mice. Furthermore, SJL mice produced antiviral antibodies after MHV-A59 inoculation with 10(5) PFU, but cB61ba mice did not. Thus, cB61ba mice are apparently completely resistant to MHV-A59 infection, while SJL mice permit low levels of MHV-A59 virus replication during self-limited, asymptomatic infection. When expressed on cultured BHK cells, the mCEACAM1b and mCEACAM1ba proteins had similar levels of MHV-A59 receptor activity. These results strongly support the hypothesis that although alleles of mCEACAM1 are the principal determinants of mouse susceptibility to MHV-A59, other as-yet-unidentified murine genes may also play a role in susceptibility to MHV.","output":"Role of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) receptor murine CEACAM1 in the resistance of mice to MHV infection: studies of mice with chimeric mCEACAM1a and mCEACAM1b."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented health crisis.

We identified published articles on SARS-COV efficacy experiments in which some selected compounds were used to test the reduction of the virus load in mice. METHODS A systematic search of articles was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. We then developed a combined model based on a systematic review, meta-analyses, and molecular docking studies to evaluate the effect size of preclinical studies of compounds that have been tested against SARS-COV. Because substantial heterogeneity was expected, random effect model meta-analyses were carried out to estimate the overall pooled disease's prevalence. All meta-analyses were performed with Stata version 15.0. Subgroup analyses on therapies were conducted as well. Molecular docking studies of the inhibitors in the active pocket of COVID-19 protease were also performed. RESULTS From all screened articles, six studies were appropriate for ultimate meta-analysis and systematic review. The residual amount of heterogeneity was high (2 =0.02; heterogeneity I2 =85.5 % with heterogeneity chi-square =103.57, a degree of freedom =15, and p <0.001). The overall random pooled prevalence of infected mice treated with the selected compounds was 78.1 % [95 % Confidence Interval (CI): 14.7-17.0 %]. Prophylactic has a significantly higher pooled prevalence than therapeutic, with 21.8 % (95 % CI: 16.4 % to 28.8 %). Our results indicated that most of the SARS-COV inhibitors analyzed were less effective in reducing the lung virus titer of SARS-COV infection in animal models. The findings from molecular docking studies also identified COVID-19 inhibitors that are good for optimization and drug development to fight against COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS Findings from the review showed that studies on the preclinical compounds targeting SARS-COV and COVID-19 are limited. Furthermore, molecular docking studies and meta-analysis results substantiated three compounds, i.e., EIDD-2801, GS-5734, and amodiaquine.

Unlike conventional small molecule medicines or protein biologics, nucleic acid theranostics have characteristic features such as the intrinsic ability as information drugs to code and execute genetic and theranostic information, ready programmability for nucleic acid engineering, intrinsic stimulatory or regulatory immunomodulation, versatile functionalities, and easy conformational recovery upon thermal or chemical denaturation. Single-stranded circular DNA (circDNA) are a class of single-stranded DNAs (ssDNA) featured with their covalently-closed topology. In addition to the basic advantages of nucleic acids-based materials, such as low cost, biocompatibility, and simplicity of chemical modification, the lack of terminals in circDNA prevents exonuclease degradation, resulting in enhanced biostability relative to the corresponding linear ssDNA. circDNA has been explored for versatile theranostic applications. For instance, circDNA has been extensively studied as templates for bioanalytical signal amplification and the synthesis of nano-/micro-/macro- biomaterials via rolling circle amplification (RCA) and rolling circle transcription (RCT) technologies. circDNA has also been commonly used as the scaffolds for the self-assembly of versatile DNA origami. Finally, circDNA has been implemented as theranostic aptamers, miRNA inhibitors, as well as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated proteins (CRISPR-Cas) gene editing donors.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort for algorithm training, testing, and validation. SETTING: Eight hospitals across two geographically distinct regions. PATIENTS: Two-thousand fifteen hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019Cpositive patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Anticipating Respiratory failure in Coronavirus disease (ARC), a clinically interpretable, continuously monitoring prognostic model of acute respiratory failure in hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients, was developed and validated. An analysis of the most important clinical predictors aligns with key risk factors identified by other investigators but contributes new insights regarding the time at which key factors first begin to exhibit aberrency and distinguishes features predictive of acute respiratory failure in coronavirus disease 2019 versus pneumonia caused by other types of infection. Departing from prior work, ARC was designed to update continuously over time as new observations (vitals and laboratory test results) are recorded in the electronic health record. Validation against data from two geographically distinct health systems showed that the proposed model achieved 75% specificity and 77% sensitivity and predicted acute respiratory failure at a median time of 32 hours prior to onset. Over 80% of true-positive alerts occurred in non-ICU settings. CONCLUSIONS: Patients admitted to non-ICU environments with coronavirus disease 2019 are at ongoing risk of clinical progression to severe disease, yet it is challenging to anticipate which patients will develop acute respiratory failure. A continuously monitoring prognostic model has potential to facilitate anticipatory rather than reactive approaches to escalation of care (e.g., earlier initiation of treatments for severe disease or structured monitoring and therapeutic interventions for high-risk patients).","output":"Development and Validation of ARC, a Model for Anticipating Acute Respiratory Failure in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM To retrospectively compare the treatment effect of intraprocedural computed tomography/magnetic resonance-contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CT/MR-CEUS) fusion imaging (FI) with that of conventional ultrasound (US) in the guidance and assessment of thermal ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

In late February, the disease began to spread quickly across the world, causing serious health, social, and economic emergencies. This paper aims to forecast the short to medium-term incidence of COVID-19 epidemic through the medium of an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, applied to Italy, Russia, and the USA The analysis is performed on the number of new daily confirmed COVID-19 cases, collected by Worldometer website (www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). The best ARIMA models were Italy (4,2,4), Russia (1,2,1), and the USA (6,2,3). The results showed that: i) ARIMA models are reliable enough when new daily cases begin to stabilize;ii) Italy, the USA, and Russia reached the peak of COVID-19 infections in mid-April, mid-May, and early June, respectively;and iii) Russia and the USA will require much more time than Italy to drop COVID-19 cases near zero. This may suggest the importance of the application of quick and effective lockdown measures, which have been relatively stricter in Italy. Therefore, even if the results should be interpreted with caution, ARIMA models seem to be a good tool that can help the health authorities to monitor the diffusion of the outbreak.

In situ spectra of the regolith have peak band positions at 1 and 2 m, similar to the spectral data of Finsen ejecta from the Moon Mineralogy Mapper, which confirms that the regolith's composition of the landing area is mostly similar to that of Finsen ejecta.

The accumulating evidence suggests that supplementation of albumin may provide survival advantages only when the insult is severe as in patients with septic shock. METHODS/DESIGN: The randomized controlled multicentre study of albumin replacement therapy in septic shock (ARISS) investigates whether the replacement with albumin and the maintenance of its serum levels of at least 30 g/l for 28 days improve survival in patients with septic shock compared to resuscitation and volume maintenance without albumin. Adult patients ( 18 years) with septic shock are randomly assigned within a maximum of 24 h after the onset of septic shock after obtaining informed consents to treatment or control groups. Patients assigned to the treatment group receive a 60-g loading dose of human albumin 20% over 2C3 h. Serum albumin levels are maintained at least at 30 g/l in the ICU for a maximum of 28 days following randomization using 40C80 g human albumin 20% infusion. The control group is treated according to the usual practice with crystalloids as the first choice for the resuscitation and maintenance phase of septic shock. The primary endpoint is 90 days mortality and secondary endpoints include 28-day, 60-day, ICU, and in-hospital mortality, organ dysfunction/failure, total amount of fluid administration and total fluid balance in the ICU, and lengths of ICU and hospital stay. In total, 1412 patients need to be analysed, 706 per group. For the sample size estimation, a 15% reduction in 90-day mortality is assumed, i.e. an absolute reduction of 7.5% points to 42.5% (relative risk 1.18). Assuming a dropout rate of 15%, a total of 1662 patients need to be allocated. DISCUSSION: The results of the clinical trial may influence the treatment of patients with septic shock. The expected improvement in patient survival may result in a reduction in the resources currently used in the treatment of these patients and in the socioeconomic burden of this disease.

Urgent endoscopies are, however, intended to proceed as normal with additional personal protective procedures. A perceived reduction in hospital attendances may suggest a number of urgently indicated endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatographies (ERCPs) are being missed. Objectives and Methods: A review of all ERCPs carried out in a large tertiary referral endoscopy unit under healthcare restrictions was compared to the same time period in previous years. The intention was to determine if ERCPs are proceeding as normal or if there is a difference in referral characteristics. RESULTS Under service restrictions (13 March to the end of April 2020), 55 ERCPs were performed compared with 87 ERCPs in 2019. Similar numbers to 2019 were also recorded in the preceding years. One case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in a patient in the days following ERCP, with no cases notified among staff related to endoscopy.

Still higher testing capacity permits detection of geographical differences in spreading rates. Furthermore and most importantly, with daily sampling in place, a reboot could be attempted while the fraction of infected people is still an order of magnitude higher than the level required for a relaxation of restrictions with testing focused on symptomatic individuals.

The effectiveness and safety of interventions used to treat depression is often assessed through randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, heterogeneity in the selection, measurement and reporting of outcomes in RCTs renders comparisons between trial results, interpretability and generalisability of findings challenging. There is presently no core outcome set (COS) for use in RCTs that assess interventions for older adults with MDD. We will conduct a methodological review of the literature for outcomes reported in trials for adults 65 years and older with depression to assess the heterogeneity of outcome measures. METHODS AND ANALYSIS RCTs evaluating pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or any other treatment intervention for older adults with MDD published in the last 10 years will be located using electronic database searches (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials). Reviewers will conduct title and abstract screening, full-text screening and data extraction of trials eligible for inclusion independently and in duplicate. Outcomes will be synthesised and mapped to core outcome-domain frameworks. We will summarise characteristics associated with trials and outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION We hope that findings from our methodological review will reduce variability in outcome selection, measurement and reporting and facilitate the development of a COS for older adults with MDD. Our review will also inform evidence synthesis efforts in identifying the best treatment practices for this clinical population. Ethics approval is not required, as this study is a literature review.

Spoilage microorganisms with proteolytic and/or lipolytic properties are primarily responsible for the decrease in the quality of milk, which is reflected in the shelf life of pasteurized milk and all derivatives. The aim of this study was to determine the spoilage microbial load of refrigerated raw milk from the northeast and southern regions of Brazil, which have different climatic and technological conditions of production. We evaluated 46 samples of milk from the state of Paran in the southern region, and 10 samples of milk from the state of Maranh?o in the northeast region, totaling 56 samples collected from November 2013 to November 2014. The producers of Paran were divided into large (20) or small (26) according to the average daily production. All producers of Maranh?o were considered small ( 500L/day). The proteolytic and lipolytic microorganism counts were conducted in milk agar and tributyrin agar, respectively. Milk from the large producers of Paran had average counts of 1.4  104 CFU/mL for proteolytic microorganisms and 1.2  103 CFU/mL for lipolytics microorganisms, significantly (p 0.05) lower than the small producers in the same state, and the producers of Maranh?o. Producers of Maranhao had counts of 1.1  105 CFU/mL for proteolytic microorganisms and 2  105 CFU/mL for lipolytic microorganisms, with the proteolytic count significantly lower than that of small Paran producers. The amount of proteolytic and lipolytic spoilage microorganisms in milk is influenced by the adaptation of the microorganisms to cold, promoted by the cooling of milk, which is practiced less frequently in the countrys northeastern region. The amount of spoilage microorganisms is also affected by the implementation of milking hygiene practices, which reduce contamination.(AU)","output":"Proteolytic and lipolytic microbiota of refrigerated raw milk from northeast and southern regions of Brazil/ Microbiota proteoltica e lipoltica de leite cru refrigerado da regi?o nordeste e sul do Brasil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an effort to discover potent anticancer agents, 2-thiouracil-5-sulfonamides derivatives were designed and synthesized.

Now, accumulating evidence suggests greater involvement of lower age and narrowing the age and sex based differences for the severity of symptoms in infections with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Delta variant (B.1.617.2) is now a globally dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain, however, current evidence on demographic characteristics for this variant are limited.

DesignA cross sectional study SettingDemographic characteristics, including vaccination status (for two complete doses) and severity of the illness and mortality rate, of COVID-19 cases caused by wild type strain (B.1) and delta variant (B.1.617.2) of SARS-CoV-2 in Indian population were studied. ParticipantsCOVID-19 cases for which SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing was performed and complete demographic details (age, sex, and location) were available, were included. ExposuresSARS-CoV-2 infection with Delta (B.1.617.2) variant and wild type (B.1) strain. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe patient metadata containing details for demographic and vaccination status (two complete doses) of the COVID-19 patients with confirmed delta variant and WT (B.1) infections were analyzed [total number of cases (N) =9500, Ndelta=6238, NWT=3262]. Further, severity of the illness and mortality were assessed in subsets of patients. Final data were tabulated and statistically analyzed to determine age and sex based differences in chances of getting infection and the severity of illness, and post-vaccination infections were compared between wild type and delta variant strains. Graphs were plotted to visualize the trends. ResultsWith delta variant, in comparison to wild type (B.1) strain, higher proportion of lower age groups, particularly <20 year (0-9 year: 4.47% vs. 2.3%, 10-19 year: 9% vs. 7%) were affected.

Treatment setting (outpatient/hospital/nursing-home), pre-existing comorbidities, signs/symptoms, clinical course, severity and lethality (death from any cause in-hospital or within the first 30-day after the diagnosis) were determined. Chi squared and Fisher's test were used to compare percentages. RESULTS Of the 536 overall cases (mean age: 74 years; 43.8% male), 150 (28%) were outpatient, 179 (33.4%) were hospitalised and 207 (38.6%) happened in nursing-home/social-health centres. The most prevalent symptoms were fever (57.9%), cough (49.8%), dyspnea (41.5%), general discomfort (36.2%), fatigue (24.4%), diarrhea (19.6%), myalgias (17.3%), headache (14.6%), confusion/lethargy (14.6%), thoracic pain (10%), anosmia (9.8%), disgeusia/ageusia (8.1%) and sore throat (7.7%).

Research has revealed that defects in specific molecular pathways underlie AF pathogenesis, resulting in electrical conduction disorders that drive AF. The severity of this so-called electropathology correlates with the stage of AF disease progression and determines the response to AF treatment. Therefore, unravelling the molecular mechanisms underlying electropathology is expected to fuel the development of innovative personalized diagnostic tools and mechanism-based therapies. Moreover, the co-creation of AF studies with patients to implement novel diagnostic tools and therapies is a prerequisite for successful personalized AF management.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, nonessential clinical visits were greatly limited, and much of the outpatient neurosurgical practice at the authors' institution was shifted quickly to telehealth. Although there are prior data suggesting that the use of telemedicine is satisfactory in other surgical fields, data in neurosurgery are limited. This study aimed to investigate both patient and provider satisfaction with telemedicine and its strengths and limitations in outpatient neurosurgery visits. METHODS This quality improvement study was designed to analyze provider and patient satisfaction with telemedicine consultations in an outpatient neurosurgery clinic setting at a tertiary care, large-volume, academic center. The authors designed an 11-question survey for neurosurgical providers and a 13-question survey for patients using both closed 5-point Likert scale responses and multiple choice responses. The questionnaires were administered to patients and providers during the period when the clinic restricted in-person visits. At the conclusion of the study, the overall data were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. RESULTS During the study period, 607 surveys were sent out to patients seen by telehealth at the authors' academic center, and 122 responses were received. For the provider survey, 85 surveys were sent out to providers at the authors' center and other academic centers, and 40 surveys were received. Ninety-two percent of patients agreed or strongly agreed that they were satisfied with that particular telehealth visit. Eighty-eight percent of patients agreed that their telehealth visit was more convenient for them than an in-person visit, but only 36% of patients stated they would like their future visits to be telehealth. Sixty-three percent of providers agreed that telehealth visits were more convenient for them than in-person visits, and 85% of responding providers stated that they wished to incorporate telehealth into their future practice. CONCLUSIONS Although the authors' transition to telehealth was both rapid and unexpected, most providers and patients reported positive experiences with their telemedicine visits and found telemedicine to be an effective form of ambulatory neurosurgical care. Not all patients preferred telemedicine visits over in-person visits, but the high satisfaction with telemedicine by both providers and patients is promising to the future expansion of telehealth in ambulatory neurosurgery.","output":"Ambulatory neurosurgery in the COVID-19 era: patient and provider satisfaction with telemedicine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aim: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the current pandemic, can have multi-organ impact.

RESULTS: Most of the European countries closed schools in the period of 11C20 of March 2020. However, there was a big difference in the phase of the epidemic on the day of closure. The data indicate that there was a strong correlation between the day of educational facilities closure and the incidence rate in the following days (16th, 30th, and 60th days since the 100th confirmed case in each country). Early closure of schools in analyzed countries is statistically significantly correlated with lower incidence rates further on during the different phases of the epidemic. Thereby closure of schools with delay is statistically significantly correlated with a higher incidence rate in the following days.

Among the mechanisms associated with disease onset and progression, it has been hypothesized that IPF lungs might be affected either by a regenerative deficit of the alveolar epithelium or by a dysregulation of repair mechanisms in response to alveolar and vascular damage. This latter might be related to the progressive dysfunction and exhaustion of the resident stem cells together with a process of cellular and tissue senescence. The role of endogenous mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) resident in the lung in the homeostasis of these mechanisms is still a matter of debate. Although endogenous MSCs may play a critical role in lung repair, they are also involved in cellular senescence and tissue ageing processes with loss of lung regenerative potential. In addition, MSCs have immunomodulatory properties and can secrete anti-fibrotic factors. Thus, MSCs obtained from other sources administered systemically or directly into the lung have been investigated for lung epithelial repair and have been explored as a potential therapy for the treatment of lung diseases including IPF.

We previously reported that only a limited neutralizing activity to vesicular stomatitis virus or HCV pseudotype is generated in animals immunized with recombinant HCV envelope proteins and chronically infected HCV patient sera. Interestingly, when some of these neutralizing sera were diluted into a range of concentrations below those that reduced virus plaque number, an increase in pseudotype plaque formation was observed. Purified HCV E2-specific human monoclonal antibodies were used to further verify the specificity of this enhancement, and one- to twofold increases were apparent on permissive Huh-7 cells. The enhancement of HCV pseudotype titer could be inhibited by the addition of a Fc-specific anti-human immunoglobulin G Fab fragment to the virus-antibody mixture prior to infection. Treatment of cells with antibody to Fc receptor I (FcRI) or FcRII, but not FcRIII, also led to an inhibition of pseudotype titer enhancement in an additive manner. Human lymphoblastoid cell line (Raji), a poor host for HCV pseudotype infection, exhibited a four- to sixfold enhancement of pseudotype-mediated cell death upon incubation with antibody at nonneutralizing concentrations. A similar enhancement of cell culture-grown HCV infectivity by a human monoclonal antibody was also observed.

We monitored the plasma clonal IgG1 profiles of 8 donors (4 male and 4 female) who had recently experienced an infection by either the wild type Wuhan Hu-1 virus or one of 3 VOCs (Alpha, Beta and Gamma). In these donors we charted the full plasma IgG1 repertoires as well as the IgG1 repertoires targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimer as antigen. We observed that shortly after infection in between <0.1% to almost 10% of all IgG1 antibody molecules present in plasma did bind to the spike protein. Each donor displayed a unique plasma IgG1 repertoire, but also each donor displayed a unique and polyclonal antibody response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein variants. Our analyses revealed that certain clones exhibit (alike) binding affinity towards all four tested spike-protein variants, whereas other clones displayed strong unique mutant-specific affinity. We conclude that each infected person generates a unique polyclonal response following infection, whereby some of these clones can bind multiple viral variants, whereas other clones do not display such cross-reactivity. In general, by assessing IgG1 repertoires following infection it becomes possible to identify and select fully matured human plasma antibodies that target specific antigens, and display either high specificity or cross-reactivity versus mutated versions of the antigen, which will aid in selecting antibodies that may be developed into biotherapeutics.","output":"IgG1 responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection are polyclonal and highly personalized, whereby each donor and each clone displays a distinct pattern of cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the vessel endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a risk factor in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis (SCCP).

Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane (M) protein, have been tested for vaccine development against SARS and MERS. However, these vaccine candidates might lack the induction of complete protection and have safety concerns. We then applied the Vaxign and the newly developed machine learning-based Vaxign-ML reverse vaccinology tools to predict COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Our Vaxign analysis found that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein sequence is conserved with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but not from the other four human coronaviruses causing mild symptoms. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8-10), were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective antigenicity. Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 coronaviruses infecting human and other animals. The protein was also predicted to contain promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and the predicted linear B-cell epitopes were found to be localized on the surface of the protein. Our predicted vaccine targets have the potential for effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine development.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate and analyze posts related to COVID-19 misinformation on major Chinese social media platforms in order to characterize the COVID-19 infodemic. METHODS: We collected posts related to COVID-19 misinformation published on major Chinese social media platforms from January 20 to May 28, 2020, by using PythonToolkit. We used content analysis to identify the quantity and source of prevalent posts and topic modeling to cluster themes related to the COVID-19 infodemic. Furthermore, we explored the quantity, sources, and theme characteristics of the COVID-19 infodemic over time. RESULTS: The daily number of social media posts related to the COVID-19 infodemic was positively correlated with the daily number of newly confirmed (r=0.672, P<.01) and newly suspected (r=0.497, P<.01) COVID-19 cases. The COVID-19 infodemic showed a characteristic of gradual progress, which can be divided into 5 stages: incubation, outbreak, stalemate, control, and recovery. The sources of the COVID-19 infodemic can be divided into 5 types: chat platforms (1100/2745, 40.07%), video-sharing platforms (642/2745, 23.39%), news-sharing platforms (607/2745, 22.11%), health care platforms (239/2745, 8.71%), and Q&A platforms (157/2745, 5.72%), which slightly differed at each stage. The themes related to the COVID-19 infodemic were clustered into 8 categories: conspiracy theories (648/2745, 23.61%), government response (544/2745, 19.82%), prevention action (411/2745, 14.97%), new cases (365/2745, 13.30%), transmission routes (244/2745, 8.89%), origin and nomenclature (228/2745, 8.30%), vaccines and medicines (154/2745, 5.61%), and symptoms and detection (151/2745, 5.50%), which were prominently diverse at different stages. Additionally, the COVID-19 infodemic showed the characteristic of repeated fluctuations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that the COVID-19 infodemic on Chinese social media was characterized by gradual progress, videoization, and repeated fluctuations. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the COVID-19 infodemic is paralleled to the propagation of the COVID-19 epidemic. We have tracked the COVID-19 infodemic across Chinese social media, providing critical new insights into the characteristics of the infodemic and pointing out opportunities for preventing and controlling the COVID-19 infodemic.","output":"Characterizing the COVID-19 Infodemic on Chinese Social Media: Exploratory Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective small molecule therapies to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection are still lacking as the COVID-19 pandemic continues globally. High throughput screening assays are needed for lead discovery and optimization of small molecule SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. In this work, we have applied viral pseudotyping to establish a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 entry assay. Here, the pseudotyped particles (PP) contain SARS-CoV-2 spike in a membrane enveloping both the murine leukemia virus (MLV) gag-pol polyprotein and luciferase reporter RNA. Upon addition of PP to HEK293-ACE2 cells, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to the ACE2 receptor on the cell surface, resulting in priming by host proteases to trigger endocytosis of these particles, and membrane fusion between the particle envelope and the cell membrane. The internalized luciferase reporter gene is then expressed in cells, resulting in a luminescent readout as a surrogate for spike-mediated entry into cells. This SARS-CoV-2 PP entry assay can be executed in a biosafety level 2 containment lab for high throughput screening. From a collection of 5,158 approved drugs and drug candidates, our screening efforts identified 7 active compounds that inhibited the SARS-CoV-2-S PP entry. Of these seven, six compounds were active against live replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus in a cytopathic effect assay. Our results demonstrated the utility of this assay in the discovery and development of SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors as well as the mechanistic study of anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. Additionally, particles pseudotyped with spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants were prepared and used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of viral entry inhibitors.","output":"A high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped particle entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and spreading rapidly worldwide with extremely high infection rate. Since effective and specific vaccine is not available to combat the deadly COVID-19, the objective of our study was to design a multi-epitope vaccine using immunoinformatics approach with translational implications. Nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is stable, conserved and highly immunogenic along with being less prone to mutations during infection, which makes it a suitable candidate for designing vaccine. In our study, B- and T-cells epitopes were identified from N protein and screened based on crucial parameters to design the multi-epitope vaccine construct. Additionally, human beta-defensin-2 was incorporated into the vaccine construct as an adjuvant along with suitable linkers followed by its further evaluation based on crucial parameters including allergenicity, antigenicity, stability etc. Combined major histocompatibility complexes (MHC-I and MHC-II) binding epitopes presented broader population coverage of the vaccine throughout the world. The three-dimensional structure of vaccine candidate implied strong interaction with toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) using molecular docking. The vaccine-TLR3 complex was observed to be highly stable during simulation and electrostatic free energy was foremost contributor for stabilization of the structure. Subsequently, in silico cloning of vaccine candidate was carried out to generate the construct into pET-28a(+) expression vector succeeded by its virtual confirmation.

We used a dynamical model of heart rate changes to estimate coregulation. We found that (a) increases in state attachment avoidance were associated with contrarian coregulation (heart rate becoming misaligned with the partner's physiology) and (b) conversely, increases in state attachment anxiety were associated with dependent coregulation (heart rate becoming aligned with the partners' physiology). Dispositional attachment insecurity moderated the effects of state attachment insecurity on physiological coregulation. Whereas dispositional anxiety predicted individuals exhibiting dependent coregulation in response to state insecurity, dispositional avoidance predicted contrarian coregulation in response to state insecurity.

We used data from the racially diverse Kaiser Permanente GERA cohort (68,638 Non-Hispanic Whites, 5,874 Hispanics, 6,870 Asians and 2,760 Blacks). Race was self-reported by questionnaire. RESULTS For the standard PRS, Non-Hispanic Whites showed the highest odds ratio for a standard deviation increase in PRS for asthma OR=1.16 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.18). The standard PRS was also associated with asthma in Hispanic OR=1.12 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.19), and Asian subjects OR=1.10 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.17), with a trend toward increased risk in Blacks OR=1.05 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.15). We detected an interaction by sex, with men showing higher risk of asthma with an increase in PRS as compared to women.

The aim of this review is to summarise the current best evidence for the effectiveness of home-based active video games on gait and balance, user compliance, feasibility and safety for pwMS. METHODS We searched for studies in five databases (PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, CINAHL and Science direct) up to October 2020. Selection of studies, extraction of data and methodological quality assessment through the PEDro scale were made independently by two authors and discussed with a third author.

Home-based active video games are feasible and safe, with good compliance and adherence. The methodological quality of the studies was moderate (PEDro scale: 5.3  2). CONCLUSION Overall, home-based active video games were found safe and effective improving static and dynamic balance in pwMS. Compliance was good, probably because it is a motivating and enjoyable training. Active video games can be a relevant alternative for physical rehabilitation at home in pwMS.

Objective: To estimate the degree to which expanding fecal immunochemical test-based colorectal cancer screening participation during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with clinical outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: A previously developed simulation model was adopted to estimate how much COVID-19 may have contributed to colorectal cancer outcomes. The model included the US population estimated to have completed colorectal cancer screening pre-COVID-19 according the American Cancer Society. The model was designed to estimate colorectal cancer outcomes between 2020 and 2023. This analysis was completed between July and December 2020. Exposures: Adults screened for colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer cases detected by stage. Main Outcomes and Measures: Estimates of colorectal cancer outcomes across 4 scenarios: (1) 9 months of 50% colorectal cancer screenings followed by 21 months of 75% colorectal cancer screenings; (2) 18 months of 50% screening followed by 12 months of 75% screening; (3) scenario 1 with increased use of fecal immunochemical tests; and (4) scenario 2 with increased use of fecal immunochemical tests. Results: In our simulation model, COVID-19-related reductions in care utilization resulted in an estimated 1a?176a?942 to 2a?014a?164 fewer colorectal cancer screenings, 8346 to 12a?894 fewer colorectal cancer diagnoses, and 6113 to 9301 fewer early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses between 2020 and 2023. With an abbreviated period of reduced colorectal cancer screenings, increasing fecal immunochemical test use was associated with an estimated additional 588a?844 colorectal cancer screenings and 2836 colorectal cancer diagnoses, of which 1953 (68.9%) were early stage. In the event of a prolonged period of reduced colorectal cancer screenings, increasing fecal immunochemical test use was associated with an estimated additional 655a?825 colorectal cancer screenings and 2715 colorectal cancer diagnoses, of which 1944 (71.6%) were early stage. Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that the increased use of fecal immunochemical tests during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased colorectal cancer screening participation and more colorectal cancer diagnoses at earlier stages. If our estimates are borne out in real-world clinical practice, increasing fecal immunochemical test-based colorectal cancer screening participation during the COVID-19 pandemic could mitigate the consequences of reduced screening rates during the pandemic for colorectal cancer outcomes.","output":"Model-Based Estimation of Colorectal Cancer Screening and Outcomes During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"So far, no coherent and convincing theory has been developed to fully explain the pathogenesis of migraine, although many researchers and experts emphasize its association with spreading cortical depression, oxidative stress, vascular changes, nervous excitement, neurotransmitter release, and electrolyte disturbances. The contribution of magnesium deficiency to the induction of cortical depression or abnormal glutamatergic neurotransmission is a likely mechanism of the magnesiumCmigraine relationship. Hence, there is interest in various methods of assessing magnesium ion deficiency and attempts to study the relationship of its intra- and extracellular levels with the induction of migraine attacks. At the same time, many clinicians believe that magnesium supplementation in the right dose and form can be a treatment to prevent migraine attacks, especially in those patients who have identified contraindications to standard medications or their different preferences. However, there are no reliable publications confirming the role of magnesium deficiency in the diet as a factor causing migraine attacks. It also seems interesting to deepen the research on the administration of high doses of magnesium intravenously during migraine attacks. The aim of the study was to discuss the probable mechanisms of correlation of magnesium deficiency with migraine, as well as to present the current clinical proposals for the use of various magnesium preparations in complementary or substitute pharmacotherapy of migraine.

Employing panel data techniques, and distinguishing between Islamic and conventional banks, we show that banks tend to hold higher capital ratios when operating in a more competitive environment. We also provide evidence that banks in the MENA region increase their capitalization levels in response to a higher risk and vice versa. Further, banking concentration (measured by the HH-index) and credit risk have a significant and positive impact on capital ratios of IBs, whereas competition does play a restrictive role in determining the level of their capital.

The objective of this study was to summarize the adverse drug events (ADEs) associated with HCQ, CQ, and AZM use during the national COVID-19 emergency and compare the results with known adverse reactions listed in the drugs' package inserts. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used. The publicly available Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System quarterly data extract files from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 were downloaded. A disproportionality analysis was conducted using the proportional reporting ratio to identify possible ADE signals. A Poisson regression was used to assess if the number of ADE reports for the 3 drugs increased over time. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant increasing trend in the reported ADEs for both HCQ (P < 0.001) and AZM (P < 0.001). Before the declaration of the national emergency, there were 592 reported drug-ADE pairs for the 3 drugs compared with 2492 drug-ADE pairs reported after March 13, 2020. These 2492 drug-ADE pairs represented 848 ADEs across the 3 drugs, of which 114 (13.4%) were identified as potential signals including 55 (48.2%) that were not listed in the prescribing information. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the reported ADEs for HCQ and AZM have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Differences were observed in both the type of and frequency of the highest reported ADEs for the 3 selected drugs before and after the national emergency declaration.

Whether Alzheimer disease has an impact on the outcomes of critically ill patients remains unclear; therefore, we conducted this study to evaluate comorbid Alzheimer disease in patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). MATERIAL/METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III database, version 1.4. Patients were divided into an Alzheimer disease group and a non-Alzheimer disease group. Differences in all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, mechanical ventilation rate, and mechanical ventilation duration were analyzed. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to compensate for differences in baseline characteristics. The differences in prognosis were compared between groups after PSM. Survival analyses in patients were performed and Cox regression analyses were used to predict prognoses. RESULTS: We included 33 935 patients, among which 433 patients were comorbid with Alzheimer disease. After PSM, there were no significant differences in 7-day mortality, but there were significant differences in 28-day mortality (P=0.047) and 90-day mortality (P=0.012) between the 2 groups. There was also a significant difference in the 4-year cumulative survival between the 2 groups (P<0.001).

In comparison with other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS, the mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is lower but the transmissibility is higher. Immune dysregulation is the most common feature of the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 that leads to hyperinflammation. Micronutrients such as zinc are essential for normal immune function. According to the assessment of WHO, approximately one-third of the world's society suffer from zinc deficiency. Low plasma levels of zinc are associated with abnormal immune system functions such as impaired chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and phagocytosis, dysregulated intracellular killing, overexpression of the inflammatory cytokines, lymphopenia, decreased antibody production, and sensitivity to microbes especially viral respiratory infections. Zinc exerts numerous direct and indirect effects against a wide variety of viral species particularly RNA viruses. The use of zinc and a combination of zinc-pyrithione at low concentrations impede SARS-CoV replication in vitro. Accordingly, zinc can inhibit the elongation step of RNA transcription. Furthermore, zinc might improve antiviral immunity by up-regulation of IFN&#945; through JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway in leukocytes. On the other hand, zinc supplementation might ameliorate tissue damage caused by mechanical ventilation in critical COVID-19 patients. Finally, zinc might be used in combination with antiviral medications for the management of COVID-19 patients. In the current review article, we review and discuss the immunobiological roles and antiviral properties as well as the therapeutic application of zinc in SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses infections.","output":"Immunopharmacological perspective on zinc in SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The benefit of using the laparoscopic approach in minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) has not been established. We therefore compared the outcome of esophagectomy for patients with esophageal cancer performed with open surgery, video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)/laparotomy (hybrid MIE), and VATS/ laparoscopy (total MIE). METHODS Patients with esophageal cancer undergoing tri-incisional esophagectomy with three different approaches between 2005 and 2009 were analyzed from a prospective database. RESULTS Three groups of patients underwent esophagectomy by open surgery (n = 64), hybrid MIE (n = 44), and total MIE (n = 30). The total MIE group had significantly longer operative times but had shorter postoperative ventilator usage times postoperative hospital stay, and they began jejunostomy feeding sooner (P < 0.05, compared with the other groups). There was a significant trend toward a decrease in postoperative pulmonary complications and anastomotic leakage in parallel to the proportion of minimally invasive procedures for esophagectomy (P < 0.05 for the trend test), with a significant difference between the open surgery and total MIE groups (30% vs. 6.7%, and 28% vs. 6.7%, respectively; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Use of a laparoscopic procedure in MIE for patients with esophageal cancer might provide benefit by facilitating postoperative recovery and reducing the rates of post-esophagectomy pulmonary complications and anastomotic leakage.","output":"Is there any benefit to incorporating a laparoscopic procedure into minimally invasive esophagectomy?

Underlying low-grade inflammation (LGI) has been theorized as one of its pathophysiological mechanisms. We aimed to investigate a possible relationship between PCS and an increase in inflammation markers, in a sex-stratified analysis. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS Mild cases of COVID-19 according to the WHO classification followed-up in a Primary Care Center, were included. We collected epidemiological data (age, sex, body mass index -BMI-, smoking, and comorbidities -Charlson index-), variables of the acute COVID-19 episode, and data at 3 months of follow-up (clinical manifestations and inflammatory markers). Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, fibrinogen, and D-dimer levels were analyzed. Low-grade inflammation (LGI) was defined as serum CRP between >0.3 and <1.0 mg/dL. Five composite indices were built combining the upper ranges of 4 markers. Bivariate and multivariate analyses (logistic regression and general linear models) were performed, stratified by sex. RESULTS We analyzed 121 subjects with mild COVID-19 (56.2% women; mean age 46 years). The most common symptom in the acute episode was fever (60.3%), while it was fatigue in PCS (42.8%). Prevalence of PCS was 35.8% in women and 20.8% in men (p = 0.07). In women, after controlling for age, BMI, smoking, and comorbidities, the D1, D3, and D4 indices were consistently associated with PCS, with ORs of 5.14 (95% CI, 1.6-16.4), 4.20 (95% CI, 1.3- 13.3), and 4.12 (95% CI, 1.3-13.1), respectively; in patients with post-COVID anosmia and ageusia, neutrophils were significantly elevated (3.43 {+/-} 0.3 vs 2.58 {+/-} 0.1; p = 0.014, and 3.89 {+/-}0.3 vs 2.59 {+/-} 0.1; p = 0.002, respectively), after adjusting for confounders. In men, the D2 and D5 indices were associated with PCS, with adjusted ORs of 10.1 (95% CI, 1.2- 85) and 17.5 (95% CI, 2-153), respectively; furthermore, serum CRP in the LGI range was associated with PCS [adjusted OR=12.9 (95% CI, 1.3-121)], and in post-COVID persistent fatigue, the neutrophil count was significantly elevated (4.68 {+/-} 0.6 vs 3.37 {+/-} 0.1; p = 0.041), after controlling for confounders. CONCLUSIONS Consistent associations among PCS, anosmia, ageusia, and fatigue, with slight -but significant- elevated levels of inflammatory markers, have been observed. The neutrophil count was the most frequently involved marker. Sex-stratified analyses showed relevant differences between women and men concerning PCS and serum inflammatory markers.","output":"POST-COVID-19 SYNDROME, INFLAMMATORY MARKERS AND SEX DIFFERENCES"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nursing students represent the future of nursing.

Although the relationship between these two concepts has been studied in the workplace, less is known about the links of servant leadership and spirituality among nursing students. Data from 66 student participants were analyzed using the Servant Leadership and Spirituality Scales. The results indicated nursing students had relatively high levels of spirituality and servant leadership. A significant positive association was found between overall servant leadership and spirituality scores. Servant leadership characteristics increased from Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) to Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) program students, but then decreased among the doctoral students. A decline in servant leadership was also demonstrated in nurses in practice greater than 10 years. Spirituality scores declined slightly in nurses early years of practice, then rebounded and continued to progress with increased years of practice.

This sudden widespread shift to home-based teleworking was not anticipated. Consequently, the ability to make provisions to ensure the health and safety of workers was limited. Further, in many cases, the shift to working at home has been involuntary and likely to continue for an extended period. The study presented in this paper aimed to examine the health and well-being experiences in a sample of professional/managerial workers who were engaged in teleworking as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic situation developed. Data were collected from workers in the Australian construction industry who were required to work from home on alternate weeks to reduce the number of people in project offices. A multiwave survey was conducted at three construction projects. Longitudinal analysis of the data indicated a consistent gradual decline in the mental well-being of participants. The analysis identified a positive and significant relationship between work-life satisfaction and mental well-being and indicated that the effects of work hours, work pressure, work engagement, and work-life interference on mental well-being were mediated by the extent to which participants were satisfied with their work-life balance. Combining these results with qualitative comments made by participants helped to understand their varying experiences during the pandemic and the impact on their mental well-being. The results highlight the importance of considering work-life satisfaction and creating opportunities for improved work-family balance when designing teleworking arrangements.

The skewed readmission time distribution coupled with delay in health information exchange among healthcare providers might offer a limited time to devise a comprehensive intervention plan. However, pediatric readmission studies are thus far limited to the development of the prediction model after hospital discharges. In this study, we proposed a novel pediatric readmission prediction model at the time of hospital admission which can improve the high-risk patient selection process. We also compared proposed models with the standard at-discharge readmission prediction model. Using the Hospital Cost and Utilization Project database, this prognostic study included pediatric hospital discharges in Florida from January 2016 through September 2017. Four machine learning algorithmslogistic regression with backward stepwise selection, decision tree, Support Vector machines (SVM) with the polynomial kernel, and Gradient Boostingwere developed for at-admission and at-discharge models using a recursive feature elimination technique with a repeated cross-validation process. The performance of the at-admission and at-discharge model was measured by the area under the curve. The performance of the at-admission model was comparable with the at-discharge model for all four algorithms. SVM with Polynomial Kernel algorithms outperformed all other algorithms for at-admission and at-discharge models. Important features associated with increased readmission risk varied widely across the type of prediction model and were mostly related to patients demographics, social determinates, clinical factors, and hospital characteristics. Proposed at-admission readmission risk decision support model could help hospitals and providers with additional time for intervention planning, particularly for those targeting social determinants of childrens overall health.","output":"Identifying Children at Readmission Risk: At-Admission versus Traditional At-Discharge Readmission Prediction Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a previous study, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\\\\CoV) was cultured in the presence of bananin, an effective adamantane\\\\related molecule with antiviral activity.

METHODS: A prospective Swedish nationwide study of patients who undergone surgery for esophageal cancer between 2013 and 2019. Telephone interviews were conducted 5 weeks and 13 weeks after the introduction of social distancing recommendations. The participants responded to a few scales and items from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30. Regression models adjusted for potential confounders were used to examine mean score differences (MSD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) between compliance with the recommendations and HRQL. RESULTS: In total, 134 individuals participated in the study. At 5 weeks, a reduction in role function was seen for individuals who fully (MSD -8, 95% CI: -16 to 0) and to a large extent (MSD -19, 95% CI: -26 to -12) complied with the recommendations. Less fatigue (MSD 9, 95% CI: 3-15) was also detected for this group. Being female, elderly, having comorbidities, living in a region with higher COVID-19 incidence, living in a villa, and being considered as an at-risk person were related to changes in role function.

The primary aims were to assess (1) the degree of involvement of UC patients, (2) the clinical disease course and the adherence to therapy and (3) the impact of the UC on health status. The secondary aim was to evaluate the degree of patient satisfaction. Materials and methods: The study design was to prospectively enrol twenty adult UC patients with quiescent or mild to moderate disease. They received a tablet for 6 months through which questionnaires about adherence to therapy and UC-related symptoms were periodically administered. The health-related quality of life was assessed through the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ). The Satisfaction Questionnaire was sent at the baseline and then every three months. Patients also received educational and motivational messages related to bowel disease. Results: Patients received the tablets in June 2020 and all of them completed the study. Demographics and clinical characteristics of the participants are shown in Table 1. Eighty percent of patients regularly used the device and more than 95% answered all questionnaires at least once. The compilation rate was inversely proportional to the frequency of administration (from 54% of the weekly ones up to 80% of the quarterly Satisfaction Questionnaires). Thirteen patients completed at least two questionnaires on UC-related symptoms per month. Among them, 31% maintained clinical remission, 38% achieved clinical remission, 15% had persistent disease activity and 16% experienced disease flare.

CONCLUSION: Implementation of an app-based, EHR-integrated ICP in BC survivors was feasible and created minimal provider burden; however, patient engagement was below the feasibility threshold suggesting that changes may enhance broad implementation and adoption. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: An ICP may facilitate remote monitoring, symptom control, and recurrence surveillance for cancer survivors as strategies to enhance patient engagement are applied.

Since then, tireless efforts have been made to mitigate the spread of the disease and its impact, and these efforts have mostly relied on nonpharmaceutical interventions. By December 2020, the safety and efficacy of the first COVID-19 vaccines were demonstrated. The large social media platform Twitter has been used by medical researchers for the analysis of important public health topics, such as the public's perception on antibiotic use and misuse and human papillomavirus vaccination. The analysis of Twitter-generated data can be further facilitated by using Twitter's built-in, anonymous polling tool to gain insight into public health issues and obtain rapid feedback on an international scale. During the fast-paced course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Twitter polling system has provided a viable method for gaining rapid, large-scale, international public health insights on highly relevant and timely SARS-CoV-2-related topics. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to understand the public's perception on the safety and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines in real time by using Twitter polls. METHODS: We developed 2 Twitter polls to explore the public's views on available COVID-19 vaccines. The surveys were pinned to the Digital Health and Patient Safety Platform Twitter timeline for 1 week in mid-February 2021, and Twitter users and influencers were asked to participate in and retweet the polls to reach the largest possible audience. RESULTS: The adequacy of COVID-19 vaccine safety (ie, the safety of currently available vaccines; poll 1) was agreed upon by 1579 out of 3439 (45.9%) Twitter users. In contrast, almost as many Twitter users (1434/3439, 41.7%) were unsure about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Only 5.2% (179/3439) of Twitter users rated the available COVID-19 vaccines as generally unsafe. Poll 2, which addressed the question of whether users would undergo vaccination, was answered affirmatively by 82.8% (2862/3457) of Twitter users, and only 8% (277/3457) categorically rejected vaccination at the time of polling. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the perceived high level of uncertainty about the safety of the available COVID-19 vaccines, we observed an elevated willingness to undergo vaccination among our study sample. Since people's perceptions and views are strongly influenced by social media, the snapshots provided by these media platforms represent a static image of a moving target. Thus, the results of this study need to be followed up by long-term surveys to maintain their validity. This is especially relevant due to the circumstances of the fast-paced pandemic and the need to not miss sudden rises in the incidence of vaccine hesitancy, which may have detrimental effects on the pandemic's course.","output":"People's Willingness to Vaccinate Against COVID-19 Despite Their Safety Concerns: Twitter Poll Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Child abuse appears to be on the increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the extent that lockdown measures modified the association between stress and abuses has not been systematically assessed. Objectives: To assess: 1) the association between caregiver's stress and self-reported verbal abuse and corporal punishment of a child in the household, and; 2) modification of the stated association by experienced COVID-19 lockdown measures. Participants and settings: Caregivers residing in villages on lockdown in the Deep South of Thailand (n=466 participants) Methods: We randomly sampled 12 villages in the study area, and 40 households per village. Trained enumerators who were residents of the sampled villages collected the data using phone-based interview. We measured stress level using the standard ST-5 questionnaire. We developed and pilot-tested questions for measurement of child abuse and lockdown experiences specifically for this study. Results: Caregivers with moderate and higher levels of stress were more likely than caregivers with low level of stress to report verbal abuse (48% vs. 23%, respectively; Adj. OR = 3.12, 95% CI = 1.89, 5.15) and corporal punishment (28% vs. 8%, respectively; Adj. OR = 2.76, 95% CI = 1.41, 5.42). We found that COVID-19 lockdown experiences modified the associations between stress and verbal abuse and corporal punishment. Conclusion: There were associations between stress and abuses, which were modified by lockdown experiences. However, social desirability, lack of details in the answers, and potential confounding by mental illness co-morbidities were notable limitations of the study.

Within its institutions, continuous criteria of efficiency facilitate the evaluation of the impact of the reforms and policies on the banks' performance. In this paper, we employ the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) method for estimating the efficiency of Islamic banks in developed and developing countries. MARS is a well-known efficient method for the flexible modelling of high-dimensional data. Unlike previous work, using a nonparametric technique of such a robustness instead of parametric approaches contributes to the improvement of the various estimates, which provides investors with accurate and timely information they can immediately react upon for a better decision-making in turbulent times. On the one hand, the results of the experiments show that, in the emerging region, there is evidence of a strong linkage between Islamic banking efficiency and gross domestic product. On the other hand, in the developed region, the efficiency is rather based upon Sharia Supervisory Board and board committees. These outcomes confirm previous works showing that governance-related variables have a significant positive effect on Islamic banking efficiency.

Yet health advocacy requires alternative methods to reach key stakeholders to drive change. The purpose of this study was to analyze the impact of social media and public narrative for advocacy in matters of firearm-related injury and death. STUDY DESIGN: The movement This Is Our Lane was evaluated through the #ThisIsOurLane and #ThisIsMyLane hashtags. Sources were assessed from November 2018 through March 2019. Analyses specifically examined message volume, time course, global engagement, and content across Twitter, scientific literature, and mass media. Twitter data were analyzed via Symplur Signals. Scientific literature reviews were performed using PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Mass media was compiled using Access World News/Newsbank, Newspaper Source, and Google. RESULTS: A total of 507,813 tweets were shared using #ThisIsOurLane, #ThisIsMyLane, or both (co-occurrence 21C39%). Fifteen scientific items and n = 358 mass media publications were published during the study period; the latter included articles, blogs, television interviews, petitions, press releases, and audio interviews/podcasts. Peak messaging appeared first on Twitter on November 10(th), followed by mass media on November 12(th) and 20(th), and scientific publications during December. CONCLUSIONS: Social media enables clinicians to quickly disseminate information about a complex public health issue like firearms to the mainstream media, scientific community, and general public alike. Humanized data resonates with people and has the ability to transcend the barriers of language, culture, and geography.

A total of 86 interviews (TH: n = 28; MY: n = 18; IT: n = 20; UK: n = 20) were conducted with members of the public, including healthcare workers (n = 13). Participants across countries held strong views on government imposed NPIs, with many feeling measures lacked clarity. Most participants reported primarily negative impacts of NPIs on their lives, including through separation, isolation and grief over missed milestones; work-related challenges and income loss; and poor mental health and wellbeing. Nonetheless, many also experienced inadvertent positive consequences, including more time at home to focus on what they most valued in life; a greater sense of connectedness; and benefits to working life. Commonly employed coping strategies focused on financial coping (e.g. reducing spending); psycho-emotional coping (e.g. engaging in spiritual practices); social coping and connectedness (e.g., maintaining relationships remotely); reducing and mitigating risks (e.g., changing food shopping routines); and limiting exposure to the news (e.g., checking news only occasionally). Importantly, the extent to which participants lived experiences were positive or negative, and their ability to cope was underpinned by individual, social and economic factors, with the analysis indicating some salient differences across countries and participants. In order to mitigate negative and unequal impacts of NPIs, COVID-19 policies will benefit from paying closer attention to the social, cultural and psychologicalnot just biologicalvulnerabilities to, and consequences of public health measures.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions on the lived experiences of people living in Thailand, Malaysia, Italy and the United Kingdom: A cross-country qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review aims to establish the current knowledge on Corona viruses by highlighting the recent progress that has been made and comparing it to previous knowledge Good progress has been made but much still remains unknown and this review has identified some gaps in the current knowledge and made suggestions for consideration in future research Corona viruses are important human and animal pathogens Corona viruses (CoVs) are a large group of enveloped viruses with a single-strand RNA genome, which continuously circulate in mammals and birds and pose a threat to livestock, companion animals, and humans CoVs harboured by avian species are classified to the genera gamma- and delta corona viruses During epidemics, they are the cause of up to one-third of community-acquired upper respiratory tract infections in adults and probably also play a role in severe respiratory infections in both children and adults Corona viruses (CoVs) primarily cause enzootic infections in birds and mammals but, in the last few decades, have shown to be capable of infecting humans as well The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and, more recently, Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has demonstrated the lethality of CoVs when they cross the species barrier and infect humans A renewed interest in corona viral research has led to the discovery of several novel human CoVs and since then much progress has been made in understanding the CoV life cycle Recent studies have expanded on its structural motifs and topology, its functions as an ion-channelling viroporin, and its interactions with both other CoV proteins and host cell proteins The most progress has been made on SARS-CoV E, highlighting specific structural requirements for its functions in the CoV life cycle as well as mechanisms behind its pathogenesis Data shows that E is involved in critical aspects of the viral life cycle and that CoVs lacking E make promising vaccine candidates","output":"Corona Viruses - Current Knowledge - A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Standard assays used for influenza serology present certain practical issues, such as inter-laboratory variability, complex protocols and the necessity for handling certain virus strains in high biological containment facilities.

In this study we generated an equine influenza pseudotyped lentivirus for serological screening.

There is limited evidence on the impact of COVID-19 and its related school closures and disease-containment measures on the psychosocial wellbeing of children; little research has been done on the characteristics of vulnerable groups and factors that promote resilience. METHODS: We conducted a large-scale cross-sectional population study of Hong Kong families with children aged 2-12 years. Parents completed an online survey on family demographics, child psychosocial wellbeing, functioning and lifestyle habits, parent-child interactions, and parental stress during school closures due to COVID-19. We used simple and multiple linear regression analyses to explore factors associated with child psychosocial problems and parental stress during the pandemic. RESULTS: The study included 29,202 individual families; of which 12,163 had children aged 2-5 years and 17,029 had children aged 6-12 years. The risk of child psychosocial problems was higher in children with special educational needs, and/or acute or chronic disease, mothers with mental illness, single-parent families, and low-income families. Delayed bedtime and/or inadequate sleep or exercise duration, extended use of electronic devices were associated with significantly higher parental stress and more psychosocial problems among pre-schoolers.

This study assesses the general mental health and immediate psychological impacts in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Method: In this cross-sectional study, 88 patients from two tertiary hospitals in Tehran agreed to complete the surveys. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and 12 item General Health questionnaire (GHQ-12) were used to evaluate mental health and impact of disease. Epidemiological and sociodemographic information entailing underlying diseases was assess by a researcher-made questionnaire. Results: We found that the psychological impact of the current pandemic is mild to moderate. During the initial phase of the pandemic, the intellectual engagements, inducing post event stress is not yet entirely developed. However, patients had a moderate to high probability of psychiatric morbidity with 63.6% and 28.4%, respectively. Conclusion: The effect of such viral pandemic on mental health is inevitable. As we conducted the study in the dire times of the outbreak, patients showed a high probability of psychiatric morbidity. On the other hand, since the study was done in the initial phase of the epidemic, we detected mild effects of the epidemic on PTSD in COVID-19 patients.

Airway management has been particularly difficult; the challenge of quickly establishing an airway in patients must be balanced by the risk of aerosolizing respiratory secretions and putting the provider at risk of infection. Significant attention has been given to developing protocols for the emergency department and critical care units, but little guidance regarding establishing airway and respiratory support for patients in the prehospital setting has been made available. While some of the recommendations can be extrapolated from hospital guidelines, other factors such as environment and available resources make these protocols unfeasible.

Methods: Data from 143 COVID-19 patients over 65 years of age admitted to the Humanitas Clinical and Research Center Emergency Department (Milan, Italy) and treated with Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or Darunavir/cobicistat (DVR/c) associated to Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were retrospectively analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed by using a logistic regression model and survival analysis to assess the role of different predictors of in-hospital mortality, including an early (<6 days from symptoms onset) vs. late treatment onset, signs and symptoms at COVID-19 presentation, type of antiviral treatment (LPV/r or DVR/c) and patients age (65C80 vs. >80 years old). Results: Multivariate analysis showed that an older age (OR: 2.54) and dyspnea as presenting symptom (OR: 2.01) were associated with higher mortality rate, whereas cough as presenting symptom (OR: 0.53) and a timely drug administration (OR: 0.44) were associated with lower mortality. Survival analysis demonstrated that the timing of drug administration had an impact on mortality in 65C80 years-old patients (p = 0.02), whereas no difference was seen in those >80 years-old. This impact was more evident in patients with dyspnea as primary symptom of COVID-19, in whom mortality decreased from 57.1% to 38.3% due to timely drug administration (OR: 0.5; p = 0.04). Conclusions: There was a significant association between the use of a combined antiviral regimen and HCQ and lower mortality, when timely-administered, in COVID-19 patients aged 65C80 years.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with SUD are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency; this relates to frequent fractures and proximal myopathy. The coronavirus pandemic brought vitamin D into focus. Local guidelines advise that patients at high risk of vitamin D deficiency are offered replacement. There were no local data on vitamin D deficiency prevalence or any mention of patients with SUD in local vitamin D guidelines. The main aim of this project was to offer vitamin D checks and replacement to all appropriate patients. RESULTS: We collected data on 207 patients, [pilot study (n=50) and two subsequent samples (n=95 and n=62)]. Our pilot study showed that no patients were offered vitamin D testing or replacement. We then offered vitamin D checks to 95 patients. Most had low vitamin D (30 patients were vitamin D deficient and 26 were vitamin D insufficient). We provided vitamin D replacement and follow-up advice. Quality improvement was demonstrated 6 months later. We collected data on a further 62 patients who were all on our current or recent caseload. Following exclusions, nearly half (48%) of patients had had a vitamin D check. Almost all of these (95%) had low vitamin D (60% being classified as deficient). CONCLUSIONS: Patients had not been offered vitamin D replacement despite often having multiple risk factors for vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D checks (and subsequent replacement) rose in frequency since the outset of this project. Local guidelines should add SUD as a risk factor for vitamin D deficiency. Hospital admission provides a rich opportunity to offer this simple intervention to patients who are often poorly engaged with community services.","output":"Golden opportunity for intervention?

Various studies have postulated that there is a complex interplay of mediators of coagulation and inflammation responsible for the pathogenesis of COVID-19. We did this study on coagulation parameters and inflammatory markers and their effect on outcome in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a single centre observational cross-sectional study. Procoagulants [Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), D-dimer, lupus anticoagulant (LA), fibrinogen, factor-VIII (F-VIII)]; anticoagulants [protein-C (PC), protein-S (PS), antithrombin] and inflammatory markers [interleukin-6 (IL-6) and highly sensitive - C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)] were measured at the time of hospitalization and correlated with the severity of the disease. RESULTS: A total of 230 patients were enrolled, of which 61.3%, 20.0%, and 18.7% had asymptomatic/ mild, moderate, or severe disease, respectively. COVID-19 disease severity was associated with rising trends with coagulation parameters (PT, APTT, D-Dimer; p value 0.01, <0.0001, <0.0001, respectively). Falling trends of anticoagulant (PC, Antithrombin; p value <0.0001, 0.003 respectively) and rising trends of procoagulant (fibrinogen, F-VIII; p value 0.004, <0.0001 respectively) were observed with increasing COVID-19 disease severity. Multivariate logistic regression analysis found that advanced age, D-Dimer, and hs-CRP (p value 0.035, 0.018, <0.0001 respectively) were independent predictors of mortality in COVID-19. Procoagulant parameters (D-dimer, APTT, Factor VIII) were positively correlated with anticoagulant parameters (PC and PS) and inflammatory parameters (hs-CRP). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed increased levels of coagulation and inflammatory parameters, which correlated with the severity of COVID-19. Age, D-dimer, IL-6, hs-CRP, APTT, fibrinogen, and Factor VIII were significantly higher in patients with moderate and severe disease as compared to asymptomatic/mild disease.

This vaccine uses the next-generation hAd5 [E1-, E2b-, E3-] platform previously used successfully in cancer patients with pre-existing adenovirus immunity, engineered to express both SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein modified to improve the generation of neutralizing antibodies to block entry of the virus, and nucleocapsid (N) protein with an Enhanced T cell Stimulation Domain (ETSD) to activate CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to clear the virus and block replication by killing infected cells. The targeting of N to endosomes and lysosomes to enhance CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses distinguishes our vaccine. In our previously reported pre-clinical studies we showed that in mice, the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine elicits both humoral and T-cell responses that are robust and T helper cell 1 (Th1) dominant. Here we report that the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine is recognized by anti-sera and T cells from previously SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, and that the presence of N is vital for T-cell recall. The findings presented herein: i. demonstrate specific recognition of hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD infected cells by plasma antibodies from previously SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, but not antibodies from virus-naive subjects; ii. show enhanced binding of plasma SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from previously infected patients to monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) expressing the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine as compared to hAd5 S-Fusion alone; iii. reveal N-ETSD localizes to vesicles associated with MHC class II antigen presentation, including endosomes, lysosomes, and autophagosomes in MoDCs; iv. demonstrate endosome/lysosome-targeted N-ETSD elicits higher interferon-gamma T-cell responses than cytoplasm-localized N; and v. N-ETSD alone or in the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD construct induces both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell memory recall. This recognition of hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine antigens by T cells from previously SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, together with the ability of this vaccine candidate to elicit de novo immune responses in naive mice suggests that it re-capitulates the natural immune response to SARS-CoV-2 to activate both B and T cells towards viral neutralization and recognition of infected cells, critical for prevention of COVID-19 disease. Intriguingly, our hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD T-cell biased vaccine has the potential to not only provide protection for uninfected individuals, but also to be utilized as a therapeutic for already infected patients to induce rapid clearance of the virus by activating T cells to kill the virus-infected cells, thereby reducing viral replication and lateral transmission.","output":"Th1 Dominant Nucleocapsid and Spike Antigen-Specific CD4+ and CD8+ Memory T Cell Recall Induced by hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD Infection of Autologous Dendritic Cells from Patients Previously Infected with SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurological disease that starts at a focal point and gradually spreads to other parts of the nervous system. One of the main clinical symptoms of ALS is muscle weakness. To study spreading patterns of muscle weakness, we analyze spatiotemporal binary muscle strength data, which indicates whether observed muscle strengths are impaired or healthy. We propose a hidden Markov model-based approach that assumes the observed disease status depends on two latent disease states. The model enables us to estimate the incidence rate of ALS disease and the probability of disease state transition. Specifically, the latter is modeled by a logistic autoregression in that the spatial network of susceptible muscles follows a Markov process. The proposed model is flexible to allow both historical muscle conditions and their spatial relationships to be included in the analysis. To estimate the model parameters, we provide an iterative algorithm to maximize sparse-penalized likelihood with bias correction, and use the Viterbi algorithm to label hidden disease states. We apply the proposed approach to analyze the ALS patients' data from EMPOWER Study.","output":"A binary hidden Markov model on spatial network for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disease spreading pattern analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation (AF) can be a cause of previously diagnosed cryptogenic stroke. However, AF can be paroxysmal and asymptomatic, thereby making detection with routine ECG methods difficult. Oral anticoagulation is highly effective in reducing recurrent stroke in patients with AF, but its initiation is dependent on the detection of AF. Cryptogenic Stroke and Underlying Atrial Fibrillation (CRYSTAL AF) is the first randomized study to report the detection of AF in cryptogenic stroke patients using continuous long-term monitoring via insertable cardiac monitors (ICM). METHODS AND RESULTS Patients with prior cryptogenic stroke were randomized to control (n=220) or ICM (n=221) and followed for 36 months. Cumulative AF detection rates in the ICM arm increased progressively during this period (3.7%, 8.9%, 12.4%, and 30.0% at 1, 6, 12, and 36 months, respectively), but remained low in the control arm (3.0% at 36 months). This resulted in oral anticoagulation prescription in 94.7% of ICM patients with AF detected at 6 months, 96.6% at 12 months, and 90.5% at 36 months. Among ICM patients with AF detected, the median time to AF detection was 8.4 months, 81.0% of first AF episodes were asymptomatic, and 94.9% had at least 1 day with >6 minutes of AF. CONCLUSIONS Three-year monitoring by ICM in cryptogenic stroke patients demonstrated a significantly higher AF detection rate compared with routine care. Given the frequency of asymptomatic first episodes and the long median time to detection, these findings highlight the limitations of using traditional AF detection methods. The majority of patients with AF were prescribed oral anticoagulation therapy.

The relationship between the US presidential election cycle and the S&P500 index is examined in this paper. We focus our attention on President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump presidential election cycles, as there is a research gap examining these two presidency periods. A comparative study is limited as Obama served two terms in office while Trump only one. Daily data from January 20, 2009 to November 16, 2020 was analysed. The selected dataset covers Obamas two terms and Trumps single term in office to examine cointegration (long-run relationships) and volatility dynamics exhibited by the S&P500. The study is framed around economic and political uncertainty that was captured by the US Economic Policy Uncertainty index (EPU). The ARDL, the LASSO and the GARCH models were implemented to facilitate the analysis of long-run dynamics, and volatility patterns, and to deal with modelling over parameterisation issues. The results suggest the existence of a long-run relationship for both the Obama and Trump administrations, showing that the EPU index could be connected to the behaviour of the S&P500. The long-term association between political uncertainty and the performance of the S&P500 offers insights into the importance of monitoring market volatility during presidential cycles as investors can generate profit and losses derived of markets reactions to the presidential cycle, suggesting the importance of an active portfolio management strategy during times of election. The research findings indicate low-levels of volatility persistence registered during Obamas second presidential cycle. Higher levels of market uncertainty were identified during the first cycle, results that are not surprising, as the Obamas first term in office was impacted by the global economic and financial crisis. This period was characterised by a delicate economic and financial climate, followed by government active intervention to address the effects of the crisis. In the context of the Trump admin- istration, his single term in office was shaken by the outburst of the global health crisis. Volatility persistence levels exhibited during Obama's first term in office were manifest again towards the end of Trump administration, mirroring the impact of the new health crisis and the administration lack of strategy and incoherent approach to the domestic and international impact of COVID-19.","output":"The Impact of the Obama and Trump Presidential Election Cycles on the S&P500"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conjunctivitis is a commonly encountered condition in ophthalmology clinics throughout the world.

To accurately locate COVID-19 lesions and assist doctors to make the best diagnosis and treatment plan, a deep-supervised ensemble learning network is presented for COVID-19 lesion segmentation in CT images. Methods: Since a large number of COVID-19 CT images and the corresponding lesion annotations are difficult to obtain, a transfer learning strategy is employed to make up for the shortcoming and alleviate the overfitting problem. Based on the reality that traditional single deep learning framework is difficult to extract complicated and varied COVID-19 lesion features effectively that may cause some lesions to be undetected. To overcome the problem, a deep-supervised ensemble learning network is presented to combine with local and global features for COVID-19 lesion segmentation.

The incidence of colorectal cancer in adults younger than 50 years is rising in contrast to the decreasing incidence of this cancer in older adults. People with young-onset colorectal cancer may be at that stage of life in which they are establishing their careers, building relationships with long-term partners, raising children, and assembling a financial base for the future. A qualitative study designed to facilitate triangulation with extant quantitative patient-reported data would contribute the first comprehensive resource for understanding how this distinct patient population experiences health services and the outcomes of care throughout the patient pathway. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to undertake a mixed-methods study of qualitative patient-reported data on young-onset colorectal cancer experiences and outcomes. METHODS: This is a study of web-based unsolicited patient stories recounting experiences of health services and clinical outcomes related to young-onset colorectal cancer. Personal Recollections Organized as Data (PROD) is a novel methodology for understanding patients health experiences in order to improve care. PROD pivots qualitative data collection and analysis around the validated domains and dimensions measured in patient-reported outcome and patient-reported experience questionnaires. PROD involves 4 processes: (1) classifying attributes of the contributing patients, their disease states, their routes to diagnosis, and the clinical features of their treatment and posttreatment; (2) coding texts into the patient-reported experience and patient-reported outcome domains and dimensions, defined a priori, according to phases of the patient pathway; (3) thematic analysis of content within and across each domain; and (4) quantitative text analysis of the narrative content. RESULTS: Relevant patient stories have been identified, and permission has been obtained for use of the texts in primary research. The approval for this study was granted by the Macquarie University Human Research Ethics Committee in June 2020. The analytical framework was established in September 2020, and data collection commenced in October 2020. We will complete the analysis in March 2021 and we aim to publish the results in mid-2021. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study will identify areas for improvement in the PROD methodology and inform the development of a large-scale study of young-onset colorectal cancer patient narratives. We believe that this will be the first qualitative study to identify and describe the patient pathway from symptom self-identification to help-seeking through to diagnosis, treatment, and to survivorship or palliation for people with young-onset colorectal cancer.

Clinically they provide critical guidance to the patient management and therapeutic evaluation. Recently, the biomechanical effects induced by hemodynamic and contractile forces on platelet functions attracted increasing attention. Unfortunately, the existing platelet function tests on the market do not sufficiently incorporate the topical platelet mechanobiology at play. Besides, they are often expensive and bulky systems that require large sample volumes and long processing time. To this end, numerous novel microfluidic technologies emerge to mimic vascular anatomies, incorporate hemodynamic parameters and recapitulate platelet mechanobiology. These miniaturized and cost-efficient microfluidic devices shed light on high-throughput, rapid and scalable platelet function testing, hematological disorder profiling and antiplatelet drug screening. Moreover, the existing antiplatelet drugs often have suboptimal efficacy while incurring several adverse bleeding side effects on certain individuals. Encouraged by a few microfluidic systems that are successfully commercialized and applied to clinical practices, the microfluidics that incorporate platelet mechanobiology hold great potential as handy, efficient, and inexpensive point-of-care tools for patient monitoring and therapeutic evaluation. Hereby, we first summarize the conventional and commercially available platelet function tests. Then we highlight the recent advances of platelet mechanobiology inspired microfluidic technologies.

The richness of various optical and electronic behaviors has made them one of the rapidly rising materials on the horizon of material science and condensed matter physics. Having the sheets of atoms that are stacked in a disorganized manner makes activated carbon being different from other forms of carbon -graphite- structures. The researches about the shielding properties of activated carbon atoms for gamma-rays are very rare and required to be improved. Since the use of radioactive sources in different fields (nuclear industry, shielding material, radiation biophysics and space research application, etc.) has been increasing expeditiously, the photon interactions with matter has gained more importance in the world of material science technology. In this article, we review the basics of the impregnated activated carbons (AC1 and AC2), as well as the link between the structural behaviors and the gamma shielding properties in terms of both quality and efficiency.

In low- and middle-income countries, where resources are often limited, IPC practices are infrequently assessed. AIM: To assess the availability of the core components of World Health Organization (WHO) IPC practices at health facilities in Southwestern Uganda. METHODS: We assessed the availability of WHO IPC core components using a modified WHO Infection Prevention and Control Assessment tool. We determined differences between government versus private ownership and by type of health facility. FINDINGS: We assessed 111 of 224 (50%) health facilities in four districts. The most frequently achieved core component of IPC strategies was environmental cleanliness with 75 of 111 (68%) facilities scoring >85%. The most infrequently achieved core component of IPC strategies was personal protective equipment (PPE) with only one of seven (14%) hospitals and no other facilities scoring >85%. Of the 20 hospital or health center IV facilities, five (25%) received an overall score of >85% compared to only one of 91 (1%) health center II or III facilities (OR 30.0 [95% CI: 3.27-274.99], p=0.003).

The health emergency from Covid-19 has seen health workers on the front line face all the difficulties related to the burden of care and the reorganization of procedures, roles, and tools at the hospital level. One of the most significant and probably underestimated aspects is the psychological stress of frontline nurses. The article aims to analyze the literature relating to the impact on the mental health of nurses engaged in the management and care of Covid-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic review of the published articles on the subject was conducted from January 2020 to November 2020. The search for papers was conducted on scientific databases like PubMed, Scopus and Embase. RESULTS: The results show the onset of anxiety, depression and stress and insomnia in healthcare workers. These aspects are closely related to numerous factors, including the fear of contracting the disease and infecting family members, stressful shifts and little rest, leading to a state of psychological and physical tension capable of activating pathological behaviours. The literature highlights the importance of support interventions for frontline personnel to avoid the onset of psycho-pathophysical severe problems. CONCLUSION: The review suggests that frontline nurses during the emergency phase of Covid- 19 may be prone to psychological disorders that can compromise mental health. Therefore, the surveillance and monitoring of symptoms, together with targeted support interventions, should be guaranteed daily to all professionals involved to prevent the onset of psychological disorders.","output":"[Covid-19 and front-line nurses' mental health: a literature review]./ Covid-19 e salute mentale del personale infermieristico in prima linea: una revisione della letteratura"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tourism activity in Peru has been experiencing significant growth in the last ten years, positioning this economic sector as the third largest contributor to the National Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

RESULTS: Eighty patients were treated during a 4-week period and included in the analysis: 22 (28%) received standard of care only, 20 (25%) patients received lopinavir/ritonavir associated to standard of care, and 38 (47%) patients received hydroxychloroquine and standard of care. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the 3 groups. Treatment escalation occurred in 9 (41%), 10 (50%), and 15 (39%) patients who received standard of care only, standard of care and lopinavir/ritonavir, and standard of care and hydroxychloroquine, respectively (p = 0.567). There was no significant difference between groups regarding the number of ventilator-free days at day 28 and mortality at day 14 and day 28. Finally, there was no significant change between groups in viral respiratory or plasma load between admission and day 7. CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia, no difference was found between hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir as compared to standard of care only on the proportion of patients who needed treatment escalation at day 28. Further randomized controlled trials are required to demonstrate whether these drugs may be useful in this context.","output":"Comparison of hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and standard of care in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia: an opportunistic retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Supplementary lighting is frequently applied in the winter season for crop production in greenhouses. The effect of supplementary lighting on plant growth depends on the balance between assimilate production in source leaves and the overall capacity of the plants to use assimilates. This study aims at quantifying the source-sink balance and carbohydrate content of three tomato cultivars differing in fruit size, and to investigate to what extent the source/sink ratio correlates with the potential fruit size. Cultivars Komeet (large size), Capricia (medium size), and Sunstream (small size, cherry tomato) were grown from 16 August to 21 November, at similar crop management as in commercial practice. Supplementary lighting (High Pressure Sodium lamps, photosynthetic active radiation at 1 m below lamps was 162 mol photons m(-2) s(-1); maximum 10 h per day depending on solar irradiance level) was applied from 19 September onward. Source strength was estimated from total plant growth rate using periodic destructive plant harvests in combination with the crop growth model TOMSIM. Sink strength was estimated from potential fruit growth rate which was determined from non-destructively measuring the fruit growth rate at non-limiting assimilate supply, growing only one fruit on each truss. Carbohydrate content in leaves and stems were periodically determined. During the early growth stage, 'Komeet' and 'Capricia' showed sink limitation and 'Sunstream' was close to sink limitation. During this stage reproductive organs had hardly formed or were still small and natural irradiance was high (early September) compared to winter months. Subsequently, during the fully fruiting stage all three cultivars were strongly source-limited as indicated by the low source/sink ratio (average source/sink ratio from 50 days after planting onward was 0.17, 0.22, and 0.33 for 'Komeet,' 'Capricia,' and 'Sunstream,' respectively). This was further confirmed by the fact that pruning half of the fruits hardly influenced net leaf photosynthesis rates. Carbohydrate content in leaves and stems increased linearly with the source/sink ratio. We conclude that during the early growth stage under high irradiance, tomato plants are sink-limited and that the level of sink limitation differs between cultivars but it is not correlated with their potential fruit size. During the fully fruiting stage tomato plants are source-limited and the extent of source limitation of a cultivar is positively correlated with its potential fruit size.","output":"Quantifying the source-sink balance and carbohydrate content in three tomato cultivars."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this research paper, an analysis is developed on the performance of a hybrid ventilation system that combines Earth-to-Air Heat eXchangers (EAHX), free cooling and evaporative cooling Air Handling Unit Heat eXchanger (AHU-HX), all being controlled by a Building Management System (BMS) in a net Zero Energy Building (nZEB), called LUCIA.

In addition, we observed a rapid fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus which is visible by 6 h and complete by 12 h post-infection. Golgi derived lipid appears to be incorporated into the replication organelle although protein markers are dispersed throughout the infected cell. The mechanism of Golgi disruption is undefined, but chemical disruption of the Golgi apparatus by brefeldin A is inhibitory to viral replication. A search for an individual SARS-CoV-2 protein responsible for this activity identified at least five viral proteins, M, S, E, Orf6, and nsp3, that induced Golgi fragmentation when expressed in eukaryotic cells. Each of these proteins, as well as nsp4, also caused visible changes to ER structure as shown by correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM).

COVID-19 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can develop clinical symptoms that are often confused with the infections of other respiratory pathogens. Sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 with the ability to discriminate from other viruses is urgently needed for COVID-19 diagnosis. Herein, we streamlined a highly efficient CRISPR-Cas12a-based nucleic acid detection platform, termed Cas12a-linked beam unlocking reaction (CALIBURN). We show that CALIBURN could detect SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses and influenza viruses with little cross-reactivity. Importantly, CALIBURN allowed accurate diagnosis of clinical samples with extremely low viral loads, which is a major obstacle for the clinical applications of existing CRISPR diagnostic platforms. When tested on the specimens from SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative donors, CALIBURN exhibited 73.0% positive and 19.0% presumptive positive rates and 100% specificity. Moreover, unlike existing CRISPR detection methods that were mainly restricted to respiratory specimens, CALIBURN displayed consistent performance across both respiratory and nonrespiratory specimens, suggesting its broad specimen compatibility. Finally, using a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we demonstrated that CALIBURN allowed detection of coexisting pathogens without cross-reactivity from a single tissue specimen. Our results suggest that CALIBURN can serve as a versatile platform for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and other respiratory infectious diseases.","output":"Development of a Broadly Applicable Cas12a-Linked Beam Unlocking Reaction for Sensitive and Specific Detection of Respiratory Pathogens Including SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mindfulness has been found to have many positive effects on life outcomes, including mental health and educational achievement.

We infected fully differentiated human nasal epithelium cultures derived from healthy children (1-12 years old), young adults (26-34 years old) and older adults (56-62 years old) with SARS-COV-2 to identify age-related cell-intrinsic differences that may influence viral entry, replication and host defence response. We integrated imaging, transcriptomics, proteomics and biochemical assays revealing age-related changes in transcriptional regulation that impact viral replication, effectiveness of host responses and therapeutic drug targets. Viral load was lowest in infected older adult cultures despite the highest expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry and detection factors. We showed this was likely due to lower expression of hijacked host machinery essential for viral replication. Unlike the nasal epithelium of young adults and children, global host response and induction of the interferon signalling was profoundly impaired in older adults, which preferentially expressed proinflammatory cytokines mirroring the cytokine storm seen in severe COVID-194,5.

These four stages are invasion; primary blockade of antiviral innate immunity; engagement of the viruss protection mechanisms against the factors of adaptive immunity; and acute, long-term complications of COVID-19. The invasion stage entails the recognition of the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 target cell receptors, namely, the main receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, ACE2), its coreceptors, and potential alternative receptors. The presence of a diverse repertoire of receptors allows SARS-CoV-2 to infect various types of cells, including those not expressing ACE2. During the second stage, the majority of the polyfunctional structural, non-structural, and extra proteins SARS-CoV-2 synthesizes in infected cells are involved in the primary blockage of antiviral innate immunity. A high degree of redundancy and systemic action characterizing these pathogenic factors allows SARS-CoV-2 to overcome antiviral mechanisms at the initial stages of invasion. The third stage includes passive and active protection of the virus from factors of adaptive immunity, overcoming of the barrier function at the focus of inflammation, and generalization of SARS-CoV-2 in the body. The fourth stage is associated with the deployment of variants of acute and long-term complications of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2s ability to induce autoimmune and autoinflammatory pathways of tissue invasion and development of both immunosuppressive and hyperergic mechanisms of systemic inflammation is critical at this stage of infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2-Specific Immune Response and the Pathogenesis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 lineages that are more transmissible and resistant to currently approved antibody therapies poses a considerable challenge to the clinical treatment of COVID-19.

We aimed to explore the characteristics and factors associated with ATI during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: We conducted an online survey among PLHIV by convenience sampling through social media between 5 and 17 February 2020. Respondents were asked to report whether they were at risk of ATI (i.e. experienced ATI, risk of imminent ATI, threatened but resolved risk of ATI [obtaining ART prior to interruption]) or were not at risk of ATI associated with the COVID-19 outbreak. PLHIV were also asked to report perceived risk factors for ATI and sources of additional ART. The factors associated with the risk of ATI were assessed using logistic regression. We also evaluated the factors associated with experienced ATI. RESULTS: A total of 5084 PLHIV from 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in mainland China completed the survey, with valid response rate of 99.4%. The median age was 31 years (IQR 27 to 37), 96.5% of participants were men, and 71.3% were men who had sex with men. Over one-third (35.1%, 1782/5084) reported any risk of ATI during the COVID-19 outbreak, including 2.7% (135/5084) who experienced ATI, 18.0% (917/5084) at risk of imminent ATI and 14.4% (730/5084) at threatened but resolved risk. PLHIV with ATI were more likely to have previous interruptions in ART (aOR 8.3, 95% CI 5.6 to 12.3), travelled away from where they typically receive HIV care (aOR 3.0, 95% CI 2.1 to 4.5), stayed in an area that implemented citywide lockdowns or travel restrictions to control COVID-19 (aOR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4 to 4.6), and be in permanent residence in a rural area (aOR 3.7, 95% CI 2.3 to 5.8). CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of PLHIV in China are at risk of ATI during the COVID-19 outbreak and some have already experienced ATI. Correlates of ATI and self-reported barriers to ART suggest that social disruptions from COVID-19 have contributed to ATI. Our findings demonstrate an urgent need for policies and interventions to maintain access to HIV care during public health emergencies.","output":"Antiretroviral treatment interruption among people living with HIV during COVID-19 outbreak in China: a nationwide cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current influenza vaccines, live attenuated or inactivated, do not protect against antigenically novel influenza A viruses (IAVs) of pandemic potential, which has driven interest in the development of universal influenza vaccines. Universal influenza vaccine candidates targeting highly conserved antigens of IAV nucleoprotein (NP) are promising as vaccines that induce T cell immunity, but concerns have been raised about the safety of inducing robust CD8 T cell responses in the lungs. Using a mouse model, we systematically evaluated effects of recombinant adenovirus vectors (rAd) expressing IAV NP (A/NP-rAd) or influenza B virus (IBV) NP (B/NP-rAd) on pulmonary inflammation and function after vaccination and following live IAV challenge. After A/NP-rAd or B/NP-rAd vaccination, female mice exhibited robust systemic and pulmonary vaccine-specific B cell and T cell responses and experienced no morbidity (e.g., body mass loss). Both in vivo pulmonary function testing and lung histopathology scoring revealed minimal adverse effects of intranasal rAd vaccination compared with unvaccinated mice. After IAV challenge, A/NP-rAd-vaccinated mice experienced significantly less morbidity, had lower pulmonary virus titers, and developed less pulmonary inflammation than unvaccinated or B/NP-rAd-vaccinated mice. Based on analysis of pulmonary physiology using detailed testing not previously applied to the question of T cell damage, mice protected by vaccination also had better lung function than controls. Results provide evidence that, in this model, adenoviral universal influenza vaccine does not damage pulmonary tissue. In addition, adaptive immunity, in particular, T cell immunity in the lungs, does not cause damage when restimulated but instead mitigates pulmonary damage following IAV infection. IMPORTANCE Respiratory viruses can emerge and spread rapidly before vaccines are available. It would be a tremendous advance to use vaccines that protect against whole categories of viruses, such as universal influenza vaccines, without the need to predict which virus will emerge. The nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza virus provides a target conserved among strains and is a dominant T cell target. In animals, vaccination to NP generates powerful T cell immunity and long-lasting protection against diverse influenza strains. Concerns have been raised, but not evaluated experimentally, that potent local T cell responses might damage the lungs. We analyzed lung function in detail in the setting of such a vaccination. Despite CD8 T cell responses in the lungs, lungs were not damaged and functioned normally after vaccination alone and were protected upon subsequent infection. This precedent provides important support for vaccines based on T cell-mediated protection, currently being considered for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","output":"Effect of an Adenovirus-Vectored Universal Influenza Virus Vaccine on Pulmonary Pathophysiology in a Mouse Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We analyzed the trends for two important cancers affecting females, breast cancer and cervical cancer, using the Indian cancer registry data and correlated the findings with selected relevant sociodemographic and behavioral indicators.

The efficacy of IIT-SIT in suppressing indoor female Ae. aegypti density (quantified from a generalized linear mixed model showing a statistically significant reduction in treatment versus control areas) was 90.9% a month after initiation of the suppression phase, 47.7% two months after (when number of released males was reduced in 50% to match local abundance), 61.4% four months after (when initial number of released males was re-established), 88.4% five months after and 89.4% at six months after the initiation of the suppression phase. A proportional, but lower, reduction in outdoor female Ae. aegypti was also quantified (range, 50.0C75.2% suppression). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study, the first open-field pilot implementation of Wolbachia IIT-SIT in Mexico and Latin-America, confirms that inundative male releases can significantly reduce natural populations of Ae. aegypti. More importantly, we present successful pilot results of the integration of Wolbachia IIT-SIT within a IVM plan implemented by Ministry of Health personnel.","output":"Pilot trial using mass field-releases of sterile males produced with the incompatible and sterile insect techniques as part of integrated Aedes aegypti control in Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) cDNA clones have been used for the expression of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) genes for immune prevention and control. However, can it be used for the expression of an allogenetic fragment? To answer this question, a BVDV chimeric virus expressing the spike (S) antigen fragment of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was constructed. Antigen S499-602 was inserted into pig-derived BVDV-2 infectious cDNA clone pASH28 in tandem by overlapping PCR, located between the seventh and eighth amino acids at the N-terminus of the capsid (C) protein of BVDV. Indirect immunofluorescence assay confirmed that the chimeric virus vASH-dS312 containing double S499-602 sequences was successfully assembled, which could react with the monoclonal antibody (MAb) against BVDV E2 and PEDV S proteins. Further western blot analysis confirmed that the exogenous S499-602 double protein could be stably expressed. Next, the chimeric virus vASH-dS312 was administered to BALB/C mice either orally or by intramuscular injection. The immunized mice were healthy and showed no signs of toxicity. IgG against BVDV and PEDV antibodies could be detected in the mice administered vASH-dS312 by intramuscular injection, which had neutralization activity against BVDV and PEDV. Thus, this study reported a new insertion site in the BVDV infectious cDNA clone that could successfully express an allogenetic antigen.","output":"Attenuated porcine-derived type 2 bovine viral diarrhea virus as vector stably expressing viral gene."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Depression, one of the most common mental disorders, is up-surging worldwide amid the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, especially among the older population. This study aims to measure prevalent depressive symptoms and its associates among older adults amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out among 1032 older Bangladeshi adults, aged 60 years and above, through telephone interviews in October 2020. We used a semi-structured questionnaire to collect data on participants' socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics, pre-existing medical conditions, and COVID-19-related information. Meanwhile, depressive symptoms were measured using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). The binary logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Two-in-five participants showed depressive symptoms on the GDS-15 scale. Poor socioeconomic characteristic such as low family income, dependency on the family for living, recipient of financial support during the pandemic was associated with higher odds of depressive symptoms. Participants with pre-existing medical conditions had 91% higher odds of depressive symptoms. Social isolation, captured in terms of living alone (aOR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.11-4.01), less frequent communication during pandemic (aOR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.07-2.26), perceived loneliness (aOR = 2.25, 95% CI 1.47-3.45), and isolation from others (aOR = 2.45, 95% CI 1.62-3.70) were associated with higher odds of depressive symptoms.

We aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of combining point-of-care molecular viral test and serum procalcitonin (PCT) level for antibiotic stewardship in the emergency department (ED). Design: A prospective twin-center cohort study was conducted between January 2017 and March 2018. Setting and Participants: Older adult patients who presented to the ED with SARIs received a rapid molecular test for 17 respiratory viruses and a PCT test. Measures: To evaluate the clinical impact, we compared the outcomes of SARI patients between the experimental cohort and a propensity scoreCmatched historical cohort. The primary outcome was the proportion of antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation in the ED. The secondary outcomes included duration of intravenous antibiotics, length of hospital stay, and mortality. Results: A total of 676 patients were included, of which 169 patients were in the experimental group and 507 patients were in the control group. More than one-fourth (27.9%) of the patients in the experimental group tested positive for virus. Compared with controls, the experimental group had a significantly higher proportion of antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation in the ED (26.0% vs 16.1%, P = .007), neuraminidase inhibitor uses (8.9% vs 0.6%, P &lt; .001), and shorter duration of intravenous antibiotics (10.0 vs 14.5 days, P &lt; .001).

These individuals require additional support to achieve good sexual health but the best way to provide this remains needs to be better understood. Methods: We searched for randomised controlled trials of behavioural and psychosocial interventions aimed at promoting sexual health in high-risk young populations. Outcomes of interest were indicators of sexual health (e.g., condom use, attitudes to contraception, knowledge of risk). Participants were under 25 years old and in one of the following high-risk groups: alcohol and other drug use; ethnic minority; homeless; justice-involved; LGBTQI+; mental ill-health; or out-of-home care. Results: Twenty-eight papers from 26 trials met our inclusion criteria, with all but one conducted in North America. Condom use was the most frequently reported outcome measure along with knowledge and attitudes towards sexual health but considerable differences in measures used made comparisons across studies difficult. Change in knowledge and attitudes did not consistently result in long-term change in behaviours. Conclusions: There remains a dearth of research undertaken outside of North America across all high-risk groups of young people. Future interventions should address sexual health more broadly than just the absence of negative biological outcomes, with LGBTQI+, homeless and mental ill-health populations targeted for such work.

This imminent depletion can cause a catastrophic health crisis for maternal health. This study analyzed the post-policy impact of key factors on maternity insurance income inflow and outflow in Jiangsu Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (AR). We applied Paseras ARLD model and VECM Granger Causality Test to establish long- and short-term impact of selected factors that determines the income and expenditure of the maternity insurance fund in the two regions based on data from 2011 to 2019. Our results show that the addition of new births due to the universal two-child policy has increased the per capita utilization of the maternity insurance fund in both areas. We further observed that the impact of the maternity insurance contribution rate to the maternity insurance fund decays with time giving a long-run limited impact in both provinces. Thus the positive impact is stronger in the short term, but in the long term, its influence or contribution to stability of the funds reduces. The positive impact of interest from investment in the maternity insurance fund is however insignificant in both provinces, giving a major cause for concern on its role in maternity insurance fund income generation. In the short term, the contribution rate of the maternity insurance fund must be adjusted upward or the payment base expanded to receive additional contribution from all employees to avoid complete depletion of the fund. In the long term, we recommend the need to replenish the maternity insurance funds through proper investment options for the funds.

Although extensive research has been conducted to identify inhibitors targeting SARS-CoV-2, there are still no effective treatment strategies to combat the COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 comprises two important proteolytic enzymes, namely, the papain-like proteinase, located within non-structural protein 3 (nsp3), and nsp5, both of which cleave large replicase polypeptides into multiple fragments that are required for viral replication. Moreover, a domain within nsp3, known as the macrodomain (Mac1), also plays an important role in viral replication. Inhibition of their function should be able to significantly interfere with the replication cycle of the virus, therefore these key proteins may serve as potential therapeutic targets. The functions of the above viral targets and their corresponding inhibitors have been summarized in the current review.

Little is known about the associations between loneliness and symptom burden in oncology patients before and during the pandemic. Study purposes include determining the prevalence of loneliness in a sample of oncology patients; evaluating for differences in demographic, clinical, and symptom characteristics between lonely and nonlonely patients; and determining which demographic, clinical, and symptom characteristics were associated with membership in the lonely group. METHODS: A convenience sample (n = 606) completed online surveys that evaluated the severity of loneliness, social isolation, and common symptoms (ie, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and pain) in oncology patients. Parametric and nonparametric tests were used to evaluate for differences in scores between the lonely and nonlonely groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine risk factors for membership in the loneliness group. RESULTS: Of the 606 patients, 53.0% were categorized in the lonely group. The lonely group reported higher levels of social isolation, as well as higher symptom severity scores for all of the symptoms evaluated. In the multivariate model, being unmarried, having higher levels of social isolation, as well as higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were associated with membership in the lonely group.

Two radiologists independently evaluated the baseline CXR of the patients using a semi-quantitative score to determine the severity of lung involvement: a score of 0 represented no lung involvement, whereas scores of 1 to 4 represented the first (less severe) to the fourth (more severe) quartiles regarding the severity of lung involvement. Relevant clinical and laboratory data were collected. The outcome of patients was defined as severe if noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or intubation was necessary, or if the patient died. RESULTS: Our sample comprised 140 patients. Most of the patients were symptomatic (132/138; 95.7%), and 133/140 patients (95.0%) presented with opacities on CXR at admission.

However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we investigate whether miRNAs in serum exosomes can exert antiviral functions and affect the response to COVID-19 in the elderly and people with diabetes. First, we identified four miRNAs (miR-7-5p, miR-24-3p, miR-145-5p and miR-223-3p) through high-throughput sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR analysis, that are remarkably decreased in the elderly and diabetic groups. We further demonstrated that these miRNAs, either in the exosome or in the free form, can directly inhibit S protein expression and SARS-CoV-2 replication. Serum exosomes from young people can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and S protein expression, while the inhibitory effect is markedly decreased in the elderly and diabetic patients.

We compared performances of single-use and reusable duodenoscopes in patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). DESIGN Patients with native papilla requiring ERCP were randomised to single-use or reusable duodenoscope. Primary outcome was comparing number of attempts to achieve successful cannulation of desired duct. Secondary outcomes were technical performance that measured duodenoscope manoeuvrability, mechanical-imaging characteristics and ability to perform therapeutic interventions, need for advanced cannulation techniques or cross-over to alternate duodenoscope group to achieve ductal access and adverse events. RESULTS 98 patients were treated using single-use (n=48) or reusable (n=50) duodenoscopes with >80% graded as low-complexity procedures. While median number of attempts to achieve successful cannulation was significantly lower for single-use cohort (2 vs 5, p=0.013), ease of passage into stomach (p=0.047), image quality (p<0.001), image stability (p<0.001) and air-water button functionality (p<0.001) were significantly worse. There was no significant difference in rate of cannulation, adverse events including mortality (one patient in each group), need to cross-over or need for advanced cannulation techniques to achieve ductal access, between cohorts. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, only duodenoscope type (single-use) was associated with less than six attempts to achieve selective cannulation (p=0.012), when adjusted for patient demographics, procedural complexity and type of intervention. CONCLUSION Given the overall safety profile and similar technical performance, single-use duodenoscopes represent an alternative to reusable duodenoscopes for performing low-complexity ERCP procedures in experienced hands.

As such, it is important to examine pandemic-related changes in mental health and to identify which individuals are at greatest risk of worsening symptoms. Methods: Online questionnaires were administered to 34,465 individuals in the UK, recruited from existing cohorts or via social media. Around one third (n = 12,718) with prior diagnoses of depression or anxiety completed pre-pandemic mental health assessments, allowing prospective investigation of symptom change. We examined changes in depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms using prospective, retrospective and global ratings of change assessments. We also examined the effect of key risk factors on changes in symptoms.Outcomes: Prospective analyses showed small decreases in depression (PHQ-9: - .43 points) and anxiety symptoms (GAD-7: -.33 points), and increases in PTSD symptoms (PCL-6: .22 points). Conversely, retrospective analyses demonstrated large significant increases in depression (2.40 points) and anxiety symptoms (1.97 points) and 55% reported worsening mental health since the beginning of the pandemic on a global change rating. Using both prospective and retrospective symptom measures, regression analyses demonstrated that worsening depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms were associated with i) prior mental health diagnoses, ii) female gender;iii) young age, and iv) unemployed or student status.Interpretation: We highlight the effect of prior mental health diagnoses on worsening mental health during the pandemic and confirm previously-reported sociodemographic risk factors. Discrepancies between prospective and retrospective measures of changes in mental health may be related to recall bias underestimating prior symptom severity.","output":"Depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the osseo\\\\integrative behavior of untreated (UCFP) and sandblasted ceramic filled PEEK (SCFP) implants in comparison with titanium implants through measurement of bone implant contact (BIC) and bone density (BD).

It is important to evaluate various types of obesity, such as visceral and sarcopenic obesity. The evidence on the associated risk of CVD, cancer and sarcopenic obesity, including pathophysiological aspects, occurrence, clinical implications and survival, needs further investigation. Sarcopenic obesity is a relatively new term. It is a clinical condition that primarily affects older adults. There are several endocrine-hormonal, metabolic and lifestyle aspects involved in the occurrence of sarcopenic obesity that affect pathophysiological aspects that, in turn, contribute to CVD and neoplasms. However, there is no available evidence on the role of sarcopenic obesity in the occurrence of CVD and cancer and its pathophysiological interplay.

We aimed to compare the clinical and echocardiographic features of a predominantly African American patient cohort hospitalized with acute COVID-19 infection during the first (MarchCJune 2020) and second (SeptemberCDecember 2020) waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to investigate which parameters are most strongly associated with composite all-cause mortality. We performed consecutive transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) on 105 patients admitted with acute COVID-19 infection during the first wave and 129 patients admitted during the second wave. TTE parameters including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS), right ventricular global longitudinal strain (RVGLS), right ventricular free-wall strain (RVFWS), and right ventricular basal diameter (RVBD) were compared between the two groups. Clinical and demographic characteristics including underlying co-morbidities, biomarkers, in-hospital treatment regimens, and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to determine variables associated with all-cause mortality. There were no significant differences between the two waves in terms of age, gender, BMI, or race. Overall all-cause mortality was 35.2% for the first wave compared to 14.7% for the second wave (p < 0.001). Previous medical conditions were similar between the two waves with the exception of underlying lung disease (41.9% vs. 29.5%, p = 0.047). Echocardiographic parameters were significantly more abnormal in the first wave compared to the second: LVGLS (? 17.1  5.0 vs. ? 18.9  4.8, p = 0.02), RVGLS (? 15.7  5.9% vs. ? 19.0  5.9%, p < 0.001), RVFWS (? 19.5  6.8% vs. ? 23.2  6.9%, p = 0.001), and RVBD (4.5  0.8 vs. 3.9  0.7 cm, p < 0.001). Stepwise multivariable logistic analysis showed mechanical ventilation, RVFWS, and RVGLS to be independently associated with mortality. In a predominantly African American patient population on the south side of Chicago, the clinical and echocardiographic features of patients hospitalized with acute COVID-19 infection demonstrated marked improvement from the first to the second wave of the pandemic, with a significant decrease in all-cause mortality. Possible explanations include implementation of evidence-based therapies, changes in echocardiographic practices, and behavioral changes in our patient population.

The OASI Care Bundle was implemented in 16 maternity units in Britain in the OASI1 project (2017-2018), which demonstrated the care bundles effectiveness in reducing OASI rates. In OASI2, the care bundle will be scaled up to 20 additional National Health Service (NHS) maternity units in a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study that will examine the effectiveness of strategies used to introduce, implement and sustain the care bundle. METHODS: OASI2 is a two-arm cluster-randomised control trial (C-RCT) of maternity units in England, Scotland and Wales, with an additional non-randomised study arm. C-RCT arm 1 (peer support, n = 10 units) will be supported by buddy units to implement the OASI Care Bundle. C-RCT arm 2 (lean implementation, n = 10 units) will implement without external support. The additional study arm (sustainability, n = 10 units) will include some original OASI1 units to evaluate the care bundles sustainability and OASI rates over time, from before OASI1 and through the end of OASI2. Units in all three study arms will receive an Implementation Toolkit with training resources and implementation support. The C-RCT arms will be compared in terms of OASI rate reduction (primary effectiveness outcome) and clinicians adoption of the care bundle (primary implementation outcome). Clinical data will be collated from maternity information systems; implementation data will be collected through validated surveys with women and clinicians, supplemented by qualitative methods. Descriptive statistics and regression modelling will be used for analysis. Emergent themes from the qualitative data will be assessed using framework analysis. DISCUSSION: OASI2 will study the impact of various implementation strategies used to introduce and sustain the OASI Care Bundle, and how these strategies affect the bundles clinical effectiveness. The study will generate insights into how to effectively scale-up and sustain uptake and coverage of similar interventions in maternity units. A locally adaptable implementation blueprint will be produced to inform development of future guidelines to prevent perineal trauma.

Many of these engineered viruses are viable and express heterologous proteins at high levels, but the inserted sequences often prove to be unstable over time and are rapidly lost, limiting heterologous protein expression. Although virologists are aware that inserted sequences can be unstable, processes leading to insert instability are rarely considered from an evolutionary perspective. Here, we review experimental work on the stability of inserted sequences over a broad range of viruses, and we present some theoretical considerations concerning insert stability. Different virus genome organizations strongly impact insert stability, and factors such as the position of insertion can have a strong effect. In addition, we argue that insert stability not only depends on the characteristics of a particular genome, but that it will also depend on the host environment and the demography of a virus population. The interplay between all factors affecting stability is complex, which makes it challenging to develop a general model to predict the stability of genomic insertions. We highlight key questions and future directions, finding that insert stability is a surprisingly complex problem and that there is need for mechanism-based, predictive models. Combining theoretical models with experimental tests for stability under varying conditions can lead to improved engineering of viral modified genomes, which is a valuable tool for understanding genome evolution as well as for biotechnological applications, such as gene therapy.","output":"On the stability of sequences inserted into viral genomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given

Reactive results were confirmed using an alternate target region TMA assay. Reactive MPs were tested by TMA after serial dilution to estimate viral load. Testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and infectivity was performed. RESULTS: A total of 17,995 MPs corresponding to approximately 258,000 donations were tested for vRNA. Three confirmed reactive MP16 were identified. The estimated prevalence of vRNA reactive donations was 1.16/100,000 (95% CI 0.40, 3.42). The vRNA-reactive samples were non-reactive for antibody, and the estimated viral loads of the (presumed single) positive donations within each MP ranged from <1000 to <4000 copies/ml. When tested, no infectivity was observed in inoculated permissive cell cultures. DISCUSSION: Blood donation MP-nucleic acid testing (NAT) indicated that SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia is infrequent and, when detected, the vRNA was at low concentrations. Only one RNA-reactive MP could be tested for infectivity for operational reasons and was not infectious in cell culture.

Pairwise analyses indicated higher COVID-19 total and positive test rates per 1000 persons in majority Black and Hispanic vs. majority White ZCTAs (CI [0.117, 4.55]; CI [2.53, 5.14]). Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that higher percentage of Black and Hispanic residents predicted more total COVID-19 tests per 1000 persons (p < 0.05). In contrast, majority Black and Hispanic ZCTAs had fewer licensed and ICU beds (CI [6.50, 124.25]; CI [0.69, 7.16]), with social disadvantage predicting lower licensed and ICU bed access per 1000 persons (p < 0.01). While news reports of inequitable access to COVID-19-related healthcare resources in ethnocultural minority communities have emerged, this is the first study to reveal that social disadvantage may be a major driver of hospital resource inequities in Black and Hispanic communities. Thus, it will be imperative to enact policies that ensure equitable allocation of healthcare resources to socially disadvantaged communities to address current and future public health crises.","output":"COVID-19 treatment resource disparities and social disadvantage in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the co-evolution of viruses and their hosts, the latter have equipped themselves with an elaborate immune system to defend themselves from the invading viruses. In order to establish a successful infection, replicate and persist in the host, viruses have evolved numerous strategies to counter and evade host antiviral immune responses as well as exploit them for productive viral replication. These strategies include those that target immune receptor transmembrane signaling. Uncovering the exact molecular mechanisms underlying these critical points in viral pathogenesis will not only help us understand strategies used by viruses to escape from the host immune surveillance but also reveal new therapeutic targets for antiviral as well as immunomodulatory therapy. In this chapter, based on our current understanding of transmembrane signal transduction mediated by multichain immune recognition receptors (MIRRs) and the results of sequence analysis, we discuss the MIRR-targeting viral strategies of immune evasion and suggest their possible mechanisms that, in turn, reveal new points of antiviral intervention. We also show how two unrelated enveloped viruses, human immunodeficiency virus and human cytomegalovirus, use a similar mechanism to modulate the host immune response mediated by two functionally different MIRRsT-cell antigen receptor and natural killer cell receptor, NKp30. This suggests that it is very likely that similar general mechanisms can be or are used by other viral and possibly nonviral pathogens.","output":"Viral Pathogenesis, Modulation of Immune Receptor Signaling and Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The behavioral immune system is considered to be a psychological adaptation that decreases the risk of infection.

In three studies, we investigated whether two facets of the behavioral immune systemgerm aversion (i.e., aversion to potential pathogen transmission) and perceived infectability (i.e., perceived susceptibility to disease)predicted intentions to accept COVID-19 and influenza vaccination during the pandemic. The behavioral immune system mechanisms were measured before the COVID-19 pandemic in one study, and during the pandemic in two. In contrast to previous research, those with higher germ aversion during the pandemic perceived vaccines to be safer and had higher intentions to accept vaccination. Germ aversion before the pandemic was not associated with vaccination intentions. Individuals who perceived themselves as more susceptible to disease were slightly more willing to accept vaccination. We conjecture that high disease threat reverses the relationship between the behavioral immune system response and vaccination. As the associations were weak, individual differences in germ aversion and perceived infectability are of little practical relevance for vaccine uptake.","output":"The behavioral immune system and vaccination intentions during the coronavirus pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-F adjacent transcript 10 (FAT10) also called ubiquitin D (UBD) is a member of the ubiquitin-like modifier (ULM) family. The FAT10 gene is localized in the MHC class I locus and FAT10 protein expression is mainly restricted to cells and organs of the immune system. In all other cell types and tissues, FAT10 expression is highly inducible by the pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)- and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Besides ubiquitin, FAT10 is the only ULM which directly targets its substrates for degradation by the 26S proteasome. This poses the question as to why two ULMs sharing the proteasome-targeting function have evolved and how they differ from each other. This Review summarizes the current knowledge of the special structure of FAT10 and highlights its differences from ubiquitin. We discuss how these differences might result in differential outcomes concerning proteasomal degradation mechanisms and non-covalent target interactions. Moreover, recent insights about the structural and functional impact of FAT10 interacting with specific non-covalent interaction partners are reviewed.","output":"The ubiquitin-like modifier FAT10 - much more than a proteasome-targeting signal."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amino acid substitutions and deletions in Spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants can reduce the effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In contrast, heterologous polyclonal antibodies raised against S protein, through the recognition of multiple target epitopes, have the potential to maintain neutralization capacities. XAV-19 is a swine glyco-humanized polyclonal neutralizing antibody raised against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Wuhan-Hu-1 Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. XAV-19 target epitopes were found distributed all over the RBD and particularly cover the receptor binding motives (RBM), in direct contact sites with the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2). Therefore, in Spike/ACE2 interaction assays, XAV-19 showed potent neutralization capacities of the original Wuhan Spike and of the United Kingdom (Alpha/B.1.1.7) and South African (Beta/B.1.351) variants. These results were confirmed by cytopathogenic assays using Vero E6 and live virus variants including the Brazil (Gamma/P.1) and the Indian (Delta/B.1.617.2) variants. In a selective pressure study with the Beta strain on Vero E6 cells conducted over 1 month, no mutation was associated with addition of increasing doses XAV-19.

Furthermore, we investigated the risk factors of long COVID in children and adolescents. METHODS: All consecutive children and adolescents who were referred to the hospitals anywhere in Fars province, Iran, from 19 February 2020 until 20 November 2020 were included. All patients had a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. In a phone call to patients/parents, at least 3 months after their discharge from the hospital, we obtained their current status and information if their parents agreed to participate. RESULTS: In total, 58 children and adolescents fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Twenty-six (448%) children/adolescents reported symptoms/complaints of long COVID. These symptoms included fatigue in 12 (21%), shortness of breath in 7 (12%), exercise intolerance in 7 (12%), weakness in 6 (10%), and walking intolerance in 5 (9%) individuals. Older age, muscle pain on admission, and intensive care unit admission were significantly associated with long COVID. CONCLUSIONS: Long COVID is a frequent condition in children and adolescents.

We aimed to review our clinical practice and compare treatment outcomes with published data. METHODS: Clinical data from electronic records were retrospectively reviewed for patients treated with anakinra over the past 6 years for autoinflammatory diseases (AID). RESULTS: From 47 eligible patients (27 female patients), 32 were children. Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) was the indication for anakinra therapy in 42.6% of patients. Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) was the most common underlying diagnosis (19/47) followed by the spectrum of AID. Off-label use was noted in 38.3% patients. Recommended dose was exceeded in 21 children (mean induction dose 5.1, highest dose 29.4 mg/kg/day) and two adults; five patients were treated intravenously. The mean treatment duration for SJIA was 1.4 years, that for AID was 2.2 years, and that for patients with higher anakinra dose was 9.7 (19.3) months. The mean follow-up duration was 2.7 (1.7) years. Treatment was effective in the majority of SJIA and cryopyrinopathy patients as well as those with MAS. Anakinra was well-tolerated without any major adverse effects even in patients with long-term administration of higher than recommended doses including two infants treated with a dose of over 20 mg/kg/day. CONCLUSION: Our results support early use of anakinra in the individually tailored dosing. In patients with hyperinflammation, anakinra may be lifesaving and may even allow for corticosteroid avoidance.

An expert panel of the leading cancer centers in United States recommended routine imaging examinations should be scheduled at least 6 weeks after the final vaccination to allow for any reactive lymphadenopathy to resolve. However, there were no prospective trials regarding COVID-19 vaccination-related lymphadenopathy and the evidence was so limited. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and imaging characteristics of COVID-19 vaccination-related axillary lymphadenopathy and assess the recovery period. Methods: We prospectively enrolled healthy women working at the St. Luke's International Hospital who received Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination within 8 weeks before enrollment between May 10th and 27th, 2021. Women with a history of any type of cancer or axillary surgery, active atopic dermatitis and auto-immune disease were excluded. Participants underwent ultrasound examinations for bilateral axilla at the enrollment. Lymphadenopathy was defined as demonstrating an enlarged node(s) with more than 5mm in short axis by ultrasound imaging in this trial. As for imaging characteristics, status of cortical thickening, echogenic hilus and vascularity of lymph nodes were evaluated. Other side effects by vaccination were assessed by a questionnaire. If lymphadenopathy was detected, we followed the participant by ultrasound examination every three weeks until the lymphadenopathy was resolved. We evaluated theincidence rate and imaging characteristics of lymphadenopathy detected by ultrasound examination, and the recovery period required for improvement of the lymphadenopathy. We also validated the association of the lymphadenopathy with the participant characteristics and other side effects. Results: A total of 135 women were enrolled in this study. Participants' median age was 37 years (range 23-63). Median time from the latest vaccination to the enrollment was 45 days (range 8-56). In the ultrasound examination at enrollment, axillary lymphadenopathy was observed in 67 participants (50%) on the injected (ipsilateral) side. In the contralateral axilla, 13 participants (10%) showed lymphadenopathy. In the ipsilateral axilla, the number of enlarged node(s) was 1 node in 25 cases (19%), 2 nodes in 24 cases (18%), 3 nodes in 13 cases (10%), 4 nodes in 4 cases (3%) and 5 nodes in 1 case (1%). Regarding the ipsilateral enlarged lymph node, focal cortical thickening was observed in 58 cases (43%) and the absence of the echogenic hilus was observed in 15 cases (11%). Hypervascularity was observed in 15 cases (11%). Incidence of the lymphadenopathy was not statistically correlated with participant's age or incidence of fever due to vaccination. At 6 weeks after the latest vaccination, the rate of ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy was 48%, 40% at 8 weeks, and 6% at 12 weeks. In participants with lymphadenopathy, median recovery period to resolve the lymphadenopathy was 75 days from the latest vaccination. Conclusion: A half of participants showed COVID-19 vaccination-related axillary lymphadenopathy and the imaging characteristics were often indistinguishable from malignant nodal involvement. Therefore, patients with breast cancer should be vaccinated on the contralateral arm to the cancer side to avoid diagnostic conundrum. The lymphadenopathy was commonly observed even in 8 weeks, and mostly resolved after 12 weeks from the vaccination. Therefore, non-urgent imaging examinations such as screening would be recommended to be scheduled at least 12 weeks following the latest vaccination.","output":"Prospective ultrasonographic surveillance study for incidence and recovery period of COVID-19 vaccination-related axillary lymphadenopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has resulted in an increased demand for eHealth services globally. There is emerging evidence for the efficacy for group eHealth interventions that support population-based mental health and wellbeing, but a systematic review is lacking. The primary objective of this systematic review is to summarize the evidence for eHealth group counseling and coaching programs for adults. A second objective is to assess, within studies selected for our primary objective, the impact of programs that encourage PA on outcomes compared to those that do not. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials that assess the impact of eHealth group counseling or coaching programs on mental health, health behavior, or physical health activity among community-dwelling adults will be included. We will search the following electronic databases (from January 2005 onwards): MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINHAL, and the Central Register of Controlled Trials. The primary outcomes will be changes in mental health conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress, quality of life), behavioral health conditions (e.g., substance use, smoking, sexual behavior, eating behavior, medication adherence), and physical health conditions (e.g., coping with cancer, menopausal symptoms, arthritis pain). Secondary outcomes will be changes in physical activity. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. Potential conflicts will be resolved through discussion with a third reviewer. A narrative synthesis without meta-analysis will be conducted. The strength of the body of evidence will be assessed using GRADE. The risk of bias in individual studies will be appraised using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Potential sources of gender bias in included studies will be considered at all stages of the planned review.

This presents a challenge for air quality modelling and forecasting during this period, in that transportation emission inventories need to be updated in near real-time. Here, we update the previously developed fuel-based inventory of vehicle emissions (FIVE) to account for changes due to COVID-19 lockdowns. We first construct a 2020 business-as-usual (BAU) case inventory and adjust the emissions for a COVID-19 case using monthly fuel sales information. We evaluate cellular phone-based mobility data products (Google COVID-19 Community Mobility, Apple COVID-19 Mobility Trends) in comparison to embedded traffic monitoring sites in four US cities. We find that mobility datasets tend to overestimate traffic reductions in April 2020 (i.e. lockdown period), while fuel sales adjustments are more similar to changes observed by traffic monitors;for example, mobility-based methods for scaling emissions result in an approximately two-times greater estimate of on-road nitrogen oxide (NO x ) reductions in April 2020 than we find using a fuel-based method. Overall, FIVE estimates a 20%C25% reduction in mobile source NO x emissions in April 2020 versus BAU, and a smaller 6%C7% drop by July. Reductions in April showed considerable spatial heterogeneity, ranging from 6% to 39% at the state level. Similar decreases are found for carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compounds. Decreases to mobile source NO x emissions are expected to lower total US anthropogenic emissions by 9%C12% and 3%C4% in April and July, respectively, with larger relative impacts in urban areas. Changes to diurnal and day-of-week patterns of light- and heavy-duty vehicular traffic are evaluated and found to be relatively minor.

Methods: Online databases (PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial) and the clinicaltrials.gov website were searched for studies reporting the use of isoflurane, sevoflurane or desflurane. Results: We identified three manuscripts describing the beneficial effects of isoflurane on 41 COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in Germany (n = 2) and in the USA (n = 1), in terms of reduction in the use of opioids and other sedatives. We also found a case report of two patients with transient nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, which started after 6 and 8 days of sevoflurane sedation. We identified two randomized controlled trials (RCTs; 92 patients overall), two observational studies (238 patients) on the use of volatile anesthetics in COVID-19 patients that were completed but not yet published, and one RCT interrupted for a low recruitment ratio (19 patients) and thus not published. We also identified five ongoing RCTs on the use of inhaled sedation in ARDS, which are also likely to be recruiting COVID-19 patients and which have currently enrolled a total of >1643 patients.

Especially, the number of people reporting anxiety symptoms increased significantly during the first lockdown-phase compared to similar data collected before the pandemic. Yet, most of these studies relied on a unitary approach to anxiety, wherein its different constitutive features (i.e., symptoms) were tallied into one sum-score, thus ignoring any possibility of interactions between them. Therefore, in this study, we seek to map the associations between the core features of anxiety during the first weeks of the first Belgian COVID-19 lockdown-phase (n = 2,829).

Although, to prevent such infections we must prepare anti-viral drugs and type-specific vaccines against influenza, we need various simple and effective protection methods, such as the use of face masks for public health. Also, in any consideration of bacterial infections, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) also pose serious concerns which must be addressed. I examined the antiviral activity of gentian violet (GV) and GV-dyed cloth against the influenza A (H1N1) virus. Time-kill studies were carried out, and the virus titer was determined based on the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of GV against bacteria were also determined, and the killing activities of the GV-dyed cloth were judged from viable cell counts. GV immediately killed the influenza A virus and this was confirmed by electron microscopy. Moreover, cloth dyed with a combination of GV and copper showed not only excellent antiviral activity but also prominent bactericidal activities.","output":"Inactivation of influenza A virus by gentian violet (GV) and GV-dyed cotton cloth, and bactericidal activities of these agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Chronic pain affects 100 million Americans and is most often treated in primary care, where the health care provider shortage remains a challenge. Nurse practitioners (NPs) represent a growing solution, yet their patterns of chronic pain management are understudied. Additionally, prescriptive authority limitations in many states limit NPs from prescribing opioids and often exist due to concerns of NP-driven opioid overprescribing. Little evidence on NP pain management prescribing patterns exists to address these issues. OBJECTIVE Systematic review, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, to examine opioid and nonopioid prescribing patterns of physicians, NPs, and physician assistants (PAs) in primary care. Eligible studies scored 60% on the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal checklist. DATA SOURCES Searches within PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science. CONCLUSIONS Three themes were elucidated: 1) opioid prescribing in primary care, 2) similarities and differences in opioid prescribing by provider type, and 3) nonopioid pain management strategies. All provider groups had similar opioid prescribing patterns, although NPs and PAs may be slightly less likely to prescribe opioids than physicians. Although some studies suggested that NPs/PAs had higher opioid prescribing rates compared with physicians, methodological flaws may undermine these conclusions. Evidence is also lacking on nonopioid prescribing patterns across disciplines. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Nurse practitioner/PA prescriptive authority limitations may not be as effective of a solution for addressing opioid overprescribing as transdisciplinary interventions targeting the highest subset of opioid prescribers. Future research should examine prescribing patterns of nonopioid, including nonpharmacologic, therapies.","output":"Influence of provider type on chronic pain prescribing patterns A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The purpose of this article was to report a case of full-thickness corneal transplant rejection 3 days after immunization with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine. METHODS Case Report. RESULTS A 51-year-old man with a history of keratoconus and penetrating keratoplasty underwent repeat penetrating keratoplasty for graft failure. The patient had an uncomplicated intraoperative and postoperative course with improved vision and a healthy graft. The patient received the SARS-CoV-2 Moderna vaccine on postoperative week 3, and within 3 days, the patient began developing eye pain, photophobia, and blurred vision. The patient was found to have graft rejection with corneal edema and endothelial keratic precipitates. The rejection did not improve despite a trial of increased topical steroids and ultimately evolved into graft failure. CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge, this case of full-thickness graft rejection after the Moderna SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination is the first to be reported worldwide. The temporal relationship between vaccination and subsequent rejection is highly suggestive of causation due to the short interval (3 days) between vaccination and rejection and the lack of other inciting factors in an otherwise healthy graft. Patients with corneal transplants who plan to take the COVID-19 vaccinations should be counseled on symptoms and closely monitored, and an individualized plan should be made in discussion with the ophthalmologist.","output":"Acute Corneal Transplant Rejection After Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 mRNA-1273 Vaccination."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study is to adapt and then discuss the appropriateness of the Life Orientation Test as a one or two dimension scale.

ABSTRACT: There is evidence to suggest that the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may hamper our achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Here, we use non-human primates as a case study to examine the impacts of COVID-19 on the ability to achieve biodiversity conservation and management sustainability targets.

This need is of particular relevance for developing countries, since they host the majority of the global urban population and are disproportionally affected by the burden of disease. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) data-loggers to track the fine-scale (within city) mobility patterns of 582 residents from two neighborhoods from the city of Iquitos, Peru. We used 2.3 million GPS data-points to quantify age-specific mobility parameters and dynamic co-location networks among all tracked individuals. Geographic space significantly affected human mobility, giving rise to highly local mobility kernels. Most (80%) movements occurred within 1 km of an individuals home. Potential hourly contacts among individuals were highly irregular and temporally unstructured. Only up to 38% of the tracked participants showed a regular and predictable mobility routine, a sharp contrast to the situation in the developed world. As a case study, we quantified the impact of spatially and temporally unstructured routines on the dynamics of transmission of an influenza-like pathogen within an Iquitos neighborhood. Temporally unstructured daily routines (e.g., not dominated by a single location, such as a workplace, where an individual repeatedly spent significant amount of time) increased an epidemics final size and effective reproduction number by 20% in comparison to scenarios modeling temporally structured contacts. Our findings provide a mechanistic description of the basic rules that shape human mobility within a resource-poor urban center, and contribute to the understanding of the role of fine-scale patterns of individual movement and co-location in infectious disease dynamics.

Most countries are still facing several issues due to this disease, which has resulted in several fatalities. The first COVID-19 wave caused devastation across the world owing to its virulence and led to a massive loss in human lives, impacting the country's economy drastically. A dangerous disease called mucormycosis was discovered worldwide during the second COVID-19 wave, in 2021, which lasted from April to July. The mucormycosis disease is commonly known as black fungus, which belongs to the fungus family Mucorales. It is usually a rare disease, but the level of destruction caused by the disease is vast and unpredictable. This disease mainly targets people already suffering from other diseases and consuming heavy medication to counter the disease they are suffering from. This is because of the reduction in antibodies in the affected people. Therefore, the patient's body does not have the ability to act against fungus-oriented infections. This black fungus is more commonly identified in patients with coronavirus disease in certain country. The condition frequently manifests on skin, but it can also harm organs such as eyes and brain.

Here, through a multidisciplinary Perspective encompassing diverse fields such as virology, biology, medicine, engineering, chemistry, materials science, and computational science, we outline how nanotechnology-based strategies can support the fight against COVID-19, as well as infectious diseases in general, including future pandemics. Considering what we know so far about the life cycle of the virus, we envision key steps where nanotechnology could counter the disease. First, nanoparticles (NPs) can offer alternative methods to classical disinfection protocols used in healthcare settings, thanks to their intrinsic antipathogenic properties and/or their ability to inactivate viruses, bacteria, fungi, or yeasts either photothermally or via photocatalysis-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Nanotechnology tools to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in patients could also be explored.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a convolutional neural network, called CheXLocNet, for the segmentation of pneumothorax lesions. The SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax Segmentation dataset was used to train and validate CheXLocNets. The training dataset contained 2079 radiographs with the annotated lesion areas. We trained six CheXLocNets with various hyperparameters. Another 300 annotated radiographs were used to select parameters of these CheXLocNets as the validation set. We determined the optimal parameters by the AP50 (average precision at the intersection over union (IoU) equal to 0.50), a segmentation evaluation metric used by several well-known competitions. Then CheXLocNets were evaluated by a test set (1082 normal radiographs and 290 disease radiographs), based on the classification metrics: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV); segmentation metrics: IoU and Dice score. For the classification, CheXLocNet with best sensitivity produced an AUC of 0.87, sensitivity of 0.78 (95% CI 0.73-0.83), and specificity of 0.78 (95% CI 0.76-0.81). CheXLocNet with best specificity produced an AUC of 0.79, sensitivity of 0.46 (95% CI 0.40-0.52), and specificity of 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.94). For the segmentation, CheXLocNet with best sensitivity produced an IoU of 0.69 and Dice score of 0.72. CheXLocNet with best specificity produced an IoU of 0.77 and Dice score of 0.79. We combined them to form an ensemble CheXLocNet. The ensemble CheXLocNet produced an IoU of 0.81 and Dice score of 0.82. Our CheXLocNet succeeded in automatically detecting pneumothorax lesions, without any human guidance. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we proposed a deep learning network, called, CheXLocNet, for the automatic segmentation of chest radiographs to detect pneumothorax. Our CheXLocNets generated accurate classification results and high-quality segmentation masks for the pneumothorax at the same time. This technology has the potential to improve healthcare delivery and increase access to chest radiograph expertise for the detection of diseases. Furthermore, the segmentation results can offer comprehensive geometric information of lesions, which can benefit monitoring the sequential development of lesions with high accuracy. Thus, CheXLocNets can be further extended to be a reliable clinical decision support tool. Although we used transfer learning in training CheXLocNet, the parameters of CheXLocNet was still large for the radiograph dataset. Further work is necessary to prune CheXLocNet suitable for the radiograph dataset.","output":"CheXLocNet: Automatic localization of pneumothorax in chest radiographs using deep convolutional neural networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mixed fluids confined in porous solid hosts present challenges for the accurate characterization of individual-component behavior. NMR diffusometry with chemical resolution is used to identify unexpected loading- and composition-dependent anomalous diffusion in water/cyclohexane mixtures confined to solid nanoporous glass (NPG) hosts. Diffusion NMR results indicate that data obtained on pure-component liquids in confinement cannot be extrapolated to their nonideal liquid mixtures confined in the same solid host. Loading-dependent data must be obtained on each component in the confined mixture in order to determine which of the liquid components exhibits chemical affinity for the host and, conversely, which of the components exhibits anomalous diffusivity. Most notably, NMR diffusometry revealed that cyclohexane diffusivity varied by 2 orders of magnitude in a water-rich mixture depending on the total fluid loading in the NPG host, ranging from anomalously high diffusivities that significantly exceeded that for pure cyclohexane in NPG at low fluid loadings to kinetically trapped sequestration at high fluid loadings. NMR diffusometry indicates that nonideal solution behavior in fluids confined within nanoporous hosts may have practical implications for enhanced oil recovery methods. Specifically, kinetic trapping of hydrocarbons in water-flooding regimes can result from complex liquid-vapor equilibrium that is significantly perturbed from that which exists in bulk or microporous confinement.","output":"Diffusion, Interactions, and Disparate Kinetic Trapping of Water-Hydrocarbon Mixtures in Nanoporous Solids."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To compare the operation time and performance of two uterine manipulators used for total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH). MATERIAL AND METHODS Design: Retrospective cohort analysis. Design classification: Canadian Task Force Classification II-2. SETTING Tertiary-care university-based teaching hospital and academic affiliated private hospital. PATIENTS All consecutive patients who underwent for TLH between January 2014 and June 2017. All operations were performed by two expert endoscopic surgeons using one of the following uterine manipulators depending on surgeon preferences: Clermont-Ferrand (CF) or Vectec (VT) MAUT60. Patients were excluded if additional surgeries such as urogynecological procedures were performed, TLH was converted to laparotomy prior to colpotomy, and when their operation records could not be obtained. A total of 169 patients were added to final analysis. Operation time, colpotomy time and the subjective performance of manipulators such as movement of the uterus, visualization of the vaginal fornices, and maintenance of pneumoperitoneum were evaluated by watching un-edited operation videos. RESULTS A total of 169 patients (83 patients in CF group; 86 patients in VT group) were included in the final analysis. Patients' baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. Operation time and time required for colpotomy were significantly shorter in the VT group. Lateral movements of the manipulators and elevation of the uterus were better with VT compared to CF (p = .001 for both). Compared to the CF, VT was superior for visualization of the vaginal fornices (p = .004) and maintenance of pneumoperitoneum (p < .001). Both surgeons had perfect agreement on the performance grading of manipulators (p < .001, Kappa values were between 0.86-0.92). There was no difference between groups in estimated blood loss and duration of hospital stay. Reinsertion or the need to change the manipulator was not required in either group. No pelvic or vaginal abscess, cuff cellulitis, dehiscence, or hematoma formations were noted. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic hysterectomy assisted with the VT uterine manipulator is associated with shorter operation and colpotomy time. Furthermore, the movements of uterus, visualization of the vaginal fornices, and maintenance of pneumoperitoneum were significantly better with VT compared to the CF manipulator.","output":"Clermont-Ferrand versus Vectec uterine manipulator for total laparoscopic hysterectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Historically, the vaccination strategies developed in the second half of the 20th century have permitted to eradicate infectious diseases.

These trends have been identified as a public health crisis in urgent need of new solutions and have spurred significant research efforts to improve our understanding of suicide and strategies to prevent it. Unfortunately, despite making significant contributions to the founding of suicidology C through Emile Durkheims classic Suicide (1897/1951) C sociologys role has been less prominent in contemporary efforts to address these tragic trends, though as we will show, sociological theories offer great promise for advancing our understanding of suicide and improving the efficacy of suicide prevention. Here, we review sociological theory and empirical research on suicide. We begin where all sociologists must: with Durkheim. However, we offer a more comprehensive understanding of Durkheims insights into suicide than the prior reviews provided by those in other disciplines. In so doing, we reveal the nuance and richness of Durkheims insights that have been largely lost in modern suicidology, despite being foundational to all sociological theories of suicide C even those that have moved beyond his model. We proceed to discuss broadly acknowledged limitations to Durkheims theory of suicide and review how more recent theoretical efforts have not only addressed those concerns, but have done so by bringing a larger swatch of sociologys theoretical and empirical toolkit to bare on suicide. Specifically, we review how recent sociological theories of suicide have incorporated insights from social network theories, cultural sociology, sociology of emotions, and sociological social psychology to better theorize how the external social world matters to individual psychological pain and suffering. We conclude by making explicit bridges between sociological and psychological theories of suicide; by noting important limitations in knowledge about suicide C particularly regarding the roles of organizations, inequality, and intersectionality in suicide C that sociology is well situated to help address.","output":"The Social Roots of Suicide: Theorizing How the External Social World Matters to Suicide and Suicide Prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Myocarditis in athletes is a feared complication of SARS-CoV-2, yet guidelines for screening with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging are lacking. Further, stakeholder involvement in the research is rare. Hypothesis: We sought to determine the rates of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging evidence of SARS-CoV-2 related myocarditis in student athletes. We hypothesized that rates of myocarditis were lower than initially reported and that including athletes on the research team would enhance participant satisfaction and scientific integrity. Methods: Accordingly, when members of a hockey team were infected with SARS-CoV-2, we invited them and their team physicians to be part of the design of a study assessing the incidence of myocarditis. We performed cardiac magnetic resonance imaging on participating hockey players infected with SARS-CoV-2 and compared them to a healthy lacrosse cohort. Participants were given an optional survey to complete at the end of the study to assess their satisfaction with it. Results: Four hockey players and two team physicians joined the study team; eight hockey players and four lacrosse players participated in the study. Zero athletes met imaging criteria for myocarditis; delayed enhancement was observed in seven cases and three controls. Athletes supported sharing the findings with the participants. No athletes reported feeling uncomfortable participating, knowing other athletes participated on the research team. Conclusion: Rates of SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis in young athletes appears to be lower than initially reported. Partnered research is important, especially in populations with more to lose, such as collegiate athletes; future studies should include stakeholders in the study design and execution.

Recently, C/D snoRNAs were also implicated in regulating the expression of non-ribosomal genes through different modes of binding. Large scale RNA-RNA interaction datasets detect many snoRNAs binding messenger RNA, but are limited by specific experimental conditions. To enable a more comprehensive study of C/D snoRNA interactions, we created snoGloBe, a human C/D snoRNA interaction predictor based on a gradient boosting classifier. SnoGloBe considers the target type, position and sequence of the interactions, enabling it to outperform existing predictors. Interestingly, for specific snoRNAs, snoGloBe identifies strong enrichment of interactions near gene expression regulatory elements including splice sites. Abundance and splicing of predicted targets were altered upon the knockdown of their associated snoRNA. Strikingly, the predicted snoRNA interactions often overlap with the binding sites of functionally related RNA binding proteins, reinforcing their role in gene expression regulation. SnoGloBe is also an excellent tool for discovering viral RNA targets, as shown by its capacity to identify snoRNAs targeting the heavily methylated SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Overall, snoGloBe is capable of identifying experimentally validated binding sites and predicting novel sites with shared regulatory function.","output":"The snoGloBe interaction predictor reveals a broad spectrum of C/D snoRNA RNA targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many viruses that cause serious diseases in humans and animals, including the betacoronaviruses (beta-CoVs), such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2, have natural reservoirs in bats. Because these viruses rely entirely on the host cellular machinery for survival, their evolution is likely to be guided by the link between the codon usage of the virus and that of its host. As a result, specific cellular microenvironments of the diverse hosts and/or host tissues imprint peculiar molecular signatures in virus genomes. Our study is aimed at deciphering some of these signatures. Using a variety of genetic methods we demonstrated that trends in codon usage across chiroptera-hosted CoVs are collaboratively driven by geographically different host-species and temporal-spatial distribution. We not only found that chiroptera-hosted CoVs are the ancestors of SARS-CoV-2, but we also revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has the codon usage characteristics similar to those seen in CoVs infecting the Rhinolophus sp. Surprisingly, the envelope gene of beta-CoVs infecting Rhinolophus sp., including SARS-CoV-2, had extremely high CpG levels, which appears to be an evolutionarily conserved trait. The dissection of the furin cleavage site of various CoVs infecting hosts revealed host-specific preferences for arginine codons; however, arginine is encoded by a wider variety of synonymous codons in the murine CoV (MHV-A59) furin cleavage site. Our findings also highlight the latent diversity of CoVs in mammals that has yet to be fully explored.","output":"Evolutionary Signatures Governing the Codon Usage Bias in Coronaviruses and Their Implications for Viruses Infecting Various Bat Species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new zoonotic agent that emerged in December 2019, causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This infection can be spread by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily via respiratory droplets during close person-to-person contact in a closed space, especially a building. This article summarizes the environmental factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including a strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a building environment. SARS-CoV-2 can persist on surfaces of fomites for at least 3 days depending on the conditions. If SARS-CoV-2 is aerosolized intentionally, it is stable for at least several hours. SARS-CoV-2 is inactivated rapidly on surfaces with sunlight. Close-contact aerosol transmission through smaller aerosolized particles is likely to be combined with respiratory droplets and contact transmission in a confined, crowded, and poorly ventilated indoor environment, as suggested by some cluster cases. Although evidence of the effect of aerosol transmission is limited and uncertainty remains, adequate preventive measures to control indoor environmental quality are required, based on a precautionary approach, because COVID-19 has caused serious global damages to public health, community, and the social economy. The expert panel for COVID-19 in Japan has focused on the 3 Cs, namely, closed spaces with poor ventilation, crowded spaces with many people, and close contact. In addition, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan has been recommending adequate ventilation in all closed spaces in accordance with the existing standards of the Law for Maintenance of Sanitation in Buildings as one of the initial political actions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, specific standards for indoor environmental quality control have not been recommended and many scientific uncertainties remain regarding the infection dynamics and mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in closed indoor spaces. Further research and evaluation are required regarding the effect and role of indoor environmental quality control, especially ventilation.","output":"Environmental factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 transmission: effect and role of indoor environmental quality in the strategy for COVID-19 infection control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the perceived effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on small animal surgical specialist training, among trainees and supervisors and to propose changes, based upon the results, that could be incorporated into training programs.

Before the development of in vitro cell culture techniques, all viruses had to be propagated in their natural host. For bacterial viruses, this was a relatively simple process that permitted an earlier development of laboratory research methods than was possible with plant or animal viruses. For animal viruses, samples from affected animals were collected and used to infect other animals, initially of the same species. When consistent results were obtained, attempts were usually made to determine whether other species might also be susceptible. This chapter explains that the advent of in vitro animal cell culture brought research studies in line with those involving bacterial viruses, thereby reducing the risks associated with adventitious viruses in animal inoculation systems and enhancing diagnostic testing. Various in vitro cell culture systems are used since an artificial medium was developed to maintain cell viability outside the source species: organ cultures, explant cultures, primary cell cultures, and cell lines. Organ cultures maintain the three-dimensional structure of the tissue and are used for short-term experiments. A fundamental characteristic that separates viruses from other replicating entities is the manner in which new virus particles are synthesized. Viruses do not use binary fission; virus particles are assembled de novo from the various structural components synthesized as somewhat independent but synchronized events. The critical first step in the virus replication cycle is the binding of the virus particle to a host cell. This binding process may involve a series of interactions that define in part the host range of the virus and its tissue/organ specificity.","output":"Chapter 2 Virus Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China has spread to over 113 countries with 118,326 infected and 4,292 died as of 11 March 2020 and the World Health Organization (WHO) has just announced COVID-19 a global pandemic.

One of the simply available imaging modalities in clinical routine involves chest X-ray (CXR), which is often used for diagnostic purposes. Here, we proposed a computer-aided detection of COVID-19 in CXR imaging using deep and conventional radiomic features. First, we used a 2D U-Net model to segment the lung lobes. Then, we extracted deep latent space radiomics by applying deep convolutional autoencoder (ConvAE) with internal dense layers to extract low-dimensional deep radiomics. We used JohnsonCLindenstrauss (JL) lemma, Laplacian scoring (LS), and principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality in conventional radiomics. The generated low-dimensional deep and conventional radiomics were integrated to classify COVID-19 from pneumonia and healthy patients. We used 704 CXR images for training the entire model (i.e., U-Net, ConvAE, and feature selection in conventional radiomics). Afterward, we independently validated the whole system using a study cohort of 1597 cases. We trained and tested a random forest model for detecting COVID-19 cases through multivariate binary-class and multiclass classification. The maximal (full multivariate) model using a combination of the two radiomic groups yields performance in classification cross-validated accuracy of 72.6% (69.4C74.4%) for multiclass and 89.6% (88.4C90.7%) for binary-class classification.","output":"Impartially Validated Multiple Deep-Chain Models to Detect COVID-19 in Chest X-ray Using Latent Space Radiomics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies reporting clinical symptoms related to electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) usage, especially types of devices and e-liquids, are sparse.

Virus entry route through ACE2 ligation and TMPRSS2 coligation allows identifying potential viral targets in the kidney, including tubules, endothelial cells, and glomerulus.

Notwithstanding the technical challenge of disclosing viral invasion within tissues and cells, viral direct cytopathogenic effect generally does not appear as the cause of the observed renal damage. Inflammation and altered hemodynamics, described as viral sepsis, might rather be responsible for organ dysfunction, including kidneys. We shall place these various mechanisms into an integrated vision where the synergy between direct viral pathogenicity and systemic inflammation enhances renal damage. As SARS-CoV-2 inexorably continues its rampant spread, understanding the sequence of events in the kidneys might thus help inform improved therapeutic strategies, including antiviral drugs and immunomodulators.","output":"The Good Treatment, the Bad Virus, and the Ugly Inflammation: Pathophysiology of Kidney Involvement During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper estimates a three-region DSGE model (EA, US, RoW) with international financial linkages in the form of cross-border equity holding and allowing for region-specific as well as global financial shocks, which match empirical measures of financial tightness and global stock market valuation.

However, no studies examine how human infant amygdala connectivity relates to direct observations of novelty-evoked distress in human infants. The current study examines the link between amygdala connectivity and infant novelty-evoked distress using direct-observation of temperament. METHOD At four-months of age infants' (N=90) novelty-evoked distress was assessed using a standardized reactivity assessment and parent-report. Within three weeks, resting state fMRI was collected in a subset of infants (n=34). Using a whole-brain voxel wise approach, we examine amygdala connectivity associated with positive and negative affect during the reactivity assessment. We then examined regions where the association of amygdala connectivity with negative affect was higher than with positive affect. Additionally, we examined associations between amygdala connectivity and parent-report of temperament. RESULTS Greater amygdala-cingulate and amygdala-superior frontal gyrus connectivity was associated with lower positive affect during the reactivity assessment. Results further indicated that the association between amygdala-cingulate connectivity was greater for negative affect compared to positive affect. There were no significant associations between latency to approach novelty (as measured by parent-report) and amygdala connectivity.

It presents a descriptive analysis of the data to provide a basic overview of the impact of COVID-19 in HC, as assessed in August-September 2020. A total of 936 participants from HC responded to the survey. Approximately one-third reported that they or their family members experienced reduced work hours, and one-fifth lost their jobs because of COVID-19. Many reported difficulties paying for many types of living essentials and expected these difficulties to increase in the near future. Challenges for the fall school semester included lack of access to funds for school supplies and face-coverings. The majority perceived the severity of COVID-19 to be moderate/very high and most had at least a moderate level of knowledge about risks for developing severe COVID-19. Approximately half reported maintaining social distancing usually/all of the time, and about two-thirds reported wearing a face-covering usually/always when needed. Other barriers for COVID disease prevention and response included a lack of space for quarantine/isolation of family members, not having enough cleaning supplies, low knowledge of how to care for a household member with COVID disease and not having someone available to care for them if they contracted the virus. The results provide a baseline for understanding the impact, needs, and threats to the health and social welfare of individuals and their families as a result of COVID-19 in HC.

METHODS This phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of NVX-CoV2373 in adults []18 years of age in the United States and Mexico during the first quarter of 2021. Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive two doses of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo 21 days apart. The primary end point was vaccine efficacy (VE) against reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed Covid-19 in SARS-CoV-2-naive participants []7 days after the second dose administration. RESULTS Of the 29,949 participants randomized between December 27, 2020, and February 18, 2021, 29,582 (median age: 47 years, 12.6% []65 years) received []1 dose: 19,714 received vaccine and 9868 placebo. In the per-protocol population, there were 77 Covid-19 cases; 14 among vaccine and 63 among placebo recipients (VE: 90.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 82.9 to 94.6, P<0.001). All moderate-to-severe cases occurred in placebo recipients, yielding VE of 100% (95% CI 87.0 to 100). Most sequenced viral genomes (48/61, 78.7%) were variants of concern (VOC) or interest (VOI), mainly represented by variant alpha/B.1.1.7 (31/35, 88.6% VOC identified). VE against any VOC/VOI was 92.6% (95% CI 83.6 to 96.7). Reactogenicity was mostly mild-to-moderate and transient, but more frequent in NVX-CoV2373 recipients and after the second dose. Serious adverse events were rare and evenly distributed between treatments. CONCLUSIONS NVX-CoV2373 was well tolerated and demonstrated a high overall VE (>90%) for prevention of Covid-19, with most cases due to variant strains.

We designed a cross-sectional, observational, multicenter, nationwide survey in Italy to verify whether renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are related to COVID-19 severe outcomes. We analyzed information from Italian patients diagnosed with COVID-19, admitted in 26 hospitals. One thousand five hundred ninety-one charts (male, 64.1%; 660.4 years) were recorded. At least 1 preexisting condition was observed in 73.4% of patients, with hypertension being the most represented (54.9%). One hundred eighty-eight deaths were recorded (11.8%; mean age, 79.60.9 years). In nonsurvivors, older age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery diseases, and heart failure were more represented than in survivors. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (4.30.15 versus 2.60.05; P<0.001). ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, diuretics, and ?-blockers were more frequently used in nonsurvivors than in survivors. After correction by multivariate analysis, only age (P=0.0001), diabetes mellitus (P=0.004), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P=0.011), and chronic kidney disease (P=0.004) but not hypertension predicted mortality.

Eligible patients were randomized to either the low dose group; 1200 mg daily NAC, the high dose group; 1200 mg NAC twice daily or the control group; received paclitaxel only. The primary endpoint was the incidence of different grades of PIPN using National Cancer Institute's common toxicity criteria for adverse event (NCI-CTCAE) while secondary endpoints were the severity of PIPN using modified total neuropathy score (mTNS), quality of life (QOL) using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity (FACT-GOG-NTX) subscale, serum nerve growth factor (NGF), and serum malondialdehyde (MDA). RESULTS At the end of the 12-week period, the incidence of grade (2, 3) peripheral neuropathy was significantly lower in the high dose group (28.6%) compared to the low dose group (61.9%) and the control group (100%), p value < 0.001. A significant improvement in the mTNS and QOL scores was observed after 6 and 12 weeks in the high dose group and the low dose group compared to the control, p value < 0.001. Significantly higher levels of serum NGF in the high dose group and lower level of serum MDA in the high dose and the low dose group were observed.

Transcriptome sequencing was performed to analyze the differentially expressed mRNAs and microRNAs. The results showed that open arm entries and time of PSD mice were markedly decreased. Times of the entry to center for mice in the model group were apparently decreased. The climbing time of mice in the model group was greatly decreased. The behavior of PSD mice indicated a marked change, and several indicators of the behavioral tests were significantly lower than those of the control group. Transcriptome sequencing analysis demonstrated that expressions of 1 206 genes and 21 microRNAs were markedly upregulated in model group, whereas expressions of 2 113 genes and 32 microRNAs were markedly downregulated. GO analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in regulatory pathways of single-multicellular organism process, developmental process, cell periphery, plasma membrane, and neuron projection. Meanwhile, KEGG analysis results indicated that the differentially expressed genes mostly participated in signaling pathways of neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, calcium signaling pathway, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction.

METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, Medical records of patients who underwent AADA surgery at two institutions between January 2015 and January 2018 were collected. Patients with postoperative hypoxemia were classified as iNO and control groups. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared using a propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis. RESULTS: Among 436 patients who underwent surgical repair, 187 (42.9%) had hypoxemia and 43 were treated with low-dose iNO. After PSM, patients were included in the iNO treatment (n = 40) and PSM control (n = 94) groups in a 1:3 ratio. iNO ameliorated hypoxemia at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after initiation, and shortened the durations of ventilator support (39.0 h (31.3C47.8) vs. 69.0 h (47.8C110.3), p < 0.001) and ICU stay (122.0 h (80.8C155.0) vs 179.5 h (114.0C258.0), p < 0.001).

In the current study, aberrant BM-M1/M2 M polarization, characterized by increased M1 Ms and decreased M2 Ms and accompanied by impaired megakaryopoiesis-supporting abilities, was found in patients with PT post-allotransplant. RNA-seq and western blot analysis showed that the PI3K-AKT pathway was downregulated in the BM Ms of PT patients. Moreover, in vitro treatment with PI3K-AKT activators restored the impaired megakaryopoiesis-supporting ability of Ms from PT patients. Furthermore, we found M1 Ms suppress, whereas M2 Ms support MK maturation and platelet formation in humans. Chemical inhibition of PI3K-AKT pathway reduced megakaryopoiesis-supporting ability of M2 Ms, as indicated by decreased MK count, colony-forming unit number, high-ploidy distribution, and platelet count. Importantly, genetic knockdown of the PI3K-AKT pathway impaired the megakaryopoiesis-supporting ability of Ms both in vitro and in a M-specific PI3K-knockdown murine model, indicating a critical role of PI3K-AKT pathway in regulating the megakaryopoiesis-supporting ability of M2 Ms. Furthermore, our preliminary data indicated that TGF- released by M2 Ms may facilitate megakaryopoiesis through upregulation of the JAK2/STAT5 and MAPK/ERK pathways in MKs. Taken together, our data reveal that M1 and M2 Ms have opposing effects on MKs in a PI3K-AKT pathway-dependent manner, which may lead to new insights into the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia and provide a potential therapeutic strategy to promote megakaryopoiesis.","output":"M2 macrophages, but not M1 macrophages, support megakaryopoiesis by upregulating PI3K-AKT pathway activity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China and transmission to more than 80 territories worldwide, including nine countries in Africa, presents a delicate situation for low-resource settings Countries in Eastern and Central Africa have been on high alert since mid-2018 in anticipation of regional spread of the Ebola virus from the Democratic Republic of Congo Significant investment has been made to support enhanced surveillance at point of entry and hospitals, infection control practices, clinical case management, and clinical research With a new threat on the horizon, African countries have an opportunity to leverage the existing capacities for Ebola preparedness to brace for the imminent threat","output":"Leveraging investments in Ebola preparedness for COVID-19 in Sub-Saharan Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To evaluate a telehealth simulation rubric for a pharmacy skills lab course using inter-rater reliability (IRR) comparing different evaluator types.Methods A rubric was developed and used to score student pharmacists' competency in a telehealth simulation for a pharmacy skills lab course.

Methods This cross-sectional study utilized data from the Health Statistical Yearbook published by the Ministry of Health during the period 2015-2019. The number of hospital beds per 100 000 population was calculated for the 20 health regions. Generation of other parameters, such as the Gini index and the Lorenz curve, was performed to assess the distribution of beds. The Pearson coefficient was calculated to assess the correlation between beds and population in each health region. Results The ratio of hospital beds to population improved from 2015 to 2019 in areas such as Ha'il, Tabouk and Ta'if, which increased by 89.6, 72.5 and 32.5 respectively. The calculated mean Gini index for bed distribution in the public sector was 0.21; in the private sector it was 0.53.

One such pathway is the formation of stress granules (SG), which are ribonucleoprotein complexes that assemble during translation inhibition following cellular stress. Inhibition of SG assembly has been observed under numerous virus infections across species, suggesting a conserved fundamental viral strategy. However, the significance of SG modulation during virus infection is not fully understood. The 1A protein encoded by the model dicistrovirus, Cricket Paralysis Virus (CrPV), is a multifunctional protein that can bind to and degrade Ago-2 in an E3 ubiquitin ligase-dependent manner to block the antiviral RNA interference pathway and inhibit SG formation. Moreover, the R146 residue of 1A is necessary for SG inhibition and CrPV infection in both Drosophila S2 cells and adult flies. Here, we uncoupled CrPV-1As functions and provide insight into its underlying mechanism for SG inhibition. CrPV-1A mediated inhibition of SGs requires the E3 ubiquitin-ligase binding domain and the R146 residue, but not the Ago-2 binding domain. Wild-type but not mutant CrPV-1A R146A localizes to the nuclear membrane which correlates with nuclear enrichment of poly(A)+ RNA. Transcriptome changes in CrPV-infected cells are dependent on the R146 residue. Finally, Nup358/RanBP2 is targeted and degraded in CrPV-infected cells in an R146-dependent manner and the depletion of Nup358 blocks SG formation. We propose that CrPV utilizes a multiprong strategy whereby the CrPV-1A protein interferes with a nuclear event that contributes to SG inhibition in order to promote infection. AUTHOR SUMMARY Viruses often inhibit a cellular stress response that leads to the accumulation of RNA and protein condensates called stress granules. How this occurs and why this would benefit virus infection are not fully understood. Here, we reveal a viral protein that can block stress granules and identify a key amino acid residue in the protein that inactivates this function. We demonstrate that this viral protein has multiple functions to modulate nuclear events including mRNA export and transcription to regulate stress granule formation. We identify a key host protein that is important for viral protein mediate stress granule inhibition, thus providing mechanistic insights. This study reveals a novel viral strategy in modulating stress granule formation to promote virus infection.","output":"Targeting Nup358/RanBP2 by a viral protein disrupts stress granule formation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We evaluated the Panbio?

This stochastic SIS epidemic model can be interpreted as a Hamiltonian system, therefore we wondered if it could be geometrically handled through the theory of Lie--Hamilton systems, and this happened to be the case. The primordial result is that we are able to obtain a general solution for the stochastic/ SIS-epidemic model (with fluctuations) in form of a nonlinear superposition rule that includes particular stochastic solutions and certain constants to be related to initial conditions of the contagion process. The choice of these initial conditions will be crucial to display the expected behavior of the curve of infections during the epidemic. We shall limit these constants to nonsingular regimes and display graphics of the behavior of the solutions. As one could expect, the increase of infected individuals follows a sigmoid-like curve. Lie--Hamiltonian systems admit a quantum deformation, so does the stochastic SIS-epidemic model. We present this generalization as well. If one wants to study the evolution of an SIS epidemic under the influence of a constant heat source (like centrally heated buildings), one can make use of quantum stochastic differential equations coming from the so-called quantum deformation.","output":"Geometry and solutions of an epidemic SIS model permitting fluctuations and quantization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS To compare cuffed silicone endotracheal tubes with self-sealing baffled silicone endotracheal tubes in an ex vivo canine tracheal model, to determine whether the tubes differed in their maintenance of a seal and their effectiveness in removing fluid from the tracheal lumen, and whether the self-sealing endotracheal tubes would release pressure when a closed anaesthetic circuit reached 30 cm H2O. METHODS Twelve cadaver tracheae were randomly selected to be intubated with either cuffed or self-sealing baffled endotracheal tubes. To test tracheal seal efficacy, the tracheae were positioned vertically, 5 mL of water was instilled proximal to the tube cuff or baffles and they were monitored for leakage at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, recording the total volume leaked. To test fluid removal at extubation, the tracheae were intubated, then 5.6 g of 60% barium sulphate suspension was instilled proximal to the seal and left undisturbed for 5 minutes. The tubes were then extubated, with the cuffed endotracheal tubes being partially deflated before extubation, and the amount of barium recovered was weighed. These procedures were repeated on the same tracheae using the other endotracheal tubes. To test whether self-sealing baffled endotracheal tubes would release pressure at 30 cm H2O, the tracheae were intubated, connected to an anaesthetic machine and pressurised to 30 cm H2O for 5 minutes and then 50 cm H2O for 5 minutes. Release of pressure was defined as a decrease in pressure within the closed anaesthetic circuit. RESULTS More cuffed (7/12) than baffled (0/12) endotracheal tubes leaked water after 60 minutes (p=0.016). The mean amount of barium removed by the self-sealing baffled endotracheal tubes (4.9 (95% CI=3.8-4.4) g) was greater than that removed by the partially deflated cuffed endotracheal tubes (0.4 (95% CI=0.14-0.66) g) (p<0.001). None of the self-sealing baffled endotracheal tubes released pressure at 30 cm H2O in a closed anaesthetic circuit. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Self-sealing baffled endotracheal tubes were more effective than cuffed endotracheal tubes at both preventing fluid leakage at the tracheal seal and removing fluid from the lumen of the trachea in cadaver tracheae. However they did not release pressure when the closed-circuit system was at 30 cm H2O in a canine cadaver model. The self-sealing baffled endotracheal tubes may be a suitable substitute for cuffed endotracheal tubes.","output":"An ex vivo comparison of cuffed endotracheal tubes and self-sealing baffled endotracheal tubes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic poses a significant threat to peoples lives.

Swedens population is literate and has a high level of trust in authorities and those in power. During 2020, however, Sweden had ten times higher COVID-19 death rates compared with neighbouring Norway. In this report, we try to understand why, using a narrative approach to evaluate the Swedish COVID-19 policy and the role of scientific evidence and integrity. We argue that that scientific methodology was not followed by the major figures in the acting authoritiesor the responsible politicianswith alternative narratives being considered as valid, resulting in arbitrary policy decisions. In 2014, the Public Health Agency merged with the Institute for Infectious Disease Control;the first decision by its new head (Johan Carlson) was to dismiss and move the authoritys six professors to Karolinska Institute. With this setup, the authority lacked expertise and could disregard scientific facts. The Swedish pandemic strategy seemed targeted towards natural herd-immunity and avoiding a societal shutdown. The Public Health Agency labelled advice from national scientists and international authorities as extreme positions, resulting in media and political bodies to accept their own policy instead. The Swedish people were kept in ignorance of basic facts such as the airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission, that asymptomatic individuals can be contagious and that face masks protect both the carrier and others. Mandatory legislation was seldom used;recommendations relying upon personal responsibility and without any sanctions were the norm. Many elderly people were administered morphine instead of oxygen despite available supplies, effectively ending their lives. If Sweden wants to do better in future pandemics, the scientific method must be re-established, not least within the Public Health Agency. It would likely make a large difference if a separate, independent Institute for Infectious Disease Control is recreated.

It also stimulated extraordinary scientific achievement, bringing vaccines to the public in under a year. In this article, we discuss the implications of current vaccination guidance for pregnant and lactating women, whether their exclusion from the first wave of vaccine trials was justified, and if a change in the current vaccine development pathway is necessary. Pregnant and lactating women were not included in initial SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials. Perhaps unsurprisingly therefore, the first vaccine regulatory approvals have been accompanied by inconsistent advice from public health, governmental, and professional authorities around the world. Denying vaccination to women who though pregnant or breastfeeding are fully capable of autonomous decision-making is a throwback to a paternalistic era. Conversely, lack of evidence upon which to make an informed decision generated in a timely manner, shifts responsibility from research sponsors and regulators, and places the burden of decision-making upon a woman and her healthcare advisor. The World Health Organization (WHO), the Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant Women and Lactating Women (PRGLAC), and others have highlighted the long-standing disadvantage experienced by women in relation to the development of vaccines and medicines. It is uncertain whether there was sufficient justification for excluding pregnant and lactating women from initial SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials. In future, we recommend regulators mandate plans that describe the development pathway for new vaccines and medicines that address the needs of women who are pregnant or lactating. These should incorporate at the outset, careful consideration of the balance of risks of exclusion or inclusion from initial studies, patient and public perspectives, details of Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity studies, and approaches to collect data systematically from participants who are unknowingly pregnant at the time of exposure. This requires careful consideration of any prior knowledge of the mode of action of the vaccine and the likelihood of toxicity or teratogenicity. We also support the view that the default position should be a presumption of inclusion, with exclusion of women who are pregnant or lactating only if justified on specific, not generic, grounds.

Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) therapy for venous thromboembolism (VTE) is now as common as vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment, but data are sparse regarding outcomes for patients with low-risk PE treated with DOACs as outpatients. We conducted a systematic review of literature on outcomes of outpatient management for PE, including comparisons to inpatient treatment and differences by anticoagulant class. METHODS We searched Medline, Embase, PubMed, CENTRAL, clinicaltrials.gov, and ICTRN for studies published from January 1980 through February 2019 using a predefined strategy developed with a medical librarian. We included English-language randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective nonrandomized trials (NRTs) of adult patients diagnosed with acute, symptomatic pulmonary embolism and discharged from the emergency department (ED) or within 48 hours. Our primary outcome included four major adverse outcomes (all-cause mortality, PE-related mortality, recurrent VTE, and major bleeding) within 30 and 90 days. A preplanned subanalysis of high-quality studies assessed outcomes associated with different anticoagulation treatment classes. RESULTS Our initial search identified 6,818 records, of which 12 studies (4 RCT, 8 NRT) with a total of 3191 patients were included in the review. All RCTs and six NRTs were determined to have low-moderate risk of bias and were classified as high quality.

Previously, groups had targeted conserved coronavirus proteins as a strategy to generate live attenuated vaccine strains against current and future CoVs. With this in mind, we explored whether manipulation of CoV NSP16, a conserved 2'O methyltransferase (MTase), could provide a broad attenuation platform against future emergent strains. Using the severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV mouse model, an NSP16 mutant vaccine was evaluated for protection from heterologous challenge, efficacy in the aging host, and potential for reversion to pathogenesis. Despite some success, concerns for virulence in the aged and potential for reversion makes targeting NSP16 alone an untenable approach. However, combining a 2'O MTase mutation with a previously described CoV fidelity mutant produced a vaccine strain capable of protection from heterologous virus challenge, efficacy in aged mice, and no evidence for reversion. Together, the results indicate that targeting the CoV 2'O MTase in parallel with other conserved attenuating mutations may provide a platform strategy for rapidly generating live attenuated coronavirus vaccines.IMPORTANCE Emergent coronaviruses remain a significant threat to global public health and rapid response vaccine platforms are needed to stem future outbreaks. However, failure of many previous CoV vaccine formulations has clearly highlighted the need to test efficacy under different conditions and especially in vulnerable populations such as the aged and immunocompromised. This study illustrates that despite success in young models, the 2'O methyltransferase mutant carries too much risk for pathogenesis and reversion in vulnerable models to be used as a stand-alone vaccine strategy. Importantly, the 2'O methyltransferase mutation can be paired with other attenuating approaches to provide robust protection from heterologous challenge and in vulnerable populations.

The purpose of this study was to identify potential financial implications of continued telehealth use in hand and wrist surgery clinical practice. METHODS Two hundred telehealth visits were randomly selected and matched 1:1 based on primary diagnosis code to in-person visits. Medical and billing records were reviewed to compare visit complexities, total visit charges, work relative value units (wRVUs), and approved insurance reimbursement. Postoperative visits and visits with radiographic evaluation were excluded. RESULTS Level 4 visits were more common with in-person encounters compared to telehealth (11% vs 2%, respectively), and level 1 and 2 visits were more common with telehealth compared to in-person encounters (14% vs 6%, respectively). Twenty-seven in-person visits (13%) had at least 1 additional procedure code billed. The mean total visit charge was 26% less in telehealth compared to in-person. Based on the primary procedure code alone, the sum of wRVUs was 15.1 points less in the telehealth cohort compared to in-person (per visit average, 1.1 [telehealth] vs 1.2 [in-person]). The 28 additional services provided during in-person visits accounted for an added 20.7 wRVUs. Unpaid claims were more common among telehealth encounters (8% [telehealth] vs 3% [in-person]). CONCLUSIONS Higher complexity visits and visits with additional procedural codes billed were more common with in-person visits. This led to a lower number of total wRVUs and lower total visit charges among the included telehealth visits compared to the matched in-person controls.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study comparing the emergency surgery activity in a Spanish tertiary Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic and emergency surgery activity registered in 2019 during the equivalent time period. RESULTS: A total of 1802 patients were included in control group (CG) versus 756 in pandemic group (PG). Mean number of patients who underwent emergency surgery during the control and pandemic periods was 3.42 patients per day, in contrast to 1.62 during the pandemic period, which represents a 52.6% decrease in emergency surgery activity. During the pandemic period, most of the patients consulted after more than 72 h of symptoms, representing a delay in presenting in the ER of 23.7% when compared to CG. Surgeries due to complications from previous elective procedures decreased (12% vs. 6.1%) in PG, probably because elective procedures are being postponed. We had a 13.1% COVID-19 positivity rate. Morbidity was higher during pandemic (52.5% vs. 35.2%). Mortality rates in patients undergoing emergency surgery was higher in PG (12.1% vs. 4.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The impact of the first wave of COVID-19 in emergency surgery activity has been profound. A significant reduction in emergency surgery was observed, along with longer time periods between patients' onset of symptoms and their arrival at the Emergency Department. Higher morbidity was also observed during the pandemic period.","output":"First wave of COVID-19 impact on emergency general surgery in a Spanish tertiary hospital.

OSHA officers conduct inspections and assess fines for non-compliance and regulatory violations. Literature discussion on the economic impact of OSHA inspections with COVID-19 related citations for the construction sector is lacking. This study aims to investigate the relationships between the number of COVID-19 cases, construction employment and OSHA citations and it further evaluates the total and monthly predicted cost impact of OSHA citations associated with COVID-19 violations. Design/methodology/approach An application of multiple regression analysis, a supervised machine learning linear regression model, based on K-fold cross validation sampling and a probabilistic risk-based cost estimate Monte Carlo simulation were utilized to evaluate the data. The data were collected from numerous websites including OSHA, Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization. Findings The results show that as the monthly construction employment increased, there was a decrease in OSHA citations. Conversely, the cost impact of OSHA citations had a positive relationship with the number of COVID-19 cases. In addition, the monthly cost impact of OSHA COVID-19 related citations along with the total cost impact of citations were predicted and analyzed. Originality/value The application of the two models on cost analysis provides a thorough comparison of predicted and overall cost impact, which can assist the contractors to better understand the possible cost ramifications. Based on the findings, it is suggested that the contractors include contingency fees within their contracts, hire safety managers to implement specific safety protocols related to COVID-19 and request a safety action plan when qualifying their subcontractors to avoid potential fines and citations.","output":"Predicting the trends and cost impact of COVID-19 OSHA citations on US construction contractors using machine learning and simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic propelled remote simulation and online distance debriefings. Like in-person debriefings, educators seek to facilitate reflective learning conversations, yet, in the online setting, educators face challenges to learner engagement that differ considerably from in-person debriefing. METHODS: We performed a thematic analysis of fourteen semi-structured interviews conducted with fourteen participants who had experience with virtual debriefing as an educator or as a learner. We explored the experiences and perceptions of both educators and learners to provide a more in-depth understanding of the factors that influence engagement in online distance debriefing. RESULTS: Our study identified the challenges online distance debriefing poses for educators and learners. We found ten themes that support the Community of Inquiry (CoI) theoretical framework and provided additional considerations related to internal and external factors of engagement, including the influence of the simulation, false engagement, and self-presence.

With time, this problem will only become more severe as population density in urban centers grows. Social interactions play a very important role in determining how infectious diseases spread, and organization of people along social lines gives rise to non-spatial networks in which the infections spread. Infection networks are different for diseases with different transmission modes, but are likely to be identical or highly similar for diseases that spread the same way. Hence, infection networks estimated from common infections can be useful to contain epidemics of a more severe disease with the same transmission mode. Here we present a proof-of-concept study demonstrating the effectiveness of epidemic mitigation based on such estimated infection networks. We first generate artificial social networks of different sizes and average degrees, but with roughly the same clustering characteristic. We then start SIR epidemics on these networks, censor the simulated incidences, and use them to reconstruct the infection network. We then efficiently fragment the estimated network by removing the smallest number of nodes identified by a graph partitioning algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this targeted strategy, by comparing it against traditional untargeted strategies, in slowing down and reducing the size of advancing epidemics.","output":"Equal Graph Partitioning on Estimated Infection Network as an Effective Epidemic Mitigation Measure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lifestyle changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic increased the risk of suffering from anxiety and depression.

Wearable sensors allow for direct measurement of upper limb (UL) performance in daily life. Objective. To map the trajectory of UL performance and its relationships to other factors post-stroke. Methods. Participants (n = 67) with first stroke and UL paresis were assessed at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks after stroke. Assessments captured UL impairment (Fugl-Meyer), capacity for activity (Action Research Arm Test), and performance of activity in daily life (accelerometer variables of use ratio and hours of paretic limb activity), along with other potential modifying factors. We modeled individual trajectories of change for each measurement level and the moderating effects on UL performance trajectories. Results. Individual trajectories were best fit with a 3-parameter logistic model, capturing the rapid growth early after stroke within the longer data collection period. Plateaus (90% of asymptote) in impairment (bootstrap mean  SE: 32  4 days post-stroke) preceded those in capacity (41  4 days). Plateau in performance, as measured by the use ratio (24  5 days), tended to precede plateaus in impairment and capacity. Plateau in performance, as measured by hours of paretic activity (41  6 days), occurred at a similar time to that of capacity and slightly lagged impairment. Modifiers of performance trajectories were capacity, concordance, UL rehabilitation, depressive symptomatology, and cognition. Conclusions. Upper limb performance in daily life approached plateau 3 to 6 weeks post-stroke.

They often need help from family members and friends to provide comprehensive care. When death occurs, funerals and other death-related rituals bring family and communities together to honor the life and mourn the death of a loved one and provide needed support to family and caregivers. These collective rituals are often deeply rooted in culturally-bound values and can facilitate grief and help make sense about loss. Rituals act as bridge-building activities that allow people to organize and appraise emotions, information, and actions after a loss. With the emergence of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the recommended restrictions to reduce infection and transmission, family members and caregivers are often faced with weighing options for honored rituals to help them grieve. Grieving during the pandemic has become disorganized. The purpose of this article is to provide case managers and other clinical staff with recommendations on guiding caregivers/families through safety precautions when a loved one dies either because of a life-limiting illness or from COVID-19 during the pandemic using guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The authors also present information about complicated grief and ways to support coping with death and suggest safe alternatives to traditional death-related rituals and funerals in a COVID-19 era. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING(S): Primary practice settings include home health care, hospice, hospital discharge planning, case management, and primary care. FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: Precautions necessary in a COVID-19 era may add anxiety and stress to an already difficult situation of caring for loved ones at end-of-life and grieving with their loss. Utilization of CDC guidelines lessens the risk of infection while honoring loved ones' wishes and cultural traditions surrounding death and burial.

This study evaluated whether specialized ECMO team is associated with improved in-hospital mortality in AMI patients undergoing veno-arterial (VA) ECMO. METHODS: A total of 255 AMI patients who underwent VA-ECMO were included. In January 2014, a multidisciplinary ECMO team was founded at our institution. Eligible patients were classified into a pre-ECMO team group (n = 131) and a post-ECMO team group (n = 124). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: In-hospital mortality (pre-ECMO team vs. post-ECMO team, 54.2% vs. 33.9%; p = 0.002) and cardiac intensive care unit mortality (pre-ECMO team vs. post-ECMO team, 51.9% vs. 30.6%; p = 0.001) were significantly lower after the implementation of a multidisciplinary ECMO team. On multivariable logistic regression model, implementation of the multidisciplinary ECMO team was associated with reduction of in-hospital mortality [odds ratio: 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20C0.67; p = 0.001].

The three components are (a) nearly simultaneous self-testing for the pathogen by an entire population, followed rapidly by (b) nearly simultaneous self-isolation of carriers, and (c) secondary screening at entrances to facilities where people congregate. After a period of preparation lasting roughly 5-10 weeks, these steps could and probably should be taken in a single day. The power of this methodology has already been demonstrated in varying degrees with groups ranging in size from 1,000 to 11 million. Although this plan might seem daunting, its costs are minimal compared to the losses we have incurred by relying on half measures, and the US and other countries have the technological, logistical, and industrial capacities to implement this plan in a matter of weeks. With proper messaging during the weeks leading up to the testing, compliance in such a program is likely to be high given the potential benefits, and because participation is voluntary and testing is noninvasive, the legal and ethical issues associated with such a program are minimal - trivial, in fact, compared to those associated with imposing a months-long lockdown on an entire population. A SIRD/CSP model suggests that the single-day testing and separation procedure will substantially lower the number of infections, even if compliance with the procedure is modest. Modeling also suggests that when long-term secondary screening is added to the 1-day procedure, over time, the pathogen is eradicated from the population. This can occur even when compliance with secondary screening is itself relatively low.","output":"How SARS-CoV-2 and Comparable Pathogens Can Be Defeated in a Single Day: Description and Mathematical Model of the Carrier Separation Plan (CSP)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak as a pandemic due to its uncontrolled global spread. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is a laboratory test that is widely used for the diagnosis of this deadly disease. However, the limited availability of testing kits and qualified staff and the drastically increasing number of cases have hampered massive testing. To handle COVID19 testing problems, we apply the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence to achieve self-adaptive, secure, and fast resource allocation, real-time tracking, remote screening, and patient monitoring. In addition, we implement a cloud platform for efficient spectrum utilization. Thus, we propose a cloud based intelligent system for remote COVID-19 screening using cognitive radio-based Internet of Things and deep learning. Specifically, a deep learning technique recognizes radiographic patterns in chest computed tomography (CT) scans. To this end, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization is applied to an input CT scan followed by bilateral filtering to enhance the spatial quality. The image quality assessment of the CT scan is performed using the blind/referenceless image spatial quality evaluator. Then, a deep transfer learning model, VGG-16, is trained to diagnose a suspected CT scan as either COVID-19 positive or negative. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed VGG-16 model outperforms existing COVID-19 screening models regarding accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The results obtained from the proposed system can be verified by doctors and sent to remote places through the Internet.","output":"Screening of COVID-19 Patients Using Deep Learning and IoT Framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, particularly vaccines, have caused an 'infodemic' online;a rapid and vast spread of unreliable information.

It has been proven that arterial hypertension, as one of the significant risk factors for the development of concomitant cardiovascular diseases, is associated with a more severe prognosis of COVID-19. This article presents the results of modern studies and large meta- analyzes of necessity and safety of the use of blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in patients with arterial hypertension and COVID-19.

Caregivers provided quantitative and qualitative responses to questions regarding training, information, and services received in relation to their child's sleep. Caregivers also reported on the factors and strategies they perceived as most important for helping children in their care sleep well. RESULTS: Only 13% of caregivers reported receiving any information/education about sleep from agencies or case workers, whereas 55% had sought help from a health provider related to their child's sleep. Nearly half of all caregivers (46%) reported giving their child melatonin. Caregivers reported that a bedtime routine/consistency, reassurance of safety/love, and a calming environment were most important for helping their child sleep well. A recurrent theme in qualitative responses was a need to mitigate child fear/anxiety at night.

Typically a\\"reservoir\\"is comprised of a large number of dynamical systems, and is consequently high-dimensional. In this work, we use just a single simple low-dimensional dynamical system, namely a driven pendulum, as a potential reservoir to implement reservoir computing. Remarkably we demonstrate, through numerical simulations, as well as a proof-of-principle experimental realization, that one can successfully perform learning tasks using this single system. The underlying idea is to utilize the rich intrinsic dynamical patterns of the driven pendulum, especially the transient dynamics which has so far been an untapped resource. This allows even a single system to serve as a suitable candidate for a\\"reservoir\\". Specifically, we analyze the performance of the single pendulum reservoir for two classes of tasks: temporal and non-temporal data processing. The accuracy and robustness of the performance exhibited by this minimal one-node reservoir in implementing these tasks strongly suggest a new direction in designing the reservoir layer from the point of view of efficient applications. Further, the simplicity of our learning system offers an opportunity to better understand the framework of reservoir computing in general and indicates the remarkable machine learning potential of even a single simple nonlinear system.","output":"Machine Learning Potential of a Single Pendulum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The health service of EU member states facing numerous challenges.

METHODS: Data of 45,161 Brazilian adults from a nationwide behavior survey, conducted between April 24th and May 24th (2020), were used. Participants reported physical inactivity (PI; <150 min/week), high TV-viewing (TV; &#8805;4 h/day), and high computer/tablet use (PC; &#8805;4 h/day) before and during COVID-19 quarantine (exposures). For incidence indicators, we only considered participants without the risk behavior before quarantine. Changes in sleep quality during the quarantine period (maintained/got better or worsened) were treated as a mediator. Elevated frequencies of feelings of loneliness, sadness (feel sad, crestfallen, or depressed), and anxiety (feel worried, anxious, or nervous) during the pandemic period were the study outcomes. Analyses were adjusted for sex, age group, highest academic achievement, working status during quarantine, skin color, previous diagnosis of depression, and adherence to quarantine. Mediation models were created using the Karlson Holm Breen method. RESULTS: The incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use were associated with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety feelings. Worsening sleep quality partly mediated the association of the incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use with loneliness (PI:30.9%; TV:19.6%; PC: 30.5%), sadness (PI:29.8%; TV:29.3%; PC: 39.1%), and anxiety (PI:21.9%; TV:30.0%; PC:38.5%).

Orthostatic hypotension and other abnormal cardiovascular responses may be early markers of Lewy body disease. We aimed to assess whether abnormal blood pressure and heart rate responses to orthostatic challenge and Valsalva manoeuvre would be more common in mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB) than MCI due to Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD). METHODS MCI patients (n = 89) underwent longitudinal clinical assessment with differential classification of probable MCI-LB, possible MCI-LB, or MCI-AD, with objective autonomic function testing at baseline. Blood pressure and heart rate responses to active stand and Valsalva manoeuvre were calculated from beat-to-beat cardiovascular data, with abnormalities defined by current criteria, and age-adjusted group differences estimated with logistic models. RESULTS Orthostatic hypotension and abnormal heart rate response to orthostatic challenge were not more common in probable MCI-LB than MCI-AD. Heart rate abnormalities were likewise not more common in response to Valsalva manoeuvre in probable MCI-LB. An abnormal blood pressure response to Valsalva (delayed return to baseline/absence of overshoot after release of strain) was more common in probable MCI-LB than MCI-AD. In secondary analyses, magnitude of blood pressure drop after active stand and 10-s after release of Valsalva strain were weakly correlated with cardiac sympathetic denervation.

METHODS A systematic review of literature was conducted until April 24th , 2020. From 6,843 articles, 49 studies were selected for a pooled assessment; cumulative statistics for age and sex were retrieved in 587,790 and 602,234 cases. Two endpoints were defined: 1) a composite outcome including death, severe presentation, hospitalization in intensive care unit (ICU) and/or mechanical ventilation; 2) in-hospital mortality. We extracted numeric data on patients' characteristics and cases with adverse outcomes and employed inverse variance random effects models to derive pooled estimates. RESULTS We identified 18 and 12 factors associated with the composite endpoint and death, respectively. Among those, a history of CVD (odds ratio (OR)=3.15, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 2.26-4.41), acute cardiac (OR=10.58, 5.00-22.40) or kidney (OR=5.13, 1.78-14.83) injury, increased procalcitonin (OR=4.8, 2.034-11.31) or D-dimer (OR=3.7, 1.74-7.89), and thrombocytopenia (OR=6.23, 1.031-37.67) conveyed the highest odds for the adverse composite endpoint. Advanced age, male sex, cardiovascular comorbidities, acute cardiac or kidney injury, lymphocytopenia and D-dimer conferred an increased risk of in-hospital death. With respect to the treatment of the acute phase, therapy with steroids was associated with the adverse composite endpoint (OR=3.61, 95% CI 1.934-6.73), but not with mortality.

This contributed to a virtual cessation of elective surgery during the pandemic surge. To inform evidence-based guidance on the decisions for surgery during the recovery phase of the pandemic, we compare 30-day outcomes in patients testing positive for COVID-19 before their operation, to contemporary propensity-matched COVID-19 negative patients undergoing the same procedures. METHODS: This prospective multicentre study included all patients undergoing surgery at 170 Veterans Health Administration (VA) hospitals across the United States. COVID-19 positive patients were propensity matched to COVID-19 negative patients on demographic and procedural factors. We compared 30-day outcomes between COVID-19 positive and negative patients, and the effect of time from testing positive to the date of procedure (&#8804;10 days, 11-30 days and >30 days) on outcomes. RESULTS: Between March 1 and August 15, 2020, 449 COVID-19 positive and 51,238 negative patients met inclusion criteria. Propensity matching yielded 432 COVID-19 positive and 1256 negative patients among whom half underwent elective surgery. Infected patients had longer hospital stays (median seven days), higher rates of pneumonia (20.6%), ventilator requirement (7.6%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 17.1%), septic shock (13.7%), and ischemic stroke (5.8%), while mortality, reoperations and readmissions were not significantly different. Higher odds for ventilation and stroke persisted even when surgery was delayed 11-30 days, and for pneumonia, ARDS, and septic shock >30 days after a positive test. DISCUSSION: 30-day pulmonary, septic, and ischaemic complications are increased in COVID-19 positive, compared to propensity score matched negative patients. Odds for several complications persist despite a delay beyond ten days after testing positive. Individualized risk-stratification by pulmonary and atherosclerotic comorbidities should be considered when making decisions for delaying surgery in infected patients.","output":"Periprocedural complications in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to those without infection: A nationwide propensity-matched analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, is a pandemic disease and affecting all people in the world Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is the standard clinical tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 Computed Tomography (CT) is an alternative method to RT-PCR test for the diagnosis of COVID-19 due to some disadvantages of the RT-PCR test In this method, the target is to determine coronavirus pneumonia from CT images However, high noise decreases the image quality, so a noise reduction filter is used The wavelet functions are widely used to reduce noise in images In this study, a performance comparison of the different wavelet functions in CT image denoising is proposed Significant remarks are obtained from the analysis to improve the quality for CT exams of COVID-19 disease","output":"A comparative study on wavelet denoising for high noisy CT images of COVID-19 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was to investigate secondary school students? and teachers? access to information technologies in Turkey by making interregional comparisons.

Little is known about providing end-of-life care for people with PIMD. The aim of this study was to explore health practitioners perspectives and practices relating to end-of-life decision-making and planning for people with PIMD. METHODS: Seven in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with health practitioners employed in a range of hospital and community services throughout Melbourne, Australia. Questions were designed to gather information about their experience, perceptions, and attitudes relating to people with PIMD during and at the end of their life. Each interview, ranging from 40 to 60 min in length, was audio recorded and transcribed. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged: limited participation, bias, dignity, and quality of death. Health practitioners indicated that people with PIMD are frequently excluded from participating in decision-making related to end-of-life care. Participants discussed reasons for this exclusion including challenges with communication and cognition. Participants reported a need for additional support and guidance in providing care for people with PIMD at the end of life. Professional and family bias played a role in end-of-life decision-making for people with PIMD. Participants reported a disproportional focus by palliative care practitioners on physical as opposed to emotional and spiritual well-being for patients with PIMD at the end of life. Finally, participants reported that people with PIMD generally did not die in specialised palliative care settings, but in segregated supported living environments. CONCLUSIONS: Due to negative perceptions of a person with PIMDs decision-making capacity, people with PIMD are likely to be assessed as unable to express choice and preference regarding end-of-life care and are offered limited opportunity to be involved in their own end-of-life care. This research provides guidance for the development of training and professional development relating to people with PIMD at the end of life. It is hoped that this will increase the accessibility of end-of-life services for people with PIMD, ensuring that a respectful and dignified death can be a reality for all humankind regardless of disability.

The study has been conducted to analyze the resilient teff value chain across teff supply chain members from production to consumption by comparing two production areas in Ethiopia. Cross-sectional descriptive surveys at different stages of the supply chain are identified. Data collection has been made based on the purposive sampling technique. It has then, analyzed the data and reach on conclusion. The findings revealed that wealth was not accumulated by farmers to create a sustainable supply of Teff to the consumers which is not enough to respond to the demand gap created in the event of supply chain disruption. Teff value chain analysis also indicated that consumers have low price expectations of Teff regardless of its high price at the retail shop. Since March 2020 Due to COVID 19 prevalence in Ethiopia, lockdown that disrupts goods and people move from rural to urban has resulted in a sharp Teff price increase from an average of 4200 per Quintal to 5000 Birr per Quintal in just one month at the retail shop. This has significantly benefited downstream supply chain members like wholesalers and retailers by hoarding Teff supply to consumers until regulatory bodies took action on price hikes by retailers.

For the purposes of evaluation of crowd experiments, it is paramount that we distinguish between different dimensions of their validity. Here, we differentiate between four types of experimentation in crowd dynamics based on their underlying purpose of investigation. This includes experiments whose main aim is (i) testing a behavioural theory/hypothesis, (ii) exploring empirical behavioural regularities; (iii) assessing collective (system-level) performance rather than individual behaviour (iv) calibrating and/or validating pre-existing models. While delineating various dimensions of external/internal validity as they relate to crowd experiments, we argue how the importance of different validity dimensions varies depending on investigation purpose. This could provide clarity about circumstances where artificiality of laboratory settings is justified as opposed to experiments for which higher levels of contextual fidelity should be given more weight. It is critical that investigators (a) be conscious of the trade-off between controllability and realism in their experiment design and (b) identify potential factors that can jeopardise validity of their experiments and mitigate them. Inferences made from field data do not invariably supersede those of experiments on the issue of validity. Depending on the purpose of investigation, maintaining internal validity sometimes necessitates laboratory settings and justifies artificiality. In the absence of adequate control over the causal relationship, the question of external validity will be futile.

Abnormalities on chest CT were detected among 35 of the 69 patients (50.7%) after admission, except for one pregnant woman had not been examined. 4 (4/70, 5.7%) and 8 (8/70, 11.4%) cases showed leucopenia and lymphopenia. With the effective antiviral treatment, all the 70 asymptomatic infections had been discharged, none cases developed severe pneumonia, admission to intensive care unit, or died. The mean time from nucleic acid positive to negative was 13.26.84 days. Cox regression analysis showed that smoking history (P=0.028, hazard ratio=4.49, 95% CI 1.18-17.08) and existence of pulmonary disease (P=0.038, hazard ratio=7.09, 95% CI 1.12-44.90) were risk factors of the onset of symptoms in asymptomatic carries. Conclusion: The initially asymptomatic patients can develop mild symptoms and have a good prognosis. History of smoking and pulmonary disease was prone to illness onset in asymptomatic patients, and it is necessary to be highly vigilant to those patients.","output":"Determination of risk factors for predicting the onset of symptoms in asymptomatic COVID-19 infected patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unique challenges for the clinical trial community, both in the rapid establishment of COVID-19 clinical trials and many existing non-COVID-19 studies either being temporarily paused (whether that is a complete pause or pause in some activities) and/or adapting their processes. Trial managers have played a key role in decision-making, undertaking risk assessments and adapting trial processes, working closely with other members of the research team. This article presents some of the ways in which trial management processes have been altered and the key role that trial managers have played. It has been born out of discussions between trial managers in the UK who are members of the UK Trial Managers Network (UKTMN), a national network of trial management professionals managing non-commercial trials. In these unprecedented times, clinical trials have faced many uncertainties and broad-ranging challenges encompassing a range of activities including prioritising patient safety amidst the pandemic, consenting and recruiting new participants into trials, data collection and management and intervention delivery. In many cases, recruitment has been paused whilst mitigations have been put in place to continue data collection. Innovative solutions have been implemented to ensure we continue, where possible, to deliver high-quality clinical trials. Technology has provided many solutions to these challenges, and trial managers have adapted to new ways of working whilst continuing to deliver their clinical trials. Trial management groups are now faced with new uncertainties around re-starting clinical trials, and it is unclear currently how this will go, though working together with sponsors, funders and site teams is clearly a priority. Clinical trial teams have worked together to ensure their trials have adapted quickly whilst ensuring participant safety is given utmost importance. There are clear examples where the trial community have come together to share experiences and expertise, and this should continue in the future to ensure the innovative practices developed become embedded in the design and conduct of clinical trials in the future.","output":"It is unprecedented: trial management during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the causative agent of COVID-19, now represents the sixth Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 2009. Considering that SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted via the mucosal route, a therapy administered by this same route may represent a desirable approach to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is now widely accepted that genetically modified microorganisms, including probiotics, represent attractive vehicles for oral or nasal mucosal delivery of therapeutic molecules. Previous studies have shown that the mucosal administration of therapeutic molecules is able to induce an immune response mediated by specific serum IgG and mucosal IgA antibodies along with mucosal cell-mediated immune responses, which effectively concur to neutralize and eradicate infections. Therefore, advances in the modulation of mucosal immune responses, and in particular the use of probiotics as live delivery vectors, may encourage prospective studies to assess the effectiveness of genetically modified probiotics for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Emerging trends in the ever-progressing field of vaccine development re-emphasize the contribution of adjuvants, along with optimization of codon usage (when designing a synthetic gene), expression level, and inoculation dose to elicit specific and potent protective immune responses. In this review, we will highlight the existing pre-clinical and clinical information on the use of genetically modified microorganisms in control strategies against respiratory and non-respiratory viruses. In addition, we will discuss some controversial aspects of the use of genetically modified probiotics in modulating the cross-talk between mucosal delivery of therapeutics and immune system modulation.","output":"Probiotic-Based Vaccines May Provide Effective Protection against COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted by inhalation of aerosols and can remain viable in the air for hours. Viruses can spread in dental settings and put professionals and patients at high risk of infection due to proximity and aerosol-generating procedures, and poor air ventilation. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a 1% hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) mouth rinse on reducing the intraoral SARS-CoV-2 load. METHODS: Portable air cleaners with HEPA filters exposed for 3 months were analysed to test for virus presence in a waiting room (where patients wore a face mask but did not undergo mouth rinsing) and three treatment rooms (where patients wore no mask but carried out mouth rinsing). As CO(2) is co-exhaled with aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 by COVID-19 infected people, we also measured CO(2) as a proxy of infection risk indoors. Specific primer and probe RT-PCR were applied to detect viral genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the filters. Specifically, we amplified the nucleocapsid gene (Nuclv) of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: CO(2) levels ranged from 860 to 907 ppm, thus indicating low ventilation and the risk of COVID-19 transmission. However, we only found viral load in filters from the waiting room and not from the treatment rooms. The results revealed the efficiency of 1-minute mouth rinsing with 1% H(2)O(2) since patients rinsed their mouths immediately after removing their mask in the treatment rooms. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that dental clinics would be safer and more COVID-19 free by implementing mouth rinsing 1 min with 1% H(2)O(2) immediately after the patients arrive at the clinic.","output":"Is hydrogen peroxide an effective mouthwash for reducing the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in dental clinics?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical development, the number of newly started clinical trials in each geographical region between January 2018 and December 2020 were calculated based on data from the ClinicalTrials.gov database.

They were divided into three groups: 35 patients, 196 family members and 224 hospital staffs. We extracted their epidemiological information, clinical records, auxiliary examination results and therapeutic schedules. RESULTS The median contact time for patients was four days and that for family members was five days. Cardiovascular disease accounted for 25% among original diseases of patients. Apart from hospital staffs, both patients and family members were isolated medically. During the quarantine, seven patients plus one family member appeared new respiratory symptoms, where fever was the most common one. The blood counts in most contacts were within a normal range. All CT images showed no sign of COVID-19 infection. No severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections was detected in 455 contacts by nucleic acid test.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs regulate the occurrence and development of various cancers and play an important role in GC progression. X-inactive specific transcript (XIST), a carcinogenic lncRNA, is involved in human tumourigenesis and is altered in GC. Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), a transcription factor, is involved in cancer cell metastasis and differentiation. However, the exact mechanism underlying the biological roles of XIST and JAK2 in cancer cells remains unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study was conducted using GES-1, HGC-27, AGS and HEK-293 T cells. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were performed to detect XIST, microRNA-337 (miR-337) and JAK2 expressions. GC cell invasion was investigated by using the Transwell assay. Fluorescein reporter gene detection was used to determine the relationship between JAK2 and XIST. RESULTS Compared with that in GES-1 cells, XIST expression was significantly up-regulated in AGS and HGC-27 cells. miR-337 expression in GC cell lines was decreased. The proliferation, invasion and migration of GC cells were simultaneously inhibited by XIST knockdown, and the relationship between XIST and miR-337 was confirmed by bioinformatics analysis. JAK2 is expected to be the target gene of miR-337. MiR-337 can negatively regulate JAK2 expression in vitro. In addition, si-XIST decreased JAK2 expression by up-regulating miR-337 in vitro, thereby inhibiting GC cell proliferation and migration. Therefore, we speculated that XIST regulates JAK2 by competing with miR-337 as a competitive endogenous lncRNA in GC. CONCLUSION We elucidated the effects of migration and invasion after XIST inhibition, at least in part, by inhibiting miR-337 expression in GC cells to regulate JAK2. These data indicate that a positive feedback loop exists between XIST and JAK2 and suggest that JAK2 and XIST play a vital role in cancer cell migration and invasion.","output":"The lncRNA XIST promotes proliferation, migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells by targeting miR-337."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The potential relationship between external and internal spaces in the architectural environment of the post-pandemic era is emerging as an essential issue. Since the early 20th century, the issue of transparency inside and outside architecture has been explored in various fields. This study is motivated by the lack of a leading theory about architectural transparency in the post-pandemic era. First, it revisits the notion of phenomenal transparency in Colin Rowe and Robert Slutzkys influential text on literal and phenomenal transparency. Next, it investigates Maurice Merleau-Pontys phenomenology for architectural transparency. Last, it scrutinizes practical possibilities using cases from Sejima and Nishizawa and Associates (SAANA). It finds that intertwining the cognition of natural environment and spatial experiential perceptions can create phenomenological architectural experiences. Sustainable architectural transparency may be accomplished when three factors (the visual perception of space, spatial experiential perceptions, and the cognition of natural environment) are incorporated. Further, depth functions as a medium for architectural transparency, intertwining between material and immaterial, literal and phenomenal, and visible and invisible.

Due to the importance of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation during electro-Fenton oxidation, effects of pH, current density, molecular oxygen (O2) flow rate, and anode material on H2O2 generation were evaluated. H2O2 generation was enhanced by increasing the current density up to 60 mA/cm2 and the O2 flow rate up to 80 mL/min at pH 3.0 and using carbon felt cathode and boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode. Electro-Fenton-BDD oxidation achieved the total CLQ depletion and 92% total organic carbon (TOC) removal. Electro-Fenton-BDD oxidation was more effective than electro-Fenton-Pt and anodic oxidation using Pt and BDD anodes. The efficiency of CLQ depletion by electro-Fenton-BDD oxidation raises by increasing the current density and Fe2+ dose; however it drops with the increase of pH and CLQ concentration. CLQ depletion follows a pseudo-first order kinetics in all the experiments. The identification of CLQ degradation intermediates by chromatography methods confirms the formation of 7-chloro-4-quinolinamine, oxamic, and oxalic acids. Quantitative amounts of chlorides, nitrates, and ammonium ions are released during electro-Fenton oxidation of CLQ. The high efficiency of electro-Fenton oxidation derives from the generation of hydroxyl radicals from the catalytic decomposition of H2O2 by Fe2+ in solution, and the electrogeneration of hydroxyl and sulfates radicals and other strong oxidants (persulfates) from the oxidation of the electrolyte at the surface BDD anode. Electro-Fenton oxidation has the potential to be an alternative method for treating wastewaters contaminated with CLQ and its derivatives.","output":"Efficient degradation of chloroquine drug by electro-Fenton oxidation: Effects of operating conditions and degradation mechanism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The freezing phenomenon has a dramatic impact on the quality of freeze-dried products. Several freezing models applied to solutions in vials have been proposed to predict the resulting product morphology and describe heat transfer mechanisms. However, there is a lack of detailed experimental observations of the freezing phenomenon in vials in the literature. Thus, the present work offers new experimental observations of the freezing phenomenon in vials by infrared (IR) thermography. IR imaging allowed each vials whole axial temperature profile to be collected during freezing, providing significant insights into the process. Spontaneous nucleation and vacuum-induced surface freezing (VISF), as a controlled nucleation technique, are investigated. Batches having vials in direct contact with the shelf (exchanging heat mainly through conduction) as well as suspended (exchanging heat mainly through natural convection and radiation) were tested. The study used three solutions: sucrose 5%, mannitol 5%, and dextran 10%.

To keep our economy running, especially in difficult times of epidemics, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is of utmost importance to keep ships sailing, moving the bulk of goods including medical supplies and food. Every month, around 100,000 seafarers need to disembark from the ships that they operate to comply with regulations governing safe working hours and crew welfare, and another 100,000 seafarers will embark to continue to move the global trade safely. However, as countries around the world tighten border controls in against the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, seafarers are prohibited from boarding or leaving ships at most ports, with the exception of just a few. This situation is leading seafarers to serve onboard vessels beyond their contracted shifts. Given that more than a quarter of seafarers suffer from depression because of their long time spent at sea and being away from family and friends, banning crew changes will put their mental health at risk. This will further increase the likelihood of marine accidents, jeopardize global supply chains, and ultimately exacerbate current hardships. To tackle this emergency, the International Maritime Organization and the European Commission, amongst others, call on governments to coordinate efforts to designate ports for crew changes while preventing the potential spread of the coronavirus. The aim of the study is to develop a framework that integrates big data, machine learning, and operational research for governments and supranational organizations to choose ports for crew changes, safeguarding seafarers welfare, and strengthening the global response to the threats of epidemics. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","output":"Modeling Seafarer Change at Seaports in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The acute respiratory disease induced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global epidemic in just less than a year by the first half of 2020. The subsequent efficient human-to-human transmission of this virus eventually affected millions of people worldwide. The most devastating thing is that the infection rate is continuously uprising and resulting in significant mortality especially among the older age population and those with health co-morbidities. This enveloped, positive-sense RNA virus is chiefly responsible for the infection of the upper respiratory system. The virulence of the SARS-CoV-2 is mostly regulated by its proteins like entry to the host cell through fusion mechanism, fusion of infected cells with neighboring uninfected cells to spread the virus, inhibition of host gene expression, cellular differentiation, apoptosis, mitochondrial biogenesis, etc. But very little is known about the protein structures and functionalities. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to learn more about these proteins through bioinformatics approaches. In this study, ORF10, ORF7b, ORF7a, ORF6, membrane glycoprotein, and envelope protein have been selected from a Bangladeshi Corona-virus strain G039392 and a number of bioinformatics tools (MEGA-X-V10.1.7, PONDR?, ProtScale, ProtParam, SCRIBER, NetSurfP v2.0, IntFOLD, UCSF Chimera, and PyMol) and strategies were implemented for multiple sequence alignment and phylogeny analysis with 9 different variants, predicting hydropathicity, amino acid compositions, protein-binding propensity, protein disorders, 2D and 3D protein modeling. Selected proteins were characterized as highly flexible, structurally and electrostatically extremely stable, ordered, biologically active, hydrophobic, and closely related to the proteins of different variants.

This manuscript is an attempt to study the various structural, physical, and chemical properties of the molecules. The molecule was optimized using B3LYP functional with 6-311G + (2d,p) basis set. Excited state properties of the compound were studied using CAM-B3LYP functional with same basis sets using IEFPCM model in methanol for the implicit solvent atmosphere. The various electronic descriptors helped to identify the reactivity behavior and stability. The compound is found to possess good nonlinear optical properties in the gas phase. The various intramolecular electronic delocalizations and non-covalent interactions were analyzed and explained. As the compound contain several heterocyclic nitrogen atoms, they have potential proton abstraction features, which was analyzed energetically. The most important result from this study is from the molecular docking analysis which indicates that rimegepant binds irreversibly with three established SARS-CoV-2 proteins with ID 6LU7, 6M03, and 6W63 with docking scores ? 9.2988, ? 8.3629, and ? 9.5421 kcal/mol respectively. Further assessment of docked complexes with molecular dynamics simulations revealed that hydrophobic interactions, water bridges, and ШC interactions play a significant role in stabilizing the ligand within the binding region of respective proteins. MMGBSA-free energies further demonstrated that rimegepant is more stable when complexed with 6LU7 among the selected PDB models.

Given the remarkable heterogeneity of the host inflammatory response in this viral syndrome and the widespread expression of ABO/Rh antigens on vascular and alveolar endothelial cells, it is biologically plausible that certain blood group phenotypes, with their unique repertoire of anti-A and/or anti-B antibodies, may differentially augment the host-pathogen response. We conducted a retrospective review of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 within our regional healthcare network in San Diego County to identify an association between ABO/Rh blood group type and the severity of infection. Methods: All patients hospitalized at one of five Scripps Health hospitals in San Diego County from March 1, 2020 to July 30, 2020 with a PCR confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and blood type on record were included in the initial analysis (n = 316). Demographic, laboratory and clinical data were extracted from the electronic medical record and included age, ethnicity, BMI, sex, medications, co-morbidities and admission white blood cell and lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, platelets, ESR, CRP and D-dimer. Outcomes of interest included length of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation need, and mortality. Significant associations between each parameter of interest and blood group type were determined using either linear or logistic regression analysis. To address potential confounding variables, an adjusted multivariate model accounting for potential significant (p< 0.1) predictors of each outcome on univariate analysis, in addition to blood type groups, was conducted to further refine any associations. The study was approved by the Scripps Health Institutional Review Board. Results: 316 patients met inclusion criteria for analysis. Hospitalized COVID patients were predominantly male, obese (BMI 30.6) and were an average age of 63 years. Almost 70% of patients hospitalized were Hispanic. 57.0% of patients were blood type O, 30.4% were type A, 3.8% were type B and 8.9% were type AB. 7% were Rh negative. Median length of hospital stay was 16.514.7 days, 59% were admitted to the ICU, 37% were intubated, and 27% died. Further relevant laboratory values on admission, co-morbidities, and medications administered during hospitalization are summarized in Table 1. Blood type, with or without adjusting for other clinical variables, was not predictive of length of hospital stay, ICU admission, or intubation during the hospitalization. Type B blood alone was associated with decreased odds of death (OR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.06-0.85, p<0.05), though this effect was not seen after adjusting for significant confounding variables (OR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.08-1.43, p>0.18). Conclusion: In this large, multi-hospital, retrospective analysis of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in San Diego County, there was a low relative percentage of Rh negative blood type and type B blood compared to historical population averages. Blood type was not determined to be independently associated with hospital length of stay, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission or death. ABO/Rh blood typing appears to have a limited prognostic role in COVID-19 severity of hospitalized patients, though further analysis of the protective effects of type B and/or Rh negative blood type may be warranted in a larger sample.

METHODS: Data were collected both prospectively and retrospectively from both primary and secondary care over an 8-week period from June to August 2020. RESULTS: In primary care CUES in Greater Manchester (GM) 2461 patients were assessed, with a majority self-referring to the service (68.7%, n = 1844). 91.7% of cases initially screened for CUES were deemed eligible and given a telemedicine appointment in GM; 53.3% of these cases required face-to-face consultation. 14.3% of cases seen within in GM CUES (351 out of 2461) were provisionally referred to secondary care. Contemporaneously the main provider emergency eyecare department (EED) attendances were reduced by 37.7% per month between April and December 2020 inclusive, compared to the same months in 2019. Patients attending a CUES face-to-face assessment were more likely to have a diagnosis in agreement with secondary care, compared to patients referred in from telemedicine assessment only (P < 0.05).

One way the pandemic can be mitigated is through vaccination of the general population. Yet, some young adults have been slow to choose to be vaccinated. As has been demonstrated, simple availability of the COVID-19 vaccine will not guarantee its uptake, especially among marginalized populations. In order to better understand the nuances of vaccination among youth in foster care and recent foster care alumni, we conducted in-depth, semi-structured focus groups and interviews with 23 parenting youth with foster care histories aged 18-26 years. Data regarding vaccine attitudes were analyzed using thematic analysis. Participating youth, who were majority Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) and often lived in multigenerational households, had significant concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine. They expressed varying degrees of intention to get vaccinated. Young people, especially those who belong to marginalized populations, need opportunities to openly discuss their vaccination-related questions without judgment. Science communicators should consider these questions and address youths concerns through diverse voices and channels to ensure youth have the information they need to make an informed decision regarding COVID-19 vaccination.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccination Perspectives Among Young Parents with Foster Care Backgrounds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this article is to detail the measures taken in public institutions to cope with the COVID-19 epidemic.

METHODS: We used comparative analysis of microsatellites (short tandem repeats [STRs]), sex chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for fetal (-fetoprotein [AFP]) and maternal (immunoglobulin M [IgM]) serum proteins to distinguish the origin of IVTs. Using an informatics approach, we tested the association between IVTs and fetomaternal hemorrhage (FMH). RESULTS: In 9 of 10 cases, the preponderance of evidence showed that the thrombus was mostly or entirely maternal in origin. In 1 case, the thrombus was of mixed origins. STR testing was prone to contamination by entrapped fetal villi. FISH was useful but limited only to cases with male fetuses. IgM showed stronger staining than AFP in 9 cases, supporting maternal origin. By informatics, we found no association between IVTs and FMH.

Air purification devices are necessary to remove and/or inactivate airborne biological species from indoor air environment. Corona discharge in an electrostatic precipitator is capable of removing particulate matter and disinfecting biological aerosols to act as electrostatic disinfector (ESD). The ions generated by ESD can effectively inactivate bacteria/viruses. However, the available research rarely investigated disinfection effect of ESD, and it is urgent to develop quantitative ESD design methods for building mechanical ventilation applications. This study developed an integrated numerical model to simulate disinfection performance of ESD. The numerical model considers the ionized electric field, electrohydrodynamic flow, and biological disinfection. The model prediction was validated with the experimental data (E. coli): Good agreement was observed. The validated model then was used to study the influences of essential design parameters (e.g. voltage, inlet velocity) of ESD on disinfection efficiency. The effects of modeling of electrophoretic force and EHD (electrohydrodynamic) flow patterns on disinfection efficiency and computing time were also analyzed. The disinfection efficiency of well-designed ESD (with space charge density of 3.610(?06) C/m(3)) could be as high as 100%.

However, the most effective types of IFNs and the underlying antiviral effectors remain to be defined. Here, we show that zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP), which preferentially targets CpG dinucleotides in viral RNA sequences, restricts SARS-CoV-2. We further demonstrate that ZAP and its cofactors KHNYN and TRIM25 are expressed in human lung cells. Type I, II, and III IFNs all strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 and further induced ZAP expression. Comprehensive sequence analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 and its closest relatives from horseshoe bats showed the strongest CpG suppression among all known human and bat coronaviruses, respectively. Nevertheless, endogenous ZAP expression restricted SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells, particularly upon treatment with IFN- or IFN-. Both the long and the short isoforms of human ZAP reduced SARS-CoV-2 RNA expression levels, but the former did so with greater efficiency. Finally, we show that the ability to restrict SARS-CoV-2 is conserved in ZAP orthologues of the reservoir bat and potential intermediate pangolin hosts of human coronaviruses. Altogether, our results show that ZAP is an important effector of the innate response against SARS-CoV-2, although this pandemic pathogen emerged from zoonosis of a coronavirus that was preadapted to the low-CpG environment in humans.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Is Restricted by Zinc Finger Antiviral Protein despite Preadaptation to the Low-CpG Environment in Humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the height of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, elective surgeries, including oncologic surgeries, were delayed. Little prospective data existed to guide practice, and professional surgical societies issued recommendations grounded mainly in common sense and expert consensus, such as medical therapy for early-stage breast and prostate cancer patients. To understand the patient experience of delay in cancer surgery during the pandemic, we interviewed breast and prostate cancer patients whose surgeries were delayed due to the pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with early-stage breast or prostate cancer who suffered surgical postponement at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) were invited to participate. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 21 breast and prostate cancer patients. Interviews were transcribed, and qualitative analysis using ground-theory approach was performed. RESULTS: Most patients reported significant distress due to cancer and COVID. Key themes that emerged included the lack of surprise and acceptance of the surgical delays but endorsed persistent cancer- and delay-related worries. Satisfaction with patient-physician communication and the availability of a delay strategy were key factors in patients' acceptance of the situation; perceived lack of communication prompted a few patients to seek care elsewhere. DISCUSSION: The clinical effect of delay in cancer surgery will take years to fully understand, but there are immediate steps that can be taken to improve the patient experience of delays in care, including elicitation of individual patient perspectives and ongoing communication. More work is needed to understand the wider experiences of patients, especially minority, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and uninsured patients, who encounter delays in oncologic care.","output":"Cancer in the Shadow of COVID: Early-Stage Breast and Prostate Cancer Patient Perspectives on Surgical Delays Due to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus of which evidence-based medical paradigms cannot be easily applied; difficult clinical decisions shall be required particularly in the 'difficult-to-treat' cases of high risk group with associated comorbidities.

Among responders, injected antigen induces acquired immunity pathways and leads to the final production of antigen-specific antibodies. The whole process may take weeks to months, depending on the antigen. Typically, seroconversion to influenza vaccine is expected after one month with a responder rate of ~50%. An early biomarker to predict response is desirable. Peripheral blood gene expression (or transcript abundance, TA) datasets in the public domain were analyzed for early biomarkers among responders. As peripheral blood samples (such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMC) are cell mixture samples containing various blood cell-types (leukocyte subpopulations, LS). We first develop a model that enables the determination of TA in B lymphocytes of certain genes directly in PBMC samples without the need of prior cell isolation. These genes are called B cell informative genes. Then a ratio of two B cell informative genes (a target gene and a stably expressed reference gene) measured in PBMC was used as a new biomarker to gauge the target gene expression in B lymphocytes. This method having an obvious advantage over conventional methods by eliminating the tedious procedure of cell sorting and enables directly determining TA of a leukocyte subpopulation in cell mixture samples is called Direct LS-TA method. By using a B lymphocyte-specific gene such as TNFRSF17 or TXNDC5 as target genes with either TNFRSF13C or FCRLA as reference genes, the B cell biomarkers were determined directly in PBMC which was highly correlated with TA of target genes in purified B lymphocytes. These Direct LS-TA biomarkers in PBMC increased significantly early after vaccination in both the discovery dataset and a meta-analysis of 7 datasets. Responders had almost a 2-fold higher Direct LS-TA biomarker level of TNFRSF17 (SMD=0.84, 95% CI=0.47-1.21 after log2). And Direct LS-TA biomarkers of TNFRSF17 and TXNDC5 measured at day 7 predict responder with sensitivity values of higher than 0.7. The Area-under curves (AUC) in receiver operation curve (ROC) analysis were over 0.8. Here, we report a straightforward approach to directly analyses B lymphocyte gene expression in PBMC, which could be used in a routine clinical setting as it avoids the labor-intensive procedures of B lymphocyte isolation. And the method allows the practice of precision medicine in the prediction of vaccination response. Furthermore, response to vaccination could be predicted as early as on day 7. As vaccination response is based on the similar acquired immunology pathway in the upcoming worldwide vaccination campaign against COVID-19, these biomarkers could also be useful to predict seroconversion for individuals.","output":"Direct measurement of B lymphocyte gene expression biomarkers in peripheral blood enables early prediction of seroconversion after vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the General Considerations: The purpose of this COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019] Aviation Health Safety Protocol is to provide guidance to airport operators, aircraft operators, and NCAs [national competent authorities], as well as other relevant authorities and stakeholders on how to facilitate the safe and gradual restoration of passenger air transport This restoration is subject to the deployment of proportionate and effective measures that reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2] transmission at the airport and on board aircraft, as much as practicably possible, to protect the health of passengers and aviation personnel The general situation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, including the implemented containment measures, the potential risk of being exposed to one or more infected individuals, and the need to deal with unfamiliar situations in the workplace, is likely to have a negative impact on the mental health and well-being of passengers and aviation personnel In this context, airport operators, aircraft operators and, where applicable, other service providers/suppliers should promote aviation personnel's access to counselling and/or support programmes (where available), and make use of the World Health Organization, EU-OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health Association] and any other relevant guidance Air travel--Health aspects;Travel restrictions;COVID-19 (Disease)","output":"COVID-19 Aviation Health Safety Protocol: Operational Guidelines for the Management of Air Passengers and Aviation Personnel in Relation to the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19, the ongoing global pandemic.

RP was defined as the positive result of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) after symptom resolution and discharge. Children were defined as being less than 18 years old. RESULTS: Fourteen out of 38 (36.8%) pediatric patients exhibited RP. Compared with the non-RP group (n = 24), the RP group (n = 14) had more family cluster infections, relatively higher white blood cell (WBC) count and longer plasma prothrombin time (PT), while age and gender were insignificant. T lymphocyte subclassification was observed at five-time points: the first test after admission, 2 weeks, and 1, 2, and 3 months after discharge.

However, to date, no study has investigated the association between problem gambling and functional disability. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between problem gambling and functional disability in a UK nationally representative sample. METHODS Cross-sectional data from the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey were analyzed. Problem gambling was assessed using a questionnaire including 10 DSM-IV criteria, whereas functional disability referred to at least 1 difficulty in 1 of 7 activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. Control variables included sociodemographic factors, smoking status, alcohol dependence, drug use, the number of chronic physical conditions, depression, and anxiety disorder. The problem gambling-functional disability relationship was studied using a logistic regression model. RESULTS This study included 6941 adults aged 16 years (51.2% women; mean [SD] age 46.3 [18.6] years). The prevalence of functional disability was significantly higher in the at-risk problem gambling/problem gambling group than in the no problem gambling group (46.2% vs 32.1%, P value < 0.001).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with a history of a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test was performed between March 1st, 2020 and October 31st, 2020. Patients were included if they presented within 90 days of their first positive COVID-19 test and underwent color fundus photography and/or OCT of the macula. All images were reviewed by two independent graders who assessed the presence of retinal heme, cotton wool spots, vascular sheathing, and disc edema, as well as hyper-reflective changes, intra-retinal fluid, and sub-retinal fluid on OCT. RESULTS: A total of 119 eyes from 61 patients were included. Among 83 eyes which underwent OCT of the macula, inner retinal hyper-reflective changes were seen in 16.9% (n=14), outer retinal hyper-reflective changes in 18.1% (n=15), intra-retinal fluid in 28.9% (n=24), and sub-retinal fluid in 14.5% (n=12).

One solution may be to decontaminate equipment such as facemasks for reuse. AIM: To collect and synthesize existing information on decontamination of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) using microwave and heat-based treatments, with special attention to impacts on mask function (aerosol penetration, airflow resistance), fit, and physical traits. METHODS: A systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42020177036) of literature available from Medline, Embase, Global Health, and other sources was conducted. Records were screened independently by two reviewers, and data was extracted from studies that reported on effects of microwave- or heat-based decontamination on N95 FFR performance, fit, physical traits, and/or reductions in microbial load. FINDINGS: Thirteen studies were included that used dry/moist microwave irradiation, heat, or autoclaving. All treatment types reduced pathogen load by a log10 reduction factor of at least three when applied for sufficient duration (>30 s microwave, >60 min dry heat), with most studies assessing viral pathogens. Mask function (aerosol penetration <5% and airflow resistance <25 mmH2O) was preserved after all treatments except autoclaving. Fit was maintained for most N95 models, though all treatment types caused observable physical damage to at least one model.

Fecal calprotectin is applied in the clinical management of inflammatory bowel disease whereas serum calprotectin has been discussed as a biomarker in inflammatory disorders. However, its long-term prognostic relevance in critical illness remains unclear. Our aim was to investigate serum calprotectin concentrations as a prognostic biomarker in critically ill and septic patients. Methods: Serum calprotectin concentrations were analyzed in 165 critically ill patients (108 with sepsis, 57 without sepsis) included in our observational study. Patients were enrolled upon admission to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of the RWTH Aachen University Hospital. Calprotectin concentrations were compared to 24 healthy controls and correlated with clinical parameters, therapeutic interventions, and survival. Results: Serum calprotectin concentrations were significantly increased in ICU patients as well as in septic patients compared to respective controls (p < 0.001 for ICU patients and p = 0.001 for septic patients). Lower calprotectin concentrations were measured in patients with comorbidities i.e., coronary artery disease. Calprotectin concentrations strongly correlated with the C-reactive protein (p < 0.001) and were closely associated to parameters of mechanical ventilation (i.a. inspiratory oxygen fraction, FiO(2); p < 0.001). The overall survival was significantly impaired in septic patients with high baseline calprotectin concentrations (p = 0.036). However, patients with increasing calprotectin serum concentrations within the first week of ICU admission showed an improved overall survival (p = 0.009). Conclusions: In summary, serum calprotectin concentrations are significantly increased in critically ill patients with sepsis. High calprotectin concentrations at ICU admission predict long-term mortality risk, whereas increasing calprotectin concentrations are associated with a favorable long-term outcome.","output":"Association of Serum Calprotectin Concentrations with Mortality in Critically Ill and Septic Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For many of us, COVID-19 markedly changed our world and how we operate in it daily While the behavioral health ramifications of this pandemic are not fully known, they have clearly had an impact For weeks, we all watched in disbelief as COVID-19 ambushed China, Italy, and other countries When President Trump implemented the March 16, 2020, live broadcast detailing plans of how our nation would address COVID-19, we knew that it was just a matter of time before we began to experience what we saw happening around the world Quickly, the escalation of COVID-19 in the United States caused a major shift for social work education, practice, and research Social workers are serving in critical roles during this pandemic and providing care for COVID-19 patients and their families The purpose of this article is to provide reflection on the disruptions, distractions, and challenges of a social worker serving in a leadership role on the frontlines at the Javits Center in New York during the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Reflections on a pandemic: Disruptions, distractions and challenges of a clinical social worker on the frontline in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While understanding of periodic travelling waves (PTW) of Covid-19 epidemics would aid to combat the pandemics, quantitative analysis of data over a two years period from the outbreak, is lacking.

Given that early reports from heavily affected areas demonstrated a very high mortality rate amongst kidney transplant recipients, ranging between 30% and 40%, we sought to evaluate outcomes at a center with a high burden of cases but not experiencing acute crisis due to COVID-19. PROCEDURES: In this single center retrospective observational study, medical records of all kidney transplant recipients at the UCLA Medical Center were reviewed for a diagnosis of COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction, followed by chart review to determine kidney transplant characteristics and clinical course. MAIN FINDINGS: A total of 41 kidney transplant recipients were identified with COVID-19 positive polymerase chain reaction. Recipients had been transplanted for a median of 47 months before diagnosis. The large proportion of infected individuals were minorities (Hispanic 65.9%, black 14.6%), on prednisone, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil (95.1%, 87.8%, and 87.8%, respectively), and had excellent allograft function (median 1.25 mg/dL). The most common presenting symptoms were fever, dyspnea, or cough. Most patients were hospitalized (63.4%); mortality was 9.8% and occurred only in patients in the intensive care unit. The most common treatment was reduction or removal of antimetabolite (77.8%). Approximately 26.9% presented with AKI. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection in kidney transplant recipients results in a higher rate of hospitalization and mortality than in the general population. In an area with a high number of infections, the mortality rate was lower compared with earlier reports from areas experiencing early surge and strain on the medical system. Minorities were disproportionately affected.

Personal protective equipment has been mandatory for healthcare workers in order to contain the outbreak of pandemic disease. Mild neurological disturbances such as headache have been related to the extensive utilization of facemask. This study aims to examine headache variations related to the intensive utilization of facemask among a cohort of healthcare professionals in a setting of low-medium risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study among healthcare providers from different hospital and clinics in Italy. Each participant completed a specifically designed self-administered questionnaire. Headache features and outcome measures change from baseline were evaluated over a 4-month period, in which wearing facemask has become mandatory for Italian healthcare workers. RESULTS: A total of 400 healthcare providers completed the questionnaire, 383 of them met the inclusion criteria. The majority were doctors, with a mean age of 33.4  9.2 years old. Among 166/383 subjects, who were headache free at baseline, 44 (26.5%) developed de novo headache. Furthermore, 217/383 reported a previous diagnosis of primary headache disorder: 137 were affected by migraine and 80 had tension-type headache. A proportion (31.3%) of these primary headache sufferers experienced worsening of their pre-existing headache disorder, mainly for migraine frequency and attack mean duration. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed the appearance of de novo associated facemask headache in previous headache-free subjects and an exacerbation of pre-existing primary headache disorders, mostly experienced by people with migraine disease.

This study aims to identify major changes in inpatient pediatric healthcare delivery and potential lessons learned. STUDY DESIGN: In this study, we conducted semi\\\\structured video interviews. We analyzed interview data using constant comparative methods to identify major healthcare delivery changes for hospitalized children during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. POPULATION STUDIED: We purposefully sampled clinicians from both community and children's hospitals serving pediatric patients in the 6 U.S. states with the highest COVID\\\\19 hospitalization rates at the onset of the pandemic (NY, NJ, DC, MA, CT, LA). We recruited 2 participants from each hospital to interview (mix of administrators, physicians, and nurses). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We interviewed 24 participants from 12 hospitals and identified several themes [Table 1]. They described how hospital leaders rapidly developed policies to: 1) ensure adequate staff for surges of COVID\\\\19 patients, 2) provide adequate care spaces and supplies, 3) direct use of personal protective equipment, and 4) guide medical management of COVID\\\\19 patients. Hospital leaders optimized communication by conducting regular meetings to discuss the current state of the pandemic, hospital operations, and policy changes. In the setting of declining volumes of hospitalized children, clinicians newly provided care for hospitalized adults. This was facilitated by developing care teams supported by adult hospitalists, educational resources, and telehealth supports. Participants described negative impacts of the pandemic on clinicians' mental health, as well as helpful supports for clinician well\\\\being, including mental health resources, wellness activities and spaces, and housing. Finally, participants described experiences managing multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children including diagnostic uncertainty and evolving management for this novel disease. CONCLUSIONS: We identified several changes in inpatient pediatric care delivery and potential lessons learned during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic: 1) optimizing communication aided in rapidly changing hospital policies, 2) developing new team models and educational resources helped clinicians in newly caring for hospitalized adults, and 3) providing wellness resources was helpful for supporting clinicians' mental health.

Subject and methods: A qualitative evidence synthesis was conducted to examine the phenomenon of adherence to quarantine focused on the following questions: What strategies affect adherence to quarantine? What are the barriers and facilitators to quarantine acceptance? What benefits and harms of quarantine have been described or measured? Results: The evidence synthesis produced 18 findings assessed with high confidence. The findings were used to construct a conceptual framework for inter- and within-organization coordination and public communication that includes the following topics for consideration: desired orientation for implementation; population demographics; perceptions of messages; prior acceptance of quarantine; likelihood of impacts of quarantine; perceptions of health infrastructure; and perceptions of policy importance.

International institutions and researchers have advocated that the strengthening of productive capacities in these countries would help them enhance the resilience of their economies to shocks, and promote sustainable development. The present paper has examined the effect of productive capacities on economic growth and economic growth volatility in developing countries, in particular when they face a high level of structural economic vulnerability. The analysis covers 117 developing countries over the period 2000-2018. It shows that productive capacities do not only promote economic growth, but also reduce economic growth volatility. On the other hand, structural economic vulnerability reduces economic growth, in particular when it exceeds a certain level, and induces greater volatility of economic growth. Interestingly, the findings suggest that productive capacities promote economic growth and reduce economic growth volatility in countries that face a high degree of structural economic vulnerability. These findings support the recommendation by international institutions and researchers that if they were to enhance the resilience of their economies to shocks, and promote sustainable economic growth, developing countries (in particular the poorest ones) should strengthen their productive capacities.","output":"Productive Capacities, Economic Growth and Economic Growth Volatility in Developing Countries: Does Structural Economic Vulnerability Matter?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current microbiologic diagnostics often fail to identify the etiology of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in hematopoietic cellular transplant recipients (HCT), which precludes the implementation of targeted therapies.

We enrolled 22 post-HCT adults ages 19-69 years with acute respiratory illnesses who underwent BAL at the University of Michigan between January 2012 and May 2013. mNGS was performed on BAL fluid to detect microbes and simultaneously assess the host transcriptional response. Results were compared against conventional microbiologic assays. mNGS demonstrated 100% sensitivity for detecting respiratory microbes (human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, human herpesvirus 6 and cytomegalovirus) when compared to standard testing. Previously unrecognized LRTI pathogens were identified in six patients for whom standard testing was negative (human coronavirus 229E, human rhinovirus A, Corynebacterium propinquum and Streptococcus mitis); findings were confirmed by independent PCR and 16S rRNA sequencing. Relative to patients without infection, patients with infection had increased expression of immunity related genes (p=0.022) and significantly lower diversity of their respiratory microbiome (p=0.017).

The use of web-based online-therapy has been shown to be useful to overcome caregiver's distress syndrome and further stimulate cognitive-motor recovery of SABI-patients. Our study aimed to investigate whether a systematic online Skype-therapy(OLST) may be of support in favoring global cognitive and sensory-motor recovery in SABI-patients and reducing caregiver distress. METHODS: Twenty-five SABI-subjects in inpatient regimen were provided with intensive OLST with the caregiver for 12 weeks in addition to standard neurorehabilitation. Each subject and caregiver was evaluated before and after the treatment by administering an ad hoc battery. Furthermore, 18 of 27 patients were provided with EEG recording in resting state. RESULTS: We found a significant reduction in caregiver's anxiety (p<0.0001) and burden(p<0.0001). Patients showed significant improvement in trunk control (p<0.0001), functional independence (p = 0.005), functional (p = 0.01) and global communication (p = 0.004), cognitive functioning (p = 0.001), and behavioral responsiveness (p = 0.0004). The training yielded a significant connectivity change within the fronto-centro-parietal areas in the delta frequency band (p<0.0001) and the centro-parieto-occipital areas in the alpha range (p = 0.004). DISCUSSION: OLST may be a useful and complementary treatment to optimize global cognitive and functional recovery in SABI-subjects and reduce caregivers' concerns in the Covid-era. OLST can foster cognitive-motor recovery potentially by favoring the plasticity-dependent functional recovery. Therefore, OLST could be proposed as a tool allowing social conversations also in the hospital setting.","output":"'Online therapy' to reduce caregiver's distress and to stimulate post-severe acquired brain injury motor and cognitive recovery: A Sicilian hospital experience in the COVID era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Logbooks are ubiquitous in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education.

It has been reported that CoVs exhibit variable sensitivity to nsp14-ExoN deficiency. Betacoronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV were viable upon nsp14-ExoN deficiency. While betacoronavirus Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were non-viable with disabled nsp14-ExoN. In this study, we investigated the nsp14-ExoN deficiency of alphacoronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in viral pathogenesis using reverse genetics. RESULTS: Eight nsp14-ExoN deficient mutants, targeting the predicted active sites and the Zinc finger or mental-coordinating sites, of PEDV were designed. Only one mutant E191A with a mutation in the Mg(2+)-binding site was rescued using the infectious clone of PEDV PC22A strain (icPC22A). The passage no.1C3 (P1-3) of E191A grew to very low titers in Vero cells. To evaluate the pathogenesis of the E191A, 4 or 5-day-old gnotobiotic pigs were inoculated orally with 100 TCID(50)/pig of the E191A-P1, icPC22A, or mock. All mock pigs did not shed virus in feces or show clinical signs. All pigs inoculated with icPC22A shed high viral RNA levels, had severe diarrhea, and died by 6 days post-inoculation (dpi). In contrast, only 3 pigs (3/4, 75%) in the E191A-P1 group shed low levels of viral RNA and 2 pigs had moderate diarrhea at acute infection phase. At 22 dpi, each pig was challenged orally with 10(6) plaque forming unit of virulent icPC22A. All pigs in the mock group developed severe diarrhea and 2 of the 5 pigs died. Pigs in the E191A-P1 group had less severe diarrhea and no pigs died. Sanger sequencing analysis revealed that the viral genome in the fecal sample of one E191A-P1-inoculated pig and the P4 virus passaged in vitro lost the E191A mutation, suggesting the genetic instability of the E191A mutant. CONCLUSION: The recombinant PEDV variants carrying mutations at the essential functional sites within nsp14-ExoN were either lethal or genetically unstable. Our finding further confirmed the critical role of nsp14-ExoN in CoV life cycle, suggesting that it may be a target for the design of universal anti-CoV drugs.

A literature review was also carried out to propose a set of indicators capable of assessing the overall impact of this eco-innovation in eight lines of action: (1) environmental, (2) social, (3) economic, (4) human resource training, (5) institutional development, (6) introduction of innovation, (7) unwanted occurrences, and (8) characteristics of environmental management. To compile and process the data, the computerized model INOVA-tec System was used. The objective was to employ the INOVA-tec System model as an instrument for evaluating eco-innovative processes in leading companies in its segment, looking for evidence to expand its usability to other realities in the agro-industry. The results show that the technology scenario is favorable to its dissemination; however, the low performance of the indicators together makes it underutilized.

The latter are highly heterogeneous conditions with variable severity and a clinical course marked by several relapses often triggered by immune-activating events (infections, traumas, surgery, etc.) including vaccines. Some reports of ITP and AIHA post-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been described but no population studies have been conducted in AIC patients. Here we systematically studied a large series of 100 patients with AIC (44 AIHA, 38 ITP, 7 AIN, 6 ES, and 5 AA) prospectively followed at a reference center in Milan, Italy, who underwent SARS-CoV-2 vaccination from 24 th of March until the end of June 2021. Patients (median age 62 years, range 25-89, female/male ratio 1.7) were monitored with whole blood counts and LDH testing the week before and the week after each vaccination dose. Importantly, ongoing AIC therapy (38% of cases, including steroids, cyclosporine, eltrombopag, and complement inhibitor sutimlimab) were kept stable within the 2 weeks before vaccination. Patients mainly received Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine (N=88), followed by Moderna (N=10), and Astra-Zeneca (N=2). Table 1 summarizes hematologic trends and side effects observed after each dose in patients with ITP and AIHA. Regarding the former, a delta percentage reduction of 10% or higher was observed in up to 13% of cases after the first and the second dose, requiring therapy adjustment in 2 patients. They were two elderly male subjects on low dose eltrombopag treatment and experienced a severe/moderate relapse (platelets 28 and 21x10^9/L) with mucosal bleeding, after the 2 nd dose of Pfizer vaccine. Both had a concomitant trigger (1 hip fracture and 1 bronchitis reactivation) and were rescued by increasing eltrombopag dose and with the addition of prednisone 1 mg/Kg day. Regarding AIHA, 3 elderly patients experienced a clinically significant relapse (>10% Hb decrease): 1 female patient experienced an Hb reduction from 10.4 to 9.1 g/dL after the first dose of Pfizer vaccine, that required a slight increase of steroid dose (to 5 mg day prednisone) and remained stable after the second dose; 1 male subject had an Hb reduction from 13.9 to 9.1 g/d>L after the first dose of Moderna vaccine, requiring prednisone 0.5 mg/kg day; the third male patient experienced a severe relapse (Hb reduction by 47%, from 14 to 7.4 g/dL) with LDH increase to 2.3 x ULN after the second dose of Pfizer vaccine. The patient required high dose intravenous steroids and hemolysis improved in about 1 week. All patients had warm type AIHA and had complained no other triggers or non-hematologic adverse events. Patients with AIN, AA and ES had no significant changes in their hematologic values (1 AIN had a neutrophil decrease by 30% but was consistent with previous oscillations; 2 ES had a platelet or neutrophil decrease within the normal range) and required no treatment changes. Finally, the following non-hematologic adverse events were observed: fever (7%), pain at the injection site (15%) and arthralgia (<5%), without significant differences between the first and the second dose. These data show that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may be associated with a mild decrease of hematologic values in about 10% of AIC cases. However, true ITP and AIHA relapses occurred in 5% of cases only, sometimes in the presence of a concomitant trigger, and were rapidly rescued with treatment adaptation. Overall, the hematologic monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine adopted in our survey appears appropriate to early detect and manage AIC reactivation, ensuring a safe vaccination campaign in this patient population.

There are two forms of PCL: primary, which arise de novo, and secondary which is a leukemic transformation in patients with previously multiple myeloma. Patients with PCL may benefit from stem cell transplantation and novel agents, but their prognosis remains inferior to that of patients who have multiple myeloma. CLINICAL CASE We describe the case of 53 years old patient with relapsed plasma cells leukemia after unrelated bone marrow transplant, treated with a KRD chemotherapy regimen. He performed a very good response after the first 2 cycles (bone marrow malignant plasma cells reducing from 36% to 0.5%). However, according to the very poor prognosis of this disease, after the 4th cycle of chemotherapy the patient progressed and dead into few weeks. The KRD regimen was able to convert the chimerism after bone marrow transplant from partial to complete after the first 2 cycles of treatment, showing some activity in this disease. CONCLUSIONS KRD regimen, in our clinical case, showed some activity being well tolerated in a very poor prognosis disease such as PCL. Probably, right use and maybe sooner use of new drugs such as bortezomib or carfilzomib, in combination regimens, may be useful in better treating such disease.","output":"[Treatment of early relapsed plasma cells leukemia after unrelated bone marrow transplant with KRD (carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone): a case report.]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread and high transmissibility of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to lead to a significant number of key workers testing positive simultaneously. Under a policy of self-isolation after testing positive, this may lead to extreme staffing shortfalls at the same time as e.g. hospital admissions are peaking. Using a model of individual infectiousness and testing with lateral flow tests (LFT), we evaluate test-to-release policies against conventional fixed-duration isolation policies in terms of excess days of infectiousness, days saved, and tests used. We find that the number of infectious days in the community can be reduced to almost zero by requiring at least 2 consecutive days of negative tests, regardless of the number of days' wait until testing again after initially testing positive. On average, a policy of fewer days' wait until initiating testing (e.g 3 or 5 days) results in more days saved vs. a 10-day isolation period, but also requires a greater number of tests. Due to a lack of specific data on viral load progression, infectivity, and likelihood of testing positive by LFT over the course of an Omicron infection, we assume the same parameters as for pre-Omicron variants and explore the impact of a possible shorter proliferation phase.","output":"Test to release from isolation after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient tracheostomy outcomes. METHODS: All COVID-19 patients at the National Guard Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were retrospectively recruited. Those who had tracheostomies between April and December 2020 were included. RESULTS: The population was 45 patients, of which 30 (66.7%) were males, 15 (33.3%) were females and the mean age was 66.7612.74 years. The tracheostomy indications were anticipated prolonged weaning in 40 (88.9%) and failed extubation in 5 (11.1%) of the patients. The mean intubation to tracheostomy duration was 20.627.21 days. Mortalities were high, with most attributed to COVID-19. Mortality and a pre-tracheostomy C-reactive protein (CRP) uptrend were significantly related (p=0.039). Mortality and intubation to tracheostomy duration were not significantly related. The mean post-tracheostomy time to death was 10.646.9 days. Among the survivors, 20 (44.4%) males and 11 (24.4%) females were weaned off mechanical ventilation; 9 (20%) remained on ventilation during the study. The mean ventilation weaning time was 27.9220 days. CONCLUSION: The high mortality rate was attributed to COVID-19. Mortality and a pre-tracheostomy CRP uptrend were significantly related; uptrend patients experienced far more mortalities than downtrend patients.

By calibrating the parameters of the EDM to the reported data in Hubei Province of China, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak. We compare the EDM applied to WR and the Gompertz model, which is based on exponential decay and is often used to estimate cumulative events. Specifically, we assess the performance of each model to short-term forecast of the epidemic, and to predict the final epidemic size. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the model applied to data from February 27 until the 17st of March estimate that the cumulative number of infected could reach 131,280 (with a credibility interval 71,415-263,501) by April 25 (credibility interval April 12 to May 3). With the data available until the 24st of March the peak date should be reached on May 3 (April 23 to May 23) with 197,179 cumulative infections expected (130033-315,269); with data available until the 31st of March the peak should be reached on May 4 (April 25 to May 18) with 202,210 cumulative infections expected (155.235-270,737); with data available until the 07st of April the peak should be reached on May 3 (April 26 to May 11) with 191,586 (160,861-232,023) cumulative infections expected. Based on the average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), cumulated infections forecasts provided by the EDM applied to WR performed better across all scenarios than the Gompertz model. An exponential decay model applied to the cumulated and weighted average daily growth rate appears to be useful in estimating the number of cases and peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy and the model was more reliable in the exponential growth phase.","output":"Estimating the size of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy: Application of an exponential decay model to the weighted and cumulative average daily growth rate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"WHO was informed on 31 December 2019 of cases of unknown cause pneumonia in Wuhan City, China On 7 January 2020 Chinese authorities reported a novel coronaviru","output":"Use of Blockchain Technology to CurNovel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An often overlooked strategy for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic is group testing.

Thus, this study was aimed to compare the admission and outcome variables such as number of patient and its severity, acute recanalisation therapy given pre-post COVID-19 at a primary stroke centre located in Malaysia. Methods: This cross-sectional hospital-based study included adult ischaemic stroke patients. Variables of the study included the number of ischaemic stroke patients, the proportions of recanalisation therapies, stroke severity during admission based on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, functional outcome at discharge based on the modified Rankin Scale, and relevant workflow metrics. We compared the outcome between two six-month periods, namely the pre-COVID-19 period (March 2019 to September 2019) and the COVID-19 period (March 2020 to September 2020). Results: There were 131 and 156 patients, respectively, from the pre-COVID-19 period and the COVID-19 period. The median door-to-scan time and the median door-to-reperfusion time were both significantly shorter in the COVID-19 period (24.5 min versus 12.0 min, p = 0.047) and (93.5 min versus 60.0 min, p = 0.015), respectively. There were also significantly more patients who received intravenous thrombolysis (7.6% versus 17.3%, p = 0.015) and mechanical thrombectomy (0.8% versus 6.4%, p = 0.013) in the COVID-19 period, respectively. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic may not have caused disruptions of acute stroke care in our primary stroke centre. Our data indicated that the number of ischaemic stroke events remained stable, with a significant increase of recanalisation therapies and better in-hospital workflow metrics during the COVID-19 pandemic period. However, we would like to highlight that the burden of COVID-19 cases in the study area was very low. Therefore, the study may not have captured the true burden (and relevant delays in stroke patient management) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The effect of the pandemic crisis is ongoing and both pre-hospital and in-hospital care systems must continue to provide optimal, highly time-dependent stroke care services.","output":"Stroke Patients' Characteristics and Clinical Outcomes: A Pre-Post COVID-19 Comparison Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection has widely spread to the hugest public health challenge to date, COVID-19 pandemic. Different fatality rates among countries are probably due to unstandardized records being carried out by local health authorities.

A multicenter retrospective study of demographic, clinical, laboratory and immunological features of 574 Spanish COVID-19 inpatients (59.4% males) and their outcomes was performed. 27.7% cases presented a mild curse, 42% a moderate one and 30.3%, severe. Ages ranged from 18 to 98 (average 63.2). Interleukin 6 was higher as increasing severity. On the other hand, CD8 lymphocyte count was significantly lower as severity grew and subpopulations CD4, CD8, CD19 and NK showed concordant lowering trends. Severity-related natural killer percent descents were evidenced just within aged cases. A significant severity-related decrease of CD4 lymphocytes was found in males. The use of renin-angiotensin system blockers was associated with moderate or mild disease courses. Clinical course of the disease is more severe in this study than in previous literature cohorts. Age and age-related comorbidities, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension or diabetes, were also higher. Immunosenescence might be therefore a suitable explanation for immune system effectors severity-related hampering. Adaptive immunity would go exhausted and a huge ineffective and almost deleterious innate response would account for COVID-19 severity.

We developed a framework for prioritizing postponed urologic surgeries that was utilized once cases were permitted to be rescheduled. As many parts of our country experience first and second waves of this pandemic, our framework may serve as a resource for other centers experiencing restrictions on the scheduling of elective urologic surgeries. METHODS: As the COVID-19 pandemic started and peaked in New York, almost all of our scheduled urologic surgeries were cancelled. Each Urologist was asked to rank his/her cancelled surgeries by priority (Level 1-least urgent; Level 2-moderately urgent; Level 3-most urgent). A committee of Urologists assigned a subclass to Level 3 and 2 cases (3a-least urgent; 3b-moderately urgent; 3c-most urgent; 2a-lower priority; 2b-higher priority). The committee then reviewed cases by urgency to derive a final priority ranking. RESULTS: A total of 478 total urologic surgeries were canceled and categorized: 250 Level 1, 130 Level 2, 98 Level 3 (73 adult, 25 pediatric). Level 3c involved renal cell carcinoma &#8805; T2b, high-grade bladder urothelial carcinoma, adrenal mass/cancer > 6 cm, testicular cancer requiring radical orchiectomy, and penile cancer. Level 3b involved T2a renal masses requiring nephrectomy, while high-risk prostate cancer and symptomatic nephrolithiasis were classified as 3a. Level 2 included testicular cancer requiring retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and complicated benign prostatic hyperplasia. Surgeries for urologic reconstruction, non-complicated nephrolithiasis, erectile dysfunction, and urinary incontinence were considered Level 1.

Both genders showed similar 5-year primary patency rates (64.3% men vs. 58.1% women, p=0.11). A statistically significant difference was observed concerning the secondary patency rates in favor of men (71.9% vs. 66.8% at 5 years, p=0.005). Limb salvage rates did not vary between the groups (p=0.83). Survival rates were comparable at 5 years (83.3% and 82.6% for men and women, respectively; p=0.63), although female patients were older at their presentation (68.5 vs. 74.3 years, p<0.001). Female gender was an independent risk factor for restenosis for TASC C/D lesions (primary patency rate 39.8% in women vs. 62.0% in men; p=0.002). Finally, critical limb ischemia was an independent risk factor for restenosis in women (odds ratio 1.5). CONCLUSION Female gender was associated with a higher prevalence of critical limb ischemia, poorer secondary patency, and more frequent restenosis in TASC C/D lesions. Endovascular treatment of femoropopliteal lesions provides equal results between genders in terms of primary stent patency in the long term.","output":"Gender-related long-term outcome of primary femoropopliteal stent placement for peripheral artery disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Exosomes derived from cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are known as important drivers of tumor progression. Previously, microRNA (miR)-148b-3p has been found to be upregulated in bladder cancers as well as in body fluids (blood, urine) of bladder cancer patients. Here, we aimed to explore the role of CAF-derived exosome miR-148b-3p in bladder cancer progression and chemosensitivity. METHODS: Transwell, MTT, flow cytometry and colony formation assays were applied to assess the effects of CAF-derived exosomes on bladder cancer cell metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and chemosensitivity. A dual luciferase reporter assay was employed to evaluate the targeting relationship between miR-148b-3p and PTEN. Gain- and loss- of function assays were conducted to explore the roles of miR-148b-3p and PTEN in the behavior of bladder cancer cells. The role of PTEN in the metastasis, EMT and chemosensitivity of bladder cancer cells was assessed both in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: We found that CAF-derived exosomes promoted the metastasis, EMT and drug resistance of bladder cancer cells. We also found that CAF-derived exosomes could directly transport miR-148b-3p into bladder cancer cells. In a xenograft mouse model we found that CAF-derived exosomes increased miR-148b-3p expression levels and promoted tumor proliferation, metastasis and drug resistance. PTEN was validated as a target of miR-148b-3p. Concordantly, we found that PTEN overexpression inhibited EMT, metastasis and chemoresistance in bladder cancer cells, reversing the tumor promoting effects of miR-148b-3p via the Wnt/?-catenin pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that miR-148b-3p downregulation in CAF-derived exosomes, thereby inhibiting the Wnt/?-catenin pathway and promoting PTEN expression, may offer potential opportunities for bladder cancer treatment.","output":"Downregulated exosomal microRNA-148b-3p in cancer associated fibroblasts enhance chemosensitivity of bladder cancer cells by downregulating the Wnt/?-catenin pathway and upregulating PTEN"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona virus disease (COVID-19) presents a serious threat to global health A historical timeline of early molecular diagnostics from government alert (January 22) (D) was presented After in silico analysis, Brazilian Army Institute of Biology (IBEx-RJ) tested samples in house using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (fast mode) based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations First cases from Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, IBEx, and diagnosis team were reported in D36, D44, D66, and D74 respectively Therefore, after 1300 tests, we recommend N1/N2 primer sets (CDC) for preliminary and Charit protocol confirmation in case of positive results Moreover, every professional should be tested before starting work, in addition to weekly tests for everyone involved","output":"SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic diary: from rumors to the first case.

Methods: Between December 2019- December 2020, each F1 doctor was offered a day to spend in elective theatre during their General Surgery rotation (excluding emergency COVID rota periods). This was following feedback from the August- December 2019 cohort. Each 'Theatre Day' was scheduled during normal working hours when there was sufficient staff. Post-participation questionnaires were completed. Results: Prior to implementation of the Programme, 3/8 F1s surveyed had not attended any elective surgery lists (1 had not attended theatre at all). All indicated that they would have been interested in attending a timetabled elective theatre day;88% highlighted a 'lack of staff' and 63% indicated that 'feeling guilty' were barriers in attending theatre. 21 F1s were offered a 'Theatre Day': 17 agreed to participate and 16 completed post-participation questionnaires. Only 47% confirmed that they were considering a career in surgery prior to participation: all agreed that spending time in theatre was a useful learning opportunity and 94% agreed that the Programme should be continued. Conclusions: Spending time in theatre appears to be valued as a useful learning opportunity for F1s, whether or not they are aspiring surgeons. Common barriers to self-organised theatre attendance appear to be an anticipated 'lack of staff' or feelings of 'guilt'. A senior-led scheduling of one day in theatre should circumnavigate these barriers and ensure that access is available to all.","output":"Improving Access to Surgery: The F1 'Theatre Day' Programme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Treatment options for pediatric and adolescent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries include early operative, delayed operative, and nonoperative management. Currently, there is a lack of consensus regarding the optimal treatment for these injuries. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS The purpose was to determine the optimal treatment strategy for ACL injuries in pediatric and adolescent patients. We hypothesized that (1) early ACL reconstruction results in fewer meniscal tears than delayed reconstruction but yields no difference in knee stability and (2) when compared with nonoperative management, any operative management results in fewer meniscal tears and cartilage injuries, greater knee stability, and higher return-to-sport rates. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS A systematic search of databases was performed including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Inclusion criteria were a pediatric and adolescent patient population (19 years old at surgery), the reporting of clinical outcomes after treatment of primary ACL injury, and original scientific research article. Exclusion criteria were revision ACL reconstruction, tibial spine avulsion fracture, case report or small case series (<5 patients), non-English language manuscripts, multiligamentous injuries, and nonclinical studies. RESULTS A total of 30 studies containing 50 cohorts and representing 1176 patients met our criteria. With respect to nonoperative treatment, knee instability was observed in 20% to 100%, and return to preinjury level of sports ranged from 6% to 50% at final follow-up. Regarding operative treatment, meta-analysis results favored early ACL reconstruction over delayed reconstruction (>12 weeks) for the presence of any meniscal tear (odds ratio, 0.23; P = .006) and irreparable meniscal tear (odds ratio, 0.31; P = .001). Comparison of any side-to-side differences in KT-1000 arthrometer testing did not favor early or delayed ACL reconstruction in either continuous mean differences (P = .413) or proportion with difference 3 mm (P = .181). Return to preinjury level of competition rates for early and delayed ACL reconstruction ranged from 57% to 100%. CONCLUSION Delaying ACL reconstruction in pediatric or adolescent patients for >12 weeks significantly increased the risk of meniscal injuries and irreparable meniscal tears; however, early and delayed operative treatment achieved satisfactory knee stability. Nonoperative management resulted in high rates of residual knee instability, increased risk of meniscal tears, and comparatively low rates of return to sports.","output":"Early Operative Versus Delayed Operative Versus Nonoperative Treatment of Pediatric and Adolescent Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Streptococcus suis, a ubiquitous bacterial colonizer in pigs, has recently extended host range to humans, leading to a global surge of deadly human infections and three large outbreaks since 1998.

However, reduction in clinic visits for people living with HIV (PLWH) should go along with out-of-clinic care tailored to PLWH\`s preferences and comorbidities to maintain quality of care. eHealth supported MMD offers a potential solution. METHODS: Between October 2019 and January 2020 we assessed preferences on an eHealth supported MMD package among adult PLWH attending routine ART care at a rural clinic in Lesotho using a mixed-methods approach. Participants reported their preferences among different refill and eHealth options. They were invited to test automated text messages (SMS) informing about their viral load results, an automated tuberculosis symptoms screening call and telemedical support by an expert nurse. Telemedical service comprised a call-back option if participants required any additional support and adherence counselling for closer follow-up of participants with unsuppressed viral loads. After 6 weeks, participants were followed-up to assess perception of the chosen eHealth support using a qualitative approach. RESULTS: Among 112 participants (median age = 43 years; 74% female), 83/112 (75%) preferred MMD for 6C12 months (median = 9 months, IQR = [5, 12]). Neither sex, age, employment, costs and time for travel to clinic, nor the duration of taking ART correlated with the MMD preference. All 17 participants attending routine viral load measurement wished to receive the result via SMS. Fifteen (19.2%) participants requested a telemedical nurse call-back during the study period. All participants with recent unsuppressed viral load (N = 13) requested telemedical adherence counselling for closer follow-up. Among 78 participants followed-up, 76 (97%) would appreciate having the call-back option in future. Seventy-five participants (67%) received and evaluated the automated symptomatic tuberculosis screening call, overall 71 (95%) appreciated it. CONCLUSIONS: The great majority of PLWH in this study preferred 6C12 months MMD and appreciated the additional eHealth support, including viral load results via SMS, telemedical nurse consultations and automated tuberculosis symptom screening calls. eHealth supported MMD packages appear to be a promising approach for DSD models and should be assessed for clinical endpoints and cost-effectiveness in larger studies.

A SAS had been implemented in Freiburg (Germany) in 2018 alerting nearby registered first responders in case of emergencies with suspected cardiac arrest. Due to the pandemic, SAS was stopped in March 2020. A concept for a safe restart was elaborated with provision of a set with ventilation bag/mask, airway filter, and personal protective equipment (PPE) for every volunteer. A standard operating procedure was elaborated following the COVID-19 guidelines of the European Resuscitation Council. Willingness of the participants to respond alarms during the pandemic was investigated using an online survey. The response rates of first responders were monitored before and after deactivation, and during the second wave of the pandemic. The system was restarted in May 2020. The willingness to respond to alarms was lower during the pandemic without PPE. It remained lower than before the pandemic when the volunteers had been equipped with PPE, but the alarm response rate remained at approximately 50% during the second wave of the pandemic.

Previous studies related to the SARS pandemic showed a decrease up to 80% in the emergency care episodes. Hence, the objective of this study is to analyze the use of emergency services during the first pandemic month, compared to historical records. METHODS: Data from emergency episodes in mainland Portugal, from January 2014 to March 2020, were downloaded from the National Health Service (NHS) Transparency Portal and the NHS monitoring website. The evolution of emergency services from March to September 2020 was forecasted based on historical data from January 2014 to February 2020. Information for March 2020 was forecasted globally, by the Regional Health Administration (RHA) and Manchester Triage System (MTS). RESULTS: Compared with forecasted values, there was a 48% reduction in the number of emergency episodes in March 2020. In the analysis by the RHA, Alentejo had the smallest decrease in the number of episodes; interestingly, Alentejo is also the area with fewer COVID-19 cases in mainland Portugal. In the analysis by the MTS, the episodes classified as yellow showed the highest reduction (50%). For episodes classified as urgent, there is a difference of about 144,000 episodes during March 2020. DISCUSSION: The results of this preliminary study are aligned with the evidence produced for previous pandemics. Data about the use of emergency services, demographic and clinical characteristics of the episodes would be relevant to analyze this reduction. CONCLUSION: There was a significant drop in the number of emergency service use in March 2020, and although the causes of this reduction are not determined, the association between the beginning of the pandemic and the reduction of demand is evident. Understanding this phenomenon is crucial to plan interventions to avoid unnecessary morbidities or deaths, caused by a delayed visit to the emergency department.","output":"The Demand for Hospital Emergency Services: Trends during the First Month of COVID-19 Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, new treatment options for malignant melanoma patients have enhanced the overall survival for selected patients. Despite new hope, most melanoma patients still relapse with drug-resistant tumors or experience intrinsic resistance to the therapy. Therefore, novel treatment modalities beneficial for subgroups of patients are needed. TRAIL receptor agonists have been suggested as promising candidates for use in cancer treatment as they preferentially induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Unfortunately, the first generation of TRAIL receptor agonists showed poor clinical efficacy. hvTRA is a second-generation TRAIL receptor agonist with improved composition giving increased potency, and in the present study, we showed hvTRA-induced activation of apoptosis leading to an efficient and sustained reduction in melanoma cell growth in cell lines and xenograft models. Furthermore, the potential of hvTRA in a clinical setting was demonstrated by showing efficacy on tumor cells harvested from melanoma patients with lymph node metastasis in an ex vivo drug sensitivity assay. Inhibition of mutated BRAF has been shown to regulate proteins in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, making the cells more susceptible for apoptosis induction. In an attempt to increase the efficacy of hvTRA, combination treatment with the mutated BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib was investigated. A synergistic effect by the combination was observed for several cell lines in vitro, and an initial cytotoxic effect was observed in vivo. Unfortunately, the initial increased reduction in tumor growth compared with hvTRA mono treatment was not sustained, and this was related to downregulation of the DR5 level by vemurafenib. Altogether, the presented data imply that hvTRA efficiently induce apoptosis and growth delay in melanoma models and patient material, and the potential of this TRAIL receptor agonist should be further evaluated for treatment of subgroups of melanoma patients.","output":"hvTRA, a novel TRAIL receptor agonist, induces apoptosis and sustained growth retardation in melanoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"So far, all countries around the world have to deal with the Covid-19 challenge.

Thus, we suggest that Zanthoxylum piperitum fruit is a promising herbal plant to reduce the level of cytokines against rheumatoid arthritis. ABSTRACT: Zanthoxylum piperitum fruits (ZPFs) have been demonstrated favorable clinical efficacy on rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but its compounds and mechanisms against RA have not been elucidated. This study was to investigate the compounds and mechanisms of ZPFs to alleviate RA via network pharmacology. The compounds from ZPFs were detected by gas chromatographyCmass spectrometry (GC-MS) and screened to select drug-likeness compounds through SwissADME. Targets associated with bioactive compounds or RA were identified utilizing bioinformatics databases. The signaling pathways related to RA were constructed; interactions among targets; and signaling pathways-targets-compounds (STC) were analyzed by RPackage. Finally, a molecular docking test (MDT) was performed to validate affinity between targets and compounds on key signaling pathway(s). GC-MS detected a total of 85 compounds from ZPFs, and drug-likeness properties accepted all compounds. A total of 216 targets associated with compounds 3377 RA targets and 101 targets between them were finally identified. Then, a bubble chart exhibited that inactivation of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and activation of PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) signaling pathway might be key pathways against RA. Overall, this work suggests that seven compounds from ZPFs and eight targets might be multiple targets on RA and provide integrated pharmacological evidence to support the clinical efficacy of ZPFs on RA.","output":"Uncovering Mechanisms of Zanthoxylum piperitum Fruits for the Alleviation of Rheumatoid Arthritis Based on Network Pharmacology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increased REM density and alpha intrusion are routinely seen in COVID-19 patient.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, South Africa had been arguably the hardest hit country both by Brexit and Corona. However, the poor, mainly working in the informal sector, were more concerned about the economic impact of the pandemic than the disease itself. In Nigeria, many people envisaged Corona as a plague of the rich and the elite. President Buhari shared the hubris of many British that they are less vulnerable to the pandemic and could continue with highflying Post-Brexit plans. Ghana counts among those countries in Sub-Sahara Africa which has been most severely hit by the corona pandemic. But unlike South Africa and Nigeria, the direct effects of the pandemic on the downturn of its economy are not as significant as in other African states. In Kenya the number of corona-death had been much lower than for the SARS pandemic of 2003, but the transmission of the COVID-19 virus had been significantly greater. Nevertheless, many Kenyans saw the Brexit as a disguised blessing because they pined their hope on massive FDI by UK investors.

RESULTS From February 2010 through June 2011, 345 children < 5 years of age were enrolled; 17%, 23%, 30% and 31% were <6, 6-11, 12-23 and 24-60 months old, respectively. Including all clinics in the region, 44.5% of patients < 5 years of age with documented respiratory diagnoses were enrolled. At least 1 virus was identified in 75.4% children, of which 7.5% were coinfections; 13.3% were positive for parainfluenza, 11.9% for influenza, 8.1% for human metapneumovirus and 7.5% for respiratory syncytial virus. Rainfall correlated with parainfluenza (P < 0.0001), influenza (P < 0.0001), human metapneumovirus (P = 0.0182) and respiratory syncytial virus (P < 0.0001).

The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional role of circular RNA ITCH (circ-ITCH) in OSCC and the underlying mechanisms. Methods: RT-qPCR analysis was applied to detect the expression levels of circ-ITCH in OSCC tissues and cell lines. MTT assay and flow cytometer analysis were used to evaluate the effects of circ-ITCH overexpression on the proliferation and apoptosis of OSCC cells. Bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay were applied to determine the binding relation between circ-ITCH and miR-421 as well as PDCD4 mRNA and miR-421. Results: Our results showed that circ-ITCH expression was remarkably decreased in OSCC tissues and cell lines. Low circ-ITCH expression was strongly associated with adverse clinicopathological characteristics of OSCC patients. Moreover, functional assays demonstrated that circ-ITCH overexpression significantly inhibited OSCC cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Our data further uncovered that circ-ITCH could bind directly to miR-421 and block its repression on PDCD4 in OSCC. MiR-421 expression was significantly increased in OSCC tissues and was inversely correlated with circ-ITCH expression. Notably, miR-421 restoration blocked the tumor-suppressive role of circ-ITCH in OSCC cells. Conclusion: In conclusion, our study reveals that circ-ITCH serves as a tumor suppressor in OSCC partly by regulating miR-421/PDCD4 axis.","output":"Circular RNA ITCH Suppresses Cell Proliferation but Induces Apoptosis in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma by Regulating miR-421/PDCD4 Axis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of e-commerce and express delivery services has significantly transformed business operations and consumer shopping experience. However, the resulting problem of packaging waste, particularly from overpackaging, poses serious challenges to environmental sustainability and human health. Existing research has proposed many solutions from various perspectives, but very few have considered the acceptability and consumer preference for these proposals. Using the value co-creation (VCC) theory, we established a research model to explore consumer preferences for e-commerce overpackaging solutions. A survey of 632 online consumers in Guangzhou and Shenzhen was conducted, and data were analyzed using the SmartPLS software. The results show that establishing a recycling system, government policy, and consumers environmental awareness have a significant positive impact on consumer preference, while combined packaging has a significant negative impact. We also found that government policy plays an intermediary role in establishing a recycling system and consumer preference. Based on these findings, we recommend that enterprises establish and improve their packaging recycling systems and that e-commerce platforms provide alternative options to combined packaging. Also, the government should play a guiding and coordinating role for enterprises and consumers, and environmental awareness among consumers should actively be promoted.","output":"Assessing Consumer Preference for Overpackaging Solutions in E-Commerce"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The aim of this study is to assess the safety and the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of osteoid osteoma with Soloist monopolar electrode using tissue impedance, rather than temperature, as an indicator of osteonecrosis. METHODS The medical records and imaging studies of 30 patients (males 18, females 12) who underwent RFA of osteoid osteoma at our institution were reviewed. The mean age of the patients was 15.3 years (range 5-34 years) and the mean duration of follow up was 26.9 months (range 3-52 months). The lesions were located in the femur (n=6, 53%), tibia (n = 8, 27%), hand (n = 3, 10%), foot (n = 2, 6%) and humerus (n = 1, 3%). The procedure was performed with general anaesthesia under CT guidance. The nidus was accessed with 11-gauge bone biopsy needle and then the stylet was removed and replaced by monopolar 16.5G radiofrequency probe with a 9-mm active tip through the coaxial axis. Power delivery via the radiofrequency generator was started at 2 W and increased gradually until the end point of 450-500  reached and 'Roll-Off' achieved indicating coagulation necrosis of the target lesion. RESULTS The procedure was technically successful in all patients. The mean procedure time was 72 min and the mean RFA time was 12.7 min. The clinical success rate was 93%. In one patient, the procedure was abandoned due to immature Roll-Off despite all measures. In one patient (3%), recurrence occurred 39 months after the procedure. No major complications were encountered. Two minor skin burns occurred that were resolved with conservative measures. CONCLUSION RFA of osteoid osteoma using Soloist monopolar electrode is a safe and effective treatment. Tissue impedance could be used as an alternative to temperature to indicate osteonecrosis of osteoid osteoma during RFA.","output":"Radiofrequency ablation of osteoid osteoma using tissue impedance as a parameter of osteonecrosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The long-term evolution of viruses is ultimately due to viral mutants that arise within infected individuals and transmit to other individuals. Here we use deep sequencing to investigate the transmission of viral genetic variation among individuals during a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak that infected the vast majority of crew members on a fishing boat. We deep-sequenced nasal swabs to characterize the within-host viral population of infected crew members, using experimental duplicates and strict computational filters to ensure accurate variant calling. We find that within-host viral diversity is low in infected crew members. The mutations that did fix in some crew members during the outbreak are not observed at detectable frequencies in any of the sampled crew members in which they are not fixed, suggesting viral evolution involves occasional fixation of low-frequency mutations during transmission rather than persistent maintenance of within-host viral diversity. Overall, our results show that strong transmission bottlenecks dominate viral evolution even during a superspreading event with a very high attack rate.","output":"Narrow transmission bottlenecks and limited within-host viral diversity during a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on a fishing boat"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: passive immunotherapy is a therapeutic alternative for patients with COVID-19.

Primary endpoint was improvement in at least two categories in WHO ordinal clinical scale at day 28 or hospital discharge (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT04494984). FINDINGS: between August 1st and October 26th, 2020, a total of 245 patients were enrolled. Enrolled patients were assigned to receive two blinded doses of INM005 (n = 118) or placebo (n = 123). Median age was 54 years old, 65?1% were male and 61% had moderate disease at baseline. Median time from symptoms onset to study treatment was 6 days (interquartile range 5 to 8). No statistically significant difference was noted between study groups on primary endpoint (risk difference [95% IC]: 5?28% [-3?95; 14?50]; p = 0?15). Rate of improvement in at least two categories was statistically significantly higher for INM005 at days 14 and 21 of follow-up. Time to improvement in two ordinal categories or hospital discharge was 14?2 ( 0?7) days in the INM005 group and 16?3 ( 0?7) days in the placebo group, hazard ratio 1?31 (95% CI 1?0 to 1?74). Subgroup analyses showed a beneficial effect of INM005 over severe patients and in those with negative baseline antibodies. Overall mortality was 6?9% the INM005 group and 11?4% in the placebo group (risk difference [95% IC]: 0?57 [0?24 to 1?37]).

Design The screening algorithm was developed by our interdisciplinary Mobility Clinic team, and focuses on 5 domains: health destabilization, mental health, access to services and supports, social isolation, and caregiver stress. The algorithm was administered by phone and any risks identified received further investigation by the team. We used the opportunity to educate patients about the risks of COVID-19 and protective measures. Follow-up continued every 6-8 weeks throughout the duration of the pandemic. Setting The program was developed and implemented in a primary care Mobility Clinic. Participants The algorithm was administered by phone to individuals identified as past and current Mobility Clinic patients. A total of 107 unique patients were contacted, 76 who were male and 31 who were female. 74 patients were identified as having a spinal cord injury (SCI). Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures An evaluation of this outreach program involved a description of the patient population contacted, the identification of common risks for patients, and patient satisfaction with the program. Results Some of the most common questionnaire responses by patients with SCI included feelings of stress and/or anxiety and a reduction in Personal Support Worker services leading to increased caregiver stress. Conclusions The outreach program helps us to proactively identify risks for individuals with SCI, including stress, anxiety, and decreased Personal Support Worker services. Through the program, we are able to address these concerns and provide follow-up. Risk assessment and care at the primary care level can mitigate adverse events and hospitalizations, which is especially important during a pandemic situation when healthcare and hospital resources are limited.

MethodsWe performed a secondary analysis of a retrospective online survey titled \\"The Covid-19 Pandemic and Womens Reproductive Health\\", conducted in March 2021 in the UK before widespread media attention regarding potential impacts of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on menstruation. Participants were recruited via a Facebook ad campaign in the UK and eligibility criteria for survey completion were age greater than 18 years, having ever menstruated and currently living in the UK. In total, 26,710 people gave consent and completed the survey. For this analysis we selected 4,989 participants who were pre-menopausal and vaccinated. These participants were aged 28 to 43, predominantly from England (81%), of white background (95%) and not using hormonal contraception (58%). FindingsAmong pre-menopausal vaccinated individuals (n=4,989), 80% did not report any menstrual cycle changes up to 4 months after their first COVID-19 vaccine injection. Current use of combined oral contraceptives was associated with lower odds of reporting any changes by 48% (OR = 0.52, 95CI = [0.34 to 0.78], P<0.001). Odds of reporting any menstrual changes were increased by 44% for current smokers (OR = 1.44, 95CI = [1.07 to 1.94], P<0.01) and by more than 50% for individuals with a positive COVID status [Long Covid (OR = 1.61, 95CI = [1.28 to 2.02], P<0.001), acute COVID (OR = 1.54, 95CI = [1.27 to 1.86], P<0.001)].

Timely identification of patients at high risk for RV failure, optimization of mechanical ventilation to limit its adverse effects on RV preload and afterload, avoidance of medication-related increase in the pulmonary vascular resistance, and the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in refractory respiratory failure with hemodynamic instability, before RV failure develops, can improve patient survival.

Limited TTE focused on the right heart appears highly useful in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and particularly beneficial for monitoring of critically ill patients. In addition to detection of right-sided heart dilation and RV dysfunction, it enables assessment of RV-pulmonary arterial coupling and evaluation of RV adaptability to pressure loading which facilitate useful prognostic statements to be made.

In several studies, participants reported perceptions of effectiveness and likelihood of using each of the major senses to identify infection threat in two types of targets: people and food. Results revealed prioritization of sight and sound with person targets and prioritization of sight and smell with food targets.

At the beginning of the vaccine era, understanding the epitope profiles of vaccine-elicited antibodies will be the first step in assessing functionality of vaccine-induced immunity. In this study, the high-resolution linear epitope profiles of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine recipients and COVID-19 patients were delineated by using microarrays mapped with overlapping peptides of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. The vaccine-induced antibodies targeting RBD had broader distribution across the RBD than that induced by the natural infection. Thus, relatively lower neutralizability was observed when a half-maximal neutralization titer measured in vitro by live virus neutralization assays was normalized to a total anti-RBD IgG titer. However, mutation panel assays targeting the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have shown that the vaccine-induced epitope variety, rich in breadth, may grant resistance against future viral evolutionary escapes, serving as an advantage of vaccine-induced immunity. ImportanceEstablishing vaccine-based population immunity has been the key factor in attaining herd protection. Thanks to expedited worldwide research efforts, the potency of messenger RNA vaccines against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now incontestable. The next debate is regarding the coverage of SARS-CoV-2 variants. At the beginning of this vaccine era, it is of importance to describe the similarities and differences between the immune responses of COVID-19 vaccine recipients and naturally infected individuals. In this study, we demonstrated that the antibody profiles of vaccine recipients are richer in variety, targeting a key protein of the invading virus, than those of naturally infected individuals. Yet vaccine-elicited antibodies included more non-neutralizing antibodies than infection-elicited, their breadth in antibody variations suggested possible resilience against future SARS-CoV-2 variants.

The effectiveness of IM to promote neurodevelopment in preterm infants has been proved, but studies on infants with early brain damage are still lacking. The main aim of this study was to assess the feasibility, acceptability and usability of IM, carried out by parents at home, on infants at high risk for Cerebral Palsy. An IM daily diary and an ad hoc questionnaire, called Infant Massage Questionnaire Parent-Infant Experiences (IMQPE), were developed. IMQPE consisted of a total of 30 questions, divided into 5 areas. The parents were trained to carry out the IM with a home-based course, conducted by an expert therapist. The intensive IM program was set according to a defined daily length of at least 20 min, with a frequency of at least 5 days per week for a total of 8 weeks. Data collection consisted in the selection of the variables around the characteristics, both of the infants and the mothers, IM dosage and frequency, different body parts of the infants involved and IMQPE scores. Variable selection was carried out by minimizing the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) over all possible variable subsets. Nineteen high-risk infants, aged 4.83  1.22 months, received IM at home for 8 weeks.

Present study investigated the anti-RdRp activity of phytochemicals against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Virtual ligand screening was carried out to determine the potent compounds against RdRp. Molecular docking and MD Simulation study was employed to evaluate the spatial affinity of selected phytochemicals for the active sites of RdRp. Structural stability of target compounds was determined using RMSD computational analysis and drug like abilities were investigated using ADMET. Bond distance between ligand and receptor were marked to predict the strength of interaction. Aloe, azadirachtin, columbin, cirsilineol, nimbiol, nimbocinol and sage exhibited highest binding affinity and interacted with active sites of RdRp surpassing the ability of chloroquine, lamivudine, favipiravir and remdesivir to target the same. All the natural metabolites exhibited stable conformation during MD Simulation of 101ns at 310K. Kinetic, potential and electrostatic energy were observed to be least in case of natural metabolites in comparison to synthetic analogs. Deviation and fluctuations were observed to be structurally least in target phytochemicals. Physiochemical and biological properties of these compounds further validated their drug like properties. Non-bonded distance was found to be short enough to form hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interactions which revealed that these target compounds can strongly bind with RdRp.

METHODS: This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study. Nursing students in five Chinese universities were invited to participate. Fatigue, depressive and anxiety symptoms, pain and QOL were measured using standardized instruments. RESULTS: A total of 1,070 nursing students participated. The prevalence of fatigue was 67.3% (95% CI [64.4C70.0]). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that male gender (P = 0.003, OR = 1.73, 95% CI [1.20C2.49]), and being a senior nursing student (second year: OR = 2.20, 95% CI [1.46C3.33], P < 0.001; third year: OR = 3.53, 95% CI [2.31C5.41], P < 0.001; and fourth year OR = 3.59, 95% CI [2.39C5.40], P < 0.001) were significantly associated with more severe fatigue.

Partial least squares structural equation modelling was used to analyse data from 250 valid questionnaires. The model explained 74.6% of the variance in rural STEM pre-service teachers' actual use of VL. Latent variables, facilitating conditions, attitude towards use, and perceived ease of use had a direct impact on the actual use of VL. Attitude to use also played a mediating role between actual use and predictors, perceived enjoyment, perceived social influence, computer self-efficacy, and perceived usefulness. It was concluded that rural STEM pre-service teachers embrace VL given the desperate pandemic situation. ?Authors","output":"Rural STEM Preservice Teachers Acceptance of Virtual Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: A subset of individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears to develop persisting cognitive and medical symptoms. Research in the acute stages of illness, generally utilizing cognitive screening measures or case reports, suggests presence of deficits in attention and executive function. This observational study investigated cognitive functioning among individuals with persistent cognitive complaints about 5.5 months after COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Patients with polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 and persistent cognitive complaints underwent comprehensive in-person neuropsychological evaluations. Patients with prior neurological disorders were excluded. When diagnosed, 40% required hospitalization, 15% were in an intensive care unit, 10% needed mechanical ventilation, and 10% experienced delirium. RESULTS: This sample was predominately women (90%), White non-Hispanic (70%), with average education of 15 years. Mild cognitive deficits were seen on tests involving attention and processing speed or executive function. Seventy percent of patients were diagnosed with a mood disorder prior to COVID-19 infection. At the time of testing, 35%C40% endorsed moderate to severe mood symptoms and 85% noted significant fatigue as measured by the Fatigue Severity Scale. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of cognitive deficits, although mild, is consistent with prior research at the acute stage of the illness. These findings suggest that psychological factors and other persisting symptoms (e.g., sleep, fatigue) may play a significant role in subjective cognitive complaints in patients with persisting complaints post COVID-19 who did not require intensive treatment. These patients would likely benefit from resources to manage persisting or new mood symptoms and compensatory strategies for the cognitive inefficiencies they experience.","output":"Neurocognitive Profiles in Patients With Persisting Cognitive Symptoms Associated With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The purpose of the following papers is to explore plausible alternative futures for dental education. The COVID-19 pandemic, challenges emerging from racism in the US, and social unrest were the precipitating factors leading to this consideration of academic dentistry in approximately 5 years. METHODS: In 2020-2021, five teams of six individual followed a seven-step process to develop five different scenarios of dental education in 2026. Four of these scenarios are constructed by considering a range of uncertainties associated with economic sustainability and educational innovation. A fifth scenario describes the optimal case for dental education's role should another pandemic occur. RESULTS: Each scenario is presented as a narrative in three parts: scenario highlights (summary), life in the scenario (fictional case), and scenario details (a description of significant factors within the envisioned future of the scenario). As a strategic tool, these scenarios will assist leaders, institutions, and stakeholders to anticipate and prepare for different futures, identify key indicators that a particular future is emerging, and guide decision-making to create the most desirable future in a changing environment. CONCLUSION: Institutions are encouraged to incorporate these scenarios into their strategic and contingency planning efforts and to use them to generate dialogue during faculty development initiatives. This study provides institutions with a process and model they can follow to create scenarios at the institutional level. The final paper in this collection is a guide that provides ideas and instructions for using the scenarios in curricular and extracurricular activities with faculty members and students.","output":"Dental education 2026: A scenario exploration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current study was aimed to introduce five new species of Cordyceps from Yunnan, with morphological descriptions, illustrations, color photographs, phylogenetic placement, associated host, and a comparison with allied taxa.

Current methods for detecting these infections are constrained by combinations of high cost, long processing times, and imperfect accuracy, reducing their effectiveness. METHODS: We examine whether the quantity of time a patient spends in a ward with other patients clinically-suspected of infection, which we call co-presence, can be used as a tool to predict subsequent healthcare-associated infection. Compared to contact tracing, this leverages passively-collected electronic data rather than manually-collected data, allowing for improved monitoring. We abstracted all 133,304 inpatient records between 2011 and 2015 from a healthcare system in the UK. We calculate the AUROC for each of five pathogens based on co-presence time, the sensitivity and specificity for the test, and how much earlier co-presence would have predicted infection for the true positives. FINDINGS: Across the five pathogens, AUROC ranged from 0.92 to 0.99, and was 0.52 for the negative control. Optimal cut-points of co-presence ranged from 25 to 59 hours, and would have led to detection of true positives up to an average of one day earlier. INTERPRETATION: These findings show that co-presence time would help predict healthcare-acquired infection, and would do so earlier than the current standard of care. Using this measure prospectively in hospitals based on real-time data could limit the consequences of infection, both by being able to treat individual infected patients earlier, and by preventing potential secondary infections stemming from the original infected patient.","output":"A passive monitoring tool using hospital administrative data enables earlier specific detection of healthcare-acquired infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Linezolid is one of the most effective drugs for treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB), but adverse effects remain problematic.

This study aimed at evaluating the relationship between area-level indicators of income and total mortality during the first phase of COVID-19 pandemic in the most hit Italian region. METHODS: We conducted an ecological study based on the number of deaths registered in the municipalities of the Lombardy region (Italy) between January 2019 and June 2020. Municipalities were grouped according to quintiles of average income and pension of their resident population. Monthly age-standardized mortality ratios (MRs) between the poorest and the richest municipalities and the corresponding 95% CI were computed to evaluate whether the pre-existing socioeconomic inequalities widened during the pandemic. RESULTS: Over the study period, 175 853 deaths were registered. During the pre-pandemic period (January 2019 to February 2020) the MR between the poorest and the richest municipalities ranged between 1.12 (95% CI: 1.00C1.25) and 1.33 (95% CI: 1.20C1.47). In March 2020, when the pandemic began to rapidly spread in the region, it raised up to 1.61 (95% CI: 1.51C1.72) and decreased thereafter, reaching the pre-pandemic values in April 2020. Similar results were observed in the analysis of the mortality at ages 65 and over in municipalities grouped according to average pension, where the MR increased up to 1.82 (95% CI: 1.70C1.94) in March 2020.

Using fluid-phase luciferase immune precipitation (LIPS) assays, we characterized IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies to the spike receptor binding domain (RBD), S1+S2, nucleocapsid, and ORF6 to ORF10 of SARS-CoV-2, to the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 betacoronaviruses spike S2, and the H1N1Ca2009 flu virus hemagglutinin. Sequential samples at 1 and 3 months after hospital discharge were also tested for SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies in 95 patients.RESULTSAntibodies developed rapidly against multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens in 95% of patients by 4 weeks after symptom onset and IgG to the RBD increased until the third month of follow-up. We observed a major synchronous expansion of antibodies to the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 spike S2. A likely coinfection with influenza was neither linked to a more severe presentation of the disease nor to a worse outcome. Of the measured antibody responses, positivity for IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD was predictive of survival.CONCLUSIONThe measurement of antibodies to selected epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 antigens can offer a more accurate assessment of the humoral response in patients and its impact on survival.

The use of 357 taxa (3711 use reports, URs), was recorded, belonging to 215 genera and 72 botanical families. Over the total taxa, 12 are new for Tuscany, 52 seem not to be present in other Italian regions, and 54 were not detected in the consulted European ethnobotanical literature. Of these taxa, 324 (3117 URs) were used as food, while 49 (178 URs) and 81 (416 URs) were used for liquor and seasoning, respectively. Of the 17 different food recipes, cooked vegetables constituted the largest group, followed by salads, omelets, snacks, and fillings. The chemical composition of the recorded food plants and the possible safety risks associated to their consumption, as well as their traditional medicinal use, are also shown.

Moreover, the effect of the Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic on the flight movement was analyzed. An analysis of the punctuality and regularity of the aircraft movement operating domestic and international scheduled, charter and cargo flights from Almaty Airport for the same period was presented. Special attention was devoted to the detailing and decoding of each delay reason which enabled the authors to determine several factors, that had provoked the occurrence of flight delays. Based on the analysis and with the aim to reduce the number of flight delays, some ideas were theorized to allow airlines and airport services to uncover their hidden reserves.

METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients diagnosed as having distal rectal adenocarcinoma with clinically positive LPLNs (7 mm, with irregular borders or mixed signal intensity) using primary pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These patients had received SIB-IMRT-based neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) and non-operative treatment according to the heterogeneity of the disease or personal preference. Chi-square tests were used to compare data between the two groups. Progression-free survival (PFS) and local regrowth were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Between 2016 and 2019, we analyzed 75 patients diagnosed as having clinically positive LPLNs using primary MRI. SIB-IMRT was delivered to the planning positive LPLNs (PGTVn) at a total dose of 56C60 Gy. After NCRT, 23 patients underwent non-operative treatment. Among these patients, the median short axis of LPLNs was 8 mm (range: 7C21 mm). Fifteen patients were categorized into the mesorectal fascia (MRF)-positive group. The median follow-up duration for these patients was 19.8 months, and no patient exhibited LPLN regrowth. The 2-year PFS rate was 85.6% for non-operative patients, 74.6% for operative patients, and 90.0% for the pathological complete response (pCR) subgroup. Eighteen patients who underwent non-operative treatment were included in the clinical complete response (cCR) subgroup. The 2-year PFS and local regrowth rates in this group were similar to those in patients with clinically negative LPLN who achieved cCR. During NCRT, 21 (28.0%) patients experienced grade 2C3 acute reversible toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: SIB-IMRT could eliminate metastases in LPLNs in a safe and effective manner, and non-operative strategies may be promising for cCR patients.","output":"Effect of Simultaneous Integrated Boost Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (SIB-IMRT) and Non-Operative Strategy on Outcomes of Distal Rectal Cancer Patients with Clinically Positive Lateral Pelvic Lymph Node"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Since the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, cancer patients have been assumed to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19. Here, we present an analysis of cancer patients from the LEOSS (Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients) registry to determine whether cancer patients are at higher risk. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 435 cancer patients and 2636 non-cancer patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, enrolled between March 16 and August 31, 2020. Data on socio-demographics, comorbidities, cancer-related features and infection course were collected. Age-, sex- and comorbidity-adjusted analysis was performed. Primary endpoint was COVID-19-related mortality. RESULTS: In total, 435 cancer patients were included in our analysis. Commonest age category was 76C85 years (36.5%), and 40.5% were female. Solid tumors were seen in 59% and lymphoma and leukemia in 17.5% and 11% of patients. Of these, 54% had an active malignancy, and 22% had recently received anti-cancer treatments. At detection of SARS-CoV-2, the majority (62.5%) presented with mild symptoms. Progression to severe COVID-19 was seen in 55% and ICU admission in 27.5%. COVID-19-related mortality rate was 22.5%. Male sex, advanced age, and active malignancy were associated with higher death rates. Comparing cancer and non-cancer patients, age distribution and comorbidity differed significantly, as did mortality (14% vs 22.5%, p value < 0.001). After adjustments for other risk factors, mortality was comparable. CONCLUSION: Comparing cancer and non-cancer patients, outcome of COVID-19 was comparable after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidity. However, our results emphasize that cancer patients as a group are at higher risk due to advanced age and pre-existing conditions.

In contrast to other dental clinics, the Justus-Liebig-University Giessen (Germany) decided not to limit dental treatment to emergencies alone, but to continue dental care for all patients, with increased safety measures. As such, health care professionals may be exposed to additional physical and mental stress. The aim of this study was to assess the perspectives of all persons involved in dental care (dentists, dental assistants, students, and patients) regarding the aspects of safety measures, anxiety about self-infection and infecting others, and other prospects in the period March to December 2020 using a questionnaire. Data collection was performed between 14 December 2020 and 23 January 2021. A total of 35 dentists (response rate of 79.5%), 23 dental assistants (65.7%), 84 students (80%), and 51 patients (21.8%) completed the survey. The patients did not notice any changes in the care received. Dentists and dental assistants reported a higher workload due to additional safety measures. The majority of dentists, students, and patients agreed that normal patient care was maintained. One-third of dental assistants would have preferred emergency treatment alone and expressed significantly higher anxiety about COVID-19 infection than all other groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, all groups showed a predominantly positive perspective on dental care, and anxiety about self-infection and infecting others was especially low. However, additional measures are time-consuming and compound daily patient care.

In particular, we focus on survival time of coronavirus on solid and porous surfaces. Since the aqueous phase of a respiratory droplet serves as a medium for virus survival, evaporation of the droplet on a surface plays a crucial role in determining the virus survival time. While the bulk of the droplet takes a few seconds to evaporate, previous virus titer measurements revealed that the virus can survive for several hours or days on a surface. This long survival of virus has been attributed to a residual thin-liquid film which remains after drying of the bulk droplet. The evaporation of the thin-film is governed by the disjoining pressure within it and therefore, is a much slower process which causes the virus to survive longer. However, the aforesaid disjoining pressure is significantly modulated for the case of porous surfaces due to their typical geometries. This accelerates the thin-film evaporation on porous surfaces and thereby making them lesser susceptible to virus survival. Therefore, porous materials are deemed to be relatively safer for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 via fomite transmission. Using results of the reported research, we briefly discuss the possible recommendations to mitigate the spread of the disease.","output":"A review on coronavirus survival on impermeable and porous surfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This commentary will focus on the role of thrombectomy for the treatment of embolic stroke during the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Several studies have reported that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can directly infect endothelial cells, and endothelial dysfunction is often found in severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To better understand the pathological mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess biomarkers of endothelial cells in patients with COVID-19. Methods. A literature search was conducted on online databases for observational studies evaluating biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and composite poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Results. A total of 1187 patients from 17 studies were included in this analysis. The estimated pooled means for von Willebrand Factor (VWF) antigen levels in COVID-19 patients was higher compared to healthy control (306.42 [95% confidence interval (CI) 291.37-321.48], p<0.001; I2:86%), with the highest VWF antigen levels was found in deceased COVID-19 patients (448.57 [95% CI 407.20-489.93], p<0.001; I2:0%). Meta-analysis showed that higher plasma levels of VWF antigen, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen (PAI-1) antigen, and soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) were associated with composite poor outcome in COVID-19 patients ([standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.74 [0.33-1.16], p<0.001; I2:80.4%], [SMD 0.55 [0.19-0.92], p=0.003; I2:6.4%], [SMD 0.33 [0.04-0.62], p=0.025; I2:7.9%], and [SMD 0.55 [0.10-0.99], p=0.015; I2:23.6%], respectively). Conclusion. The estimated pooled means shows increased levels of VWF antigen in COVID-19 patients. Several biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction, including VFW antigen, t-PA, PAI-1, and sTM, are significantly associated with increased composite poor outcome in patients with COVID-19.

Here, biosecurity is referred to as implementing control measures to decrease the chance of animal disease spreading. However, social dynamics are largely ignored in traditional livestock disease models. Not accounting for these dynamics may lead to substantial bias in the predicted epidemic trajectory. In this research, an agent-based model is developed by integrating the human decision-making process into epidemiological processes. We simulate human behavioral change on biosecurity practices following an increase in the regional disease incidence. We apply the model to beef cattle production systems in southwest Kansas, United States, to examine the impact of human behavior factors on a hypothetical foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. The simulation results indicate that heterogeneity of individuals regarding risk attitudes significantly affects the epidemic dynamics, and human-behavior factors need to be considered for improved epidemic forecasting. With the same initial biosecurity status, increasing the percentage of risk-averse producers in the total population using a targeted strategy can more effectively reduce the number of infected producer locations and cattle losses compared to a random strategy. In addition, the reduction in epidemic size caused by the shifting of producers risk attitudes towards risk-aversion is heavily dependent on the initial biosecurity level. A comprehensive investigation of the initial biosecurity status is recommended to inform risk communication strategy design.","output":"Simulating human behavioral changes in livestock production systems during an epidemic: The case of the US beef cattle industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on healthcare in general and on the availability of emergency services. Immediate access to specialised services, including intensive care unit (ICUs), is potentially endangered during a pandemic. Severely injured patients highly rely on these resources, shortage may influence their outcome. We therefore evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the outcome of major trauma patients.Methods: A nationwide comprehensive multi-centre prospective observational cohort study, based on the Dutch National Trauma Registry was performed to compare the patient characteristics, resource usage, and outcome of major trauma patients treated at all trauma-receiving hospitals during the first COVID-19 peak (March 23rd through May 10th) in 2020 versus preCCOVID-19 reference periods in 2018 and 2019.Findings: During the COVID-19 peak period, 502 major trauma patients were admitted, versus 566 on average in the pre-COVID-19 years. Significantly fewer patients were admitted to ICU facilities during the peak than during the reference period (461% versus 533%;p=0008). The subgroup of 155 major trauma patients with less severe brain injuries (abbreviated injury score 3) were in particular less often admitted to the ICU during the peak (361% vs 52 1%;p=0001). Moreover, this subgroup showed increased mortality compared to the reference group (142% vs 77%;p=0023). In addition, a significant increase in observed versus predicted mortality was also recorded for patients who had a priori predicted mortality of 50% to 75% (p=0012).Interpretation: We speculate that the restricted availability of ICU beds negatively influenced the outcome of major trauma patients during the COVID-19 peak in 2020.

Background Seasonal influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are primary causes of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children. New respiratory viruses including human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (hBoV), and influenza 2009 A(H1N1) virus have a strong impact on the pediatric population. Objectives To evaluate epidemiological and clinical features of ARTIs in hospitalized children. Methods From December 1, 2008, to December 31, 2009, all children under age fifteen (n = 575) hospitalized for ARTIs were investigated for influenza A (subtype H1N1, H3N2, and 2009 H1N1) and B, RSV A and B, hMPV, and hBoV by PCR. Results Fifty\\\\one percent of samples were positive for these respiratory viruses. The frequencies of virus detection were RSV 341%, hBoV 68%, hMPV 5%, seasonal influenza A 5%, and seasonal influenza B 0%. From April 2009, 116% of collected samples were influenza 2009 A(H1N1) positive. Respiratory syncytial virus activity peaked in January, hBoV in February, and hMPV in April. Seasonal influenza A was detected only between January and April 2009, while influenza 2009 A(H1N1) peaked in November. Respiratory syncytial virus and hMPV were mainly associated with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and with necessity of O(2) administration. The 2009 pandemic influenza was more frequently detected in elder children (P < 0001) and was associated with higher, longer\\\\lasting fevers compared with other viral infections (P < 005).

A risk factor derived from a dose response model based on the time averaged pathogen quantity present around the passengers mouth is used to quantify the risk of infection through airborne mode. It is found that the hot, dry quiescent scenario poses the greatest threat of infection (spatio averaged risk factor 42 percent), whereas the cold humid condition poses the least risk of infection (spatio averaged risk factor 30 percent. The implementation of Fan ventilation at low RPM increases the risk as compared to a quiescent scenario, however with the increase in speed the risk decreases significantly. The Fan ventilation scenario with 1100 RPM (having a spatio averaged risk factor of 10 percent) decreases the risk of infection by 67 percent in a hot, dry climatic condition as compared to a quiescent scenario.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time from ICU admission until death. We used competing risk regression models and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator to identify the factors, and to construct a risk score. Predictive ability of the score was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the Brier score using 500 bootstraps replications.

Finally, the current research analysis identified possible recommendations to enhance the resilience of coastal fishers during COVID-19, emphasizing arrangements that should be made to provide alternative livelihood opportunities for coastal fishermen via need-based training, technical and vocational education and training, and microcredit to keep them afloat and earning during the pandemic, not relying only on fishing.","output":"Impacts, Diversity, and Resilience of a Coastal Water Small-Scale Fisheries Nexus during COVID-19: A Case Study in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aging, defined by a decrease in the physical and functional integrity of the tissues, leads to age-associated degenerative diseases. There is a relation between aged dental pulp and the senescence of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). Therefore, it is important to investigate the molecular processes underlying the senescence of DPSCs to elucidate the dental pulp aging mechanisms. p-Cresol (PC), a uremic toxin, is strongly related to cellular senescence. Here, age-related phenotypic changes including senescence, apoptosis, inflammation, and declining odontoblast differentiation in PC-treated canine DPSCs were investigated. Under the PC condition, cellular senescence was induced by decreased proliferation capacity and increased cell size, senescence-associated -galactosidase (SA--gal) activity, and senescence markers p21, IL-1, IL-8, and p53. Exposure to PC could stimulate inflammation by the increased expression of IL-6 and cause the distraction of the cell cycle by the increased level of Bax protein and decreased Bcl-2. The levels of odontoblast differentiation markers, dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), dentin matrix protein 1, and osterix, were decreased. Consistent with those findings, the alizarin red staining, alkaline phosphatase, and DSPP protein level were decreased during the odontoblast differentiation process. Taken together, these findings indicate that PC could induce cellular senescence in DPSCs, which may demonstrate the changes in aging dental pulp.","output":"Effects of p-Cresol on Senescence, Survival, Inflammation, and Odontoblast Differentiation in Canine Dental Pulp Stem Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Asthma is a heterogeneous respiratory disease reflecting distinct pathobiologic mechanisms. These mechanisms are based, at least partly, on different genetic factors shared by many other conditions, such as allergic diseases and obesity. Investigating the shared genetic effects enables better understanding of the mechanisms of phenotypic correlations and is less subject to confounding by environmental factors. The increasing availability of large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) for asthma has enabled researchers to examine the genetic contributions to the epidemiologic associations between asthma subtypes and those between coexisting diseases and/or traits and asthma. Studies have found not only shared but also distinct genetic components between asthma subtypes, indicating that the heterogeneity is related to distinct genetics. This review summarizes a recently compiled analytic approach-genome-wide cross-trait analysis-to determine shared and distinct genetic architecture. The genome-wide cross-trait analysis features in several analytic aspects: genetic correlation, cross-trait meta-analysis, Mendelian randomization, polygenic risk score, and functional analysis. In this article, we discuss in detail the scientific goals that can be achieved by these analyses, their advantages, and their limitations. We also make recommendations for future directions: (1) ethnicity-specific asthma GWASs and (2) application of cross-trait methods to multiomics data to dissect the heritability found in GWASs.

Virus identification is performed by sequencing of cloned DOP-PCR products followed by sequence comparison to sequences published in GenBank. This method was used to detect a variety of DNA viruses (including HSV, VZV, SV40, AAV, and EBV) and RNA viruses (including HTLV-I, HTLV-II, influenza, and poliovirus), which were spiked into cells, constitutively expressed in cell culture, or detected in productively infected cultured cells.

Followed by the emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses in 2003 SARS-CoV, in 2012 MERS-CoV, now in 2019 pathogenic SARS-CoV-2, is associated with a global pandemic situation. In humans, the effects of these viruses are correlated with viral pneumonia, severe respiratory tract infections. It is believed that interaction between angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor and viral Spike protein mediates the coronavirus entry into human respiratory epithelial cells and establishes the host tropism. ACE2 receptor is highly expressed in airway epithelial cells. Along with viral-receptor interaction, proteolytic cleavability of S protein has been considered as the determinant of disease severity. Several studies highlight the occurrence of impaired host immune response and expression of excessive inflammatory response especially cytokines against viral infection. The mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced acute lung injury are still undefined; however, the term cytokine storm has now been recognized to be closely associated with COVID-19. The levels of inflammatory mediators from cytokine storm cause damage to the host cells. In particular, the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 appears to be the key mediator in early phase of virus-receptor interaction; however, secreted IL-6 might not be representative of lung inflammation. Understanding the cellular, and molecular factors involved in immune dysregulation and the high virulence capacity of COVID-19 will help in potential targeted therapy against it. Drug repurposing and molecular docking analysis is considered as an attractive alternative approach in analyzing suitable drug candidates to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

To identify shared mechanisms of immune dysfunction during infection by nine different viruses (cytomegalovirus, Ebstein-Barr virus, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, Hepatitis B and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, Dengue virus, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2), we applied analysis of corresponding transcription profiles from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).

In response to the growing threat of the COVID-19 pandemic in February, 2020, the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) began issuing Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) to laboratories and commercial manufacturers for the development and implementation of diagnostic tests1. So far, the gold standard assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection is the RT-qPCR (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction) test2. However, the authorized RT-qPCR test protocols vary widely, not only in the reagents, controls, and instruments they use, but also in the SARS-CoV-2 genes they target, what results constitute a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection, and their limit of detection (LoD). The FDA has provided a web site that lists most of the tests that have been issued EUAs, along with links to the authorization letters and summary documents describing these tests1. However, it is very challenging to use this site to compare or replicate these tests for a variety of reasons. First, at least 12 of 18 tests for EUA submissions made prior to March 31, 2020, are not listed there. To our knowledge, no EUAs have been issued for these applications. Second, the data are not standardized and are only provided as longhand prose in the summary documents. Third, some details (e.g. primer sequences) are absent from several of the test descriptions. Fourth, for tests provided by commercial manufacturers, summary documents are completely missing. To address at least the first three issues, we have developed a database, EUAdb (EUAdb.org), that holds standardized information about EUA-issued tests and is focused on RT-qPCR diagnostic tests, or high complexity molecular-based laboratory developed tests1.

Within the endo/lysosomal pathway, GP undergoes a series of structural rearrangements, controlled by interactions with host factors, that prime and activate it to bring about fusion between the viral and cellular lipid bilayers.

ROS-induced lysosome malfunction is an important inducement of pyroptosis. Transcription factor E3 (TFE3) exerts a decisive effect in oxidative metabolism and lysosomal homeostasis. We explored the effect of pyroptosis in random flap necrosis and discussed the effect of TFE3 in modulating pyroptosis. Histological analysis via hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunohistochemistry, general evaluation of flaps, evaluation of tissue edema, and laser Doppler blood flow were employed to determine the survival of the skin flaps. Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to calculate the expressions of pyroptosis, oxidative stress, lysosome function, and the AMPK-MCOLN1 signaling pathway. In cell experiments, HUVEC cells were utilized to ensure the relationship between TFE3, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced lysosome malfunction and cell pyroptosis. Our results indicate that pyroptosis exists in the random skin flap model and oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion cell model. In addition, NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis leads to necrosis of the flaps. Moreover, we also found that ischemic flaps can augment the accumulation of ROS, thereby inducing lysosomal malfunction and finally initiating pyroptosis. Meanwhile, we observed that TFE3 levels are interrelated with ROS levels, and overexpression and low expression of TFE3 levels can, respectively, inhibit and promote ROS-induced lysosomal dysfunction and pyroptosis during in vivo and in vitro experiments. In conclusion, we found the activation of TFE3 in random flaps is partially regulated by the AMPK-MCOLN1 signal pathway. Taken together, TFE3 is a key regulator of ROS-induced pyroptosis in random skin flaps, and TFE3 may be a promising therapeutic target for improving random flap survival.","output":"Targeting TFE3 Protects Against Lysosomal Malfunction-Induced Pyroptosis in Random Skin Flaps via ROS Elimination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global health diplomacy (GHD) is relatively a very new field that has yet to be clearly defined and developed though there are various definitions given by different experts from foreign policy, global health, diplomacy, international relations, governance, and law.

Inclusion criteria were: GA less than or equal to 30 weeks, hospitalization at less than or equal to 28 days of age, assignment of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD9-CM) or ICD10-CM codes for BPD and tracheostomy. Trends in tracheostomy and resource utilization were assessed using Jonckheere-Terpstra test. p-value < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS Overall, 987 out of 68,953 (1.4%) hospitalizations with BPD had tracheostomy. Characteristics of the study population: 60.8% were male, 68.4% less than or equal to 26 weeks GA, 43.8% White, 60.5% with Medicaid or self-pay, 65.2% in the Midwest and South census regions of the United States, and 45.7% had gastrostomy tube placement.

In the era of COVID-19, millions of people can be reached by E-E media without requiring any physical contact. We have designed a short, wordless, animated video about COVID-19 hygiene practices-such as social distancing and frequent hand washing-that can be rapidly distributed through social media channels to a global audience. The E-E video's effectiveness, however, remains unclear. The study aims to achieve the following objectives. To: 1.Quantify people's interest in watching a short, animated video about COVID-19 hygiene (abbreviated to CoVideo).2.Establish the CoVideo's effectiveness in increasing behavioural intent toward COVID-19 hygiene.3.Establish the CoVideo's effectiveness in improving COVID-19 hygiene knowledge. TRIAL DESIGN: The present study is a multi-site, parallel group, randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effectiveness of the CoVideo against an attention placebo control (APC) video or no video. The trial has an intervention arm (CoVideo), placebo arm (APC), and control arm (no video). Nested in each trial arm is a list experiment and questionnaire survey, with the following ordering. Arm 1: the CoVideo, list experiment, and questionnaire survey. Arm 2: the APC video, list experiment, questionnaire survey, and CoVideo. Arm 3: the list experiment, questionnaire survey, and CoVideo. For each list experiment, participants will be randomized to a control or treatment group. The control group will receive a list of five items and the treatment group will receive the same five items plus one item about COVID-19 hygiene. We will use the list experiment to reduce response bias associated with socially desirable answers to COVID-19 questions. The questionnaire survey will include items about the participant's age, sex, country of residence, highest education, and knowledge of COVID-19 spread. After completing the list experiment and questionnaire survey, participants in Arms 2 and 3 will receive the CoVideo to ensure post-trial access to treatment. PARTICIPANTS: This will be an online study setting. We will use Prolific Academic (ProA: https://www.prolific.co) to recruit participants and host our study on the Gorilla&#8482; platform (www.gorilla.sc). To be eligible, participants must be between the age of 18 and 59 years (male, female, or other) and have current residence in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Mexico, or France. Participants will be excluded from the study if they cannot speak English, German, French, or Spanish (since the instructions and survey questions will be available in these 4 languages only). INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The intervention is an E-E video about COVID-19 hygiene (CoVideo). Developed by our co-author (MA) for Stanford Medicine, the CoVideo is animated with sound effects, and has no words, speech, or text. The CoVideo shows how the novel coronavirus is spread (airborne, physical contact) and summarizes the public's response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Key components of the CoVideo are the promotion of five hygiene practices: i) social distancing and avoiding group gatherings, ii) frequently washing hands with soap and water or sanitizer, iii) cleaning surfaces at home (e.g., kitchen counters), iv) not sharing eating utensils, and v) avoidance of stockpiling essential goods (such as toilet paper and face masks). The CoVideo, which was designed for universal reach and optimized for release on social media channels, can be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAj38E7vrS8. The comparators are an APC video (Arm 2) or no video (Arm 3). The APC video is similar in style to the CoVideo; it is also animated with a duration of 2.30 minutes, has sound effects but no words, speech, or text. The video message is about how small choices become actions, which become habits, which become a way of life. It is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HEnohs6yYw. Each list experiment will have a control list as the comparator. The control list is needed to measure the prevalence of behavioral intent toward COVID-19 hygiene. MAIN OUTCOMES: This study will measure primary and secondary outcomes related to COVID-19 hygiene. By hygiene, we mean the adoption of behaviors or practices that reduce the chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19. As our primary outcome, we will measure changes in behavioral intent toward five hygiene practices: social distancing, washing hands, cleaning household surfaces, not sharing eating utensils, and not stockpiling essential goods. As a secondary outcome, we will measure knowledge about behaviors that can prevent the spread of COVID-19. RANDOMIZATION: Using a web-based randomization algorithm, Gorilla will randomly allocate participants to the intervention (CoVideo), placebo (APC), or control (no video) arm (sequence generation) at a 1:1:1 ratio. Within each trial arm, Gorilla will randomly allocate participants at a 1:1 ratio to the control or treatment group. Items in the lists will be randomly ordered to avoid order effects. The presentation order of the list experiments will also be randomized. BLINDING: Because ProA handles the interaction between the study investigators and participants, the participants will be completely anonymous to the study investigators. The outcome measures will be self-reported and submitted anonymously. All persons in the study team will be blinded to the group allocation. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED: The Gorilla algorithm will randomize 6,700 participants to each trial arm, giving a total sample size of 20,100. TRIAL STATUS: The protocol version number is 1.0 and the date is 18 May 2020. Recruitment is expected to end by 22 June 2020. Thus far, the study investigators have recruited 2,500 participants on ProA. Of these participants, 800 have completed the study on the Gorilla platform. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study and its outcomes were registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (www.drks.de) on May 12th, 2020, protocol number: #DRKS00021582. The study was registered before any data was collected. FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).

As advanced AD is difficult to manage, accurate diagnosis of the disorder is critical. Previous studies have revealed effective deep learning methods of classification. However, deep learning methods require a large number of image datasets. Moreover, medical images are affected by various environmental factors. In the current study, we propose a deep learning-based method for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is less sensitive to different datasets for external validation, based upon F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT). RESULTS The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of our proposed network were 86.09%, 80.00%, and 92.96% (respectively) using our dataset, and 91.02%, 87.93%, and 93.57% (respectively) using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We observed that our model classified AD and normal cognitive (NC) cases based on the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), where pathological changes occur in AD. The performance of the GAP layer was considered statistically significant compared to the fully connected layer in both datasets for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (p < 0.01). In addition, performance comparison between the ADNI dataset and our dataset showed no statistically significant differences in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The proposed model demonstrated the effectiveness of AD classification using the GAP layer. Our model learned the AD features from PCC in both the ADNI and Severance datasets, which can be seen in the heatmap.

Capturing this phenomenon theoretically requires modeling at the scale of individuals. Using a mathematical model, we show that superspreading represents an Achilles' heel of COVID-19, and drastically improves the efficacy of mitigations which reduce the personal contact number, even when this is done without changing the average social contact time.","output":"Superspreaders provide essential clues for mitigation of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chile's recent history has gone through a hybrid conjuncture between what has been called the \\"social outbreak\\" on October 18, 2019, and the declaration of health emergency by COVID-19 promulgated on March 18, 2020.

This social problem is investigated from Critical Discourse Studies (Fairclough, 2013;O'Grady, 2019) and Systemic Functional Linguistics, particularly the appraisal system (Martin and White, 2005), together with the categories of legitimation proposed by van Leeuwen (2008). This research is positioned from a qualitative perspective (Flick, 2015) and takes as a corpus of analysis the two speeches declaring a State of Exception by President Pinera in 2019 and 2020, respectively. These speeches are available to the public at https://prensa.presidencia.cl/. The results show that an enemy is constructed in both cases by contrasting the actions taken or not, which present negative appreciation valuations in the case of COVID-19 and negative integrity judgments in the case of the social outbreak. In both cases, key social actors emerge that are firmly legitimized within the State of Exception framework, which in turn is based on the categories of authority and moral legitimation. In conclusion, the enemy's construction is identified in both cases with modification of the actors that interact through a problem, an action, and an agent that solves the problem constructed.","output":"State of Exception against microscopical and powerful enemies: a critical discourse analysis of two national broadcasting from President Pinera"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a significant threat to global health. As the coronavirus outbreak began spreading, hospitals were forced to relocate resources to treat the growing number of COVID-19 patients. As a consequence, doctors across the country canceled tens of thousands of nonurgent surgeries. However, recognizing that the COVID-19 situation may be highly variable and fluid in different communities across the country, elective surgery could be still allowed in some centers for patients included in the high-priority class. The majority of endocrine disorders requiring surgical treatment in patients identifiable as first-priority class, or needing hospitalization within 30 days, are generally represented by malignant thyroid tumors, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and some adrenal disorders. The need for urgent intervention is evaluated on a case-by-case basis according to the severity of the symptoms, the likelihood of progression, and global clinical judgment. On the basis of the above indications, during the last 4 weeks, we performed 18 planned surgical treatments in patients with thyroid cancer (total thyroidectomies, plus lymph node dissection if needed) or multinodular toxic goiter. In no case, postoperative ventilatory support was needed, and the average hospital stay was 3 days. The negative COVID-19 status for all the treated patients was appropriately evaluated beforehand.

We aimed to assess the status of psychological distress and its association with quality of life (QoL) in organ transplant recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out with 305 organ transplant recipients during March 30 and April 2, 2020, in Wuhan. Psychological distress comprised depression, anxiety, insomnia, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire, the Insomnia Severity Index, and Impact of event scale-revised. QoL was assessed using the Chinese version of the short Form 36-item health survey. Results: The prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD in organ transplant recipients was 13.4, 6.9, 11.8, and 30.5%, respectively. Organ transplant recipients with depression had significantly lower scores in all eight dimensions of QoL compared with participants without depression (all p < 0.05). Lower scores on the QoL dimensions of role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, role emotional, and mental health were found in organ transplant recipients with anxiety, insomnia, or PTSD compared with their counterparts without the respective disorder (all p < 0.05). Limitation: The cross-sectional study design limited us to make causal conclusion and the influence of potential confounders cannot be ruled out. Conclusions: Psychological distress was prevalent in organ transplant recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic, and those with depression, anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD had poorer QoL. Therefore, timely psychological counseling, COVID-19 related health education, and essential community medical services should be provided to organ transplant recipients to relieve their psychological distress, and to improve their QoL.","output":"Psychological Distress and Its Association With Quality of Life in Organ Transplant Recipients During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, machine-based conversational systems known as chatbots have emerged for many applications in our lives Chatbots are intelligent tools that use the concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in order to communicate with humans using their natural languages The inherent role of chatbots is to understand users questions and provide the most appropriate responses intelligently and naturally Chatbots have been very successful in some of the most spoken languages;however, Arabic chatbots have not reached the expected level Recently, many researchers have attempted to fill the gap in implementing Arabic chatbots trying to overcome the complex linguistic features of Arabic language Although Arabic chatbots can be utilized as a supportive tool for Saudi university students, their implementation, especially in Arabic language, is surprisingly neglected Moreover, during changing the mode of education into distance learning due to (COVID-19) pandemic, it did not help the emergence of Arabic chatbots in Saudi universities This research focuses on language-related challenges and obstacles that hinder the implementation of Arabic chatbots Additionally, this paper presents fundamental recommendations for implementing effective Arabic chatbots for academic uses In summary, it is noticed that Arabic chatbots literature suffers from paucity, which means further studies are needed in this area ? 2021, IAENG International Journal of Computer Science All Rights Reserved","output":"The Challenges of Using Arabic Chatbot in Saudi Universities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, the development of basal insulin therapies has focused on insulin analogues that have longer durations of action and more predictable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profiles than their human insulin-based predecessors, such as neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin.

Background: This study aimed to evaluate the COVID-19 isolation's impact on digital device use by comparing hours spent on digital devices before and during the 24-hour curfew in Saudi Arabia, while assessing the symptoms associated with digital eye strain. Methods: A self-reported questionnaire was used to compare the total hours per day, either continuous or intermittent, spent on digital devices during and before curfew, and the association of these durations with digital eye strain. Results: A total of 1,939 participants, (mean  SD: 33  12.2 years and 72% women) were recruited. Results showed a significant difference between usage duration before and during curfew.

Most of the existing studies are based on large and private annotated datasets that are impractical to obtain from a single institution, especially when radiologists are busy fighting the coronavirus disease. Furthermore, it is hard to compare current COVID-19 CT segmentation methods as they are developed on different datasets, trained in different settings, and evaluated with different metrics. Methods: To promote the development of data-efficient deep learning methods, in this paper, we built three benchmarks for lung and infection segmentation based on 70 annotated COVID-19 cases, which contain current active research areas, e.g., few-shot learning, domain generalization, and knowledge transfer. For a fair comparison among different segmentation methods, we also provide standard training, validation and testing splits, evaluation metrics and, the corresponding code. Results: Based on the state-of-the-art network, we provide more than 40 pre-trained baseline models, which not only serve as out-of-the-box segmentation tools but also save computational time for researchers who are interested in COVID-19 lung and infection segmentation.

Deterministic wave patterns promote the growth of patterned biofilms, while wave-driven turbulent motion discourages patterned attachment of bacteria. Strong biofilms form under the wave antinodes, while inactive bacteria and passive particles settle under nodal points. By controlling the wavelength, its amplitude, and horizontal mobility of the wave patterns, one can shape the biofilm and either enhance the growth or discourage the formation of the biofilm.

This work aimed to understand the epidemiological and phylogenetic features of HRV in Guangzhou, China. In addition, the clinical characteristics of hospitalized children infected with different subtype of HRV was investigated. METHODS: Hospitalized children aged < 14 years old with acute respiratory tract infections were enrolled from August 2018 to December 2019. HRV was screened for by a real-time reverse-transcription PCR targeting the viral 5UTR. RESULTS: HRV was detected in 6.41% of the 655 specimens. HRV infection was frequently observed in children under 2 years old (57.13%). HRV-A and HRV-C were detected in 18 (45%) and 22 (55%) specimens. All 40 HRV strains detected were classified into 29 genotypes. The molecular evolutionary rate of HRV-C was estimated to be 3.34  10(C3) substitutions/site/year and was faster than HRV-A (7.79  10(C4) substitutions/site/year). Children who experienced rhinorrhoea were more common in the HRV-C infection patients than HRV-A. The viral load was higher in HRV-C detection group than HRV-A detection group (p = 0.0148).

Despite efforts to encourage referrals to high-volume hospitals, many patients receive treatment at low-volume centers with worse outcomes. We aimed to determine the most important factors considered by referring providers when selecting specialists for their patients through a systematic review of medical and surgical literature. METHODS PubMed and Embase were searched from January 2000 to July 2021 using terms related to referrals, specialty, surgery, primary care, and decision-making. We included survey and interview studies reporting the factors considered by healthcare providers as they refer patients to specialists in the USA. Studies were screened by two independent reviewers. Quality was assessed using the CASP Checklist. A qualitative thematic analysis was performed to synthesize common decision factors across studies. RESULTS We screened 1,972 abstracts and identified 7 studies for inclusion, reporting on 1,575 providers. Thematic analysis showed that referring providers consider factors related to the specialist's clinical expertise (skill, training, outcomes, and assessments), interactions between the patient and specialist (prior experience, rapport, location, scheduling, preference, and insurance), and interactions between the referring physician and specialist (personal relationships, communication, reputation, reciprocity, and practice or system affiliation). Notably, studies did not describe how providers assess clinical or technical skills. CONCLUSIONS Referring providers rely on subjective factors and assessments to evaluate quality when selecting a specialist. There may be a role for guidelines and objective measures of quality to inform the choice of specialist by referring providers.","output":"How Referring Providers Choose Specialists for Their Patients: a Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 has caused worldwide devastation. IFIH1 is a pattern recognition receptor that senses coronavirus RNA and triggers interferon production as a first line of viral immune defense. The role of IFIH1 polymorphism, rs1990760 (C>T; aaA946T) in the epidemiology of viral infection is well studied, and the minor allele T resists viral infection. Knock-in mice with mutated IFIH1 protein (946T) for this allele have enhanced interferon production and protection from lethal viral infection. The minor allele frequency (Tmaf) varies widely from Africans (0.06 to 0.35) to Chinese (0.19 to 0.23) to Caucasians (0.56 to 0.69). During the initial days of infection when the social restrictions were not imposed, I show that the infection rate in Italy was lower as expected from its higher Tmaf (0.56) than that in China (Tmaf for southern China, 0.23). The infection rate in the USA and Spain was intermediate between those two countries despite higher Caucasian overall Tmaf (0.69), perhaps due to a more admixed African population in these countries. These analyses suggest that African-Americans and Chinese with low Tmaf of rs1990760 are more vulnerable to SARS-COV2 infection, apart from other genetic factors or socioeconomic conditions in these population.

A total of 1142 pregnant women from nine Italian healthcare centers were assessed through the state scale of the StateCTrait Anxiety Inventory and a clinical interview. Demographic and socioeconomic factors were also measured. RESULTS. The prevalence of anxiety was 24.3% among pregnant women. There was a significantly higher risk of anxiety in pregnant women with low level of education (p < 0.01), who are jobless (p < 0.01), and who have economic problems (p < 0.01). Furthermore, pregnant women experience higher level of anxiety when they have not planned the pregnancy (p < 0.01), have a history of abortion (p < 0.05), and have children living at the time of the current pregnancy (p < 0.05).

Based on our data, COVID-19 is associated with a dysregulation of sphingolipid homeostasis in a severity-dependent manner, particularly focused around a reduction of sphingomyelins and an accumulation of ceramides by increased enzyme activities leading to ceramide elevation (ASM, NSM) combined with a decreased activity of enzymes (NC) reducing ceramide levels. The potential of a combined sphingolipid/enzyme pattern as a diagnostic and prognostic marker and therapeutic target deserves further exploration.","output":"COVID-19 and its clinical severity are associated with alterations of plasma sphingolipids and enzyme activities of sphingomyelinase and ceramidase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intravenous vitamin C (IV-VitC) has been suggested as a treatment for severe sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome; however, there are limited studies evaluating its use in severe COVID-19. Efficacy and safety of high-dose IV-VitC (HDIVC) in patients with severe COVID-19 were evaluated. This observational cohort was conducted at a single-center, 530 bed, community teaching hospital and took place from March 2020 through July 2020. Inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) was utilized to compare outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19 treated with and without HDIVC. Patients were enrolled if they were older than 18 years of age and were hospitalized secondary to severe COVID-19 infection, indicated by an oxygenation index < 300. Primary study outcomes included mortality, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and cardiac arrest. From a total of 100 patients enrolled, 25 patients were in the HDIVC group and 75 patients in the control group. The average time to death was significantly longer for HDIVC patients (P = 0.0139), with an average of 22.9 days versus 13.7 days for control patients. Patients who received HDIVC also had significantly lower rates of mechanical ventilation (52.93% vs. 73.14%; OR(IPTW) = 0.27; P = 0.0499) and cardiac arrest (2.46% vs. 9.06%; OR(IPTW) = 0.23; P = 0.0439).

When airway resistance (Raw) is elevated, the imposed work of breathing can lead to prolongation of mechanical ventilation. Biofilm and mucus build-up within the endotracheal tube (ETT) can increase Raw. Scraping the ETT can remove the biofilm build-up and decrease mechanical Raw. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of ETT scraping on Raw. The secondary aim was to determine whether decreasing Raw would impact subsequent SBT success. METHODS Intubated, mechanically ventilated subjects were enrolled if they failed an SBT and had an Raw of > 10 cm H2O/L/s. SBT failure was based on institutional guidelines, and Raw was calculated by subtracting the difference between the measured peak and plateau pressures using a square flow waveform with an inspiratory flow set at 60 L/min. The endOclear device was inserted into the ETT and withdrawn per manufacturer's guidelines. Scraping was repeated until the ETT was cleared. Change in Raw was compared pre- and post-ETT scraping using a paired t test. A Mann-Whitney U test evaluated the difference in percentage change in Raw between SBT groups. RESULTS Twenty-nine subjects completed the study. The mean pre- and post-ETT scraping Raw values were 15.17  3.83 and 12.05  3.19 cm H2O/L/s, respectively (P < .001). Subsequent SBT success was 48%; however, there was no difference in percentage change in Raw between subsequent passed SBT (18.61% [interquartile range 8.90-33.93%]) and failed SBT (23.88% [interquartile range 0.00-34.80%]), U = 78.5, z = -0.284, P = .78. No adverse events were noted with ETT scraping. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that ETT scraping can reduce Raw.

Using the calcineurin inhibitors (CI) nephrotoxicity score, the incidence of nephrotoxicity was monitored as a manifestation of excessive immunosuppression. Findings were correlated with clinical evidence of active BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) replication and PyVAN. Compared to the normal histology, nephrotoxicity was associated with more frequent BKPyV viremia and viruria (p = .01 and p < .01, respectively) and more common occurrence of PyVAN. The persistence of toxicity in the subsequent biopsy proved to be a negative risk factor of viremia and viruria (p = .03 and p < .01, respectively), independently of the initial BKPyV status. Toxicity could also be used as a predictor of viremia and viruria (p = .04 and p < .01, respectively) even in the absence of viral replication at the time of initial biopsy.

Methods: This was a pilot retrospective cohort study of all ISBCS and DSBCS patients who underwent senior resident-performed cataract surgery from May to September 2020 at a single academic institution. Outcome measures were final corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), final manifest refraction (MRx), intraoperative and postoperative complications rates, total number of visits, and patient satisfaction assessed postoperatively by telephone questionnaire. Results: Twenty-two eyes of 14 patients and 56 eyes of 28 patients underwent senior resident-performed ISBCS and DSBCS, respectively. Final CDVA was 20/25 or better in 21 (95%) ISBCS and 51 (91%) DSBCS eyes (P = 0.670). Deviation of final MRx from target refraction was within 0.50 D in 17 (77%) ISBCS and 47 (84%) DSBCS eyes (P = 0.522). There was no significant difference in intraoperative (P = 1.000) or postoperative (P = 1.000) complications. ISBCS patients averaged 3.5 fewer visits than DSBCS patients (5.9 vs 9.5, P < 0.001).

NIV in ARF due to Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS): Recommendations: NIV may be used in AHRF in OHS patients when they present with acute hypercapnic or acute on chronic respiratory failure (pH 45). (3B) NIV/CPAP may be used in obese, hypercapnic patients with OHS and/or right heart failure in the absence of acidosis. (UPP) B. NIV IN ACUTE HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: B1. NIV in Acute Cardiogenic Pulmonary Oedema: Recommendations: NIV is recommended in hospital patients with ARF, due to Cardiogenic pulmonary edema. (1A). NIV should be used in patients with acute heart failure/ cardiogenic pulmonary edema, right from emergency department itself. (1B) Both CPAP and BiPAP modes are safe and effective in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema. (1A). However, BPAP (NIV-PS) should be preferred in cardiogenic pulmonary edema with hypercapnia.

APPLICATION OF NIV: Recommendation: Choice of mode should be mainly decided by factors like disease etiology and severity, the breathing effort by the patient and the operator familiarity and experience. (UPP) We suggest using flow trigger over pressure triggering in assisted modes, as it provides better patient ventilator synchrony. Especially in COPD patients, flow triggering has been found to benefit auto PEEP. (3B) D. MANAGEMENT OF PATIENT ON NIV: D1. Sedation: Recommendations: A non-pharmacological approach to calm the patient (Reassuring the patient, proper environment) should always be tried before administrating sedatives. (UPP) In patients on NIV, sedation may be used with extremely close monitoring and only in an ICU setting with lookout for signs of NIV failure. (UPP) E. EQUIPMENT: Recommendations: We recommend that portable bilevel ventilators or specifically designed ICU ventilators with non-invasive mode should be used for delivering NonCinvasive ventilation in critically ill patients. (UPP) Both critical care ventilators with leak compensation and bi-level ventilators have been equally effective in decreasing the WOB, RR, and PaCO2.

To reduce wound-related complications, purse-string skin closure was introduced as an alternative to conventional linear skin closure. This study is designed to compare wound infection rates and operative outcomes between linear and purse-string skin closure after a loop ileostomy reversal. METHODS Between December 2002 and October 2010, a total of 48 consecutive patients undergoing a loop ileostomy reversal were enrolled. Outcomes were compared between linear skin closure (group L, n = 30) and purse string closure (group P, n = 18). The operative technique for linear skin closure consisted of an elliptical incision around the stoma, with mobilization, and anastomosis of the ileum. The rectus fascia was repaired with interrupted sutures. Skin closure was performed with vertical mattress interrupted sutures. Purse-string skin closure consisted of a circumstomal incision around the ileostomy using the same procedures as used for the ileum. Fascial closure was identical to linear closure, but the circumstomal skin incision was approximated using a purse-string subcuticular suture (2-0 Polysorb). RESULTS Between group L and P, there were no differences of age, gender, body mass index, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores. Original indication for ileostomy was 23 cases of malignancy (76.7%) in group L, and 13 cases of malignancy (77.2%) in group P. The median time duration from ileostomy to reversal was 4.0 months (range, 0.6 to 55.7 months) in group L and 4.1 months (range, 2.2 to 43.9 months) in group P. The median operative time was 103 minutes (range, 45 to 260 minutes) in group L and 100 minutes (range, 30 to 185 minutes) in group P. The median hospital stay was 11 days (range, 5 to 4 days) in group L and 7 days (range, 4 to 14 days) in group P (P < 0.001).

We analyzed which countries are increasing and which decreasing their consumption of all the major meats consumed over a period from 2000 to 2019. There is evidence of peak meat consumption having been reached in several countries, but also evidence of continued consumption increases in many of the emerging-economy countries, probably due to greater affordability. We also found evidence of this when we attempted to link Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita to meat consumption per capita. In many emerging-economy countries, there was a direct link over the years studied, but in the higher income countries there was no relationship. We discuss how this observed dichotomous relationship will shape future trends in meat consumption. ABSTRACT: Growing prosperity, but also disease outbreaks, natural disasters, and consumer preferences are changing global meat consumption. We investigated the 2000C2019 trends in 35 countries monitored by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. We also tested relationships with Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Several countries appeared to be reaching peak consumption of some meats, and three (New Zealand, Canada, and Switzerland) have reached this. Poultry consumption increased over time in most countries, and beef and mutton/lamb consumption decreased in many. Using cluster analysis, we divided countries into two clusters: one in which increases in GDP per capita matched increases in meat consumption; and a second one of nine countries, for which there was no association between per capita change in GDP and meat consumption. There was evidence of a tipping point around USD 40,000 of GDP per capita, after which increases in economic well-being do not lead to increased meat consumption.","output":"Are We Approaching Peak Meat Consumption?

The safety profile of the medication is favourable and well tolerated by patients, with local injection site reaction being the most common side effect described. These results have shifted the paradigm of the understanding of the disease and promise to become part of the armamentarium of medications for the standard of care of these patients, with potential use as monotherapy. The changing landscape of therapeutics and pathophysiology warrants increased recognition and understanding from the international cardiology community about this novel drug and its implication in managing these complex patients.The objective of this review is to describe the bio-action of rilonacept in the treatment of recurrent pericarditis.","output":"The role of rilonacept in recurrent pericarditis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate lung tumor identification is crucial for radiation treatment planning. Due to the low contrast of the lung tumor in computed tomography (CT) images, segmentation of the tumor in CT images is challenging. This paper effectively integrates the U-Net with the channel attention module (CAM) to segment the malignant lung area from the surrounding chest region. The SegChaNet method encodes CT slices of the input lung into feature maps utilizing the trail of encoders. Finally, we explicitly developed a multiscale, dense-feature extraction module to extract multiscale features from the collection of encoded feature maps. We have identified the segmentation map of the lungs by employing the decoders and compared SegChaNet with the state-of-the-art. The model has learned the dense-feature extraction in lung abnormalities, while iterative downsampling followed by iterative upsampling causes the network to remain invariant to the size of the dense abnormality. Experimental results show that the proposed method is accurate and efficient and directly provides explicit lung regions in complex circumstances without postprocessing.","output":"SegChaNet: A Novel Model for Lung Cancer Segmentation in CT Scans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intense X-rays available at powerful synchrotron beamlines provide macromolecular crystallographers with an incomparable tool for investigating biological phenomena on an atomic scale The resulting insights into the mechanisms underlying biological processes have played an essential role and shaped biomedical sciences during the last 30 years, considered the golden age of structural biology In this review, we analyze selected aspects of the impact of synchrotron radiation on structural biology Synchrotron beamlines have been used to determine over 70% of all macromolecular structures deposited into the Protein Data Bank (PDB) These structures were deposited by over 13,000 different research groups Interestingly, despite the impressive advances in synchrotron technologies, the median resolution of macromolecular structures determined using synchrotrons has remained constant throughout the last 30 years, at about 2 ?

While these measures helped prevent the community spread of the virus, the resulting environmental benefits of lockdown remained mostly unnoticed. While many studies documented improvements in air quality index, very few have explored the reduction in black carbon (BC) aerosols and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) concentrations due to lockdown. In this study, we evaluated the changes in concentrations of BC, PAHs, and PM2.5 before and during the lockdown period. Our results show that lockdown resulted in a significant reduction in concentrations of these pollutants. The average mass concentration of BC, PAHs, and PM2.5 before the lockdown was 11.71  3.33 gm-3, 108.71  27.77 ngm-3, and 147.65  41.77 gm-3, respectively. During the lockdown period, the concentration of BC, PAHs, and PM2.5 was 2.46  0.95 gm-3, 23.19  11.21 ngm-3, and 50.31  11.95 gm-3, respectively. The diagnostic ratio analysis for source apportionment showed changes in the emission sources before and during the lockdown. The primary sources of PAHs emissions before the lockdown were biomass, coal combustion, and vehicular traffic, while during the lockdown, PAHs emissions were primarily from the combustion of biomass and coal. Similarly, before the lockdown, the BC mass concentrations came from fossil-fuel and wood-burning, while during the lockdown period, most of the BC mass concentration came from wood-burning. Human health risk assessment demonstrated a significant reduction in risk due to inhalation of PAHs and BC-contaminated air.","output":"Emission reduction of black carbon and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Community structure analysis (Pollock, 2007, 2013a, 2015) compared city characteristics and newspaper coverage of federal/Trump administration coronavirus responses in 18 major US cities, sampling all 250+ word articles from 01/28/20 to 04/03/20 The resulting 123 articles were coded for \\"prominence\\" and \\"direction\\" (favorable/unfavorable/balanced-neutral coverage), then combined into each newspaper's composite \\"Media Vector\\" (range= 0 3850 to -0 6433, or 1 033) Fifteen of 18 newspapers (83%) displayed negative coverage of federal COVID-19 responses Pearson correlations and regression analysis confirmed a robust \\"violated buffer\\" pattern (higher proportions of economically/socially \\"buffered\\" privileged groups are associated with negative coverage of \\"biological threats or threats to a cherished way of life\\": Pollock, 2007: 101), manifest in polit-ical and religious polarization and links between health access or generational privilege and negative coverage of federal COVID-19 actions Higher proportions voting Democratic or Catholic membership in cities were associated strongly with negative coverage of federal efforts, while voting Republican and Evangelical membership accompanied positive federal coverage, evoking nationwide partisan \\"tribalism\\" Privileged healthcare access (physicians/100,000, municipal healthcare spending) and economically \\"privileged\\" age groups 45-64 and 65+ were all connected to negative coverage of federal COVID-19 responses, illuminating overall \\"violated\\" expectations that the national government is responsible for nationwide disaster protection","output":"US Nationwide Coronavirus Newspaper Coverage of Federal/National Government Responses: Community Structure Theory and a \\"Violated Buffer\\""},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is the first global scale crisis since the inception of Bitcoin.

DESIGN: A national sample survey of adults (N = 842) was conducted online between May 11 and May 19, 2020. Outcome variables were two dimensions of stigmatization, responsibility and persons as risk. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Racial prejudice, maladaptive coping, and biased media use each explained stigmatization. Racial prejudice, comprising stereotypical beliefs and emotion toward Asian Americans, was a stronger predictor of stigmatization than maladaptive coping or biased media use. Fear concerning the ongoing COVID-19 situation and the use of social media and partisan cable TV also predicted stigmatization. Low self-efficacy in dealing with COVID-19, when associated with high estimated harm of COVID-19, increased stigmatization. High perceived institutional efficacy in the handling of COVID-19 increased stigmatization when linked to high estimated harm of COVID-19. On the other hand, high perceived collective efficacy in coping with COVID-19 was associated with low stigmatization. More indirect contacts with Asians via the media predicted less stigmatization. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to reduce stigmatization should address racial stereotypes and emotions, maladaptive coping, and biased media use by providing education and resources to the public.

The whole process of vaccination was monitored by clinical pharmacists, and the occurrence, types, severity of adverse reactions were recorded in detail. Through the investigation and analysis on the safety of COVID-19 vaccination of the 2305 people, the important role and value of clinical pharmacists in the vaccination process was elaborated. Common adverse reactions included local pain, dizziness and fatigue, with the incidence rates of 2.09%, 0.67% and 0.49%, respectively. Others such as headache, nausea, skin itching, cough, palpitation, dry mouth, hand anesthesia, local induration, muscle soreness, local rash, and chill had incidence rates of less than 0.30%. Three cases of serious adverse events that occurred in this vaccination returned to normal after treatment, with no subsequent discomfort. Clinical pharmacists played an important role in the safety monitoring of COVID-19 vaccination. The safety of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine is good.

Web-based training has proven to be an effective way of transferring knowledge to healthcare professionals. OBJECTIVE: TF-CBT Web is a web-based training programme designed to foster the dissemination of Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (TF-CBT) for children and youth, and is run by the Medical University of South Carolina. This paper describes the characteristics of healthcare professionals who registered for the adapted German language version of TF-CBT Web. It evaluates the effectiveness and user friendliness of the programme. METHOD: : Similar to the TF-CBT treatment manual, the German language TF-CBT Web contains 12 modules. Between 2018 and 2020, 4,020 users registered for the programme. During the registration process users provided demographic information. The knowledge of users regarding the TF-CBT components was assessed via pre-tests and post-tests in each module. RESULTS: The programme was accessed by a sample of mostly German users with varying professional health care backgrounds and a wide-ranging spread of work experience. The results indicated a significant knowledge gain and high rates of user satisfaction with the programme. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the results of this study suggested that web-based training is an effective and well-accepted method for knowledge gain in trauma-focused interventions. Future research should evaluate the actual application of the taught methods in clinical practice. HIGHLIGHTS: Children and adolescents with PTSD require trauma-focused treatment. However, evidence-based interventions for this patient population are barely used. Therefore, it is necessary to expand professional training for the treatment of traumatised children and adolescents. Our evaluation showed the effectiveness and feasibility of a web-based training programme for mental health practitioners in an evidence-based treatment for children and youth with PTSD (TF-CBT). Results show a significant knowledge gain of users who participate in the web-based training programme. The user satisfaction survey also revealed that users found the modus and content of the web-based training applicable and relevant for their clinical practice.","output":"Online training for evidence-based child trauma treatment: evaluation of the German language TF-CBT-Web"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reviews energy management schemes for smart homes integrated with renewable energy resources in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The incorporation of distributed renewable energy system has initiated an acute transition from the traditional centralized energy management system to independent demand responsive energy systems. Renewable energy-based Smart Home Energy Management Systems (SHEMSs) play a vital role in the residential sector with the increased and dynamic electricity demand during the COVID-19 pandemic to enhance the efficacy, sustainability, economical benefits, and energy conservation for a distribution system. In this regard, the reviews of various energy management schemes for smart homes appliances and associated challenges has been presented. Different energy scheduling controller techniques have also been analyzed and compared in the COVID-19 framework by reviewing several cases from the literature. The utilization and benefits of renewable-based SHEMS have also been discussed. In addition, both micro and macro-level socio-economic implications of COVID-19 on SHEMSs are discussed. A conclusion has been drawn given the strengths and limitations of different energy scheduling controllers and optimization techniques in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is observed that renewable-energy-based SHEMS with improved multi-objective meta-heuristic optimization algorithms employing artificial intelligence are better suited to deal with the dynamic residential energy demand in the pandemic. It is hoped that this review, as a fundamental platform, will facilitate the researchers aiming to investigate the performance of energy management and demand response schemes for further improvement, especially during the pandemic.","output":"Analysis of energy management schemes for renewable-energy-based smart homes against the backdrop of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas.

Leveraging the COVID-19 pandemic, we obtain strong support for this hypothesis, finding that disgust sensitivity increased following the COVID-19 outbreak and that the degree of this increase was moderated by an individual's subjective concern about contracting the disease. This work fills a longstanding theoretical gap regarding the sources of variability in disgust sensitivity, while challenging the view that disgust sensitivity is an immutable individual difference.

We can confirm to have reasonably demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA by detecting highly specific RtDR gene on 8 filters in two parallel PCR analyses. This is the first preliminary evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be present on outdoor particulate matter, thus suggesting that, in conditions of atmospheric stability and high concentrations of PM, SARS-CoV-2 could create clusters with outdoor PM and, by reducing their diffusion coefficient, enhance the persistence of the virus in the atmosphere. Further confirmations of this preliminary evidence are ongoing, and should include real-time assessment about the vitality of the SARS-CoV-2 as well as its virulence when adsorbed on particulate matter. At the present, no assumptions can be made concerning the correlation between the presence of the virus on PM and COVID-19 outbreak progression. Other issues to be specifically addressed are the average concentrations of PM eventually required for a potential boost effect of the contagion (in case it is confirmed that PM might act as a carrier for the viral droplet nuclei), or even the theoretic possibility of immunization consequent to minimal dose exposures at lower thresholds of PM.","output":"SARS-Cov-2 RNA Found on Particulate Matter of Bergamo in Northern Italy: First Preliminary Evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Wuhan city, China, a pneumonia-like disease of unknown origin triggered a catastrophe.

The improvement in air quality and atmosphere due to the coronavirus pandemic in Pakistan was identified by both ground-based and satellite observations with a primary focus on the four provincial capitals and country capitals, namely, Peshawar, Karachi, Quetta, Lahore, and Islamabad, and statistically verified through paired Student's t test. Both datasets have shown a significant decrease in the levels of PM2.5 pollutions across Pakistan (ranging from 15 to 35% for satellite observations, while 27 to 61% for ground-based observations). The result shows that poor air quality is one of the key factors for a higher COVID-19 spread rate in major Pakistani cities. By extending the same investigation across the nation, there is a greater need to investigate the connections between COVID-19 spread and air pollution. However, both higher population density rates and frequent population exposure can be partially attributed to increased levels of PM2.5 concentrations before the pandemic of the coronavirus.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on environment: the case of the major cities in Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To investigate clinical and prognostic associations of red cell distribution width (RDW) in hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 3941 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary-level institution from March 2020 to March 2021 who had available RDW on admission. RESULTS: The median age was 74 years. The median Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was 4. The majority of patients (84.1%) on admission presented with severe or critical COVID-19. Patients with higher RDW were significantly more likely to be older and female, to present earlier during infection, and to have higher comorbidity burden, worse functional status, and critical presentation of COVID-19 on admission. RDW was not significantly associated with C-reactive protein, occurrence of pneumonia, or need for oxygen supplementation on admission. During hospital stay, patients with higher RDW were significantly more likely to require high-flow oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit, and to experience prolonged immobilization, venous thromboembolism, bleeding, and bacterial sepsis. Thirty-day and post-hospital discharge mortality gradually increased with each rising RDW percent-point. In a series of multivariate Cox-regression models, RDW demonstrated robust prognostic properties at >14% cut-off level. This cut-off was associated with inferior 30-day and post-discharge survival independently of COVID-19 severity, age, and CCI; and with 30-day survival independently of COVID severity and established prognostic scores (CURB-65, 4C-mortality, COVID-gram and VACO-index). CONCLUSION: RDW has a complex relationship with COVID-19-associated inflammatory state and is affected by prior comorbidities. RDW can improve the prognostication in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","output":"Red cell distribution width is a potent prognostic parameter for in-hospital and post-discharge mortality in hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients: a registry-based cohort study on 3941 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our aim was to correlate chest CT and pathologic findings of polyhexamethylene guanidine phosphate (PHMG)-induced lung injuries in a rat model, to determine whether PHMG exposure causes lung tumors, and to explore genetic alterations according to PHMG exposure under the guidance of CT. A PHMG solution was intratracheally administrated to 40 male rats. Chest CT was carried out in all rats and both lungs were collected for histopathologic evaluation. At 4- and 8-weeks post-instillation, one lobe of the right lung from 3 rats was subjected to RNA sequencing. At least one abnormal CT finding was found in all rats at all weeks. The major CT findings were inflammation, fibrosis, and tumors in the pathologic analysis, where significant changes were observed over time. The lung lesions remained persistent after 8 weeks of PHMG exposure. In the pathologic analysis, the extent/severity of inflammation did not show statistically significant changes over time, whereas the extent/severity of fibrosis increased continuously up to 6 weeks after PHMG exposure and then decreased significantly at 8 weeks. Bronchiolar-alveolar adenomas which have malignant potential were found in 50% of rats at 6 and 8 weeks after PHMG exposure. Also, several genes associated with lung cancer, acute lung injury, and pulmonary fibrosis were detected. Our study revealed that PHMG-induced lung injury and its changes according to the number of weeks after exposure were demonstrated using chest CT and pathologic evaluation. In addition, we showed that PHMG exposure caused lung tumors and genetic alterations according to PHMG exposure under the guidance of CT.","output":"Evaluation of polyhexamethylene guanidine-induced lung injuries by chest CT, pathologic examination, and RNA sequencing in a rat model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globalization may be viewed as the growing interdependence of countries worldwide through the increasing volume and variety of cross\\\\border transactions in goods and services, and also through the more rapid and widespread diffusion of technology. Globalization is not just an economic phenomenon, although it is frequently described as such, but includes commerce, disease and travel, and immigration, and as such it affects blood safety and supply in various ways. The relatively short travel times offered by modern aviation can result in the rapid spread of blood\\\\borne pathogens before measures to counteract transmission can be put in place; this would have happened with SARS if the basic life cycle of the SARS virus did not include an asymptomatic viraemia. This risk can be amplified by ecological factors which effect the spread of these pathogens once they are transferred to a na?ve ecosystem, as happened with West Nile virus (WNV) in North America. The rationalization and contraction of the plasma products industry may be viewed as one aspect of globalization imposed by the remorseless inevitability of the market; the effect of this development on the safety and supply of products has yet to be seen, but the oversight and assurance of a shrinking number of players will present particular challenges. Similarly, the monopolization of technology, through patent enforcement which puts access beyond the reach of developing countries, can have an effect on blood safety. The challenges presented to blood safety by globalization are heightening the tensions between the traditional focus on the product safety C zero\\\\risk paradigm and the need to view the delivery of safe blood as an integrated process. As an illustration of this tension, donor deferral measures imposed by globalization\\\\induced risks such as vCJD and WNV have resulted in the loss of the safest and most committed portion of the blood donor population in many Western countries, leading to an increased risk to safety and supply.

Because coronavirus potentially diversifies by mutation, broadly neutralizing Abs are especially sought. Here, we report a possibly novel approach to rapid generation of potent broadly neutralizing human anti-SARS-CoV-2 Abs. We isolated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific memory B cells by panning from the blood of convalescent subjects after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and sequenced and expressed Ig genes from individual B cells as human mAbs. All of 43 human mAbs generated in this way neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Eighteen of the forty-three human mAbs exhibited half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 6.7  10-12 M to 6.7  10-15 M for spike-pseudotyped virus. Seven of the human mAbs also neutralized (with IC50 < 6.7  10-12 M) viruses pseudotyped with mutant spike proteins (including receptor-binding domain mutants and the S1 C-terminal D614G mutant). Neutralization of the Wuhan Hu-1 founder strain and of some variants decreased when coding sequences were reverted to germline, suggesting that potency of neutralization was acquired by somatic hypermutation and selection of B cells. These results indicate that infection with SARS-CoV-2 evokes high-affinity B cell responses, some products of which are broadly neutralizing and others highly strain specific. We also identify variants that would potentially resist immunity evoked by infection with the Wuhan Hu-1 founder strain or by vaccines developed with products of that strain, suggesting evolutionary courses that SARS-CoV-2 could take.","output":"IgV somatic mutation of human anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies governs neutralization and breadth of reactivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several factors may account for the recent increased spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta sublineage AY.4.2 in the United Kingdom, Romania, Poland, and Denmark.

The contributions of this paper include a quantitative behavior model of fear of COVID-19, impact of government interventions on consumer behavior, and impact of consumer behavior on consumer choice and hence demand for goods. It brings together multiple models for disease progression, consumer behavior and demand estimation-thus bridging the gap between disease progression and consumer demand. We use panel regression to understand the drivers of demand during the pandemic and Bayesian inference to simplify the regulation landscape that can help build scenarios for resilient demand planning. We illustrate this resilient demand planning model using a specific example of gas retailing. We find that demand is sensitive to fear of COVID-19: as the number of COVID-19 cases increase over the previous week, the demand for gas decreases -- though this dissipates over time. Further, government regulations restrict access to different services, thereby reducing mobility, which in itself reduces demand.","output":"Consumer Demand Modeling During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality worldwide, with ~650,000 deaths recorded in < 5-year-olds in 2016. Cross-sectional studies on hospitalized LRTIs are available, but longitudinal studies on the total burden of viral LRTIs are scarce. This study (NCT01995175) prospectively collected incident RSV and other viral LRTIs in a multinational cohort. METHODS: From 2013 to 2017, infants in 8 countries were enrolled at birth and followed for LRTIs up to 2 years of age. Infants with suspected LRTIs were clinically examined and swabbed. Nasal swab samples were tested using quantitative real-time PCR for RSV and multiplex PCR panel for 16 other respiratory viruses/subtypes; bacterial culture was not performed. LRTI and severe LRTI episodes were defined per 2015 WHO LRTI case definitions. Viruses detected from nasal swabs collected from participants with WHO-defined LRTI and severe LRTI episodes are reported. RESULTS: The 2401 infants followed experienced 1012 LRTI episodes; 259 of these were severe LRTIs. At least 1 virus was detected from 909 (90%) and 235 (91%) LRTI and severe LRTI episodes, respectively. Enteroviruses/Rhinoviruses (EV/RV, 49%) were detected most frequently in samples collected from LRTI episodes, followed by RSV (22%), parainfluenza (PIV, 14%), human metapneumovirus (hMPV, 8%) and seasonal coronavirus (CoV, 6%). RSV was detected in 39% of samples from LRTI episodes in < 3-month-olds and in 18% of 1-year-olds (Table 1). In a similar trend, RSV was detected in 47% of samples from severe LRTI episodes in < 3-month-olds and in 21% of 1-year-olds (Table 2). Co-infection with another virus was common in CoV-positive samples (67%), while most samples positive for RSV (71%), hMPV (70%), EV/RV (67%) and PIV (58%) had no other virus detected. Table 1. Occurrence of laboratory confirmed respiratory viral infections by viral pathogens identified in nasal swab samples from WHO-defined LRTI episodes [Image: see text] Table 2. Occurrence of laboratory confirmed respiratory viral infections by viral pathogens identified in nasal swab samples from WHO-defined severe LRTI episodes [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses are detected in the majority of LRTIs during the first 2 years of life. RSV likely accounts for much of this overall LRTI burden. Our results suggest that RSV most strongly impacted the very young; it was the most commonly detected virus in severe LRTIs in infants aged < 3 months. RSV was also persistently detected at high levels in samples from LRTIs (22%) and severe LRTIs (28%) in children up to 2 years old.

METHOD: Participants included patient-family caregiver dyads who were enrolled in ongoing yoga trials and 2 certified yoga therapists who delivered the yoga sessions. We summarized their experiences using recordings of the yoga sessions and interventionists progress notes. RESULTS: Out of 7 dyads participating in the parent trial, 1 declined the videoconferenced sessions. Participants were between the ages of 55 and 76 and mostly non-Hispanic White (83%). Patients were mainly male (83%), all had stage III or IV cancer and were undergoing radiotherapy. Caregivers were all female. Despite challenges in the areas of technology, location, and setting, instruction and personal connection, the overall acceptability was high among patients, caregivers, and instructors. Through this transition process, solutions to these challenges were found, which are described here. CONCLUSION: Although in-person interventions are favored by both the study participants and the interventionists, videoconference sessions were deemed acceptable. All participants had the benefit of a previous in-person experience, which was helpful and perhaps necessary for older and advanced cancer patients requiring practice modifications.

These pathogens initially infect the upper respiratory tract and then reach the lower respiratory tract, leading to diseases. Vaccination is an affordable way to control the pathogenicity of viruses and constitutes the strategy of choice to fight against infections, including those leading to pulmonary diseases. Conventional vaccines based on live-attenuated pathogens present a risk of reversion to pathogenic virulence while inactivated pathogen vaccines often lead to a weak immune response. Subunit vaccines were developed to overcome these issues. However, these vaccines may suffer from a limited immunogenicity and, in most cases, the protection induced is only partial. A new generation of vaccines based on nanoparticles has shown great potential to address most of the limitations of conventional and subunit vaccines. This is due to recent advances in chemical and biological engineering, which allow the design of nanoparticles with a precise control over the size, shape, functionality and surface properties, leading to enhanced antigen presentation and strong immunogenicity. This short review provides an overview of the advantages associated with the use of nanoparticles as vaccine delivery platforms to immunize against respiratory viruses and highlights relevant examples demonstrating their potential as safe, effective and affordable vaccines.","output":"Nanoparticle-Based Vaccines Against Respiratory Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) is inflammation of the spinal cord that spans three or more spinal segments. LETM is a rare occurrence on its own and has seldom been reported with tuberculous meningitis (TBM), the rarest and deadliest of tuberculous manifestations.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old healthy male with no co-morbidities or history of tuberculosis presented with fever and headache for the past 3 months. The patients Kernigs and Brudzinskis signs were both negative, with bilateral abnormal plantar reflexes. The neurological level of injury was T8 and the patient was classified as AIS grade A. His CSF analysis showed a lymphocytic picture. However, both GeneXpert and ZiehlCNeelsen staining came back negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. MRI scans of the brain and thoracic spine revealed enhancing nodules and ring lesions in the brain and spinal cord, along with the rare complication of LETM, extending from T2 to T9. DISCUSSION: Although Mycobacterium tuberculosis was never isolated, the patient started recovering as soon as antituberculous therapy was initiated. Hence, more emphasis needs to be placed on radiological imaging in the management of rare medical emergencies like tuberculous meningitis, especially in areas where tuberculosis is rampant and endemic, rather than waiting for a positive culture.

Process analysis revealed that adhering to social isolation policies predicted lower levels of CA and that this effect was largely mediated by conservation of core beliefs (e.g., in predictability, control, and self-agency) and ability to make meaning of the pandemic. In contrast, exclusive reliance on nonsocial protections such as handwashing and mask wearing was associated with high levels of CA.

We aimed to compare clinical features of 165 Italian patients with laboratory confirmed or unconfirmed 2019-nCoV pneumonia. Methods: : On March 31 2020, hospitalized patients who presented with fever and/or respiratory symptoms, exposures, and presence of lung imaging features consistent with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, were included. Before admission to a hospital ward, patients underwent RT-PCR based SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in their nasopharyngeal swab samples. Results: : Of 165 patients studied, 119 had positive RT-PCR results and 46 were RT-PCR negative for two days or longer (i.e., when the last swab sample was obtained). The median age was 70 years (IQR, 58C78), and 123 (74.6%) of 165 patients had at least one comorbidity. The majority of patients (101/165, 61.2%) had a mild pneumonia, and the remaining patients (64/165, 38.8%) a severe/critical pneumonia. We did not find any substantial difference in symptoms, incubation periods, and radiographic/CT abnormalities as well as in many of the biological abnormalities recorded. However, at multivariable analysis, higher concentrations of hemoglobin (OR, 1.34;95% CI, 1.11?1.65;P = 0.003) and lower counts of leukocytes (OR, 0.81;95% CI, 0.72?0.90;P <0.001) were statistically associated with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.

The evolution in time of the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of COVID-19 in China very well approximates a distribution of the type of the error function, that is, the integral of a normal, Gaussian distribution. We have then used such a function to study the potential evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy by performing a number of fits of the official data so far available. We then found a statistical prediction for the day in which the peak of the number of daily positive cases in Italy occurs, corresponding to the flex of the fit, that is, to the change in sign of its second derivative (i.e., the change from acceleration to deceleration), as well as of the day in which a substantial attenuation of such number of daily cases is reached. We have also analyzed the predictions of the cumulative number of fatalities in both China and Italy, obtaining consistent results.

Although official data have been used, those predictions are obtained with a heuristic approach since they are based on a statistical approach and do not take into account either a number of relevant issues (such as number of daily nasopharyngeal swabs, medical, social distancing, virological and epidemiological) or models of contamination diffusion.","output":"Mathematical prediction of the time evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy by a Gauss error function and Monte Carlo simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The 2016 presidential election and the controversial policy agenda of its victor have raised concerns about how the election may have impacted mental health. OBJECTIVE: Assess how mental health changed from before to after the November 2016 election and how trends differed in states that voted for Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton. DESIGN: Pre- versus post-election study using monthly cross-sectional survey data. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 499,201 adults surveyed in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System from May 2016 to May 2017. EXPOSURE: Residence in a state that voted for Trump versus state that voted for Clinton and the candidates margin of victory in the state. MAIN MEASURES: Self-reported days of poor mental health in the last 30 days and depression rate. KEY RESULTS: Compared to October 2016, the mean days of poor mental health in the last 30 days per adult rose from 3.35 to 3.85 in December 2016 in Clinton states (0.50 days difference, p = 0.005) but remained statistically unchanged in Trump states, moving from 3.94 to 3.78 days (? 0.17 difference, p = 0.308). The rises in poor mental health days in Clinton states were driven by older adults, women, and white individuals. The depression rate in Clinton states began rising in January 2017. A 10Cpercentage point higher margin of victory for Clinton in a state predicted 0.41 more days of poor mental health per adult in December 2016 on average (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In states that voted for Clinton, there were 54.6 million more days of poor mental health among adults in December 2016, the month following the election, compared to October 2016. Clinicians should consider that elections could cause at least transitory increases in poor mental health and tailor patient care accordingly, especially with the 2020 election upon us.

We here aimed at investigating the possibility to target the HSV-1 G4s by a core extended naphtalene diimide (c-exNDI) G4 ligand. Biophysical and biomolecular analysis proved that c-exNDI stabilized the HSV-1 G4s in a concentration dependent manner. In MS competition assays, c-exNDI preferentially recognized HSV-1 G4s over cellular telomeric G4s, the most represented G4s within cells; other less abundant cellular G4s were also recognized. Treatment of HSV-1 infected cells with c-exNDI at low nanomolar concentrations induced significant virus inhibition with no cytotoxicity. The mechanism of action was ascribed to G4-mediated inhibition of viral DNA replication, with consequent impairment of viral genes transcription. Our data suggest that the observed potent antiviral activity and low cytotoxicity mainly depend on a combination of c-exNDI affinity for HSV-1 G4s and their massive presence during infection. HSV-1 G4s may thus represent new effective antiviral targets: the fact that no current antiherpetic drug exploits them and their presence at the viral genome, responsible for both active and latent HSV infections, makes them particularly attracting.","output":"A core extended naphtalene diimide G-quadruplex ligand potently inhibits herpes simplex virus 1 replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered treatment delivery for opioid treatment programs (OTPs) dispensing medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). We aimed to identify patterns of substance use among MOUD patients and examine whether COVID-19-related impacts on access to healthcare varied across subgroups. METHODS: This analysis was embedded within a type 3 hybrid trial that enrolled patients across eight OTPs at the start of the pandemic. Enrolled patients reported on past-30 day use of multiple substances during their baseline assessment. Participants re-contacted in MayCJuly 2020 completed a survey about COVID-19-related impacts on various life domains. Using latent class analysis we identified patient subgroups, and then examined group differences on a set of negative and positive COVID-19 impacts related to healthcare access. RESULTS: Of the 188 trial participants, 135 (72%) completed the survey. Latent class analysis identified three MOUD patient subgroups: minimal use (class probability: 0.25); opioid use (class probability: 0.34); and polysubstance use (class probability: 0.41). Compared to the minimal use group, the polysubstance use group reported increased substance use and difficulty accessing sterile needles, naloxone, and preferred substance. The opioid use group reported increased substance use and difficulty accessing their preferred substance. There were no significant group differences related to accessing routine or specialized healthcare or medication; or paying attention to their health.

In a 54-year-old COVID-19 patient with severe ARDS requiring extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO), sevoflurane on AnaConDa? device was administered for 8 days but was complicated by the development of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI).

However, not all scientific news article cites proper sources, such as original scientific papers. A portion of scientific news articles contain misinterpreted, exaggerated, or distorted information that deviates from facts asserted in the original papers. Manually identifying proper citations is laborious and costly. Therefore, it is necessary to automatically search for pertinent scientific papers that could be used as evidence for a given piece of scientific news. We propose a system called SciEv that searches for scientific evidence papers given a scientific news article. The system employs a 2-stage query paradigm with the first stage retrieving candidate papers and the second stage reranking them. The key feature of SciEv is it uses domain knowledge entities (DKEs) to find candidates in the first stage, which proved to be more effective than regular keyphrases. In the reranking stage, we explore different document representations for news articles and candidate papers. To evaluate our system, we compiled a pilot dataset consisting of 100 manually curated (news,paper) pairs from ScienceAlert and similar websites. To our best knowledge, this is the first dataset of this kind. Our experiments indicate that the transformer model performs the best for DKE extraction. The system achieves a P@1=50%, P@5=71%, and P@10=74% when it uses a TFIDF-based text representation. The transformer-based re-ranker achieves a comparable performance but costs twice as much time.

METHODS: Ochsner Health employees and patients who volunteered for Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test between March 1 and May 1, 2020 were included. We estimated IgG prevalence and used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for variables associated with IgG test status. RESULTS: Of the 13,343 participants with IgG test results, 78.6% were women, 70.6% were non-Hispanic White, 21.1% non-Hispanic Black, 2.9% Hispanic Americans and 5.4% belonged to other races. Overall, 7.99% (95% CI: 7.53-8.45%) of the participants tested IgG positive. In age-, sex- and body mass index (BMI)-adjusted analyses, non-Hispanic Blacks were 2.7-times more likely to test positive than non-Hispanic Whites (OR=2.72; 95% CI: 2.33-3.19). Corresponding ORs (95% CIs) were 1.29 (0.84-1.99) for Hispanic Americans and 1.22 (0.85-1.75) for Other race/ethnicities.

We describe the early genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from vaccinated healthcare professionals (HCP). Our post-vaccination COVID-19 symptoms-based surveillance program among HCPs in a 17-hospital network, identified all vaccinated HCP who tested positive for COVID-19 after routine screening or after self-reporting. From 01/01/2021 to 04/30/2021, 23,687 HCP received either mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. All available post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 samples and a random collection from non-vaccinated patients during the similar timeframe were subjected to VOC screening and whole genome sequencing (WGS). 62% (23,697/37,500) of HCPs received at least one vaccine dose, with 95% (22,458) fully vaccinated. We detected 138 (0.58%, 138/23,697) COVID-19 cases, 105 among partially vaccinated and 33 (0.15%, 33/22,458) among fully vaccinated. Five partially vaccinated required hospitalization, four with supplemental oxygen. VOC screening from 16 fully vaccinated HCPs identified 6 (38%) harboring N501Y and 1 (6%) with E484K polymorphisms; concurrent non-vaccinated samples was 37% (523/1404) and 20% (284/1394), respectively. There was an upward trend from January to April for E484K/Q (3% to 26%) and N501Y (1% to 49%). WGS analysis from vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals indicated highly congruent phylogenies. We did not detect an increased frequency of any RBD/NTD polymorphism between groups (P>0.05). Our results support robust protection by vaccination, particularly among recipients of both doses. Despite VOCs accounting for over 40% of SARS-CoV-2 from fully vaccinated individuals, the genomic diversity appears to proportionally represent those among non-vaccinated populations. IMPORTANCEA number of highly effective vaccines have been developed and deployed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergence and epidemiological dominance of SARS-CoV-2 mutants, with high transmission potential and immune evasion properties, the so-called Variants of Concern (VOC), continues to be a major concern. Whether these VOCs alter the efficacy of the administered vaccines is of great concern, and a critical question to study. We describe the initial genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from vaccinated healthcare professionals and probe specifically for VOC enrichment. Our findings support the high-level of protection provided by full vaccination despite a steep increase in the prevalence of polymorphisms associated with increased transmission potential (N501Y) and immune evasion (E484K) in the non-vaccinated population. Thus, we do not find evidence of VOC enrichment among vaccinated groups.

We herein describe the emergence and epidemiologic characteristics of pandemic influenza H1N1 in PICTs from 2009 to 2010. METHODS: The World Health Organization gathered reports of influenza-like-illness and laboratory-confirmed pandemic H1N1 cases from all 23 Pacific island countries and territories, from April 2009 through August 2010. Data were gathered through weekly email reports from Pacific island countries and territories and through email or telephone follow-up. RESULTS: Pacific island countries and territories started detecting pandemic H1N1 cases in June 2009, firstly in French Polynesia, with the last new detection occurring in August 2009 in Tuvalu. Nineteen Pacific island countries and territories reported 1,972 confirmed cases, peaking in August 2009. No confirmed pandemic H1N1 cases were identified in Niue, Pitcairn and Tokelau; the latter instituted strict maritime quarantine. Influenza-like-illness surveillance showed trends similar to surveillance of confirmed cases. Seven Pacific island countries and territories reported 21 deaths of confirmed pandemic H1N1. Case-patients died of acute respiratory distress syndrome or multi-organ failure, or both. The most reported pre-existing conditions were obesity, lung disease, heart disease, and pregnancy. Pacific island countries and territories instituted a variety of mitigation measures, including arrival health screening. Multiple partners facilitated influenza preparedness planning and outbreak response. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic influenza spread rapidly throughout the Pacific despite enormous distances and relative isolation. Tokelau and Pitcairn may be the only jurisdictions to have remained pandemic-free. Despite being well-prepared, Pacific island countries and territories experienced significant morbidity and mortality, consistent with other indigenous and low-resource settings. For the first time, regional influenza-like-illness surveillance was conducted in the Pacific, allowing health authorities to monitor the pandemics spread and severity in real-time. Future regional outbreak responses will likely benefit from the lessons learned during this outbreak.","output":"Influenza surveillance in the Pacific Island countries and territories during the 2009 pandemic: an observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the disease COVID-19 that has decimated the health and economy of our planet. The virus causes the disease not only in people but also in companion and wild animals. People with diabetes are at risk of the disease. As yet we do not know why the virus is highly successful in causing the pandemic within 3 months of its first report. The structural proteins of SARS include, membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N) and the spike protein (S). The structure and function of the most abundant structural protein of SARS-CoV-2, the membrane (M) glycoprotein is not fully understood. Using in silico analyses we determined the structure and potential function of the M protein. The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 98.6% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, maintains 98.2% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with M protein of SARS-CoV;whereas, the similarity was only 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV. In silico analyses showed that the M protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a triple helix bundle, form a single 3-transmembrane domain (TM), and are homologous to the prokaryotic sugar transport protein semiSWEET. SemiSWEETs are related to the PQ-loop family that function as cargo receptors in vesicle transport, mediates movement of basic amino acids across lysosomal membranes, and is also involved in phospholipase flippase function. The advantage and role of the M protein having a sugar transport-like structure is not clearly understood. The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with S, E and N protein. The S protein of the virus is glycosylated. It could be hypothesized that the sugar transporter-like structure of the M protein influences glycosylation of the S protein. Endocytosis is critical for the internalization and maturation of RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Sucrose is involved in endosome and lysosome maturation and may also induce autophagy, pathways that help in the entry of the virus. Overall, it could be hypothesized that the semiSWEET sugar transporter-like structure of the M protein may be involved in multiple functions that may aid in the rapid proliferation, replication and immune evasion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Biological experiments would validate the presence and function of the semiSWEET sugar transporter.","output":"The Structure of the Membrane Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Resembles the Sugar Transporter semiSWEET"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The group testing problem consists of determining a small set of defective items from a larger set of items based on a number of possibly-noisy tests, and has numerous practical applications.

METHODS: This was a retrospective study in ICUs of two French hospitals. Anti-Xa activities from consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection treated with enoxaparin for the prevention or the treatment of venous thrombosis were used to develop a population pharmacokinetic model using non-linear mixed effects techniques. Monte Carlo simulations were then performed to predict enoxaparin exposure at steady-state after three days of administration. RESULTS: A total of 391 anti-Xa samples were measured in 95 patients. A one-compartment model with first-order kinetics best fitted the data. The covariate analysis showed that enoxaparin clearance (typical value 1.1 L.h-1) was related to renal function estimated by the CKD-EPI formula and volume of distribution (typical value 17.9 L) to actual body weight. Simulation of anti-Xa activities with enoxaparin 40 mg qd indicated that 64% of the patients had peak levels within the range 0.2 to 0.5 IU.mL-1 and 75% had 12-hour levels above 0.1 IU.mL-1.

The diagnosis of HLH and its subtype Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) remains a challenge. Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is emerging as a potential biomarker for HLH/MAS but is currently not a part of diagnostic criteria. This systematic review aimed to assess the potential role of IL-18 in the diagnosis and monitoring of HLH and MAS. METHODS This review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed and Embase were searched on January 30th 2020. Studies included all subtypes of HLH and a range of underlying disorders in both children and adults. RESULTS A total of 14 studies were included. Generally, serum IL-18 was elevated in both primary and secondary HLH (>1,000 pg/ml) compared with other inflammatory conditions and with healthy individuals, thus serum IL-18 may be able to discriminate between HLH and other inflammatory conditions. Significantly increased IL-18 (>10,000 pg/ml) was also consistently described in MAS compared with other subtypes of HLH. The ability of IL-18 to distinguish MAS from systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is less unambiguous, as IL-18 levels >100,000 pg/ml was described in sJIA patients both with and without MAS. CONCLUSION IL-18 may help differentiate between HLH subtypes and other inflammatory conditions. Since HLH and MAS are rare disorders, only few and relatively small studies exist on the subject.

We investigated the motivations and perceptions of competencies developed as leadership and management skills in medical students who joined the COVID-19 Volunteering Program in a Brazilian medical school. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional, qualitative study involving medical students from the University of S?o Paulo, Brazil. They were invited to participate in an institutional Volunteering Program during the pandemic and filled out online application forms, including sociodemographic fields and two open-ended questions about their motivation to volunteer and perceptions of their own competencies. At the end of the program, students who were involved in management-related activities were also invited to participate in focus group interviews to track their perceptions about volunteering in this area. Data were submitted to descriptive and content analysis methods. All participants provided informed consent with electronic signatures. RESULTS: A total of 286 medical students subscribed to the Volunteering Program: 171 (60%) were men, 152 (53%) were enrolled in their 5th year of medical school, and 158 (55%) were 23-25 years old. One hundred and twelve (44%) students reported that they were motivated by altruistic reasons, 95 (37%) reported duty and 47 (19%) prioritized academic interests. Concerning CanMEDS competencies, 91 (36%) students responses matched the Scholar component, followed by 51 (20%) with Collaborator, 49 (20%) with Professional, 32 (13%) with Communicator, 17 (7%) with Leader and 11 (4%) with Health Advocate. In focus groups, students reported the importance of management and leadership skills as a curricular component, motivations to volunteer, and acquired skills from volunteering in management and leadership-related activities, thereby indicating the development of resilient attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: Students who participated in the School of Medicine of University of Sao Paulo (FMUSP) Volunteering Program reported being motivated to help others (altruistic reasons) and to serve society as future health professionals (duty).

As both a mediator and a target of IFN signals, STAT1 expression reports on, and determines IFN activity. Gene expression analyses of melanoma patient samples revealed varied levels of STAT1 expression, which highly correlated with expression of >700 genes. The ability of oncolytic viruses to exploit tumor-induced defects to antiviral responses suggests that oncolytic viruses may efficiently target a subset of melanomas, yet these should be defined. We modeled this scenario with murine B16F10 melanomas, immortalized skin fibroblasts as controls and a novel oncolytic virus, EHDV-TAU. In B16F10 cells, constitutive low expression of STAT1 and its target genes, which included intracellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), correlated with their inability to mount IFN-based antiviral responses upon EHDV-TAU challenge, and with potency of EHDV-TAU-induced oncolysis. This under-expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) and PRRs, and the inability of EHDV-TAU to induce their expression, were reversed by epigenetic modifiers, suggesting epigenetic silencing as a basis for their under-expression. Despite their inability to mount IFN/STAT-based responses upon viral infection, EHDV-TAU infected B16F10 cells secreted immune-stimulatory chemokines. Accordingly, in vivo, EHDV-TAU enhanced intra-tumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T-cells and reduced growth of local and distant tumors. We propose that 'STAT1 signatures' should guide melanoma virotherapy treatments, and that oncolytic viruses such as EHDV-TAU have the potential to exploit the cellular context of low-STAT1 tumors.","output":"Constitutive low expression of antiviral effectors sensitizes melanoma cells to a novel oncolytic virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Solid-state nanopores have been developed as a prominent tool for single molecule analysis in versatile applications.

However, on the whole these behavioral interventions have been somewhat underwhelming, exposing an inherent brittleness that comes from three common \\"errors of projection\\" in current behavioral design methodology: Projected stability, which fails to recognize that interventions often function within inherently unstable systems;projected persistence, which neglects to account for changes in those system conditions over time;and projected value, which assumes that definitions of success are universally shared across contexts. Borrowing from strategic design and futures thinking, a new proposed strategic foresight model-behavioral planning-allows practitioners to better address these system-level, anticipatory, and contextual weaknesses by more systematically identifying potential forces that may impact behavioral interventions before they have been implemented. Behavioral planning will help designers more effectively elicit signals indicating the emergence of forces that may deform behavioral interventions in emergent COVID-19 contexts, and promote \\"roughly right\\" directional solutions at earlier stages in solution development to better address system shifts. ? 2021 Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

METHODS We analyzed medical records of all patients aged of 75 and older with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 hospitalized in our Hospital between March 3, 2020 and April 25, 2020. Standardized variables were prospectively collected, and standardized care were provided to all patients. RESULTS 186 patients were included (mean 85.35.78 y). The all cause 30-day mortality was 30% (56/186). At admission, dead patients were more dyspneic (57% vs 38%, p=0.014), had more often an oxygen saturation <94% (70% vs 47%, p<0.01) and had more often a heart rate faster than 90/min (70% vs 42%, p<0.001). Mortality increased in parallel with CFS score (p=0.051) (20 deaths (36%) in 7-9 category). In multivariate analysis, CFS score (OR= 1.49 CI (95%), 1.01-2.19, p=0.046), age (OR=1.15 CI 95% 1.01-1.31 p=0.034), and dyspnea (OR=5.37 CI 95% 1.33-21.68, p=0.018) were associated with all-cause 30-day mortality.

Participants were recruited through social media advertisements, health charities and patient organisations. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The awareness, attitudes and actions survey which explores the impact of COVID-19, on including access to healthcare, use of technology for health condition management, mental health, depression, well-being and lifestyle behaviours. RESULTS: Nearly half of the sample (44.5%) reported that their mental health had worsened during the COVID-19 lockdown. Management of health conditions changed including access to medications (28.5%) and delayed surgery (11.9%), with nearly half of the sample using telephone care (45.5%). Artificial Intelligence identified that participants in the negative cluster had higher neuroticism, insecurity and negative sentiment. Participants in this cluster reported more negative impacts on lifestyle behaviours, higher depression and lower well-being, alongside lower satisfaction with platforms to deliver healthcare.

Lysosomotropic bases did not significantly reduce virus yield, suggesting that productive BCV infection was not mediated by endocytosis but rather by direct fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane. Trypsin cleavage of the 185 kDa S glycoprotein into 100 and 110 kDa subunits was required for cell fusion and productive infection of cultured BFS cells with the cell-adapted, avirulent strain BCV-L9. This strain has a wide host cell range in vitro while several wild-type, virulent strains were restricted to HRT-18 cells. Antigenic and genomic comparisons of the avirulent and virulent strains revealed corresponding differences. Some monoclonal antibodies against S reacted with both virulent and avirulent strains, while others reacted only with the avirulent strain BCV-L9.

Thymalin is effective in therapy of acute respiratory syndrome, chronic obstructive bronchitis, and other immunopathology. Thymalin increases functional activity of T lymphocytes, but the targeted molecular mechanism of its biological activity requires further study. We studied the influence of thymalin on differentiation of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and expression of CD28 molecule involved in the implementation of antiviral immunity in COVID-19 infection. It was found that thymalin reduced the expression of CD44 (stem cell marker) and CD117 (molecule of the intermediate stage of HSC differentiation) by 2-3 times and increased the expression of CD28 (marker of mature T lymphocytes) by 6.8 times. This indirectly indicates that thymalin stimulated differentiation of CD117(+) cells into mature CD28(+)T lymphocytes. It is known that in patients with severe COVID-19, the number of CD28(+), CD4(+), CD8(+)T lymphocytes in the blood decreased, which attested to a pronounced suppression of immunity. It is possible that the antiviral effect of thymalin consists in compensatory stimulation of HSC differentiation into CD28(+)T lymphocytes at the stage of immunity suppression in unfavorable course of viral infection.

DESIGN A retrospective observational before-and-after study of 40 patients undergoing percutaneous cannulation for venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in an established cannulation program by cardiothoracic surgeons versus a rapidly deployed medical intensivist cannulation program. SETTING An adult ICU in a tertiary academic medical center in Camden, NJ. PATIENTS Critically ill adult subjects with severe respiratory failure undergoing percutaneous cannulation for venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. INTERVENTIONS Percutaneous cannulation for venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation performed by cardiothoracic surgeons compared with cannulations performed by medical intensivists. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cannulation site attempts were retrospectively reviewed. Subject demographics, specialty of physician performing cannulation, type of support, cannulation configuration, cannula size, imaging guidance, success rate, and complications were recorded and summarized. Twenty-two cannulations were performed by three cardiothoracic surgeons in 11 subjects between September 2019 and February 2020. The cannulation program rapidly transitioned to an intensivist-led and performed program in March 2020. Fifty-seven cannulations were performed by eight intensivists in 29 subjects between March 2020 and December 2020. Mean body mass index for subjects did not differ between groups (33.86 vs 35.89; p = 0.775). There was no difference in days on mechanical ventilation prior to cannulation, configuration, cannula size, or discharge condition. There was no difference in success rate of cannulation on first attempt per cannulation site (95.5 vs 96.7; p = 0.483) or major complication rate per cannulation site (4.5 vs 3.5; p = 1).

An online and offline anonymous survey with a preformed questionnaire was conducted among the HCPs involved in the care of COVID-19 patients. HCPs who developed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-positive confirmed COVID-19 and/or symptomatic influenza-like illness (ILI) within 14 days of their involvement in CPR of a confirmed COVID-19 patient were identified. Activities performed during CPR, the cumulative number of CPR performed, any breach in personal protective equipment (PPE), type of the mask used, use of any pharmacological prophylaxis, and any psychological impact among HCPs were also identified. A total of 393 HCPs participated in the survey; out of them, 197 HCPs participated in CPR at least once (CPR group) and the rest 196 did not (control group). Ten in the control group and five in the CPR group developed confirmed COVID-19 within the next 2 weeks; however, only one of these five had a breach in PPE during CPR.

Global epidemiological results show that elderly men are susceptible to infection of COVID-19. The difference in the number of cases reported by gender increases progressively in favor of male subjects up to the age group 60C69 (66.6%) and 70C79 (66.1%). Through literature search and analysis, we also found that men are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than women. In addition, men with COVID-19 have a higher mortality rate than women. Male represents 73% of deaths in China, 59% in South Korea, and 61.8% in the United States. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen of COVID-19, which is transmitted through respiratory droplets, direct and indirect contact. Genomic analysis has shown that SARS-CoV-2 is 79% identical to SARS-CoV, and both use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for invading cells. In addition, Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) can enhance ACE2-mediated virus entry. However, SARS-CoV-2 has a high affinity with human ACE2, and its consequences are more serious than other coronaviruses. ACE2 acts as a gate for viruses to invade cells and is closely related to the clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Studies have found that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the testis and male reproductive tract and are regulated by testosterone. Mature spermatozoon even has all the machinery required to bind SARS-CoV-2, and these considerations raise the possibility that spermatozoa could act as potential vectors of this highly infectious disease. This review summarizes the gender differences in the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and proposes the possible mechanism of orchitis caused by SARS-CoV-2 and the potential transmission route of the virus.

Aside from current use of DNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas9, the more recently discovered CRISPR-Cas13 has been explored as a means of editing due to its RNA-targeting capabilities. Specifically, there has been a recent interest in identifying and functionally characterizing biochemical RNA modifications, which has spurred a new field of research known as epitranscriptomics. As one of the most frequently occurring transcriptome modifications, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has generated much interest. The presence of m6A modifications is under the tight control of a series of regulators, and the ability of fusing these proteins or demethylases to catalytically inactive CRISPR proteins have resulted in a new wave of programmable RNA methylation tools. In addition, studies have been conducted to develop different CRISPR/Cas and base editor systems capable of more efficient editing, and some have explored the effects of in vivo editing for certain diseases. As well, the application of CRISPR and base editors for screening shows promise in revealing the phenotypic outcomes from m6A modification, many of which are linked to physiological, and pathological effects. Thus, the therapeutic potential of CRISPR/Cas and base editors for not only m6A related, but other RNA and DNA related disease has also garnered insight.

to COVID-19 to create an evaluation framework Design/methodology/approach A PRISMA scoping review systematically maps the information published and establishes the potential challenges, as a precursor to a literature review that synthesises the data available to establish an initial COVID-19 evaluation framework to build a rationale for a future series of studies Findings The research identified these seven challenges: health and safety on-site, economic cost, possible legal exposures, manpower availability, instability of the supply chain and subcontractors, and the uncertainty related to the constant and unpredictable evolution of the pandemic The magnitude of each challenge was also found to differ depending on the size of the contractor, the rigor of local regulations and the sector where the contractor works Research limitations/implications This research contributes to increasing understanding on the subject and provides an initial assessment framework, based on these seven parameters, so that contractors can analyse their weaknesses and plan specific priorities so that their companies can remain competitive, minimising the impact of COVID-19 and possible future waves

developed different severity levels of COVID-19 We performed 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing from nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from SARS-CoV-2 positive (56) and negative (18) patients in the province of Alicante (Spain) in their first visit to the hospital Positive SARS-CoV-2 patients were observed and later categorized in mild (symptomatic without hospitalization), moderate (hospitalization), and severe (admission to ICU) We compared the microbiota diversity and OTU composition among severity groups and built bacterial co-abundance networks for each group Results: Statistical analysis indicated differences in the nasopharyngeal microbiome of COVID19 patients 62 OTUs were found exclusively in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, mostly classified as members of the

The classification challenge is raised when the X-ray images of COVID-19 and pneumonia are subtle. The CXR images of the chest are first proceeded to be standardized and to improve the visual contrast of the images. Then, the classification is performed by applying a deep learning-based technique that binds two deep learning network architectures, i.e., convolution neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), to generate a hybrid model for the classification problem. The deep features of the images are extracted by CNN before the final classification is performed using LSTM. In addition to the hybrid models, this work explores the validity of image pre-processing methods that improve the quality of the images before the classification is performed. The experiments were conducted on a public image dataset.

Although a 5-fold fractional-dose vaccine is similar to standard-dose vaccine in safety and immunogenicity, efficacy is untested. There is an urgent need to ensure the robustness of fractional-dose vaccination by elucidating the conditions under which dose fractionation would reduce transmission. METHODS: We estimate the effective reproductive number for YF in Angola using disease natural history and case report data. With simple mathematical models of YF transmission, we calculate the infection attack rate (IAR, the proportion of population infected over the course of an epidemic) under varying levels of transmissibility and five-fold fractional-dose vaccine efficacy for two vaccination scenarios: (i) random vaccination in a hypothetical population that is completely susceptible; (ii) the Kinshasa vaccination campaign in JulyCAugust 2016 with different age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines. FINDINGS: We estimate the effective reproductive number early in the Angola outbreak was between 52 and 71. If vaccine action is all-or-nothing (i.e. a proportion VE of vaccinees receives complete and the remainder receive no protection), n-fold fractionation can dramatically reduce IAR as long as efficacy VE exceeds 1/n. This benefit threshold becomes more stringent if vaccine action is leaky (i.e. the susceptibility of each vaccinee is reduced by a factor that is equal to the vaccine efficacy VE). The age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines chosen by the WHO for the Kinshasa vaccination campaign (namely, 2 years) provides the largest reduction in IAR if the efficacy of five-fold fractional-dose vaccines exceeds 20%. INTERPRETATION: Dose fractionation is a very effective strategy for reducing infection attack rate that would be robust with a large margin for error in case fractional-dose VE is lower than expected.","output":"Fractional Dosing of Yellow Fever Vaccine to Extend Supply: A Modeling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in catastrophic consequences in many aspects of life;including negative psychological effects We aimed to assess the mental health status of a group of Saudi population during this pandemic Also, we aimed to assess the effect of the intensive media coverage of the pandemic news on mental health status A questionnaire was distributed online to test depression, anxiety, and stress (using the DASS-21 scale) and their relationship to certain variables A total of 215 respondents were included Higher mental health prevalence rates were reported in non-Saudi participants compared to Saudi ones (i e , 50 74% vs 30 40%;34 23% vs 13 51% and 59 70% vs 27 70%;for depression, anxiety and stress, respectively) About 55 8% of the participants felt the extensive coverage in the media of COVID-19 news, which caused higher mental sufferings Higher mental health prevalence rates were reported in females compared to males participants (i e , 56 97% vs 23 25%;30 23% vs 13 17% and 54 65% vs 26 35%;for depression, anxiety and stress, respectively) Reasonable following of the COVID-19 news;and less exposure to the pandemic information could help in reducing the mental health issues related to the ongoing pandemic Special care and attention should be paid to females and younger people who seem to be particularly affected during the era of COVID-19","output":"The magnitude of COVID-19 related stress, anxiety and depression associated with intense mass media coverage in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Tremendous physical and psychological pressure has been placed on health care workers because of the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019.

We studied the association between the extent of organ failure and the transcriptomic response of septic patients. METHODS Gene expression profiles in the blood of 74 surgical patients with sepsis were compared with those of 30 surgical patients with no sepsis. Differentially expressed genes were assessed for their correlation with the sequential organ failure (SOFA) score. RESULTS The expression levels of a group of genes participating in the cell cycle (HIST1H1C, CKS2, CCNA2, CDK1, CCNB2, CIT, CCNB1, AURKA, RAD51), neutrophil protease activity (ELANE, ADORA3, MPO, MMP8, CTSG), IL-1R and IL-18R response correlated directly with SOFA and mortality.

While highly effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are being applied on a large-scale, whether and to what extent the strength of the vaccine-induced immune response could be further potentiated is still an object of debate. Several reports studied the effect of different vaccines on the susceptibility and mortality of COVID-19, with conflicting results. We aimed to evaluate whether previous influenza and/or pneumococcal vaccination had an impact on the specific immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. The study population consists of 710 workers from our Institute who completed the BNT162b2 schedule and have been tested at least once after the second dose, from 27 December 2020 up to 15 April 2021. Of these, 152 (21.4%) had received an influenza and 215 (30.3%) a concomitant influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, a median of 102 days before the second dose of BNT162b2. Overall, 100% of workers were tested for anti-Spike receptor-binding domain (anti-S/RBD) antibodies, 224 workers for neutralization titer (Micro-neutralization assay, MNA), and 155 workers for a spike-specific T cell interferon- response (IFN-). The levels of anti-S/RBD, MNA and IFN- were evaluated and compared according to sex, age, involvement in direct care of COVID-19 patients, and previous influenza/pneumococcal vaccination. At the univariate analysis, no statistically significant association was observed with regard to a previous influenza and pneumococcal vaccination. A significant lower anti-S/RBD response was observed according to an older age and male sex, while MNA titers were significantly associated to sex but not to age. At the multivariable analysis, workers receiving a concomitant influenza and pneumococcal vaccination or only influenza showed a 58% (p 0.01) and 42% (p 0.07) increase in MNA titers, respectively, compared to those who did not receive an influenza/pneumococcal vaccination. Female workers showed an 81% MNA and a 44% anti-S/RBD increase compared to male workers (p &lt;0.001). Compared to workers aged 21 to 49 years, those aged 50 or older were associated with a reduction in the anti-S/RBD (16%;p 0.005), MNA (31%;p 0.019), and IFN.g (32%) immune response.

Methods: The data of 22,882 cases of children who had been hospitalized for RTIs were collected. M. pneumoniae immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody was detected using the indirect immunofluorescence method and passive agglutination method. The demographic features of patients, clinical diagnoses and laboratory data were also analyzed. Results: A total of 4,213 children tested positive for M. pneumoniae. The total positive rate was 18.41% (18.30% for males and 22.72% for females). Female children had statistically significant higher positive rates than male children (chi2=198.078, P&lt;0.01). The positive rates of M. pneumoniae differed significantly among children of different ages (F=162.7532, P&lt;0.01).

In this paper, we study public responses to this information by using daily mobility and credit card transaction data in Seoul, South Korea. We first find that the disclosure of COVID-19 cases led to localized demand shock as both non-resident inflow and retail spending decreased significantly in neighborhoods with more cases. However, public responses to the disclosed information of cases do not appear to be homogenous across neighborhoods. Neighborhoods with higher employment density and land use diversity experienced a higher demand shock while mobility and retail performances of those with higher population density were less affected by COVID-19 incidences. Also, those with higher retail agglomeration were less resilient to the localized shock of COVID-19 case information potentially due to public concerns on the virus spread. Finally, we find a significant spatial spillover effect of disclosed COVID-19 information instead of spatial substitution. An increase in COVID-19 risks in both geographically and functionally adjacent areas reduced non-resident inflow and retail spending in the subject neighborhood.

Guidelines for tracheotomy in this cohort of patients are therefore required with assessed outcomes of tracheotomies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheotomy. Inclusion criteria were the performance of a tracheotomy in COVID-19 positive patients between March 11 and December 31, 2020. Exclusion criteria were lack of consent, extubation prior to the performance of a tracheotomy, death prior to the performance of the tracheotomy, and COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheotomy who tested negative twice after medical treatment. The primary predictor variable was the performance of a tracheotomy in COVID-19 positive patients and the primary outcome variable was the time to cessation of mechanical ventilation with the institution of supplemental oxygen via trach mask. RESULTS: Seventeen tracheotomies were performed between 4-25 days following intubation (meana?=a?17 days). Seven patients died between 4 and 16 days (meana?=a?8.7 days) following tracheotomy and 10 living patients realized cessation of mechanical ventilation from 4 hours to 61 days following tracheotomy (meana?=a?19.3 days). These patients underwent tracheotomy between 4 and 22 days following intubation (meana?=a?14 days). The 7 patients who died following tracheotomy underwent the procedure between 7 and 25 days following intubation (meana?=a?18.2 days). Seven patients underwent tracheotomy on or after 20 days of intubation and 3 survived (43%). Ten patients underwent tracheotomy before 20 days of intubation and 7 patients survived (70%).

The impact of the epidemic on people's attitudes toward tourism, particularly their tourist choices, appears to be a major challenge for post-COVID-19 international tourism development. Very little is known about tourists' accommodation preferences during the period emerging after the COVID-19 crisis. With a long and challenging experience of lockdowns, stress, and fear of disease, the current study attempts to examine peoples' preferences for hotel attributes during the post-COVID-19 era. It examines factors contributing to peoples' preferences for hotels with biophilic attributes. A total of 507 Iranian undergraduate and graduate students participated in the study. They answered questions on their perceived stress, level of depression, the specific burden of COVID-19, the perceived benefits of nature, and their preferences for biophilic design attributes in their accommodation. The online survey was conducted from August to October 2021. We found that the burden of COVID-19 increased the stress level of the respondents, which consequently increased the chance of depression. We further found that perceived stress and the benefits of nature significantly affect tourists' preferences for exposure to nature and hotels with biophilic attributes. Based on the data, we suggest that the demand for biophilic buildings will be strongly increased during the post-COVID-19 era.","output":"Preferences for Hotels with Biophilic Design Attributes in the Post-COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Activation of microglia in the spinal cord following peripheral nerve injury is critical for the development of long-lasting pain hypersensitivity.

We also show time- and sex-specific transcriptional changes in different microglial subpopulations following injury. Apolipoprotein E (Apoe) is the top upregulated gene in microglia at chronic time points after nerve injury in mice and polymorphisms in the APOE gene in humans are associated with chronic pain. Single-cell analysis of human spinal cord microglia reveals a subpopulation with a disease-related transcriptional signature.

However, unforeseen complications to childhood health have emerged secondary to the pandemic. Few studies to date have examined unintended complications of the pandemic in newborns and infants. In this Commentary, we discuss the impact that COVID-19 may have on inheritance of the newborn microbiome and its assembly throughout the first years of life. In the early stages of the pandemic when vertical transmission of COVID-19 was poorly understood, several studies reported increased rates of C-sections in COVID-19 positive women. Initial recommendations discouraged COVID-19 positive mothers from breastfeeding and participating in skin-to-skin care, advising them to isolate during their window of infectivity. These shifts in perinatal care can adversely impact microbial colonization during the first 1000 days of life. While obstetrical and neonatal management have evolved to reflect our current knowledge of perinatal transmission, we are observing other changes in early life exposures of infants, including increased attention to hygiene, fewer social interactions, and decreased global travel, all of which are major drivers of early-life gut colonization. Composition of the gut microbiota in adults directly impacts severity of infection, suggesting a role of microbial communities in modulating immune responses to COVID-19. Conversely, the role of the intestinal microbiome in susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 in newborns and children remains unknown. The onset of adulthood diseases is related to the establishment of a healthy gut microbiome during childhood. As we continue to define COVID-19 biology, further research is necessary to understand how acquisition of the neonatal microbiome is affected by the pandemic. Furthermore, infection control measures must be balanced with strategies that promote microbial diversity to impart optimal health outcomes and potentially modulate susceptibility of children to COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 and the neonatal microbiome: will the pandemic cost infants their microbes?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Covid19 has necessitated new methods of conducting outpatient consultations. At our institute, patient-facing paediatric ENT appointments were replaced with telemedical consultations. METHOD: We performed a prospective analysis of the outcomes following telephone consultations with parents and describe our experience of remote consulting during a pandemic, and the possibilities for future applications of telemedicine in paediatric ENT. RESULTS: 215 patients were appropriately referred to the paediatric ENT clinic, 65% of these patients were deemed suitable for remote telephone consultation. Following a telephone call, 50% did not need further ENT clinic management, most commonly due to being listed for surgery (20%) or discharged (18%). The treating consultant assessed 81% of phone consultations as being effective. When given the choice, patients reported that 29% would choose a telephone consultation whilst 43% preferred a face to face consultation. CONCLUSION: Our experience has shown that there are areas of paediatric ENT that can be streamlined effectively by substituting face to face consultations with telephone consultations. However, prospective evaluation of these remote contacts suggest that telephone consultations are not a panacea and cannot be indiscriminately applied to all. Instead, the strategies to take forwards into a post Covid19 practice are vetting of referrals, individualised treatment plans, and giving patients a choice.","output":"Telemedicine in paediatric otorhinolaryngology: Lessons learnt from remote encounters during the Covid19 pandemic and implications for future practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The COVID\\\\19 epidemic is affecting the entire world and hence provides an opportunity examine how people from different countries engage in hopeful thinking. The aim of this study was to examine the potentially facilitating role of perceived social support vis\\\\\\\\vis hope as well as the mediating role of loneliness between perceived social support and hope. This mediating model was tested concurrently in the UK, the USA, and Israel. METHODS: In April 2020, as the first wave of the virus struck the three aforementioned countries, we assessed perceived social support, loneliness, and hope in 400 adults per country (N = 1,200). Assessments in the UK/USA were conducted via the Prolific platform, whereas in Israel they were conducted via Facebook/WhatsApp. RESULTS: In all three countries, perceived social support predicted elevated hope, although the effect was smallest in the UK. Loneliness mediated this effect in all three countries, although full mediation was attained only in the UK. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived social support may facilitate hope in dire times, possibly through the reduction of loneliness. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Findings are consistent with respect to the potentially protective role of perceived social support vis\\\\\\\\vis hope. Perceived social support may increase hope through decreasing loneliness. In the UK, the above\\\\noted mediating effect of loneliness appears to be stronger than in Israel and the USA.

Treatment options have gradually streamlined to steroids and very few FDA approved antiviral as well as plasma therapy and supportive treatment. Monoclonal antibodies are used to tide over any impending cytokine storm but are not equally effective in all patients. Ventilation support is invariably required for moderate to severe disease varying from a simple High Flow non-rebreathing mask to BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) and HFNO (High-Flow Nasal Oxygen) extending to full-fledge ventilation via a Mechanical Ventilator. Because of the non-availability of satisfactory treatment so far, many researchers from different biomedical fields are looking for alternative therapeutic strategies to manage the pandemic. One such therapeutic approach showing a ray of hope to combat COVID-19 infection is Mesenchymal stem cell therapy. Mesenchymal cells have immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory as well as regenerative properties and various preliminary studies have shown that MSCs can reverse the lung damage and overcome the cytokine storm incited by COVID-19 infection.

We have previously developed a particle-based method for in vitro expansion of highly cytotoxic human NK cells (PM21-NK cells). Here, we have tested the hypothesis that oncolytic parainfluenza virus 5 (P/V virus) can combine with PM21-NK cells for targeted killing of lung cancer cells. METHODS: PM21-NK cells were assayed for killing of P/V virus-infected A549, H1299 and Calu-1 lung cancer cells in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) cultures using flow cytometry, luminescence and kinetic imaging-based methods. Blocking antibodies were used to evaluate NK cell activating receptors involved in PM21-NK cell killing of infected target cells. Media transfer experiments tested soluble factors that increase PM21-NK cell killing of both P/V virus-infected and uninfected tumor cells. RESULTS: In 2D cultures, PM21-NK cells efficiently killed P/V virus-infected cancer cells compared with non-infected cells, through involvement of the viral glycoprotein and NK cell receptors NKp30, NKp46 and NKG2D. In 3D spheroid cultures, P/V virus infection was restricted to the outer layer of the spheroid. However, PM21-NK cells were able to more efficiently kill both the outer layer of infected cells in the spheroid and progressing further to kill the uninfected interior cells. Media transfer experiments demonstrated that P/V virus infection produced both type I and type III interferons, which decreased cell growth, which contributed to a reduction in the overall number of uninfected tumor cells in conjunction with PM21-NK cells. Across five cancer cell lines, the contribution of P/V virus infection on PM21-NK cell killing of target cells correlated with interferon induction. CONCLUSION: Our data support the potential of combining oncolytic parainfluenza virus with PM21-NK cell adoptive therapy against lung cancer.","output":"Oncolytic parainfluenza virus combines with NK cells to mediate killing of infected and non-infected lung cancer cells within 3D spheroids: role of type I and type III interferon signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objectives Studies reported associations of inflammatory markers with the severity of COVID-19, but conclusions were inconsistent.

These issues affect not only their quality of life, but also their academic and professional development. Coping strategy and resilience are two factors that may influence students mental health outcomes. Data of medical student mental health in Indonesia is scarce, hampering efforts to systematically address the problem. Hence, this study aims to estimate the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in Indonesian medical students, and their association with coping strategy and resilience. METHODS: Undergraduate medical students from each year of study (Preclinical Year 1 to 4, Clinical Year 1 and 2) in the Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia were randomly selected to participate in this cross-sectional study. The study questionnaire included sociodemographic characteristics, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) to measure symptoms of depression and anxiety, Brief COPE to measure coping strategy, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) to measure resilience. Scores of depression and anxiety symptoms were analyzed by comparing them between different sociodemographic groups and by measuring their correlation with coping strategies and resilience. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of depression and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Among 532 respondents, 22.2% reported symptoms of depression and 48,1% reported anxiety, including 3.0% and 8.1% with extremely severe depression and anxiety, respectively. Students not living with immediate family had higher depression score; female students and those in Preclinical Year 1 and Clinical Year 1 showed higher anxiety scores. Dysfunctional coping strategies and lower resilience are predictors of higher depression and anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Students show different levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms, signifying different levels of mental health support needs from universal mental health promotion to psychiatric treatment. Prevention programs can be targeted towards students with risk factors, such as not living with immediate family, undergoing first year of preclinical studies or clinical rotations, coping with dysfunctional strategies, and having low resilience.

This study aims to explore whether digitally enabled, remotely supported rehabilitation for people with long COVID-19 can enable healthcare systems to provide high quality care to large numbers of patients within the available resources. Specific objectives are to (1) develop and refine a digital health intervention (DHI) that supports patient assessment, monitoring and remote rehabilitation; (2) develop implementation models that support sustainable deployment at scale; (3) evaluate the impact of the DHI on recovery trajectories and (4) identify and mitigate health inequalities due to the digital divide. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Mixed-methods, theoretically informed, single-arm prospective study, combining methods drawn from engineering/computer science with those from biomedicine. There are four work packages (WP), one for each objective. WP1 focuses on identifying user requirements and iteratively developing the intervention to meet them; WP2 combines qualitative data from users with learning from implementation science and normalisation process theory, to promote adoption, scale-up, spread and sustainability of the intervention; WP3 uses quantitative demographic, clinical and resource use data collected by the DHI to determine illness trajectories and how these are affected by use of the DHI; while WP4 focuses on identifying and mitigating health inequalities and overarches the other three WPs.

From this elementary immune response, the more complex antigen-specific adaptive responses are recruited to provide a long-lasting memory against the pathogens. Innate immunity gets activated when the host cell utilizes a diverse set of receptors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRR) to recognize the viruses that have penetrated the host and respond with cellular processes like complement system, phagocytosis, cytokine release and inflammation and destruction of NK cells. Viral RNA or DNA or viral intermediate products are recognized by receptors like toll-like receptors(TLRs), nucleotide oligomerization domain(NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) thereby, inducing type I interferon response (IFN) and other proinflammatory cytokines in infected cells or other immune cells. But certain viruses can evade the host innate immune response to replicate efficiently, triggering the spread of the viral infection. The present review describes the similarity in the mechanism chosen by viruses from different families -HIV, SARS-CoV2 and Nipah viruses to evade the innate immune response and how efficiently they establish the infection in the host.

Basal level autophagy plays an important role in cellular homeostasis through the elimination of the old or damaged organelles, as well as aggregated intracellular proteins. Autophagy refers to sequestration of intact organelles along with a portion of cytosol, into a double-or multi-membrane structure known as phagophore, which elongates, and after closure, forms a vesicular structure known as the autophagosome. Subsequently, the mature autophagosome fuses with a lysosome, thereby forming a single membrane structure, an autolysosome. Autophagy plays a critical role in inflammation, autoimmunity and cellular differentiation. Skin serves as the first line of defense against a variety of environmental insults and autophagy is thought to be a form of an endogenous defense mechanism against such environmental derangements. Autophagy has been linked with keratinocyte differentiation and melanocyte survival, as well as with the pathogenesis of diverse skin disorders including systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, psoriasis, vitiligo, infectious skin diseases and cancer. Autophagy has been one of the most studied phenomena in cell biology and pathophysiology, and given its broad clinical implications, has become a major target for drug discovery. The last decade has seen a substantial upsurge in autophagy-related research and publications; still, the dermatology literature appears to be less initiated.

Recent discussions concerning vaccination strategies have focused on identifying vaccine platforms, number of doses, route of administration, and time to reach peak immunity against SARS CoV-2. Here, we generated a single dose, fast-acting vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccine derived from the licensed Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV, expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the EBOV glycoprotein (VSV-SARS2-EBOV). Rhesus macaques vaccinated intramuscularly (IM) with a single dose of VSV-SARS2-EBOV were protected within 10 days and did not show signs of COVID-19 pneumonia. In contrast, intranasal (IN) vaccination resulted in limited immunogenicity and enhanced COVID-19 pneumonia compared to control animals. While IM and IN vaccination both induced neutralizing antibody titers, only IM vaccination resulted in a significant cellular immune response. RNA sequencing data bolstered these results by revealing robust activation of the innate and adaptive immune transcriptional signatures in the lungs of IM-vaccinated animals only.

Particularly, if an epidemic that seems initially contained after a first wave does not fully settle to its new quasi-equilibrium prior to changing circumstances or conditions that force a second wave, then indicators will show a decreasing rather than an increasing trend as a result of the persistent transient trajectory of the first wave. Our simulations show that this lack of time scale separation was to be expected during the second European epidemic wave of COVID-19. Overall, our results emphasize that the theory of critical slowing down applies only when the external forcing of the system across a critical point is slow relative to the internal system dynamics.","output":"Overlapping Time Scales Obscure Early Warning Signals for the Second COVID-19 Wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DNA vaccination has been widely studied to develop new, alternative, efficient and safe vaccines for humans and animals.

To date no trial comparing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) has been performed. METHODS: Hospitalized patients &#8805;18 years old with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were treated with either HCQ or LPV/RTV if they had either respiratory insufficiency (SpO2a?&#8804; 93% on room air or the need for oxygen insufflation) or bilateral consolidations on chest X-ray and at least 2 comorbidities associated with poor COVID-19 prognosis. Outcomes investigated included in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of stay, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) negativity and side effects of treatment. RESULTS: Of 156 patients (41% female) with a median age of 72 years (IQR 55.25-81) admitted to our department, 67 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (20 received HCQ, 47 LPV/RTV). Groups were comparable regarding most baseline characteristics. Median time from symptom onset to treatment initiation was 8 days and was similar between the groups (pa?= 0.727). There was no significant difference (HCQ vs. LPV/RTV) in hospital mortality (15% vs. 8.5%, pa?= 0.418), ICU admission rate (20% vs. 12.8%, pa?= 0.470) and length of stay (9 days vs. 11 days, pa?= 0.340). A PCR negativity from nasopharyngeal swabs was observed in approximately two thirds of patients in both groups. Side effects led to treatment discontinuation in 15% of patients in the LPV/RTV group. CONCLUSION: No statistically significant differences were observed in outcome parameters in patients treated with HCQ or LPV/RTV but patients in the LPV/RTV group showed a numerically lower hospital mortality rate. Additionally, in comparison to other studies we demonstrated a lower mortality in patients treated with LPV/RTV despite having similar patient groups, perhaps due to early initiation of treatment.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine versus lopinavir/ritonavir in severe COVID-19 patients : Results from a real-life patient cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Findings of the fifth stage of monitoring (June 18C21) based on online survey on the social situation and populations behavior amidst coronavirus demonstrate that pandemic-induced economic risks for the state are assessed by the majority of respondents as important although cause less alarm in the contest of lifting the lockdown mode.

All the subtypes were categorized by their isolated regions, including Asia, Europe, and Africa, and most of the synonymous codon usage patterns were analyzed by correspondence analysis (CA). As a result, influenza A virus showed the lowest synonymous codon usage bias among the virus species of the orthomyxoviridae family, and influenza B and influenza C virus were followed, while suggesting that influenza A virus might have an advantage in transmitting across the species barrier due to their low codon usage bias. The ENC values of the host-specific HA and NA genes represented their different HA and NA types very well, and this reveals that each influenza A virus subtype uses different codon usage patterns as well as the amino acid compositions. In NP, PA and PB2 genes, most of the virus subtypes showed similar RSCU patterns except for H5N1 and H3N2 (A/HK/1774/1999) subtypes which were suspected to be transmitted across the species barrier, from avian and porcine species to human beings, respectively. This distinguishable synonymous codon usage patterns in non-human origin viruses might be useful in determining the origin of influenza A viruses in genomic levels as well as the serological tests. In this study, all the process, including extracting sequences from GenBank flat file and calculating codon usage values, was conducted by Java codes, and these bioinformatics-related methods may be useful in predicting the evolutionary patterns of pandemic viruses.","output":"Genomic Analysis of Influenza A Viruses, including Avian Flu (H5N1) Strains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vector-borne diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Aedes-borne diseases, in particular, including dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, are increasing at an alarming rate due to urbanisation, population movement, weak vector control programmes, and climate change. The World Health Organization calls for strengthening of vector control programmes in line with the Global Vector Control Response (GVCR) strategy, and many vector control programmes are transitioning to this new approach. The Singapore dengue control programme, situated within the countrys larger vision of a clean, green, and sustainable environment for the health and well-being of its citizens, provides an excellent example of the GVCR approach in action. Since establishing vector control operations in the 1960s, the Singapore dengue control programme succeeded in reducing the dengue force of infection 10-fold by the 1990s and has maintained it at low levels ever since. Key to this success is consideration of dengue as an environmental disease, with a strong focus on source reduction and other environmental management methods as the dominant vector control strategy. The programme collaborates closely with other government ministries, as well as town councils, communities, the private sector, and academic and research institutions. Community engagement programmes encourage source reduction, and house-to-house inspections accompanied by a strong legislative framework with monetary penalties help to support compliance. Strong vector and epidemiological surveillance means that routine control activities can be heightened to specifically target dengue clusters. Despite its success, the programme continues to innovate to tackle challenges such as climate change, low herd immunity, and manpower constraints. Initiatives include development of novel vector controls such as Wolbachia-infected males and spatiotemporal models for dengue risk assessment. Lessons learnt from the Singapore programme can be applied to other settings, even those less well-resourced than Singapore, for more effective vector control.","output":"A greener vision for vector control: The example of the Singapore dengue control programme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are important regulators of ubiquitin signaling. Here, we report the discovery of deubiquitinating activity in ZUFSP/C6orf113. High-resolution crystal structures of ZUFSP in complex with ubiquitin reveal several distinctive features of ubiquitin recognition and catalysis. Our analyses reveal that ZUFSP is a novel DUB with no homology to any known DUBs, leading us to classify ZUFSP as the seventh DUB family. Intriguingly, the minimal catalytic domain does not cleave polyubiquitin. We identify two ubiquitin binding domains in ZUFSP: a ZHA (ZUFSP helical arm) that binds to the distal ubiquitin and an atypical UBZ domain in ZUFSP that binds to polyubiquitin. Importantly, both domains are essential for ZUFSP to selectively cleave K63-linked polyubiquitin. We show that ZUFSP localizes to DNA lesions, where it plays an important role in genome stability pathways, functioning to prevent spontaneous DNA damage and also promote cellular survival in response to exogenous DNA damage.","output":"Discovery and Characterization of ZUFSP/ZUP1, a Distinct Deubiquitinase Class Important for Genome Stability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To find out whether elements such as public expenditure, the coverage ratio, public or private ownership, and the size of Nursing homes relate to the number of deaths in residences per COVID-19.

Methods This JLA-PSP included a nation-wide survey in Denmark, an interim prioritisation, and an online consensus building workshop. The information gained from this was the basis for developing the final list of specific research priorities within chronic MSK pain. Results In the initial survey, 1010 respondents (91% people living with chronic MSK pain/relatives, 9% HCPs/researchers) submitted 3121 potential questions. These were summarised into 19 main themes and 36 sub-themes. In the interim prioritisation exercise, 51% people living with pain/relatives and 49% HCPs/researchers reduced the list to 33 research questions prior to the final priority setting workshop. 23 participants attended the online workshop (12 people/relatives, 10 HCPs, and 1 researcher) who reached consensus for the most important research priorities after two rounds of discussion of each question.

The first therapeutic agents approved by regulatory authorities for MF, these drugs attenuate the overactive JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling universally present in these patients, translating into major clinical benefits in terms of spleen shrinkage and symptom improvement. These, in turn, confer a survival advantage on patients with advanced disease, demonstrated in the case of ruxolitinib, for which long-term follow-up data are available. However, JAK inhibitors do not improve cytopenias in most patients, have relatively modest effects on bone marrow fibrosis and driver mutation allele burden, and clinical resistance eventually develops. Furthermore, they do not modify the risk of transformation to blast phase; indeed, their mechanism of action may be more anti-inflammatory than truly disease-modifying. This has spurred interest in rational combinations of JAK inhibitors with other agents that may improve cytopenias and drugs that could potentially modify the natural history of MF. Newer JAK inhibitors that are distinguished from ruxolitinib and fedratinib by their ability to improve anemia (eg, momelotinib) or safety and efficacy in severely thrombocytopenic patients (eg, pacritinib) are in phase 3 clinical trials. There is also interest in developing inhibitors that are highly selective for mutant JAK2, as well as type II JAK2 inhibitors.

Some of these nodules are autonomously functioning such that they can cause hyperthyroidism over time. In this case, surgery and radioiodine represent the standard of care. Nevertheless, patients might have contraindications or be unwilling to undergo these treatments. Minimally-invasive ultrasound-guided techniques, such as laser and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), have been recently introduced into clinical practice as an alternative treatment for symptomatic benign thyroid nodules. Due to their efficacy and tolerability, these techniques have become increasingly available and their usage has been extended also to autonomously functioning thyroid nodules (AFTN). Methods: In this narrative review, we will describe the studies reporting the therapeutic effects of RFA on AFTN, the studies reporting how RFA compares to the other treatment modalities, as well as the current indications for the use of RFA in patients with AFTN. For this purpose, a comprehensive literature search was independently conducted by three investigators on PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from inception up to February 2020 to identify published articles concerning the effects of RFA on AFTN. Results and Conclusions: Current consensus statements and guidelines support the notion that RFA should be regarded as a first-line therapy for non-functioning benign thyroid nodules, while it remains a valid second-line option for AFTN treatment in case of contraindications or patient unwillingness to undergo surgery or radioiodine.","output":"Radiofrequency Ablation on Autonomously Functioning Thyroid Nodules: A Critical Appraisal and Review of the Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The receptor for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a murine coronavirus, is a 110- to 120-kDa glycoprotein on intestinal brush border membranes and hepatocyte membranes.

We describe one of the most critical of these secondary consequences, the decrease in the utilization of health services and the resulting consequences for mortality. In low- and middle-income countries, these disruptions can halt progress towards reducing maternal and child mortality.Methods: Data on service utilization from January 2018 to June 2021 is extracted from health management information systems of 18 low- and lower-middle-income countries. Interrupted time series design is used to estimate percent change in the volumes of essential health services delivered during the pandemic compared to projected volumes based on pre-pandemic trends. The Lives Saved Tool mathematical model is used to estimate the impact of the service utilization disruptions on child and maternal mortality. In addition, the estimated monthly disruptions are also correlated to the COVID-19 burden, time since the start of the pandemic, and relative severity of mobility restrictions.Findings: We estimate that decreases in essential health service utilization between March 2020 and June 2021 led to 113,873 additional deaths in the 18 countries, representing 3.8% and 1.4% increases in child and maternal mortality, respectively. This corresponds to an average of 2.6 indirect deaths per COVID-19 death officially reported in the same period. This excess mortality results from the decline in utilization of the RMNCH services included in the analysis, but the utilization shortfalls vary substantially between countries, health services, and over time. The largest disruptions, resulting in 27.5% of the excess death, occurred during the second quarter of 2020, regardless of whether countries experienced the highest rate of COVID-19-related deaths during the same months. There is a significant relationship between the magnitude of service disruptions and the stringency of mobility restrictions. Interpretation: Large declines in health care utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic amplify the pandemic's harmful impacts on health outcomes.

Metals are frequently used for these surfaces due to their durability, but many metals also possess antimicrobial properties which function through a variety of mechanisms. This work investigates metallic alloys comprised of several bioactive metals with the target of achieving broad-spectrum, rapid bioactivity through synergistic activity. An entropy-motivated stabilization paradigm is proposed to prepare scalable alloys of copper, silver, nickel and cobalt. Using combinatorial sputtering, thin-film alloys were prepared on 100 mm wafers with 50% compositional grading of each element across the wafer. The films were then annealed and investigated for alloy stability. Bioactivity testing was performed on both the as-grown alloys and the annealed films using four microorganisms -- Phi6, MS2, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli -- as surrogates for human viral and bacterial pathogens. Testing showed that after 30 s of contact with some of the test alloys, Phi6, an enveloped, single-stranded RNA bacteriophage that serves as a SARS-CoV 2 surrogate, was reduced up to 6.9 orders of magnitude (>99.9999%). Additionally, the non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA bacteriophage MS2, and the Gram-negative E. coli and Gram-positive B. subtilis bacterial strains showed a 5.0, 6.4, and 5.7 log reduction in activity after 30, 20 and 10 minutes, respectively. Bioactivity in the alloy samples showed a strong dependence on the composition, with the log reduction scaling directly with the Cu content.

The availability and accessibility of high-fidelity resources and specialist education is variable. A collaboration between Great Ormond Street Hospital and the Royal Brompton Hospital, London, was established with the aim of providing a comprehensive SBE course to paediatric physiotherapists nationally. There are currently no other paediatric SBE programmes within the region. METHODS: During May 2018, 2 courses were run with a combination of pre-simulation lectures, simulation scenarios and peer group discussion. Following an international peer review from Queensland Children's Hospital and anonymised candidate feedback (N=23), the course content was divided into 2 separate study days (October 2018 and May 2019). This allowed targeted, specific SBE to both a critical care group and a high dependency care group of paediatric physiotherapists. RESULTS: 15 candidates attended the SBE paediatric critical care (N=8) and high dependency care (N=7) courses. Of the 14 anonymised electronic feedback responses, 96.5% rated the 4 simulation scenarios as extremely useful or very useful. Feedback themes were collated to guide future course content.

METHODS: Data of 2584 patients treated with partial nephrectomy for renal masses at 26 urological Italian centers (RECORD2 project) were collected. Renal function was assessed at baseline, on third postoperative day, and then at 6, 12, 24, and 48 months postoperatively. Multivariable models accounting for variables included in the Martini's nomogram were applied to each approach predicting renal function loss at all the specific timeframes. RESULTS: Multivariable models showed high area under the curve for robot-assisted partial nephrectomy at 6- and 12-month (87.3% and 83.6%) and for laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (83.2% and 75.4%), whereas area under the curves were lower in open partial nephrectomy (78.4% and 75.2%).

Integration of literature is an even more elusive task. This article describes a pilot study of a scalable online system to integrate data from 1000 articles on COVID-19. METHODS: Articles were imported from PubMed using the query COVID-19. The full text of articles reporting new data was obtained and the results extracted manually. An online software system was used to enter the results. Similar results were bundled using note fields in parentCchild order. Each extracted result was linked to the source article. Each new data entry comprised at least four note fields: (1) result, (2) population or sample, (3) description of the result and (4) topic. Articles underwent iterative rounds of group review over remote sessions. RESULTS: Screening 4126 COVID-19 articles resulted in a selection of 1000 publications presenting new data. The results were extracted and manually entered in note fields. Integration from multiple publications was achieved by sharing parent note fields by child entries. The total number of extracted primary results was 12 209. The mean number of results per article was 15.1 (SD 12.0). The average number of parent note fields for each result note field was 6.8 (SD 1.4). The total number of all note fields was 28 809. Without sharing of parent note fields, there would have been a total of 94 986 note fields. CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of a scalable online system to extract results from 1000 manuscripts. Using four types of notes to describe each result provided standardisation of data entry and information integration.

We have also presented anti-viral treatment strategies based on the pharmacological regulation of Bcl-xL expression or activity.","output":"The Role of Bcl-xL Protein in Viral Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The year 2020 witnessed a sharp increase in public attention to biological security (biosecurity) and biological diversity (biodiversity) governance. While COVID has triggered significant attention, this research chronicles and examines the development of biosecurity and biodiversity governance in China. The Copenhagen Schools approach to securitization is employed as a theoretical framework to map the evolution of biosecurity and biodiversity. Through this lens, we find that biological governance has developed from ecological security to biological security, while biodiversity governance has been framed as involving various security concerns, including biological security. These fields have converged and diverged over time in China. This analysis reveals the potential for synergetic governance over biosecurity and biodiversity concerns while identifying policy gaps in China as well as in the fragmented institutional structure of global governance.

It suggests alternate models based on new values to help tourism emerge from the current COVID crisis and come-of-age. Design/methodology/approach: The paper delineates the assumptions of neoliberal economics upon which much of tourism has been based. It then summarizes the work of progressive economists in developing new models that value capital other than financial. Six of these models are briefly described and applied to tourism. Findings: Some assumptions underlying the neoliberal economic model that need re-examining are the ideas that: self-interest drives ideal economic behavior;success comes from competition, not cooperation;encouraging consumption for its own sake;giving owners priority over other stakeholders;and more income translates into more happiness. Redesign of economic systems requires consideration of social capital, natural capital, intellectual capital, compassion capital, trust capital and spiritual capital to name a few. Examples of alternate systems using these capitals are the collaborative economy, the circular economy, the creative economy, the gift economy, the sacred economy and the regenerative economy. Originality/value: The papers approach is to interlace modern economic thought with the future maturation of tourism and to suggest that tourism policymakers and leaders learn from these thinkers to create a new model for the future of tourism. ? 2021, Pauline J.

In the present study, we conducted comprehensive computer-assisted analysis on the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in order to design a safe and potent multiepitope vaccine. In silico epitope prioritization shortlisted six HLA I epitopes and six B-cell-derived HLA II epitopes. These high-ranked epitopes were all connected to each other via flexible GPGPG linkers, and at the N-terminus side, the sequence of Cholera Toxin ? subunit was attached via an EAAAK linker. Structural modeling of the vaccine was performed, and molecular docking analysis strongly suggested a positive association of a multiepitope vaccine with Toll-like Receptor 3. The structural investigations of the vaccine-TLR3 complex revealed the formation of fifteen interchain hydrogen bonds, thus validating its integrity and stability. Moreover, it was found that this interaction was thermodynamically feasible.

Previously described mechanisms include the development of a cytokine storm, missing immunoglobulin class switch, antibody-mediated enhancement, and aberrant antigen presentation. OBJECTIVES: To understand the heterogeneity of immune response in COVID-19, a thorough investigation of histomorphological patterns in regional lymph nodes was performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lymph nodes from the cervical, mediastinal, and hilar regions were extracted from autopsies of patients with lethal COVID-19 (n = 20). Histomorphological characteristics, SARS-CoV?2 qRT-PCR, and gene expression profiling on common genes involved in immunologic response were analyzed. RESULTS: Lymph nodes displayed moderate to severe capillary stasis and edema, an increased presence of extrafollicular plasmablasts, mild to moderate plasmacytosis, a dominant population of CD8(+) T?cells, and CD11c/CD68(+) histiocytosis with hemophagocytic activity. Out of 20 cases, 18 presented with hypoplastic or missing germinal centers with a decrease of follicular dendritic cells and follicular T?helper cells. A positive viral load was detected by qRT-PCR in 14 of 20 cases, yet immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 N-antigen revealed positivity in sinus histiocytes of only one case. Gene expression analysis revealed an increased expression of STAT1, CD163, granzyme B, CD8A, MZB1, and PAK1, as well as CXCL9. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings imply a dysregulated immune response in lethal COVID-19.

In response to the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, Taipei City Government officials developed a School-based Infectious Disease Syndromic Surveillance System (SID-SSS). Teachers and nurses from preschools to universities in all 12 districts within Taipei are required to daily report cases of symptomatic children or sick leave requests through the SID-SSS. The pre-diagnosis at schools is submitted firstly as common pediatric disease syndrome-groups and re-submitted after confirmation by physicians. We retrieved these data from January 2010 to August 2011 for spatio-temporal analysis and evaluated the temporal trends with cases obtained from both the Emergency Department-based Syndromic Surveillance System (ED-SSS) and the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005 (LHID2005). Through the SID-SSS, enterovirus-like illness (EVI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) were the two most reported syndrome groups (77.6% and 15.8% among a total of 19,334 cases, respectively). The pre-diagnosis judgments made by school teachers and nurses showed high consistency with physicians clinical diagnoses for EVI (97.8%) and ILI (98.9%). Most importantly, the SID-SSS had better timeliness with earlier peaks of EVI and ILI than those in the ED-SSS. Furthermore, both of the syndrome groups in these two surveillance systems had the best correlation reaching 0.98 and 0.95, respectively (p<0.01). Spatio-temporal analysis observed the patterns of EVI and ILI both diffuse from the northern suburban districts to central Taipei, with ILI spreading faster. This novel system can identify early suspected cases of two important pediatric infections occurring at schools, and clusters from schools/families. It was also cost-effective (95.5% of the operation cost reduced and 59.7% processing time saved). The timely surveillance of mild EVI and ILI cases integrated with spatial analysis may help public health decision-makers with where to target for enhancing surveillance and prevention measures to minimize severe cases.","output":"Early Detection for Cases of Enterovirus- and Influenza-Like Illness through a Newly Established School-Based Syndromic Surveillance System in Taipei, January 2010 ~ August 2011"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We empirically examine the effect of local religious beliefs on the risk-taking behaviour of U.S. life insurers headquartered in that region.

METHODS: Prospective, observational, multicenter study performed during summer and school periods (1 July-31 October, 2020), in which epidemiological and clinical features, and viral transmission dynamics were analyzed in COVID-19 patients <16 years. A pediatric index case was established when a child was the first individual infected within a household. Secondary cases were defined when another household member tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before the child. The secondary attack rate (SAR) was calculated, and logistic regression was used to assess associations between transmission risk factors and SARS-CoV-2 infections. RESULTS: The study included 1040 COVID-19 patients <16 years. Almost half (47.2%) were asymptomatic, 10.8% had comorbidities, and 2.6% required hospitalization. No deaths were reported. Viral transmission was common among household members (62.3%). More than 70% (756/1040) of pediatric cases were secondary to an adult, whereas 7.7% (80/1040) were index cases. The SAR was significantly lower in households with COVID-19 pediatric index cases during the school period relative to summer (p=0.02), and when compared to adults (p=0.006).

In crude (unadjusted) analysis, a significantly lower risk of developing endometritis was noted in the clarithromycin group as compared to the control group (66% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.95, p = 0.040). When adjusted for perceived confounders, a significant difference was again noted (67% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.97, p = 0.034). Stratified analysis of significantly different demographic factors including Black race, BMI, and age was performed. A significantly decreased risk of development of endometritis when taking clarithromycin versus no adjunct macrolide was noted for Black race women in crude and adjusted models (crude: 87% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.83, p = 0.032; adjusted: 91% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.79, p = 0.026). This was also noted for women aged 18C29 years in crude and adjusted models (crude: model, 79% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.80, p = 0.014; adjusted model: 75% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.94, p = 0.028). All other stratified analyses did not yield significant differences in endometritis risk. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that administration of clarithromycin for adjunctive surgical prophylaxis for non-elective cesarean deliveries may be a safe option that may provide suitable endometritis prophylaxis in cases where azithromycin is unavailable, as was the case during the start of COVID-19 pandemic, most especially for Black race women and women ages 18C29 years.","output":"Clarithromycin use for adjunct surgical prophylaxis before non-elective cesarean deliveries to adapt to azithromycin shortages in COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In Kuwait, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) causes 25C30% of common cold, and 8.8% of respiratory infections in hospitalised patients. It is also associated with severe respiratory symptoms in infants, elderly, and immunocompromised patients. Our previous results showed that the expression of antiviral genes in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells is downregulated in the presence of HCoV-OC43 proteins. To understand the role of HCoV-OC43 proteins in antagonizing antiviral responses of the host, we investigated the effect of HCoV-OC43 structural and accessory proteins on the transcriptional activation of interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE), interferon- (IFN-) promoter, and nuclear factor kappa B response element (NF-kappaB-RE). METHODS: HCoV-OC43 ns2a, ns5a, membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) mRNA were amplified and cloned into the pAcGFP1-N expression vector, followed by transfection in HEK-293 cells. Two days post-transfection, the cells were co-transfected with a reporter vector containing firefly luciferase under the control of ISRE, IFN- promoter, or NF-kappaB-RE. Renilla luciferase vector was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Following 24 hours of incubation, the cells were treated with either IFN or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) for 6 hours. Thereafter, promoter activity was assayed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system. Influenza NS1 protein was used as positive control for antagonism. RESULTS: The transcriptional activity of ISRE, IFN- promoter, and NF-kappaB-RE was downregulated in the presence of ns2a, ns5a, M, or N protein as there was a sharp fall in firefly luciferase levels. Overall, HCoV-OC43 proteins reduced firefly luciferase levels for ISRE and IFN- promoter by at least ten fold, whereas for NF-kappaB-RE the firefly luciferase levels were reduced by at least fivefold. CONCLUSION: HCoV-OC43 has the ability to block the activation of different antiviral signaling pathways. DISCLOSURES: All authors: No reported disclosures.","output":"634.

The recently introduced knotless barbed suture may provide better outcomes, faster closure time, and decreased material utilization. Therefore, the aim of this study was to review the impact of barbed sutures on: (1) wound-related complications; (2) closure and operative time; (3) patient outcomes (range of motion and Knee Society Scores [KSS]); and (4) effects on cosmesis and patients' satisfaction. A literature search was performed using up to February 2017. Barbed sutures were associated with shorter closure times, shorter operative times, and larger cost savings per procedure as well as comparable wound complication rates after total joint arthroplasty. Although the current review is limited by the number of studies included, it demonstrates that overall, barbed sutures contribute to surgical efficiency when compared with conventional skin closure modalities.","output":"The Role of Barbed Sutures in Wound Closure Following Knee and Hip Arthroplasty: A Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The molecular biomarkers are molecules that are closely related to specific physiological states. Numerous molecular biomarkers have been identified as targets for disease diagnosis and biological research. To date, developing highly efficient probes for the precise detection of biomarkers has become an attractive research field which is very important for biological and biochemical studies. During the past decades, not only the small chemical probe molecules but also the biomacromolecules such as enzymes, antibodies, and nucleic acids have been introduced to construct of biosensor platform to achieve the detection of biomarkers in a highly specific and highly efficient way. Nevertheless, improving the performance of the biosensors, especially in clinical applications, is still in urgent demand in this field. A noteworthy example is the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) that breaks out globally in a short time in 2020. The COVID-19 was caused by the virus called SARS-CoV-2. Early diagnosis is very important to block the infection of the virus. Therefore, during these months scientists have developed dozens of methods to achieve rapid and sensitive detection of the virus. Nowadays some of these new methods have been applied for producing the commercial detection kit and help people against the disease worldwide. DNA-based biosensors are useful tools that have been widely applied in the detection of molecular biomarkers. The good stability, high specificity, and excellent biocompatibility make the DNA-based biosensors versatile in application both in vitro and in vivo. In this paper, we will review the major methods that emerged in recent years on the design of DNA-based biosensors and their applications. Moreover, we will also briefly discuss the possible future direction of DNA-based biosensors design.

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can noninvasively measure tissue oxygenation. We hypothesized that NIRS would correlate well with CBF, with cerebral metabolism of oxygen (CMRO2) and glucose and with lactate production as CPP was reduced. Seven anesthetized piglets were subjected to reductions in CPP to 60, 50, 40, 30, and 20 mmHg by infusing an artificial cerebral spinal fluid into the lateral ventricle of the brain. After a period of equilibration, NIRS over the left temporal cortex and regional CBF (microspheres) were measured at each CPP level as well as arterial and internal jugular PaO2 , glucose, and lactate. CMRO2 and glucose consumption and lactate production were calculated by standard formulae. NIRS correlated very well (P < 0.05) with CBF in the left temporal cortex [mean r (95% CI) = 0.95 (0.91-0.99)] and with left hemispheric CMRO2 [0.94 (0.90-0.98)], glucose consumption [0.87 (0.76-0.97)], and lactate production [0.89 (0.81-0.97)]. The correlation of NIRS with CBF was slightly better (P < 0.05) than that of CPP with CBF [0.89 (0.84-0.94)]. In this model of global cerebral hypertension, NIRS correlated well with CBF and measures of cerebral metabolism, and might be useful as a surrogate for CPP.

The present study is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database in an IBD Tertiary Centre that included all the consecutive, unselected patients undergoing surgery for CD between 1993 and 2019. Patients treated with small bowel resections, colonic resections, conventional and non-conventional strictureplasties were considered. The aim was to evaluate morbidity and long-term recurrence of repeated surgery. Among the population included, the following procedures were performed: 713 (58.2%) primary surgery (group S1), 325 (26.5%) first recurrence (group S2), and 186 (15.3%) multiple recurrences (group S3). Patients undergoing repeat surgery were older (p < 0.0001) and had a longer disease duration (p < 0.0001), extended disease (p = 0.0001), shorter time frame to first surgery (p < 0.0001), nutritional impairment (p < 0.0001), and a history of aggressive medical therapy (p = 0.04). Patients undergoing surgery for recurrences required higher complexity level surgery, with more conservative approaches (p = 0.0004) and a higher ostomy number (p = 0.06). Recurrent patients had higher short bowel syndrome rate (p < 0.0001), higher minor (p = 0.04) but not major (p = 0.2) postoperative complications rate. The 10-year surgical recurrence rate was 18% for group S1, 27% for S2, and 48% for S3, with significant differences at the log-rank test. Repeated surgery for complicated CD was associated with an increased rate of minor, but not major complications, requiring high-risk surgery, with a major ostomy rate and short bowel syndrome, and is associated with an increased long-term surgical recurrence, even on strictureplasty sites.","output":"Repeated surgery for recurrent Crohns disease: does the outcome keep worsening operation after operation?

OBJECTIVES This scoping review presents the effectiveness of simulated patients in healthcare education for geriatric care and eldercare purposes among current and prospective healthcare professionals. DATA SOURCES Search on CINAHL, Cochrane, ScienceDirect and Medline were completed on studies published between January 2009 to January 2020. A manual hand searching of reference lists for relevant articles was also conducted. REVIEW METHODS This scoping review follows the methods of Arksey and O-Malley to synthesize the literature on simulated patients in the teaching of geriatric care to current and prospective healthcare professionals. Inclusion criteria were, primary studies, with full-text articles, and in English. RESULTS Fifteen articles were included in this review. These articles were of wide variation by study design, settings, populations. Four broad themes were identified from existing literature: (i) improvement in geriatric knowledge, (ii) improvement in technical and non-technical skills, (iii) greater confidence in clinical and non-clinical skills, and (iv) learners' perception towards simulation as a learning pedagogy. CONCLUSION Simulated patients may have potential in improving geriatric education. Students generally enjoyed the learning methodology, finding it engaging and easy to learn by practising.

DESIGN Case-based retrospective analysis by a multinational group of 19 perinatal specialists of the placental pathology findings from 2 cohorts of infants delivered to mothers testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 - liveborn neonates infected via transplacental transmission who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after delivery and had SARS-CoV-2 identified in cells of the placental fetal compartment by molecular pathology; and stillborn infants with syncytiotrophoblast positive for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS In placentas from all 6 liveborn neonates acquiring SARS-CoV-2 via transplacental transmission the syncytiotrophoblast was positive for coronavirus using immunohistochemistry, RNA in situ hybridization, or both. All 6 placentas had chronic histiocytic intervillositis and necrosis of the syncytiotrophoblast.

In this study, we showed that CPIV3 infection induced apoptosis in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells, as determined by morphological changes and flow cytometry. Caspase activity and the expression of pro-apoptotic genes further indicated that CPIV3 induced apoptosis by activating both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.

However, the waning of immune response in this period is a concern. This study evaluated the durability, contributing factors of anti-RBD antibody concentration, and reactogenicities after the single dose of AZD1222 vaccine in the Thai population. METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective cohort study at Chulabhorn Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. Individuals 18 years or older who were negative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody were eligible. Anti- receptor-binding domain antibody concentrations were tested at least three weeks after the first vaccination and immediately before the second dose of vaccine. Information on reactogenicities was obtained via a questionnaire sent by a short message service. RESULTS: Anti-RBD Antibody concentration at 2 and 3 months post-vaccination were significantly higher than at 1 months post-vaccination (20.14 BAU/mL (95%CI; 16.37, 24.77) at 1 month, 48.08 BAU/mL (95%CI; 42.76, 54.08) at 2 month, and 65.01 BAU/mL (95%CI; 58.88,71.61) at 3 month). Adverse events occurred in approximately 60% of participants. Factors influencing vaccine immunogenicity include age, sex, the time elapsed from the first dose of vaccine, and underlying disease with diabetes and hematologic disease.

This work aims to develop valid instruments to evaluate COVID-19 induced anxiety, protective behaviors, and knowledge towards COVID-19, and to explore the relationship between the three constructs. Methods: A total sample of 215 university students were recruited to participate in an online self-administered questionnaire. The e-survey consisted of three instruments: COVID-19 Induced Anxiety Scale (CIAS) with 10 items, Protective Behaviors towards COVID-19 Scale (PBCS) with 14 items, and COVID-19 Related Knowledge Scale (CRKS) with 12 items. Results: Item-total analysis and CFA models indicated that CIAS items no. 1, 2, 5, and 8 should be removed to achieve adequate internal consistency (Cronbach alpha=0.78) and structural validity. The protective behaviors towards COVID-19 can be estimated from 3 dimensions: Routine Protective Behaviors (RPB), Post-exposure Protective Behaviors (PPB), and Post-exposure Risky Behaviors (PRB). Meanwhile, PBCS showed good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha=0.85). Although the sample was unbalanced on gender, gender explained 5% of the variance in protective behaviors with females being more inclined to engage in protective behaviors. Structural Equation Model (SEM) implied that an individual's COVID-19 related knowledge was associated with the three dimensions of protective behaviors (RPB, PPB, and PRB) positively. However, the level of COVID-19 induced anxiety was linked to RPB and PPB positively but negatively to PRB. Conclusion: The 6-item version of CIAS and the 14-item version of PBCS are promising tools for measuring COVID-19 induced anxiety and protective behaviors and can be adopted for future use during early phases of communicable diseases outbreaks. Knowledge is a key indicator for protective behavior; therefore, awareness strategies need to suppress infodemic impact. Severe stress must be monitored during early phases of outbreaks as it significantly increases the probability of risk behavior engagement.","output":"COVID-19 Induced Anxiety and Protective Behaviors During COVID-19 Outbreak: Scale Development and Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we review gene bank operations that have an influence on the global conservation system, with the intention to identify critical aspects that should be improved for optimum performance.

Investigations into the composition of the microbiota and its therapeutic modification have received increasing interest in human and veterinary medicine. Probiotics are a way of modifying the microbiota and have been tested to prevent and treat diseases. Probiotics are proposed to exert their beneficial effects through various pathways. Production of antimicrobial compounds targeting intestinal pathogens, general immune stimulation, and colonization resistance are among these mechanisms. Despite widespread availability and use, scientific, peer\\\\reviewed evidence behind commercial probiotic formulations in horses is limited. Additionally, quality control of commercial over\\\\the\\\\counter products is not tightly regulated. Although promising in vitro results have been achieved, in vivo health benefits have been more difficult to prove. Whether the ambiguous results are caused by strain selection, dosage selection or true lack of efficacy remains to be answered. Although these limitations exist, probiotics are increasingly used because of their lack of severe adverse effects, ease of administration, and low cost. This review summarizes the current evidence for probiotic use in equine medicine. It aims to provide veterinarians with evidence\\\\based information on when and why probiotics are indicated for prevention or treatment of gastrointestinal disease in horses.

Moreover, in the absence of such effects, DeepNull incurs no loss of power. When applied to 10 phenotypes from the UK Biobank (n = 370K), DeepNull discovered more hits (+6%) and loci (+7%), on average, than conventional association analyses, many of which are biologically plausible or have previously been reported.

Pep19 treatment of HFD-fed mice attenuated liver inflammation, hepatic fat distribution and accumulation, and lowered plasma alanine aminotransferase activity. The inguinal fat depot from the SD group treated with Pep19 showed multilocular brown-fat-like cells and increased mRNA expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), suggesting browning on inguinal white adipose cells.

Still, such exploration is challenging as there is a need for visualizations that are tailored for the purpose. RESULTS: The OmicLoupe software was developed to facilitate visual data exploration and provides more than 15 interactive cross-dataset visualizations for omics data. It expands visualizations to multiple datasets for quality control, statistical comparisons and overlap and correlation analyses, while allowing for rapid inspection and downloading of selected features. The usage of OmicLoupe is demonstrated in three different studies, where it allowed for detection of both technical data limitations and biological trends across different omic layers. An example is an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on two previously published studies, where OmicLoupe facilitated the identification of gene products with consistent expression changes across datasets at both the transcript and protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: OmicLoupe provides fast exploration of omics data with tailored visualizations for comparisons within and across data layers.

Coronavirus RNA synthesis is thought to be associated with replication organelles (ROs) consisting of modified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. These are transformed into double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) containing viral double-stranded RNA and into other membranous elements such as convoluted membranes, together forming a reticulovesicular network. Previous evidence suggested that the nonstructural proteins (nsps) 3, 4, and 6 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which contain transmembrane domains, would all be required for DMV formation. We have now expressed MERS-CoV replicase self-cleaving polyprotein fragments encompassing nsp3-4 or nsp3-6, as well as coexpressed nsp3 and nsp4 of either MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV, to characterize the membrane structures induced. Using electron tomography, we demonstrate that for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV coexpression of nsp3 and nsp4 is required and sufficient to induce DMVs. Coexpression of MERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 either as individual proteins or as a self-cleaving nsp3-4 precursor resulted in very similar DMVs, and in both setups we observed proliferation of zippered ER that appeared to wrap into nascent DMVs. Moreover, when inactivating nsp3-4 polyprotein cleavage by mutagenesis, we established that cleavage of the nsp3/nsp4 junction is essential for MERS-CoV DMV formation. Addition of the third MERS-CoV transmembrane protein, nsp6, did not noticeably affect DMV formation. These findings provide important insight into the biogenesis of coronavirus DMVs, establish strong similarities with other nidoviruses (specifically, the arteriviruses), and highlight possible general principles in viral DMV formation.","output":"Expression and Cleavage of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus nsp3-4 Polyprotein Induce the Formation of Double-Membrane Vesicles That Mimic Those Associated with Coronaviral RNA Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Attachment of a virus with a specific receptor on the cell surface is the first and foremost step in virus infection. In case of enveloped viruses, their interaction with the host cell receptor is mediated by viral encoded glycoproteins on its envelope, a host derived lipid bilayer. Since, virus entry is a multistep process, after receptor recognition, envelope proteins mediate internalisation of virus particles into the host cell. Envelope glycoproteins are the first proteins that the host immune system encounters upon infection. Thus, envelope proteins are important drug target with multiple strategies to inhibit entry of the virus into the host. Currently, there are very few drugs that function as envelope protein inhibitors which are approved for human use. Here, we reviewed different classes of envelope proteins of various viruses and emphasised the use of small molecules to inhibit fusion of envelope proteins.

These devices, while inexpensive, have not been adequately studied for their ability to resist biofouling and biofilm buildup. Bacterial biofilms are a major cause of biofouling in the medical field and, therefore, hospital-acquired, and medical device infections. These surface-attached bacteria are highly recalcitrant to conventional antimicrobial agents and result in chronic infections. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and medical officials have considered 3D printed medical devices as alternatives to conventional devices, due to manufacturing shortages. This abundant use of 3D printed devices in the medical fields warrants studies to assess the ability of different microorganisms to attach and colonize to such surfaces. In this study, we describe methods to determine bacterial biofouling and biofilm formation on 3D printed materials. We explored the biofilm-forming ability of multiple opportunistic pathogens commonly found on the human body including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus to colonize eight commonly used polylactic acid (PLA) polymers. Biofilm quantification, surface topography, digital optical microscopy, and 3D projections were employed to better understand the bacterial attachment to 3D printed surfaces.

Additionally, inclusion of a novel predicted exons located in the 3'UTR by alternative splicing may remove the C-terminal transmembrane domain of ACE2 and generate soluble ACE2 isoforms. Splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (SSOs) have been employed effectively as a therapeutic strategy in several disease conditions.

Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 became available in December, 2020. We explored the health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 immunisation alongside physical distancing in the UK to gain insights about possible future scenarios in a post-vaccination era. METHODS: We used an age-structured dynamic transmission and economic model to explore different scenarios of UK mass immunisation programmes over 10 years. We compared vaccinating 75% of individuals aged 15 years or older (and annually revaccinating 50% of individuals aged 15-64 years and 75% of individuals aged 65 years or older) to no vaccination. We assumed either 50% vaccine efficacy against disease and 45-week protection (worst-case scenario) or 95% vaccine efficacy against infection and 3-year protection (best-case scenario). Natural immunity was assumed to wane within 45 weeks. We also explored the additional impact of physical distancing on vaccination by assuming either an initial lockdown followed by voluntary physical distancing, or an initial lockdown followed by increased physical distancing mandated above a certain threshold of incident daily infections. We considered benefits in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs, both to the health-care payer and the national economy. We discounted future costs and QALYs at 35% annually and assumed a monetary value per QALY of 20 000 and a conservative long-run cost per vaccine dose of 15. We explored and varied these parameters in sensitivity analyses. We expressed the health and economic benefits of each scenario with the net monetary value: QALYs  (monetary value per QALY) - costs. FINDINGS: Without the initial lockdown, vaccination, and increased physical distancing, we estimated 1480 million (95% uncertainty interval 485-1988) COVID-19 cases and 31 million (084-45) deaths would occur in the UK over 10 years. In the best-case scenario, vaccination minimises community transmission without future periods of increased physical distancing, whereas SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic with biannual epidemics in the worst-case scenario. Ongoing transmission is also expected in intermediate scenarios with vaccine efficacy similar to published clinical trial data. From a health-care perspective, introducing vaccination leads to incremental net monetary values ranging from 120 billion to 3347 billion in the best-case scenario and from -11 billion to 569 billion in the worst-case scenario. Incremental net monetary values of increased physical distancing might be negative from a societal perspective if national economy losses are persistent and large. INTERPRETATION: Our model findings highlight the substantial health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Smaller outbreaks could continue even with vaccines, but population-wide implementation of increased physical distancing might no longer be justifiable. Our study provides early insights about possible future post-vaccination scenarios from an economic and epidemiological perspective.

In this study, we established a one-step duplex TaqMan RT-qPCR for rapid identification and detection of JEV and GETV. Primers and probes located in the NS1 gene of JEV and the E2 gene of GETV that could specifically distinguish JEV from GETV were selected for duplex TaqMan RT-qPCR. In duplex real-time RT-qPCR detection, the correlation coefficients (R(2)) of the two viruses were higher than 0.999. The RT-qPCR assay demonstrated high sensitivity, extreme specificity, and excellent repeatability. Detection of JEV and GETV in field mosquito and pig samples was 100 times and 10 times more sensitive than using traditional PCR, respectively. In addition, the new test took less time and could be completed in under an hour. Clinical sample testing revealed the prevalence of JEV and GETV in mosquitoes and pig herds in China.

The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term outcome in survivors after open surgery for rAAA in well-defined population. METHODS: This is a population-based, observational long-term follow-up (beyond 30-day mortality) study of patients surgically treated for rAAA from 2000 through 2014. Long-term survival was analysed using KaplanCMeier estimates and compared to the general population by analyses of relative survival. RESULTS: Out of 178 patients operated for rAAA, 95 patients (55%) either died in the perioperative period, were referred from other hospitals or were lost to follow-up (two patients). Altogether 83 patients were eligible for long-term outcomes: 72 men and 11 women. Estimated median crude survival time was 6.5 years [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.8C8.2]. Men had a median survival of 7.3 years (95% CI 5.1C9.4) versus 5.4 years in females (95% CI 3.5C7.3) (P = 0.082). Reinterventions during follow-up occurred in 31 (37%). Relative survival demonstrated a slightly higher risk of death in the rAAA population compared to the general age- and gender-matched population. Age, but not comorbidities, had a significant influence on long-term survival. CONCLUSION: For survivors beyond 30 days after surgery for rAAA, long-term survival compares well to that of an age- and sex-matched population.

Objective: To assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the most prevalent comorbidities, among people who died of COVID-19 in Romania. Methods: The study comprised 814 deaths caused by COVID-19 between 22nd March and 8th May, 2020 as reported by the Ministry of Health. WHO data regarding deaths of the general population of Romania was used for comparison. The study analyzed the demographics, number and prevalence of comorbidities and calculated the relative risk for each comorbidity. Results: The study sample consisted of 61.4% males and 38.6% females; the mean age was 68.2 y; 90.9% of deaths occurred in people 50+ years. The mean number of pre-existing conditions was 2.73 (SD = 1.521), with 97.4% of the patients having at least one. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (43.1%), diabetes (33.2%), and coronary heart disease (26.0%). The calculated relative risk of death due to COVID-19 was divided into 3 risk categories: high impact comorbidities (RR > 3) included diabetes RR = 6.426 (95% CI, 4.965C8.318), chronic renal disease RR = 4.338 (95% CI, 3.556C5.292) and hypertension RR=3.261 (95% CI, 2.687C3.958). The medium impact (RR = 2C3) group comprised chronic pulmonary disease RR = 2.615 (95% CI, 2.061C3.319) and chronic liver disease RR = 1.577 (95% CI, 1.183C2.104) and the low impact group (RR<2) Ccoronary heart disease RR = 0.664 (95% CI, 0.581C0.758), cancer RR = 0.515 (95% CI, 0.416C0.637) and stroke RR = 0.468 (95% CI, 0.370C0.593).

PVS can be hard to distinguish from a state of minimal preserved consciousness (\\"minimally conscious state,\\" MCS); the rate of misdiagnosis is high and has been estimated at 37-43%. In contrast, PVS is easily distinguished from brain death. We discuss the various diagnostic techniques that can be used to determine whether a patient is minimally conscious or in a persistent vegetative state. METHODS This article is based on a systematic review of pertinent literature and on a quantitative meta-analysis of the sensitivity and specificity of new diagnostic methods for the minimally conscious state. RESULTS We identified and evaluated 20 clinical studies involving a total of 906 patients with either PVS or MCS. The reported sensitivities and specificities of the various techniques used to diagnose MCS vary widely. The sensitivity and specificity of functional MRI-based techniques are 44% and 67%, respectively (with corresponding 95% confidence intervals of 19%-72% and 55%-77%); those of quantitative EEG are 90% and 80%, respectively (95% CI, 69%-97% and 66%-90%). EEG, event-related potentials, and imaging studies can also aid in prognostication. Contrary to prior assumptions, 10% to 24% of patients in PVS can regain consciousness, sometimes years after the event, but only with marked functional impairment. CONCLUSION The basic diagnostic evaluation for differentiating PVS from MCS consists of a standardized clinical examination. In the future, modern diagnostic techniques may help identify patients who are in a subclinical minimally conscious state.","output":"Persistent vegetative state and minimally conscious state: a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic procedures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, single stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with a large genomic size of 26C32 kilobases.

Subsequent epidemic outbreaks of novel zoonotic CoV transmission were reported, examples including HCoV-229E (229E), HCoV-OC43 (OC43), severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The ongoing outbreak of MERS in the Middle East is originating from a zoonotic source of dromedary camels. Surveillance later revealed that three CoV speciesHCoV-229E (229E), camel-HKU23, and MERS-CoVwere co-circulating in Saudi Arabia dromedary camels. Camel-HKU23 belongs to Group 2a CoV, which also includes human coronavirus OC43, bovine coronavirus, and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus. Recombination, resulting in the generation of different novel genotypes, has been reported previously among these CoVs. Our surveillance of dromedary camels slaughtered in a major abattoir in Nigeria identified camel-HKU23 from nasal swab samples with a prevalence of 2.2 per cent. Phylogenetic analysis showed Nigeria camel-HKU23 is distinct from those previously identified in Saudi Arabia, while still genetically similar, as they share a monophyletic origin. Recombination analysis of Nigeria camel-HKU23 revealed two recombination breakpoints at positions of 22774C24100 base pairs (bp) and 28224C29362 bp.

(i) Binding to porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) is essential for the initiation of infection. (ii) Binding to sialic acid residues on glycoproteins is dispensable for the infection of cultured cells but is required for enteropathogenicity. By comparing parental TGEV with mutant viruses deficient in the sialic acid binding activity, we determined the contributions of both binding activities to the attachment of TGEV to cultured cells. In the presence of a functional sialic acid binding activity, the amount of virus bound to two different porcine cell lines was increased sixfold compared to the binding of the mutant viruses. The attachment of parental virus was reduced to levels observed with the mutants when sialic acid containing inhibitors was present or when the cells were pretreated with neuraminidase. In virus overlay binding assays with immobilized cell surface proteins, the mutant virus only recognized pAPN. In addition, the parental virus bound to a high-molecular-mass sialoglycoprotein. The recognition of pAPN was sensitive to reducing conditions and was not dependent on sialic acid residues. On the other hand, binding to the sialic acid residues of the high-molecular-mass glycoprotein was observed regardless of whether the cellular proteins had been separated under reducing or nonreducing conditions. We propose that binding to a surface sialoglycoprotein is required for TGEV as a primary attachment site to initiate infection of intestinal cells.

Neuraminidase treatment rendered Vero, baby hamster kidney and primary chicken kidney cells resistant to infection by the IBV-Beaudette strain. Sialic acid-dependent infection was also observed with strain M41 of IBV, which infects primary chicken kidney cells but not cells from other species. In comparison with Influenza A virus and Sendai virus, IBV was most sensitive to pre-treatment of cells with neuraminidase. This finding suggests that IBV requires a greater amount of sialic acid on the cell surface to initiate an infection compared with the other two viruses. In previous studies, with respect to the haemagglutinating activity of IBV, it has been shown that the virus preferentially recognizes alpha2,3-linked sialic acid. In agreement with this finding, susceptibility to infection by IBV was connected to the expression of alpha2,3-linked sialic acid as indicated by the reactivity with the lectin Maackia amurensis agglutinin. Here, it is discussed that binding to sialic acid may be used by IBV for primary attachment to the cell surface; tighter binding and subsequent fusion between the viral and the cellular membrane may require interaction with a second receptor.","output":"Sialic acid is a receptor determinant for infection of cells by avian Infectious bronchitis virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to provide an overview of the effects of COVID-19 on macro-plastic pollution and to consider short-term and long-term scenarios for its possible environmental and human health consequences and to discuss possible strategies to address and overcome key challenges.

The changes in the spectrum of surgical procedures, as well as the structure of patients' visits to a urologist were evaluated. RESULTS In March 2020, the urogenital department of the TB Research Institute of Ministry of Health of Russia was redesigned into an observational one. Community departments worked with small restrictions or without any limitations. In KGBUZ \\"City Clinical Hospital No. 11, Barnaul\\", an increase in the number patients with bladder cancer, ureteral stones, concomitant kidney and ureteral stones by 3-27% was noted (p<0.05), as well as those with acute epididymo-orchitis, including testicular abscess. At the same time, a significant decrease in the number of patients with varicocele, pyelonephritis, chronic cystitis, chronic prostatitis, and phimosis was found. A surgical department of GBUZ CCEH from October to December 2020 was restructured to an infectious hospital; this led to a decrease in the volume of urological care and the number of procedures. The Avicenna Medical Center also established anti-epidemic measures, which made it possible not only not to reduce, but in a number of procedures to increase the volume of surgical care. CONCLUSION Owing to anti-epidemic measures, including the patient flow distribution, an introduction of mandatory testing, an early detection of patients and carriers among employees, mask regime, the opening of an observational department, single rooms, the lack of contact between patients, short length of stay, it was possible to prevent an outbreak of coronavirus infection among patients and personnel.

This study, therefore, aims to explore the association between the 24 h movement guidelines (in isolation or combination) and self-reported physical fitness in a sample of Chinese adolescents in an age range of 10C17. Methods: A convenient sample of 3807 children and adolescents from 12 schools was adopted in the present study. A questionnaire based on the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children was used to assess physical activity and screen time, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Scale was utilized to measure sleep duration. The International Fitness Scale was used to assess physical fitness in study participants. Ordinal logistic regression was performed to estimate the association between adherence to the 24 h movement guidelines and self-reported physical fitness. Results: Of all study participants, 0.9% of them met the 24 h movement guidelines, and meeting the guidelines was significantly associated with higher levels of self-reported physical fitness. The analysis for the association between specific combinations of 24 h movement guidelines and self-reported physical fitness underscored the importance of meeting the physical activity recommendations. Conclusion: Adherence to more recommendations contained in the 24 h movement guidelines was associated with higher self-reported physical fitness, especially cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular strength. Our study also stressed the importance of promoting moderate to vigorous physical activity in children and adolescents. Further works should focus on the association of a recommendation of adherence with other health indicators and replicate this study on larger samples among Chinese children and adolescents.

Design: Retrospective analysis. Subjects and Settings: The study relied on administrative claims data from the CMS Medicare Limited Data Set (5% sample) in 2018. The analysis was limited to fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare beneficiaries with minimum of 3-month enrollment in Parts A & B and at least 65 years old. Methods: We used diagnosis codes to identify members with incontinence in their 2018 claims experience and grouped these members into 3 categories (urinary incontinent only, fecal incontinent only, and dual incontinent (DI)) and four sites-of-service (nursing home, Skilled-nursing Facility (SNF), home health, and self-care). We then determined the incidence of four types of incontinence-related events for each cohort: 1) Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs), 2) Incontinence-Associated Dermatitis (IAD), 3) Slips and falls, and 4) Behavioral disruptions. Results: We found that 11.2 percent of Medicare members had a claims-based diagnosis of incontinence in 2018. This result falls below the estimated share of the over-65 population who are incontinent, as reported in the literature. The prevalence of the four incontinence-related events is significantly higher (between 2 percentage points to 17 percentage points) for members who experience dual incontinence relative to those with only urinary incontinence. On average, those diagnosed with incontinence experienced 5 times more UTIs, two times as many dermatitis events, more than twice as many slips and falls, and 2.8 times more behavior disruptions compared to those without an incontinence diagnosis. Conclusions: Although we find that the prevalence of incontinence is under-reported relative to the literature, our results show that those who are diagnosed as incontinent experience a much higher prevalence of UTIs, IAD, slips and falls, and behavioral deterioration compared to those who are not diagnosed as incontinent. Our results suggest that incontinence may be an important indicator diagnosis of many other conditions and, if not well-managed, may challenge the desire for those who are incontinent to age at home.","output":"Incontinence and Healthcare Utilization of Medicare Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic is accompanied by a high incidence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Patients with a new coronavirus infection have an increased risk of developing hospital-acquired pneumonia. Aim: to study the etiological structure of CAP during the epidemic spread of COVID-19, to assess the risks of joining the pathogens of pneumonia associated with the provision of medical care. Methods & Materials Biological material from 1085 hospitalized patients with CAP was conducted from August 2020 - June 2021 in Rostov-on-Don (Russia). Verification of respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2 RNA was performed by polymerase chain reaction in nasopharyngeal smears. Bacteriological analysis of sputum was performed via classical methods, identification of isolated pathogens was carried out using time-of-flight mass spectrometry on an Autoflex (Bruker Daltonics) with BioTyper 3.0 software. Results Cases of type 3 parainfluenza virus (7.80.9%), other types of coronaviruses (HKU-1, OC43, HL-63 and 229) (2.70.5%), respiratory syncytial virus (1.90.5%) were detected in patients with COVID-19. Fungi of the genus Candida (35.61.8%) and Staphylococcus aureus (9.11.1%) were prevailing in the microbiota structure. Should be noted that the number of Streptococcus pneumoniae cultures decreased from 5.5 % in August 2020 to 1.1 % in June 2021, possibly due to pneumococcal vaccination. Gramm-negative enterobacteria were presented predominantly by Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.50.7%), Escherichia coli (2.90.6%), and non-fermenting Gramm-negative bacteria C Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.50.5%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (1.20.4%). In 30.6% of patients treated in the hospital there was a secondary infection probably associated with compromised immune system and the transmission of infection from the hospital environment. Secondary infection with Candida spp., non-fermenting Gramm-negative bacteria (A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa) and K. pneumoniae, including those characterized by multiple drug-resistance, prevailed. The most frequently registered resistance to penicillins, cephalosporins of 3rd generation. Conclusion A feature of CAP in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 is a higher incidence of mixed infection of both viral and bacterial etiology. Patients with COVID-19 represent a high risk group for the development of mycotic lung lesions, possibly against the background of treatment with antibacterial drugs.

However, the inhibitory effects of serine protease inhibitors on influenza virus infection of human airway epithelial cells, and on their production of inflammatory cytokines are unclear. METHODS: Primary cultures of human tracheal epithelial cells were treated with four types of serine protease inhibitors, including camostat, and infected with A/Sendai-H/108/2009/(H1N1) pdm09 or A/New York/55/2004(H3N2). RESULTS: Camostat reduced the amounts of influenza viruses in the supernatants and viral RNA in the cells. It reduced the cleavage of an influenza virus precursor protein, HA0, into the subunit HA1. Camostat also reduced the concentrations of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- in the supernatants. Gabexate and aprotinin reduced the viral titers and RNA levels in the cells, and aprotinin reduced the concentrations of TNF- in the supernatants. The proteases transmembrane protease serine S1 member (TMPRSS) 2 and HAT (human trypsin-like protease: TMPRSS11D), which are known to cleave HA0 and to activate the virus, were detected at the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm. mRNA encoding TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and TMPRSS11D was detectable in the cells, and the expression levels were not affected by camostat. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that human airway epithelial cells express these serine proteases and that serine protease inhibitors, especially camostat, may reduce influenza viral replication and the resultant production of inflammatory cytokines possibly through inhibition of activities of these proteases.","output":"The serine protease inhibitor camostat inhibits influenza virus replication and cytokine production in primary cultures of human tracheal epithelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has been well controlled in China Most of the COVID-19 patients were having postinflammatory pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) on the follow-up CT scan when discharged, and complaining about exertional dyspnea of different levels, presenting with an UIP (usual interstitial pneumonia) pattern or NSIP (non-specific interstitial pneumonia) pattern on the CT scans Will the PPF get improved or stay stable, or progress?

On the basis of biochemical evidence, it is often presumed that such NO? -dependent oxidations are due to the formation of the oxidant peroxynitrite, although alternative mechanisms involving the phagocyte-derived heme proteins myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase might be operative during conditions of inflammation. Because of the overwhelming literature on NO? generation and activities in the respiratory tract, it would be beyond the scope of this commentary to review this area comprehensively.

In order to do so, previously published three-point bending test results of a single trabecula were replicated using two different extended finite element method approaches, namely, elastic-plastic-fracture and elastic-fracture that considered different configurations of the elasto-plastic properties of bone from which the best approach to fit the experimental data was identified. The behavior of a single trabecula was then used in 2D extended finite element method models to quantify the strength of the trabecular tissue of the forearm along three perpendicular anatomical axes. The results revealed that the elastic-plastic-fracture model better represented the experimental data in the model of a single trabecula. Considering the 2D trabecular specimens, the elastic fracture model predicted higher strength than the elastic-plastic-fracture model and there was no difference in stiffness between the two models. In general, the specimens exhibited higher failure strain and more ductile behavior in compression than in tension. In addition, strength and stiffness were found to be higher in tension than compression on average. It can be concluded that with proper parameters, extended finite element method is capable of simulating the ductile behavior of cancellous bone. The models are able to quantify the tensile strength of trabecular tissue in the various anatomical directions reporting an increased strength in the longitudinal direction of forearm cancellous bone tissue.

This study aimed to estimate diagnostic and therapeutic costs of patients with a diagnosis of or suspected of COVID-19 disease admitted to hospitals in northeast Iran. METHODS: This descriptive and analytical research was conducted as a retrospective study using the data collected from 2980 patients admitted to 30 hospitals from February to April 2020 in Iran. For data collection, an appropriate data capture tool was designed to record detailed resource use. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to examine the association between the treatment costs and sociodemographic, disease severity, and underlying diseases. Data were analyzed using Excel 2017 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and SPSS version 21 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). RESULTS: The inpatient costs per patient were Int$416, of which 74% were paid by social health insurance systems, 19% by the government, and 7% by the patients. The largest cost components were hoteling (37%) and medicine (36%). The 4 subscales of age, sex, underlying disease, and severity predicted 48.6% of the cost variance.

We performed ex vivo experiments to assess the impact of STING activation on CD4 T-cell differentiation and investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Finally, we tested whether STING activation enhances TH9 cell antitumor activity against mouse melanoma upon adoptive transfer. RESULTS We found that activation of STING signaling cell-intrinsically enhances the differentiation and antitumor functions of TH1 and TH9 cells by increasing their respective production of interferon gamma (IFN-) and interleukin-9. IRF3 and type I interferon receptors (IFNARs) are required for the STING-driven enhancement of TH1 cell differentiation. However, STING activation favors TH9 cell differentiation independently of the IFNARs/IRF3 pathway but through mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, underscoring that STING activation differentially affects the fate of distinct CD4 T-cell subsets. The therapeutic effect of STING activation relies on TH1 and TH9-derived cytokines, and STING activation enhances the antitumor activity of TH9 cells upon adoptive transfer.

Higher ADHD symptoms were associated with reduced inhibitory control, lower levels of top-down attentional control (endogenous orienting), and greater arousal decrements (phasic alertness). Controlling for ADHD symptoms, top-down attentional control uniquely predicted future crashes, near-crashes, and culpability for future crashes/near-crashes; only arousal decrements portended future near-crashes. Only top-down attentional control significantly mediated the association between baseline ADHD symptoms and future driving risk. Conclusions: The driving risks associated with ADHD appear to be conveyed in part by impairments in the top-down, voluntary control of attention, rather than by difficulties sustaining attention over time or inhibiting impulses, as is often assumed.

Increased sea freight is a precursor to the increase in economic activities. The volumes of sea trade and freight rates are influenced by importCexport dynamics and changes in commodity prices. So, levels of commodity prices are monitored to gain insight into the anticipated demand for bulk shipments. In this study, the causality-in-quantiles (CiQ) model is used to model the causal relationship between BDI spot values and spot price of major dry bulk commodities like iron ore, aluminum, copper, agricultural products by considering 12 years of daily data. CiQ model is superior compared to other linear causality models as it helps in capturing the asymmetry and nonlinearity in causality based on different quantiles or market conditions i.e., bearish, normal, and bullish market conditions. Also, it captures the causality-in-mean as well as variance and helps in exploring the causal relationship in returns as well as volatility transmission between BDI and commodity prices. The finding of the paper throws interesting light on the asymmetric relationship between BDI and commodity prices- commodity prices are causing BDI in all market conditions, but the influence is stronger in normal periods than bearish and bullish periods. The causality from commodity to BDI follows a common pattern across most of the commodities. However, the effect of BDI on commodities considerably varies across the range of commodities and across market conditions. So, this model provides a plethora of information that will help commodity market participants to hedge the risk of variations in commodity price and freight rates effectively.","output":"The asymmetric relationship between Baltic Dry Index and commodity spot prices: evidence from nonparametric causality-in-quantiles test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The situation associated with the growing number of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections forced ongoing monitoring of the epidemic situation, which entailed an introduction of a number of restrictions and solutions intended to isolate the infected persons on the one hand, and to minimize the risk of development of an epidemic in Poland on the other. Activity of the Polish legislator is also essential, which tried to introduce solutions that would correspond with current expectations and needs. Given the multiplicity of the introduced regulations, interpretation of provisions of statutes has not always been easy. In this paper, the author points to the issues of communication with a public authority by specific reflections on the principles of serving documents on beneficiaries of EU programs under which they were awarded funding for their implementation on the basis of EU regulations addressing the use of the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund for programs implemented as part of the cohesion policy (Regulations of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU) of 17 December 2013: no. 1303/2013, no. 1301/2013, no. 1304/2013, no 1300/2013, and no. 1299/2013). The author focuses on the issues of communication with an authority in a situation where administrative proceedings are initiated against a beneficiary of EU funds, e.g., for returning the granted funding. The author points to the dynamics of the legislator's work in this respect by analyzing the rules for serving documents by a public authority on beneficiaries who are public entities and those who are not. The author's main research aim is to analyze existing provisions establishing the possibility of electronic communication with a public authority, and also to assess them critically due to the extraordinary situation caused by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This is intended to verify the main research hypothesis focusing on the attempt to answer a question whether existing regulations, and those created at the time of the epidemic threat and the state of epidemic in Poland facilitate citizens' electronic communication with a public authority. The author aims to answer a question about whether the Polish legislator responds appropriately to the numerous emerging challenges associated with the pandemic and whether it created regulations that effectively ensure the possibility of continuity of contact with a public authority for citizens who are the beneficiaries of public funds. This analysis may contribute to the understanding of whether and how it is possible to improve citizens' contact with public authorities, which in the future may eliminate barriers and obstacles arising in this regard. The author bases her reflections on the experience resulting from providing legal services for one of the Polish Managing Authorities of the Regional Operational Programme using at the same time a number of research methods (i.e., the method of interpretation of applicable laws to establish applicable provisions of the law that regulate admissibility of electronic communication with a public authority and to establish efficiency of such communication, the analytical method, applied in reference to the relevant state of the art in the achievements of legal scholarship, and the empirical method, based on observation and analysis of practical issues resulting from the author's cooperation with a Polish managing authority). In her conclusions, the author points to the lack of introduction of comprehensive regulations (also at the EU level-for all EU Member States) in terms of de-formalizing the principles of communication in the course of pending administrative proceedings. The author notices an absence of unambiguous regulations that allow for a scanned document signed by hand and sent my email to be qualified into the category of documents served by electronic means, through use of means of electronic communication. The author assesses this absence negatively due to the fact that such action seems the simplest in a situation caused by COVID-19.","output":"Electronic Communication with Public Administration in the Time of COVID-19-Poland's Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To clarify the characteristics and distribution of hospital environmental microbiome associated with confirmed COVID-19 patients. Environmental samples with varying degrees of contamination which were associated with confirmed COVID-19 patients were collected, including 13 aerosol samples collected near eight patients in different wards, five swabs from one patient's skin and his personal belongings, and two swabs from the surface of positive pressure respiratory protective hood and the face shield from a physician who had close contact with one patient. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) was used to analyze the composition of the microbiome. One of the aerosol samples (near patient 4) was detected positive for COVID-19, and others were all negative. The environmental samples collected in different wards possessed protean compositions and community structures, the dominant genera including Pseudomonas, Corynebacterium, Neisseria, Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter, and Cutibacterium.

Genera abundance and proportion of human microbes and pathogens radiated outward from the patient, while the percentage of environmental microbes increased. The abundance of the pathogenic microorganism of medical supplies is significantly higher than other surface samples. The microbial compositions of the aerosol collected samples nearby the patients were mostly similar to those from the surfaces of the patient's skin and personal belongings, but the abundance varied greatly. The positive rate of COVID-19 RNA detected from aerosol around patients in general wards was quite low. The ward environment was predominantly inhabited by species closely related to admitted patients. The spread of hospital microorganisms via aerosol was influenced by the patients' activity.

To date, no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are therefore critical for controlling the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic and optimizing clinical care, infection control, and public health interventions.

Customary agricultural systems built by Knaka iwi (Indigenous Hawaiian) are now rested within a landscape filled with many different crops tended by farmers from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. Value systems dictating farming practices and crop selling decisions differ. In Hawai'i, values of food security or food sovereignty are of particular importance, especially as growing movements seek to increase local production and decrease the state's reliance on imported food in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we systematically compare two different groups of farmers in Hawai'i and their values related to production and distribution. We then analyze the experiences of these two groups of farmers during the COVID-19 pandemic and their responses to them. The study is based on interviews with 22 Indigenous Knaka iwi (IF) and Non-Indigenous local farmers (LF) from the island of Oahu. Ninety percent of IF say values associated with both food security and sovereignty drive their production and distribution decisions, while 75% of LF describe food security as the sole driver. Sixty percent of IF follow a non-profit economic model and emphasize cultural and educational values in their production decisions. LF follow profit-driven models and emphasize the influence the market has in their decisions. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, IF sold or donated the bulk of their crops to the local community through farm pickups, while restaurants were the primary buyers of LF crops. During the pandemic, the local community continues to be the primary recipient for IF, and due to the closure of many restaurants, LF have pivoted their sales to the community as well.

PROGRAM The states of Ohio, Oregon, and Washington received funding in 2016 to define, measure, and advocate for the foundational public health services (FPHS) delivered by the governmental public health system. They have taken unique but related approaches to strengthening work in the areas of categorical public health programs and the underlying infrastructure and capabilities that support the programmatic work. IMPLEMENTATION All 3 states conducted assessments of gaps and funding needs that have allowed them to advocate for, and receive, limited resources for the governmental public health system. These resources were used to strengthen the public health system in ways that assisted with pandemic response. The pandemic also provided many opportunities for the states to demonstrate the importance of the foundational capabilities (assessment, communications, partnership development, policy, leadership, quality improvement, emergency response planning) and public health infrastructure in the areas of information technology and laboratory capacity. These opportunities allowed states to make progress in obtaining funding for FPHS. CONCLUSION While heavily focused on the program area of communicable disease control, the pandemic response highlighted the importance of having a robust public health infrastructure that is well supported in the areas of foundational capabilities. Substantial infrastructure investments will allow health departments to close gaps in health inequities; contribute to the significant work needed postpandemic in the areas of chronic disease, behavioral health, climate change, and social determinants of health; and be better prepared for future emergencies.","output":"Resetting the Course for Foundational Public Health Services (FPHS) During COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Information on underlying conditions and severe COVID-19 illness among children is limited.

Data were collected from the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release, which included data from more than 800 US hospitals. Multivariable generalized linear models, controlling for patient and hospital characteristics, were used to estimate adjusted risk of severe COVID-19 illness associated with underlying medical conditions and medical complexity. Exposures: Underlying medical conditions and medical complexity (ie, presence of complex or noncomplex chronic disease). Main Outcomes and Measures: Hospitalization and severe illness when hospitalized (ie, combined outcome of intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death). Results: Among 43a?465 patients with COVID-19 aged 18 years or younger, the median (interquartile range) age was 12 (4-16) years, 22a?943 (52.8%) were female patients, and 12a?491 (28.7%) had underlying medical conditions. The most common diagnosed conditions were asthma (4416 [10.2%]), neurodevelopmental disorders (1690 [3.9%]), anxiety and fear-related disorders (1374 [3.2%]), depressive disorders (1209 [2.8%]), and obesity (1071 [2.5%]). The strongest risk factors for hospitalization were type 1 diabetes (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 4.60; 95% CI, 3.91-5.42) and obesity (aRR, 3.07; 95% CI, 2.66-3.54), and the strongest risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness were type 1 diabetes (aRR, 2.38; 95% CI, 2.06-2.76) and cardiac and circulatory congenital anomalies (aRR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.48-1.99). Prematurity was a risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness among children younger than 2 years (aRR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.47-2.29).

METHODS: We performed a nested analysis of a seroprevalence study among all volunteering LTCF staff to determine community and nosocomial risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity using modified Poison regression. We also combined epidemiological and genetic sequencing data from a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak investigation in a LTCF ward to infer transmission dynamics and acquisition routes of SARS-CoV-2, and evaluated strain relatedness using a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. RESULTS: Among 285 LTCF employees, 176 participated in the seroprevalence study, of whom 30 (17%) were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. Most (141/176, 80%) were healthcare workers (HCWs). Risk factors for seropositivity included exposure to a COVID-19 inpatient (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 2.6; 95% CI 0.9C8.1) and community contact with a COVID-19 case (aPR 1.7; 95% CI 0.8C3.5).

Extremely large-scale COVID-19 research has also utilised some of the world's fastest supercomputers, such as IBM's SUMMIT -- for ensemble docking high-throughput screening against SARS-CoV-2 targets for drug-repurposing, and high-throughput gene analysis -- and Sentinel, an XPE-Cray based system used to explore natural products. Grid computing has facilitated the formation of the world's first Exascale grid computer. This has accelerated COVID-19 research in molecular dynamics simulations of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interactions through massively-parallel computation and was performed with over 1 million volunteer computing devices using the Folding@home platform. Grids and clouds both can also be used for international collaboration by enabling access to important datasets and providing services that allow researchers to focus on research rather than on time-consuming data-management tasks.","output":"Distributed Computing in a Pandemic: A Review of Technologies Available for Tackling COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Little is known about this relationship in patients with lupus nephritis. METHODS: A cross-sectional, quantitative study. Data collected included demographics, current medication, systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index, medication adherence, beliefs about medicines, shared decision-making, patient-doctor depth of relationship, patient-doctor quality of relationship, interpersonal trust in a physician and illness perceptions. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients with lupus nephritis completed the questionnaires. Logistic regression indicated that medication adherence was significantly predicted by (a) interpersonal trust in a physician (B = 0.85, Wald 3.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01, 5.44; P = 0.05); (b) timeline cyclical (B = -0.89, Wald 4.95, 95% CI 0.19, 0.90; P < 0.05) and beliefs about the necessity of medicines (B = 0.75, Wald 4.14, 95% CI 1.03, 4.38; P < 0.05). Mediation analysis showed that beliefs about the necessity of medicines significantly mediated the relationship between trust and medication adherence when adjusted for age (B = 0.48, 95% CI 0.06, 1.08; P < 0.01). A further mediation analysis showed that patient-doctor depth of relationship (B = 0.05, 95% CI 0.01, 0.09; P < 0.001), shared decision-making (B = 0.07, 95% CI 0.01, 0.13; P < 0.001) and patient-doctor quality of relationship (B = 0.08, 95% CI 0.01, 0.16; P < 0.001) significantly mediated the relationship between illness coherence and interpersonal trust in a physician. CONCLUSION: The findings highlighted two key elements: (a) the importance of trust in relation to medication adherence; and (b) a good understanding of patients' illness is linked to a better relationship with their doctor and greater participation in shared decision-making which is associated with increased trust. Tailored psycho-educational interventions could contribute to improving the patient-doctor relationship quality, trust and increased shared decision-making, which, in turn, might improve medication adherence in patients with lupus nephritis.","output":"Physician-patient interaction and medication adherence in lupus nephritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper is concerned with the vibration characteristics of the Coronavirus family. There are some 25C100 receptors, commonly called spikes protruding from the envelope shell of the virus. Spikes, resembling the shape of a hot air balloon, may have a total mass similar to the mass of the lipid bi-layer shell. The lipid proteins of the virus are treated as homogeneous elastic material and the problem is formulated as the interaction of thin elastic shell with discrete masses, modeled as short conical cross-sectional beams. The system is subjected to ultrasonic excitation. Using the methods of structural acoustics, it is shown that the scattered pressure is very small and the pressure on the viral shell is simply the incident pressure. The modal analysis is performed for a bare shell, a single spike, and the spike-decorated shell. The predicted vibration frequencies and modes are shown to compare well with the newly derived closed-form solutions for a single spike and existing analytical solutions for thin shells. The fully nonlinear dynamic simulation of the transient response revealed the true character of the complex interaction between local vibration of spikes and global vibration of the multi-degree-of-freedom system. It was shown that harmonic vibration at or below the lowest resonant modes can excite large amplitude vibration of spikes. The associated maximum principal strain in a spike can reach large values in a fraction of a millisecond. Implications for possible tearing off spikes from the shell are discussed. Another important result is that after a finite number of cycles, the shell buckles and collapses, developing internal contacts and folds with large curvatures and strains exceeding 10%. For the geometry and elastic properties of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, these effects are present in the range of frequencies close to the ones used for medical ultrasound diagnostics.","output":"Effect of receptors on the resonant and transient harmonic vibrations of Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To curb Corona Virus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and Hepatitis B further spread, the local Health Ministry collaborated with local communities to build COVID-19 and Hepatitis B Ambassador.

Remote triage and consultations became the default, with adapted face-to-face contact used only when clinically necessary. This study aimed to identify the modified face-to-face delivery models used nationwide in spring/summer 2020. Information was also sought concerning COVID-19 outbreaks linked to English general practice. Methods: In June 2020, a survey was sent by email to the 135 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England to identify local organisation of face-to-face general practice consultations since March 2020. An email was sent to Public Health England (PHE) requesting data on COVID-19 outbreaks linked to general practice. Results: All CCGs responded. Between March and July 2020, separation of COVID-19 patients from others was achieved using combinations of the following models: zoned surgeries (reported by 47% of CCGs), where COVID-19 and other patients were separated within their own practice;'hot' or 'cold' hubs (reported by 90% of CCGs), separate sites where COVID-19 or other patients registered at one of several collaborating practices were seen;'hot' and 'cold' home visits (reported by 70% of CCGs). One of seven combinations of these models was used across each CCG, with some flexibility shown according to changing demand through hub availability. PHE data indicated 25 possible or confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks or clusters in English general practice to July 31st 2020. Conclusions: Varied, flexible ways of delivering face-to-face general practice consultations were identified. Analysis of the modified delivery in terms of management of COVID-19 and other conditions, and impacts on staff and patients, together with learning from investigations into confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks, may both aid future pandemic management and identify beneficial elements for practice beyond this.","output":"Modifications to the delivery of NHS face-to-face general practice consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic in England."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has altered conceptions of \\"normal\\" globally, including food purchasing and acquisition decisions.

We have also analysed if the implementation of TNO during the COVID-19 pandemic was beneficial in order to provide uninterrupted care to the patients with the limited resources available in these challenging times. METHODS: All patients who underwent TNO guided biopsies or dilatation attempted over a 7 month period during COVID- 19 pandemic were included by searching the hospital and department database at The Royal Albert Edward Infirmary. A comparative group of patients who underwent panendoscopy over 9 months were included for comparison. Demographic data, histological diagnosis, second procedure and cost involved were recorded. RESULTS: During this period, 20 TNO procedures (16 biopsies and 4 dilatations) were attempted which were compared with 20 panendoscopy procedures. The diagnostic accuracy of TNO biopsy for identifying benign and malignant pathology was 81.1%. The sensitivity and specificity for identifying malignancy was 76.9% and 100% respectively. The most common lesion location was laryngeal (43.8%) followed by oropharyngeal (37.5%), more specifically located at the tongue base. The median waiting period between the procedure being listed and TNO being performed was 5.5 days compared to 12 days for panendoscopy. There were 12/16 patients who did not require further interventions for histological diagnosis of the tumor. The TNO procedure was well tolerated with no complications and all were done under local anaesthesia as outpatient procedure without need for admission. TNO resulted in cost saving of 356 per case on a standard NHS tariff. CONCLUSION: TNO is a valuable diagnostic tool for patients with suspected UADT malignancy and dysphagia and has proven to be an asset during the COVID-19 pandemic when we have to make the best use of the limited theatre time and resources. Also, the cost analysis showed that outpatient based TNO can provide significant cost savings for the current standard of care. Furthermore, it has shown better patient tolerability, lesser complications and shortened the time for diagnosis and hence starting timely treatment for these patients.","output":"Use of office based transnasal oesophagoscopy in management of Head & Neck conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic at the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary, Wigan, United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic, due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has stimulated the search for antivirals to tackle COVID-19 infection Molecules with known pharmacokinetics and already approved for human use have been demonstrated or predicted to be suitable to be used either directly or as a base for a scaffold-based drug design Among these substances, quercetin is known to be a potent in vitro inhibitor of 3CLpro, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease However, its low in vivo bioavailability calls for modifications to its molecular structure In this work, this issue is addressed by using rutin, a natural flavonoid that is the most common glycosylated conjugate of quercetin, as a model Combining experimental (spectroscopy and calorimetry) and simulation techniques (docking and molecular dynamics simulations), we demonstrate that the sugar adduct does not hamper rutin binding to 3CLpro, and the conjugated compound preserves a high potency (inhibition constant in the low micromolar range, Ki = 11 M) Although showing a disruption of the pseudo-symmetry in the chemical structure, a larger steric volume and molecular weight, and a higher solubility compared to quercetin, rutin is able to associate in the active site of 3CLpro, interacting with the catalytic dyad (His41/Cys145) The overall results have implications in the drug-design of quercetin analogs, and possibly other antivirals, to target the catalytic site of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro","output":"Rutin Is a Low Micromolar Inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease 3CLpro: Implications for Drug Design of Quercetin Analogs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Minimally invasive surgery has revolutionized the way surgeons perform colorectal surgery, and new technologies continually upend the way surgeons view and operate within the deep pelvis.

The initial step of the infection involves the binding of the virus through the viral spike protein with the host angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In this study, the interaction of some ACE or ACE2 inhibitors and their analogues as well as selected compounds with the viral spike protein as a strategy to hinder viral-ACE2 interaction were investigated. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as well as the ligands were retrieved from protein databank and ChEBI database respectively. The molecules were prepared before initiating the virtual screening using PyRx software. Discovery studio was used to further visualize the binding interactions between the compounds and the protein. RESULTS: The ACE inhibitors and their analogues fosinopril (1-), fosinopril and moexipril have the best binding affinity to the protein with binding energies < ? 7.0 kcal/mol while non-flavonoid stilben-4-ol binds with free binding energy of ? 7.1 kcal/mol. Others compounds which belong to either the flavonoids, terpenes and alkaloid classes also have binding energies < ? 7.0 kcal/mol. Such high binding energies were enhanced via hydrogen bond (h-bond) interactions in addition to other interactions observed between the compounds and the amino acid residues of the protein.

Early on, increased loneliness has been publicly discussed as a harmful psychological side effect of these measures. Due to the serious adverse health consequences of loneliness, it is essential to take these concerns seriously and investigate them systematically to allow for evidence-based decision making. Thus far, however, high-resolution empirical evidence of such harmful side effects is rare. METHODS: The present preregistered large-scale daily diary study assessed daily loneliness in 4,844 German adults between March 16 and April 12, 2020. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Daily loneliness slightly increased during the first two weeks since implementing the pandemic-related measures and slightly decreased thereafter. With increasing age, daily loneliness increased more strongly over the four weeks. Moreover, daily loneliness increased more strongly for parents compared to people without children. Thus, despite some increases in loneliness in some individuals, there was no linear increase in loneliness in response to the first pandemic-related measures in the present sample.","output":"Changes in daily loneliness for German residents during the first four weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: People with COVID-19 may experience impairing, and sometimes persisting, symptoms that would require enhanced surveillance. Our objective was to train an artificial intelligence-based model to predict the presence of COVID-19 symptoms and derive a digital vocal biomarker for easily and quantitatively monitoring symptom resolution. Methods: We used data from 272 participants in the prospective Predi-COVID cohort study recruited between May 2020 and May 2021, with both voice recordings and simultaneous COVID-19 related symptom assessment during the first two weeks of follow-up. A total of 6473 voice features were derived from recordings of participants reading a standardized pre-specified text. Models were trained separately for Android devices (3gp audio format) and iOS devices (m4a audio format). A binary outcome (symptomatic versus asymptomatic) was considered, based on a list of 14 frequent symptoms: dry cough, fatigue, sore throat, loss of taste and smell, diarrhea, fever, respiratory problems, increase in respiratory problems, difficulty eating or drinking, skin rash, conjunctivitis or eye pain, muscle pain/unusual aches, chest pain, overall pain level. Performances of the predictive models were evaluated according to the AUC, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Matthews correlation coefficient. Findings: A total of 1775 audio recordings were analyzed (6.5 recordings per participant on average), including 1049 corresponding to symptomatic cases and 726 to asymptomatic ones. The best performances were obtained from Support Vector Machine models for both audio formats. We observed an elevated predictive capacity for both Android (AUC=0.91, balanced acc=0.85) and iOS (AUC=0.85, balanced accuracy=0.77) as well as good calibrations (Brier Scores = 0.11 and 0.16 respectively for Android and iOS). The vocal biomarker derived from the predictive models accurately discriminated asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals with COVID-19 (t-test P-values<0.001 for both Android and iOS devices). Interpretation: In this prospective cohort study, we have demonstrated that using a simple, reproducible task of reading a standardized pre-specified text of 25 seconds enabled us to derive a vocal biomarker for monitoring the resolution of COVID-19 related symptoms with elevated accuracy and calibration. An external validation, especially in other languages, would now be required before integrating such a vocal biomarker in telemonitoring solutions or in clinical practice.Trial Registration: This study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04380987)Funding: The Predi-COVID study is supported by the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR)(Predi-COVID, grant number 14716273), the Andr Losch Foundation, and the LuxembourgInstitute of Health.Declaration of Interest: Ethical Approval: This study was approved by the National Research Ethics Committee ofLuxembourg (study number 202003/07) in April 2020.","output":"A Voice-Based Biomarker for Monitoring Symptom Resolution in Adults with COVID-19: Findings from the Prospective Predi-COVID Cohort Study (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the biggest problems nowadays in the online environment is the spreading of misinformation.

The Italian government introduced progressive infection-mitigation measurements, thus dramatically reducing social interactions and preventing virus spread. During the summer, infection containment measures progressively loosened until, due to an unjustified interpretation of some permissions and the excessive utilization of public transportation at school reopening, the contagion rate progressively increased until causing a severe challenge for our NHS again. Aim of the study: to assess the efficiency of our previously described protocol in 18 Campania region-located Nefrocenter Consortium DCs as further adapted to new knowledge under the new ubiquitous contagion conditions and to identify SARS-CoV-2-infection mortality rate and risk factors. METHOD: Dialysis patients did so too during that period according to the expected shifting prevalence over time (mean  SD: 853  30 per month; range 825 to 873)  (11.8% in April, and 14.8% in November vs. a pre-COVID-19 12.0% rate in January). RESULTS: More patients got infected in November (10.19%) than in April (0,24%), and 22 patients of the 89 from the SARS-CoV-2 November positive subjects required hospitalization for moderate-severe symptoms (24.72%), with death unavoidably coming in 19 (86.36% of hospitalized and 21.35% of infected patients) compared to the only one recorded in April (0.12%). The pandemic's two periods showed a strong association between mortality rate and often co-existing comorbidities, primarily represented by arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

To begin with, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) varimax is adopted to fuse observed time-series data about the pandemic evolution in each state across the US. Then, relationships between the pandemic progress of two individual states are measured by different synchrony metrics, which can then be mapped into networks under unique topological characteristics. Lastly, the hidden knowledge in the established networks can be revealed from different perspectives by network structure measurement, community detection, and online random forest, which helps to inform data-driven decisions for battling the pandemic. It has been found that states gathered in the same community by diffusion entropy reducer (DER) are prone to be geographically close and share a similar pattern and tendency of COVID-19 evolution. Social factors regarding the political party, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and population density are possible to be significantly associated with the two detected communities within a constructed network.

These characteristics give them great potentials to be used in biomimetic and soft robotics applications. In this paper, an electrothermal actuator with directly printed microfilament heater was designed, fabricated and characterized. The soft actuator used polyimide (PI) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as the structural materials due to their large mismatch of thermal expansion. A microfilament heater was electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printed using a low melting point alloy Bi58/Sn42, and embedded in-between the PI and PDMS layers. The fabricated actuator achieved a maximum curvature of 1.0 cm ?1 under a supply voltage as low as 3 V. Resistive self-sensing technology was used to sense the deflection of the actuator and to develop the closed-loop control of the actuator. The bending curvature of the actuator is resulted from the temperature change of the actuator, which can be detected by the electrical resistance change of the embedded heater as they are linearly related. A PID controller was designed for the closed-loop operation of the actuator. Compared with the open-loop operation, the closed-loop controlled actuator demonstrated more rapid and precise response.

Adequate use of this equipment is more critical than ever because the risk of shortages must be balanced against the need to effectively protect health care workers, including prehospital personnel. Specific training is therefore necessary; however, the need for social distancing has markedly disrupted the delivery of continuing education courses. Electronic learning (e-learning) may provide significant advantages because it requires neither the physical presence of learners nor the repetitive use of equipment for demonstration. OBJECTIVE: Inclusion of game mechanics, or \\"gamification,\\" has been shown to increase knowledge and skill acquisition. The objective of this research was to develop a gamified e-learning module to interactively deliver concepts and information regarding the correct choice and handling of PPE. METHODS: The SERES framework was used to define and describe the development process, including scientific and design foundations. After we defined the target audience and learning objectives by interviewing the stakeholders, we searched the scientific literature to establish relevant theoretical bases. The learning contents were validated by infection control and prehospital experts. Learning mechanics were then determined according to the learning objectives, and the content that could benefit from the inclusion of game mechanics was identified. RESULTS: The literature search resulted in the selection and inclusion of 12 articles. In addition to gamification, pretesting, feedback, avoiding content skipping, and demonstrations using embedded videos were used as learning mechanics. Gamification was used to enhance the interactivity of the PPE donning and doffing sequences, which presented the greatest learning challenges. The module was developed with Articulate Storyline 3 to ensure that it would be compatible with a wide array of devices, as this software generates HTML5-compatible output that can be accessed on smartphones, tablets, and regular computers as long as a recent browser is available. CONCLUSIONS: A gamified e-learning module designed to promote better knowledge and understanding of PPE use among prehospital health care workers was created by following the SERES framework.

COVID-19 can cause a wide range of clinical symptoms, which varies from asymptomatic presentation to severe respiratory insufficiency, exacerbation of immune response, disseminated microthrombosis and multiple organ failure, which may lead to dead. Due to the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, the development of vaccines to minimize COVID-19 severity in the world population is imperious. One of the employed techniques to produce vaccines against emerging viruses is the synthesis of recombinant proteins, which can be used as immunizing agents. Based on the exposed, the aim of the present study was to verify the systemic and immunological effects of IM administration of recombinant Nucleocapsid protein (NP), derived from SARS-CoV-2 and produced by this research group, in 2 different strains of rats (Rattus norvegicus); Wistar and Lewis. For this purpose, experimental animals received 4 injections of NP, once a week, and were submitted to biochemical and histological analysis. Our results showed that NP inoculations were safe for the animals, which presented no clinical symptoms of worrying side effects, nor laboratorial alterations in the main biochemical and histological parameters, suggesting the absence of toxicity induced by NP. Moreover, NP injections successfully triggered the production of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by both Wistar and Lewis rats, showing the sensitization to have been well sufficient for the immunization of these strains of rats. Additionally, we observed the local lung activation of the Bronchus-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (BALT) of rats in the NP groups, suggesting that NP elicits specific lung immune response. Although pre-clinical and clinical studies are still required, our data support the recombinant NP produced by this research group as a potential immunizing agent for massive vaccination, and may represent advantages upon other recombinant proteins, since it seems to induce specific pulmonary protection.","output":"Immunization with SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein triggers a pulmonary immune response in rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The common cold is a clinical syndrome triggered by a variety of viral pathogens, but rhinoviruses are the most frequent cause. Complications of such infections include sinusitis, otitis media, and exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease. There is growing interest in host innate defence responses that may regulate the severity of viral responses. We will review recent evidence that nitric oxide is an important contributor to the host response during colds. RECENT FINDINGS Infection of human airway epithelial cells with human rhinovirus has been shown to lead to the increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase both in vitro and in vivo. This increase in epithelial inducible nitric oxide synthase correlates with increased levels of nitric oxide in exhaled air. Importantly, nitric oxide can inhibit human rhinovirus-induced epithelial expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and can inhibit viral replication in epithelial cells in vitro. Moreover, nitric oxide can modulate several signal transduction pathways that are associated with cytokine generation. Nitric oxide can also nitrosylate viral proteases and can interact with the immune system. Consistent with these observations, pilot studies have indicated that the increased generation of nitric oxide during rhinovirus infections is associated with fewer symptoms and more rapid viral clearance. SUMMARY Further studies are warranted to evaluate the role of nitric oxide in colds and to determine whether the administration of nitric oxide donor compounds could be a viable therapeutic approach for viral exacerbations of airway diseases.","output":"Nitric oxide and the common cold."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The tendency of parents to consume alcohol during the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to be moderated by pandemic-related stress combined with the ongoing demands of childcare and home-based education, which are reported to be more burdensome for females than males. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe alcohol-related content posted by mothers on Instagram during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using two popular hashtags, #momjuice and #winemom, 50 Instagram posts on each were collected from the top posts tab. The coding categories were created inductively and were as follows: displays alcohol (drinking/holding alcohol or alcohol itself), person is making alcoholic beverages, type of alcohol featured or discussed, highlights anxiety and/or depression/mental state, highlights struggling (in general), highlights parenting challenges, encourages alcohol consumption, discourages alcohol consumption, features a person wearing clothing or shows products promoting alcohol, promotes alcohol rehabilitation, highlights caffeine to alcohol daily transition throughout the day, and highlights other drugs besides caffeine and alcohol. RESULTS: Overall, the 100 selected posts had a total of 5108 comments and 94,671 likes. The respective averages were 51.08 (SD 77.94) and 946.71 (SD 1731.72). A majority (>50%) of the posts reviewed encouraged alcohol consumption (n=66) and/or displayed alcohol (n=56). Of the 66 that encouraged and/or displayed alcohol, the common type of alcohol discussed or featured was wine (n=55). Only 6 posts discouraged alcohol use and only 4 provided the audience with a disclaimer. None of the videos promoted or endorsed alcohol rehabilitation in any way. Only 37 posts highlighted struggle. However, these posts garnered more than a majority of the likes (n=50,034, 52.3%). Posts that showed struggle received an average of 1359.57 (SD 2108.02) likes. Those that did not show struggle had an average of 704.24 (SD 1447.46) likes. An independent one-tailed t test demonstrated this difference to be statistically significant (P=.0499).

Intubation may improve outcome but there are no specific criteria for intubation. Intubation of septic patients with respiratory distress and hemodynamic compromise may result in clinical deterioration and precipitate cardiovascular failure. The decision to intubate is complex and multifactorial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of intubation in patients with respiratory distress and predominant hemodynamic instability within 24 h after ICU admission for septic shock. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospective registry of adult patients with septic shock admitted to the medical ICU at Mayo Clinic, between April 30, 2014 and December 31, 2017. Septic shock was defined by persistent lactate > 4 mmol/L, mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg, or vasopressor use after 30 mL/kg fluid boluses and suspected or confirmed infection. Patients who remained hospitalized in the ICU at 24 h were separated into intubated while in the ICU and non-intubated groups. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. The first analysis used linear regression models and the second analysis used time-dependent propensity score matching to match intubated to non-intubated patients. RESULTS: Overall, 358 (33%) ICU patients were eventually intubated after their ICU admission and 738 (67%) were not. Intubated patients were younger, transferred more often from an outside facility, more critically ill, had more lung infection, and achieved blood pressure goals more often, but lactate normalization within 6 h occurred less often. Among those who remained hospitalized in the ICU 24 h after sepsis diagnosis, the crude in-hospital mortality was higher in intubated than non-intubated patients, 89 (26%) vs. 82 (12%), p < 0.001, as was the ICU mortality and ICU and hospital length of stay. After adjustment, intubation showed no effect on hospital mortality but resulted in fewer hospital-free days through day 28. One-to-one propensity resulted in similar conclusion. CONCLUSIONS: Intubation within 24 h of sepsis was not associated with hospital mortality but resulted in fewer 28-day hospital-free days. Although intubation remains a high-risk procedure, we did not identify an increased risk in mortality among septic shock patients with predominant hemodynamic compromise.

Related HEs occur in influenza C, toro-, and coronaviruses, apparently as a result of relatively recent lateral gene transfer events. Here, we report the crystal structure of a coronavirus (CoV) HE in complex with its receptor. We show that CoV HE arose from an influenza C-like HE fusion protein (HEF). In the process, HE was transformed from a trimer into a dimer, whereas remnants of the fusion domain were adapted to establish novel monomer-monomer contacts. Whereas the structural design of the RDE-acetylesterase domain remained unaltered, the HE receptor-binding domain underwent remodeling to such extent that the ligand is now bound in opposite orientation. This is surprising, because the architecture of the HEF site was preserved in influenza A HA over a much larger evolutionary distance, a switch in receptor specificity and extensive antigenic variation notwithstanding. Apparently, HA and HEF are under more stringent selective constraints than HE, limiting their exploration of alternative binding-site topologies. We attribute the plasticity of the CoV HE receptor-binding site to evolutionary flexibility conferred by functional redundancy between HE and its companion spike protein S.

Specifically, this study further investigates the economic resilience and the number of COVID-19 cases by analysing the evolutionary trend of their spatial distribution pattern using the standard deviation ellipse (SDE). The impact of COVID-19 on economic resilience is examined using a panel vector autoregressive model. The following are the findings. (1) The economic resilience value decreased throughout the study period, but the cities with high economic resilience showed a trend of spatial diffusion in the late study period. Wuhans lockdown strategy was benefit to control the spread of COVID-19, and promptly stopped the decline of China's economic resilience. (2) Economic resilience and the number of COVID-19 cases influenced their future trends positively, but this effect gradually decreased over time. During the COVID-19, although the number of confirmed cases significantly influenced China's economic resilience, and the disease's spread was evident, China maintained a high level of economic development resilience. (3) The rise in economic resilience during the pandemic's early stages promoted the number of confirmed cases, but the strength of this relationship gradually declined as the pandemic progressed. Returning to work and other activities may increase the risk of infection. Numerous policies implemented at the outbreak inception aided in laying the groundwork for economic resilience. Although the outbreak had a detrimental effect on economic resilience in the later stages of the pandemic, a convergent trend was observed at the end of the research period. (4) Using variance decomposition, we discovered that future economic resilience was significantly influenced by itself and by relatively few changes. However, the impact of confirmed cases on economic resilience becomes apparent after the fourth period. This indicates that the number of confirmed cases must be limited during the initial stages. The early support of various sectors in China facilitated the spatial expansion of economically resilient cities. The pandemic has a non-negligible negative impact on economic resilience, but this has been mitigated by Wuhan's timely closure.","output":"The spatiotemporal evolution of COVID-19 in China and its impact on urban economic resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O objetivo do trabalho foi avaliar a influncia de diferentes tipos de treinamento sobre o condicionamento fsico de equinos por meio da determina??o do lactato sanguneo e da atividade srica de creatina quinase, aspartato aminotransferase e lactato desidrogenase aps exerccio fsico de alta intensidade e curta dura??o.

METHODS: The Caritas Hospital St. Josef in Regensburg employs around 1330 employees and treats almost 20,000 inpatients annually. All records of the pandemic officer between 1 March 2020 and 28 February 2021 were included in the present descriptive study. RESULTS: In all, 280 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (mean age 68  19 years) were treated during the observation period; 81% (n = 227) of these were treated as inpatients between November 2020 and February 2021. In addition to the analysis of these patients, an analysis of the test concept was carried out, both for the patients (53% of the tests in the so-called 2nd wave) and for the employees; 1633 PCR tests were carried out, with 5.6% of all employees being infected with SARS-CoV?2 in the course of the pandemic. In addition, other measures such as reducing the surgical program and other general measures were evaluated. CONCLUSION: Many established processes had to be changed in the hospital during the pandemic. Both staff shortages due to SARS-CoV-2-positive employees and the quarantine measures of contact persons led to further tension in the already tight staffing levels, especially in the nursing care sector, and made patient care more difficult. The test concept in the hospital was very complex and asymptomatic tests in particular showed a low hit rate, while being associated with high personnel costs.","output":"Ein Jahr Coronapandemiemanagement an einem 300-Betten-Krankenhaus: Report der Pandemiebeauftragten"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, the problem of global climate change has become one of the significant challenges for ensuring the sustainability of the functioning and growth in the market value of the worlds leading industrial companies.

Research findings are as follows: First, on the whole, the total trade volume of TCM products and the number of participating economies and trade connections are on the rise. Second, in terms of topological structure, with higher network density and rising transmission efficiency, the global trade network of TCM products has typical small-world and scale-free network characteristics and has begun to be controlled by a few countries. Judging from the co-opetition between major trading countries, there are more diversified sources of imports for major trading countries, and there is competition between supplying countries. Third, For China, the trade volume of TCM products between China and various countries worldwide has grown rapidly and exhibits a trend of continuous increase followed by decline. China has established extensive trade partnerships and its position in the global trade network of TCM products has been continuously improved. China's participation has contributed to a closer connection among trading entities, but its network heterogeneity remains to be further improved. From the perspective of trade interdependence, the number of countries or regions maintaining high interdependence with China has been gradually increasing, and most of them are European and American countries, Japan, and Southeast Asian countries.

One reason is a lack of trust among the users that leads to social isolation, although a coworking space should increase knowledge and idea exchange. As most people in coworking spaces use information and communication technologies (ICT) for their collaboration with their clients or employers, we examined if and how ICT can be used to support the positive effects and dynamics of coworking spaces. For this, we conducted eight interviews with freelancers and entrepreneurs who have already worked in coworking spaces in order to identify requirements for a complementary virtual coworking platform.

To begin to understand what mechanisms might control this outcome, we examined the effect of a murine-CD52 specific monoclonal antibody on the depletion and repopulation of immune cells in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. We tested whether the tolerance-promoting receptor PD-1 is required for disease remission post anti-CD52; and found that PD-1 deficient mice with a more severe EAE were nevertheless effectively treated with anti-CD52. Anti-CD52 increased the proportions of newly generated T cells and DN T cells, while reducing newly generated B cells; the latter effect being associated with a higher expression of CD52 by these cells. In the longer-term, anti-CD52 caused substantial increases in the proportion of newly generated lymphocytes and DN T cells, in mice with EAE. Thus, the rapid repopulation of lymphocytes from central lymphoid organs post anti-CD52 may limit further disease. Furthermore, these data identify DN T cells, a subset with immunoregulatory potential, as a significant hyper-repopulating subset following CD52 mediated depletion.

Using a proportional odds model, we compared vaccine hesitancy levels to determine the odds of being more likely versus unlikely to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Of 1,000 people surveyed, 30.4% exhibited vaccine hesitancy. Findings showed that adults with significantly lower odds of vaccine hesitancy included those who were male, older, worried about COVID-19 infection or its community effects, adhered to social distancing, and reported higher incomes.

World Health Organization (WHO) has designated it as a global variant of concern (VOC) and has named as Omicron. A surge in new COVID-19 cases have been reported from certain geographical locations, primarily in South Africa (SA) following the emergence of Omicron. Materials and methodsWe performed an in silico analysis of the complete genomic sequences of Omicron available on GISAID (until 2021-12-10) to predict the functional impact of the mutations present in this variant on virus-host interactions in terms of viral transmissibility, virulence/lethality, and immune escape. The mutations present at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the variants were assessed using an open analysis pipeline which integrates a yeast-display platform with deep mutational scanning. Further, we performed a correlation analysis of the relative proportion of the genomic sequences of specific SARS-CoV-2 variants (in the period of 01 Oct-10th Dec, 2021) with the current epidemiological data (new COVID-19 cases and deaths) from SA to understand whether the Omicron has an epidemiological advantage over existing variants. ResultsCompared to the current list of global VOCs/VOIs (as per WHO) Omicron bears more sequence variation, specifically in the spike protein and host receptor-binding motif (RBM). Omicron showed the closest nucleotide and protein sequence homology with Alpha variant for the complete sequence as well as for RBM. The mutations were found primarily condensed in spike region (28-48) of the virus. Further, the mutational analysis showed enrichment for the mutations decreasing ACE2-binding affinity and RBD protein expression, in contrast, increasing the propensity of immune escape. An inverse correlation of Omicron with Delta variant was noted (r=-0.99, p< .001, 95% CI: -0.99 to - 0.97) in the sequences reported from SA post-emergence of the new variant, later showing a decrease. There has been a steep rise in the new COVID-19 cases in parallel with increase in the proportion of Omicron since the first case (74-100%), on the contrary, the incidences of new deaths have not been increased (r=-0.04, p>0.05, 95% CI =-0.52 to 0.58). ConclusionsOmicron may have greater immune escape ability than the existing VOCs/VOIs. However, there are no clear indications coming out from the predictive mutational analysis that the Omicron may have higher virulence/lethality than other variants, including Delta. The higher ability for immune escape may be a likely reason for the recent surge in Omicron cases in SA.

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Patients who underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair with double-loaded suture anchors were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups: the vertical simple stitch method (SS; n = 45) or the Bankart repair using modified Mason-Allen technique (BRUMA; n = 41). All patients underwent computed tomography arthrography at 6 months postoperatively and various functional outcome measurements at least 2 years postoperatively.

Depending on applications, many synthetic methods have been used to prepare these materials, which have found applications in different areas, including biology. However, the prominent nature of the associated toxicity and environmental concerns involved in most of these conventional methods have limited their continuous usage due to the desire for more clean, reliable, eco-friendly, and biologically appropriate approaches. Plant-mediated synthetic approaches for metal nanoparticles have emerged to circumvent the often-associated disadvantages with the conventional synthetic routes, using bioresources that act as a scaffold by effectively reducing and stabilizing these materials, whilst making them biocompatible for biological cells. This capacity by plants to intrinsically utilize their organic processes to reorganize inorganic metal ions into nanoparticles has thus led to extensive studies into this area of biochemical synthesis and analysis. In this review, we examined the use of several plant extracts as a mediating agent for the synthesis of different metal-based nanoparticles (MNPs). Furthermore, the associated biological properties, which have been suggested to emanate from the influence of the diverse metabolites found in these plants, were also reviewed.","output":"Plant Extracts Mediated Metal-Based Nanoparticles: Synthesis and Biological Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The use of telemedicine skyrocketed in March 2020 upon the implementation of the shelter-in-place measures. Within the past year, the shelter-in-place measures were lifted and the COVID-19 vaccine was released, resulting in many neurosurgeons returning to in-person outpatient clinics. Our goal is to determine the extent of usage of telemedicine in neurosurgery one year into the pandemic. Methods A retrospective cohort study of patients who received neurosurgical care at a single institution from February 1CApril 18 of the years 2020 and 2021 was performed. A total of 11,592 patients met the inclusion criteria. Of them, 1,465 patients underwent surgery, 7,083 were seen in clinic via an in-person meeting and 3,044 were assessed via telemedicine during the two study periods. Results At one year after the COVID-19 outbreak, telemedicine usage was at 81.3% of the initial volume upon the shelter-in-place measures implementation. In-person outpatient visits increased 40.2% from the early pandemic volume. Of the four divisions, telemedicine usage remained high in tumor and functional neurosurgery, significantly increased in vascular neurosurgery, and decreased in the spine division. Conclusion Telemedicine in neurosurgery clinics persisted one year after the COVID-19 outbreak. Even after the shelter-in-place measures were lifted, many neurosurgeons still use telemedicine, while the operative volume has remained stable. Due to the limited physical examination that can be performed via current telemedicine platforms, telemedicine use among spine providers is lower than the peak use during the early pandemic, while utilization has remained high among the tumor, vascular, and functional divisions.","output":"Telemedicine in Neurosurgery during the COVID-19 Outbreak: Where We Are One Year Later"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The long-term lockdown due to COVID-19 has beneficial impact on the natural environment. India has enforced a lockdown on 24th March 2020 and was subsequently extended in various phases. The lockdown due to the sudden spurt of the COVID-19 pandemic has shown a significant decline in concentration of air pollutants across India. The present article dealt with scenarios of air quality concentration of air pollutants, and effect on climatic variability during the COVID-19 lockdown period in Kolkata Metropolitan Area, India. The result showed that the air pollutants are significantly reduced and the air quality index (AQI) was improved during the lockdown months. Aerosol concentrations decreased by - 54.94% from the period of pre-lockdown. The major air pollutants like particulate matters (PM2.5, PM10), sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and Ozone (O3) were observed the maximum reduction ( - 40 to - 60%) in the COVID-19 lockdown period. The AQI has been improved by 54.94% in the lockdown period. On the other hand, Sen's slope rank and the Mann-Kendal trend test showed the daily decreased of air pollutants rate is - 0.051 to - 1.586 g /m3. The increasing trend of daily minimum, average, and maximum temperature from the month of March to May in this year (2020s) are 0.091, 0.118, and 0.106 C which is lowest than the 2016s to 2019s trend. Therefore, this research has an enormous opportunity to explain the effects of the lockdown on air quality and climate variability, and it can also be helpful for policymakers and decision-makers to enact appropriate measures to control air pollution.","output":"Have any effect of COVID-19 lockdown on environmental sustainability?

Little is known, however, about the degree to which meteorological conditions drive the daily dynamics of COVID-19 spread at a given location. The main limitation is that individual waves of the disease are typically abrupt and eventful, making correlations somewhat anecdotal. In contrast, we here present a long-term case study for the city of Buenos Aires, which has suffered a single prolonged wave of spread during 2020, with most significant changes in policy and population behavior taking place before the main local outbreak. We found that humidity plays a prominent role in modulating the variation of COVID-19 positive cases through a negative-slope linear relationship, with an optimal lag of 9 days between the meteorological observation and the positive case report. This relationship is specific to winter months, when relative humidity predicts up to half of the variance in positive cases. Our results provide a tool to anticipate local surges in COVID-19 cases after events of low humidity.

METHODS We performed genome-wide association analyses within 15 subgroups of breast cancer patients based on prognostic factors, including hormone receptors, tumor grade, age, and type of systemic treatment. Analyses were based on 91,686 female patients of European ancestry from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium, including 7531 breast cancer-specific deaths over a median follow-up of 8.1 years. Cox regression was used to assess associations of common germline variants with 15-year and 5-year breast cancer-specific survival. We assessed the probability of these associations being true positives via the Bayesian false discovery probability (BFDP < 0.15). RESULTS Evidence of associations with breast cancer-specific survival was observed in three patient subgroups, with variant rs5934618 in patients with grade 3 tumors (15-year-hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] 1.32 [1.20, 1.45], P = 1.4E-08, BFDP = 0.01, per G allele); variant rs4679741 in patients with ER-positive tumors treated with endocrine therapy (15-year-HR [95% CI] 1.18 [1.11, 1.26], P = 1.6E-07, BFDP = 0.09, per G allele); variants rs1106333 (15-year-HR [95% CI] 1.68 [1.39,2.03], P = 5.6E-08, BFDP = 0.12, per A allele) and rs78754389 (5-year-HR [95% CI] 1.79 [1.46,2.20], P = 1.7E-08, BFDP = 0.07, per A allele), in patients with ER-negative tumors treated with chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS We found evidence of four loci associated with breast cancer-specific survival within three patient subgroups. There was limited evidence for the existence of associations in other patient subgroups. However, the power for many subgroups is limited due to the low number of events. Even so, our results suggest that the impact of common germline genetic variants on breast cancer-specific survival might be limited.","output":"Association of germline genetic variants with breast cancer-specific survival in patient subgroups defined by clinic-pathological variables related to tumor biology and type of systemic treatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, government and public health officials have advocated three behaviors to help \\"flatten the curve\\" of the disease-staying-at-home, wearing face masks, and social distancing.

Here, we used diagnostic leukapheresis (DLA) to enrich CTCs from patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) and explored whether organoids provide a platform for ex vivo treatment modelling. METHODS We prospectively screened 102 patients with mPCa and performed DLA in 40 patients with 5 CTCs/7.5 mL blood. We enriched CTCs from DLA using white blood cell (WBC) depletion alone or combined with EpCAM selection. The enriched CTC samples were cultured in 3D to obtain organoids and used for downstream analyses. RESULTS The DLA procedure resulted in a median yield of 5312 CTCs as compared with 22 CTCs in 7.5 mL of blood. Using WBC depletion, we recovered 46% of the CTCs, which reduced to 12% with subsequent EpCAM selection. From the isolated and enriched CTC samples, organoid expansion succeeded in 35%. Successful organoid cultures contained significantly higher CTC numbers at initiation. Moreover, we performed treatment modelling in one organoid cell line and identified substantial tumour heterogeneity in CTCs using single cell DNA sequencing. CONCLUSIONS DLA is an efficient method to enrich CTCs, although the modest success rate of culturing CTCs precludes large scale clinical application. Our data do suggest that DLA and subsequent processing provides a rich source of viable tumour cells. Therefore, DLA offers a promising alternative to biopsy procedures to obtain sufficient number of tumour cells to study sequential samples in patients with mPCa.

We evaluated V?o(2)max attainment during incremental testing by testing for the definitive V?O(2) plateau using a linear least-squares regression approach. Peak oxygen uptake (V?o(2)peak) was considered statistically equivalent between tests if the 90% confidence interval around the mean difference was within 2.1 mlkg(?1)min(?1). Oxygen uptake plateaus were identified in 14 of 16 volunteers for visit 1 (87.5%) and all 16 volunteers for visit 2 (100%).

Interestingly, V?o(2)peak was equivalent, apparent from the mean difference in V?o(2)peak measures between visits for the incremental tests (0.0 mlkg(?1)min(?1) [?0.8 to 0.9]) but not the verification tests (?1.2 mlkg(?1)min(?1) [?2.2 to ?0.2]).

RESULTS: Fairly high levels of stress exposure and peritraumatic and general distress (depression, anxiety, and stress) were reported. Emotion regulation skills along with active and distraction coping emerged as the strongest predictors of lower distress levels. CONCLUSIONS: These results identify potential targets for online mental health interventions-focusing on engaging in adaptive emotion regulation and coping (e.g., through telehealth mental health first aid)-during the pandemic to offset the likely rise in distress over the months ahead.

METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional, anonymous survey of adult HCWs. Data collection was performed in May and June 2020, while governmental restrictions were in place. The participants completed the forms including six separate parts: personal and occupational information, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patients Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and COVID-like symptoms and Coronavirus RT-PCR status. RESULTS: Among the 372 HCW participants, 245 (66%) were women and mean age was 34.5  7.1 years (age range 23 to 58). The mean scores of all questionnaires except ISI were significantly higher in the HCWs with positive Coronavirus RT-PCR than another group (PSQI, 9  3.4 vs. 6.9  3.1; GAD-7, 9.8  3.6 vs. 7.9  5.3; PHQ-9, 12.8  6.1 vs. 9.5  6.4, P < 0.05; and ISI, 13.8  5.3 vs. 12.3  6 P = 0.163). Positive association between COVID-like symptoms and sleep and mood disturbances was found in the group without a positive test result. Analysis of questionnaires showed higher scores in the group directly involved except for ISI (P < 0.001 and P = 0.053 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the HCWs in this sample experienced a high rate of sleep and mood disturbances. There was also a strong association between sleep and mood disturbances and COVID-like symptoms in the group without a positive RT-PCR result. With all this considered, effective psychological support for HCWs during crisis seems to be necessary.","output":"Healthcare workers sleep and mood disturbances during COVID-19 outbreak in an Iranian referral center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How the hand and digits originated from fish fins during the Devonian fin-to-limb transition remains unsolved. Controversy in this conundrum stems from the scarcity of ontogenetic data from extant lobe-finned fishes. We report the patterning of an autopod-like domain by hoxa13 during fin development of the Australian lungfish, the most closely related extant fish relative of tetrapods. Differences from tetrapod limbs include the absence of digit-specific expansion of hoxd13 and hand2 and distal limitation of alx4 and pax9, which potentially evolved through an enhanced response to shh signaling in limbs. These developmental patterns indicate that the digit program originated in postaxial fin radials and later expanded anteriorly inside of a preexisting autopod-like domain during the evolution of limbs. Our findings provide a genetic framework for the transition of fins into limbs that supports the significance of classical models proposing a bending of the tetrapod metapterygial axis.","output":"Sarcopterygian fin ontogeny elucidates the origin of hands with digits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Early clinical severity assessments during the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic (pH1N1) overestimated clinical severity due to selection bias and other factors. We retrospectively investigated how to use data from the International Network for Strategic Initiatives in Global HIV Trials, a global clinical influenza research network, to make more accurate case fatality ratio (CFR) estimates early in a future pandemic, an essential part of pandemic response. METHODS: We estimated the CFR of medically attended influenza (CFR(MA)) as the product of probability of hospitalization given confirmed outpatient influenza and the probability of death given hospitalization with confirmed influenza for the pandemic (2009C2011) and post-pandemic (2012C2015) periods. We used literature survey results on health-seeking behavior to convert that estimate to CFR among all infected persons (CFR(AR)). RESULTS: During the pandemic period, 5.0% (3.1%C6.9%) of 561 pH1N1-positive outpatients were hospitalized. Of 282 pH1N1-positive inpatients, 8.5% (5.7%C12.6%) died. CFR(MA) for pH1N1 was 0.4% (0.2%C0.6%) in the pandemic period 2009C2011 but declined 5-fold in young adults during the post-pandemic period compared to the level of seasonal influenza in the post-pandemic period 2012C2015. CFR for influenza-negative patients did not change over time. We estimated the 2009 pandemic CFR(AR) to be 0.025%, 16-fold lower than CFR(MA). CONCLUSIONS: Data from a clinical research network yielded accurate pandemic severity estimates, including increased severity among younger people.

In this regard, the study used a detailed survey to collect the opinions of Turkish higher education students about the e-learning process during the spring term 2020 when the COVID 19 Pandemic began. For this purpose, 750 surveys were conducted over Google Forms with participant of higher education students from Turkey. The results of the research revealed the following findings. The majority of the participants stated that although distance education had some advantages, it was not a substitute for traditional education, and they could not achieve the same efficiency. The main reasons for this conclusion were inadequate infrastructure, Internet access problems and unfair competition caused by the lack of computer hardware, especially in the ongoing education throughout the country. Students also stressed the significance of online education and how it helped them to stick to their academic careers as they had no alternative other than following an online education system in the social isolation period of COVID-19 measures.","output":"Online Distance Learning During Covid-19 Pandemic: An Empirical Analysis Over the Students' Opinions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasing availability of the internet has resulted in the increased prevalence of problematic online behaviors.

Ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed the replication of MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in cultured cells. The 90% effective concentration (EC90) of ciclesonide for SARS-CoV-2 in differentiated human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells was 0.55 M. Eight consecutive passages of 43 SARS-CoV-2 isolates in the presence of ciclesonide generated 15 resistant mutants harboring single amino acid substitutions in nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) or nsp4. Of note, ciclesonide suppressed the replication of all these mutants by 90% or more, suggesting that these mutants cannot completely overcome ciclesonide blockade. Under a microscope, the viral RNA replication-transcription complex in cells, which is thought to be detectable using antibodies specific for nsp3 and double-stranded RNA, was observed to fall in the presence of ciclesonide in a concentration-dependent manner. These observations indicate that the suppressive effect of ciclesonide on viral replication is specific to coronaviruses, highlighting it as a candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.IMPORTANCE The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is ongoing. New and effective antiviral agents that combat the disease are needed urgently. Here, we found that an inhaled corticosteroid, ciclesonide, suppresses the replication of coronaviruses, including betacoronaviruses (murine hepatitis virus type 2 [MHV-2], MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) and an alphacoronavirus (human coronavirus 229E [HCoV-229E]), in cultured cells. Ciclesonide is safe; indeed, it can be administered to infants at high concentrations. Thus, ciclesonide is expected to be a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is effective against many members of the coronavirus family.

The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has affected millions of people worldwide and has triggered an unprecedented race for the development of diagnostic tests and therapeutical vaccines. These technologies require befitting measurements that underpin reliability and patient safety. The level of blood-borne antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is correlated initially with the extent of infection and subsequently with the degree of immunity attained. This renders their accurate measurement an important target for immunometric and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methods. Suitable reference materials and methods are being developed to ensure the reliability and consistency of such measurements. Solutions of purified monoclonal IgG may prove useful as primary calibrator materials for the development of calibration hierarchies for the measurement of blood-borne antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Bottom-up approaches can be applied to the quantification of such structurally complex large molecules. These consist of trypsin and Lys C digestion and quantification of the resulting proteotypic peptides as surrogate analytes for an IgG monoclonal antibody. Establishing the metrological traceability of this procedure requires peptides whose purity has been determined accurately, for example with quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR). The H-1 qNMR method allows for the mass fraction assignment of peptides by accurate quantification of H-1 resonance signals specific for both the peptide and for a certified reference material used as internal standard in the peptide solution.

Now, MAs are foundational to team-based care, interacting with patients, systems, and teams in many ways. The transition to Virtual Health during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a further rapid and unique shift of MA roles and responsibilities. We sought to understand the impact of this shift and to place their new roles in the context of national professional competency standards. METHODS: In this qualitative, grounded theory study we conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 MAs at 10 primary care sites at a major academic medical center on their experiences during the shift from in-person to virtual care. MAs were selected by convenience sample. Coding was done in Dedoose version 8.335. Consensus-based inductive and deductive approaches were used for interview analysis. Identified MA roles were compared to national MA, Institute of Medicine, physician, and nursing professional competency domains. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged: Role Apprehension, Role Expansion, and Adaptability/Professionalism. Nine key roles emerged in the context of virtual visits: direct patient care (pre-visit and physical care), panel management, health systems ambassador, care coordination, patient flow coordination, scribing, quality improvement, and technology support. While some prior MA roles were limited by the virtual care shift, the majority translated directly or expanded in virtual care. Identified roles aligned better with Institute of Medicine, physician, and nursing professional competencies, than current national MA curricula. CONCLUSIONS: The transition to Virtual Health decreased MA's direct clinical work and expanded other roles within interprofessional care, notably quality improvement and technology support. Comparison of the current MA roles with national training program competencies identified new leadership and teamwork competencies which could be expanded during MA training to better support MA roles on inter-professional teams.","output":"Transforming Interprofessional Roles During Virtual Health Care: The Evolving Role of the Medical Assistant, in Relationship to National Health Profession Competency Standards"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From staying quarantined at home, practicing work from home to moving outside wearing masks and carrying sanitizers, every individual has now become so adaptive to so called New Normal post series of lockdowns across the countries The situation triggered by novel Coronavirus has changed the behaviour of every individual towards every other living as well as non-living entity In the Wuhan city of China, multiple cases were reported of pneumonia caused due to unknown reasons The concerned medical authorities confirmed the cause to be Coronavirus The symptoms seen in these cases were not much different than those seen in case of pneumonia Earlier the research has been carried out in the field of pneumonia identification and classification through X-ray images of chest The difficulty in identifying Covid19 infection at initial stage is due to high resemblance of its symptoms with the infection caused due to pneumonia Hence it is trivial to well distinguish cases of coronavirus from pneumonia that may help in saving life of patients The paper uses chest X-ray images to identify Covid19 infection in lungs using machine learning classifiers and ensembles with Gray-Level Cooccurrence Matrix (GLCM) features The advocated methodology extracts statistical texture features from X-ray images by computing a GLCM for each image The matrix is computed by considering various stride combinations These GLCM features are used to train the machine learning classifiers and ensembles The paper explores both the multiclass classification (X-ray images are classified into one of the three classes namely Covid19 affected, Pneumonia affected and normal lungs) and binary classification (Covid19 affected and other) The dataset used for evaluating performance of the method is open sourced and can be accessed easily Proposed method being simple and computationally effective achieves noteworthy performance in terms of Accuracy, F-Measure, MCC, PPV and Sensitivity In sum, the best stride combination of GLCM and ensemble of machine learning classifiers is suggested as vital outcome of the proposed method for effective Covid19 identification from chest X-ray images","output":"Covid19 Identification from Chest X-ray Images Using Machine Learning Classifiers with GLCM Features"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a powerful tool to reveal the complex biological diversity and heterogeneity among cell populations.

However, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has forced many courses to adopt online modes of delivery, and anatomy is no exception. The question now is whether anatomy education has successfully made the transition to the digital space, particularly with respect to the perception of learners. Objective The current study seeks to understand how students view an online, introductory anatomy and physiology course. Traditional methods of course evaluation include Likert scales and open-ended responses;however, such methods fail to consider both the diversity of learners and the need for course-specific feedback. Thus, we used the emerging area of Q methodology as a tool for course evaluation. Hypothesis We hypothesize that Q methodology will enable us to uncover student opinions which are specifically relevant to their online course experience. Methods Q methodology can be used to identify groups of learners with shared perceptions, allowing educators to better understand and respond to the needs of students. Studies consist of three phases: survey instrument development, data collection, and analysis/interpretation. First, a list of opinion-based statements regarding anatomy education are selected. Next, students rank statements based on their level of agreement. Finally, rankings undergo a by-person factor analysis to categorize students into distinct groups with shared perceptions. Results Data was collected from 106 students at McMaster University. Factor analysis revealed three distinct subgroups within the cohort. Group 1 (n = 45) felt they needed more time on their evaluations and lectures did not cover an appropriate amount of content. Group 2 (n = 30) did not enjoy synchronous tutorials or labs. Group 3 (n = 21) overall was satisfied with course delivery. Certain perceptions were also shared among all three groups. There was a consensus among students that they generally disliked online learning compared to in-person learning, with particular concern surrounding the use of virtual specimens and bellringer exams. Students, however, appreciated the availability of asynchronous lectures as a mode of online content delivery. Age, sex, program, education history, and anticipated grade were not associated with cohort subgroupings. Conclusion Interestingly, results of this study recognize similar course strengths/limitations noted in in-person classes (e.g., value of in-person laboratories and assessment concerns reported elsewhere), but also highlight key areas of strength (asynchronous lectures) and limitation (use of digital resources) specific to the online environment, which will be important considerations for future online offerings.

Since the onset of the pandemic, the question of racial differences has been at the forefront of prognostic thought in determination of high-risk groups. Limited data is currently available about racial differences in symptoms of COVID-19. This research performed a retrospective data collection of patients in a hospital system in North Louisiana to determine if there was a statistical difference in presenting symptoms based on race. Methods: A total of 410 unique Medical Record Numbers (MRNs) were identified retrospectively. Data was collected from a mix of rapid and regular PCR nasal swabs collected from 4/1/2020 to 4/30/2020. Data collected included symptoms, race, ethnicity, occupation, sex and age. Symptoms were collected from their chief complaint, HPI, review of systems as well as nursing evaluation. Similar symptoms expressed in different wording were collapsed into larger categories. The rpart algorithm was used to perform association rule mining in both uncollapsed and collapsed data. Results: Black patients were the most represented race (74%) in our study. 399 patients were admitted with COVID-19 in April 2020. In Black patients, 306 were admitted (76.692%) compared to 79 White patients (19.799%). There were also significant differences on the basis of race between both the number of typical symptoms (Black=2.925 +- 2.067, White=2.367 +- 2.014, p=0.0330) and the more general collapsed categories of atypical symptoms (Black=1.036 +- 0.765, White=0.823 +- 0.844, p=0.026), but not concerning the number of atypical symptoms more specifically associated with COVID-19 (Black=0.428 +- 0.770, White=0.468 +- 0.749, p=0.589). This is concordant with our association rule mining results, which indicated that in Black patients, fever was frequently associated with myalgias, cough, and shortness of breath (lift=1.897) Conclusion: While evaluating the racial distribution of COVID-19 as it pertained to symptoms, Black patients were statistically more affected by COVID-19 in North Louisiana. Blacks make up 38% of the region's population but were 74% of the regions COVID-19 cases. This was not observed in South Louisiana. Additionally, Black patients were more likely to be admitted than their White counterparts and were likely to have both more typical and atypical symptoms at presentation. Further investigation into the corresponding factors such as issues like weight, comorbid conditions, and genetic polymorphisms for ACE-I tropism should be explored to illuminate the proposed racial selection that SARS2-COVID-19 demonstrates for those of African descent.","output":"77 Racial Disparity in COVID-19 Symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this contribution, we report on the possibility that cryptococcal protease(s) could activate the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. The S protein is documented to have a unique four-amino-acid sequence (underlined, SPRRARS) at the interface between the S1 and S2 sites, that serves as a cleavage site for the human protease, furin. We compared the biochemical efficiency of cryptococcal protease(s) and furin to mediate the proteolytic cleavage of the S1/S2 site in a fluorogenic peptide. We show that cryptococcal protease(s) processes this site in a manner comparable to the efficiency of furin (p > 0.581).

Given a central role of endothelial dysfunction and systemic inflammation, repurposing ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), statins, and aspirin has been of interest. In this retrospective, single-center study, we evaluated the primary outcomes of mortality and ICU admission in 587 hospitalized patients with documented COVID-19 with or without ACEIs, ARBs, statins, and aspirin. Atorvastatin was associated with reduced mortality, which persisted after adjusting for age, lockdown status, and other medications (OR: 0.18. 95% CI: 0.06-0.49, P = 0.001). ACEIs were also associated with reduced mortality in the crude model (OR: 0.20, CI: 0.06-0.66, P = 0.008), as ACEIs and ARBs were combined as a single group (OR: 0.35, CI: 0.16-0.75, P = 0.007), although ARBs alone did not reach statistical significance. There was no association between any medications and risk of ICU admission. Aspirin only achieved a significant association of reduced mortality in a subgroup of patients with diabetes in the crude model (OR: 0.17, CI: 0.04-0.80, P = 0.02). The reduced mortality observed with atorvastatin is consistent with other literature, and consideration should be given to atorvastatin as a COVID-19 treatment. While there was suggested benefit of ACEIs and ARBs in the present study, other studies are varied and further studies are warranted to recommend employing these medications as a treatment strategy. Nevertheless, this study combined with others continues to give credibility that ACEIs and ARBs are safe to continue in the setting of COVID-19.","output":"Associastion of In-hospital Use of Statins, Aspirin, and Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone Inhibitors with Mortality and ICU Admission Due to COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Started in China's Wuhan district late last year, the coronavirus outbreak has thrown several unprecedented challenges.

Its clinical effects in such patients have not been systematically reviewed, and may be more wide-ranging than expected. OBJECTIVES To summarize the evidence on the effects of PR fampridine in patients with MS. METHODS A systematic search of Pubmed, Scopus (including EMBASE), and PsycINFO (completed in 01/2019) was carried out to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT) that compared PR fampridine to placebo. When appropriate, data were pooled using a random-effects model, and standardized mean differences (SMD) were computed. Study quality was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. PRISMA guidelines were followed. All retrieved functional outcomes were categorized according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). RESULTS A total of 706 articles were screened for inclusion. Twenty RCTs involving 2616 patients met the eligibility criteria. Most studies were of good-to-excellent quality. PR fampridine administration resulted in significant benefits in relation to walking short distances (SMD: 1.23 (95% IC 0.65-1.81)) and perceived walking capacity (0.64 (0.27-1.02)). Its effects on muscle strength and middle-distance walking were not significant (0.53 (- 0.04 to 1.10) and 0.31 (- 0.18 to 0.80), respectively). No effect on higher-level cognitive functions (- 0.07 (- 0.58 to 0.45)) or hand and arm use (0.16 (- 0.33 to 0.64)) was observed. Individual studies reported effects on other outcomes across the ICF domains. CONCLUSIONS There is strong evidence that PR fampridine exerts strong effects on the ability to walk short distances and on perceived walking capacity.

Therefore, we analysed the association between apparent temperature and heat-related illnesses occurrence during international outdoor athletics championships and compared its incidence rates between athletics disciplines. Heat-related illnesses were selected from illness data prospectively collected at seven international outdoor athletics championships between 2009 and 2018 using a standardised methodology. The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) was calculated as a measure of the apparent temperature based on weather data for each day of the championships. Heat-related illness numbers and (daily) incidence rates were calculated and analysed in relation to the daily maximum UTCI temperature and between disciplines. During 50 championships days with UTCI temperatures between 15C and 37C, 132 heat-related illnesses were recorded. Average incidence rate of heat-related illnesses was 11.7 (95%CI 9.7 to 13.7) per 1000 registered athletes. The expected daily incidence rate of heat-related illnesses increased significantly with UTCI temperature (0.12 more illnesses per 1000 registered athletes/C; 95%CI 0.08-0.16), and was found to double from 25 to 35?C UTCI.

Over the past decade, the overall incidence of LVFWR has decreased given the advancements in reperfusion therapies. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant delay in hospital presentation of patients suffering myocardial infarctions, leading to a higher incidence of mechanical complications from myocardial infarctions such as LVFWR. Case Presentation We present a case in which a patient suffered a LVFWR as a mechanical complication from myocardial infarction due to delay in seeking care over fear of contracting COVID-19 from the medical setting. The patient had been having chest pain for a few days but refused to seek medical care due to fear of contracting COVID-19 from within the medical setting. He eventually suffered a cardiac arrest at home from a massive inferior myocardial infarction and found to be in cardiac tamponade from a left ventricular perforation. He was emergently taken to the operating room to attempt to repair the rupture but he ultimately expired on the operating table. Conclusions: The occurrence of LVFWR has been on a more significant rise over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic as patients delay seeking care over fear of contracting COVID-19 from within the medical setting. Clinicians should consider mechanical complications of MI when patients present as an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, as delay in seeking care is often the exacerbating factor.","output":"Left Ventricular Free Wall Rupture as a Result of Delayed Presentation of an Inferior ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Due to Fear of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed a critical challenge to the current oncology care and practices including late diagnoses, delayed anti-cancer treatment, and static clinical trials.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of single-stage endovascular treatment of multiple aneurysms with a combination of various endovascular techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty-three consecutive patients with multiple intracranial aneurysms who underwent single-stage endovascular treatment for 2 aneurysms from June 2011 to May 2016 were included in the study. Patient and aneurysm characteristics, treatment technique, complications, clinical and angiographic outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS 125 of 128 aneurysms (97.6%) were treated by the following endovascular techniques: simple coiling in 19, balloon-assisted coiling in 27, stent-assisted coiling in 33, flow diverters in 43, intrasaccular flow modifiers in 2, and a neck-bridging device in 1. Overall mortality and mortality directly related to the single-stage treatment was 15% (8/53) and 3.7% (2/53), respectively. Clinical and angiographic follow-up was available in 44 (83%) patients for 104 (83.2%) aneurysms for a mean duration of 16.2 months (range 3-51 months). According to the last angiographic follow-up, overall occlusion rates were complete in 85 (81.7%), near complete in 8 (7.6%), and incomplete in 11 (10.5%) aneurysms. CONCLUSIONS Single-stage endovascular treatment of multiple aneurysms with combined endovascular techniques is technically feasible and increases the treatment possibility of all detected aneurysms. However, the safety of the procedure is controversial due to relatively high complication rates. In particular, in patients with bilateral internal carotid artery aneurysms, staged therapy may be used instead of simultaneous treatment with flow diverters to avoid thromboembolic events.","output":"Single-stage endovascular treatment of multiple intracranial aneurysms with combined endovascular techniques: is it safe to treat all at once?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has enforced a shutdown of educative institutions of all levels, including high school and university students, and has forced educators and institutions to adapt teaching strategies in a hasty way.

In general, students reported that gamification was innovative, engaging, and an efficient strategy to deliver curricula material;moreover, it was perceived as a fun activity. Some students reported that gamified videoconferences aided to connect with their classmates during isolation time providing effective social support. However, some students reported a bad physical or psychological condition, as consequence of the confinement, and did not get involved in the activity. Some weaknesses of the reviewed studies are the small sample size and its homogeneity, which makes it difficult to generalize their results to other scenarios and academic areas. Furthermore, although there is a feeling of learning during the activity, this result is mainly based on subjective perceptions, and any of the studies demonstrated that superior learning was achieved in comparison with traditional teaching strategies.

METHODS: Cases were divided into a \\"no face mask\\" group if no face masks were worn by the physician or patient during intravitreal injections or a \\"universal face mask\\" group if face masks were worn by the physician, ancillary staff, and patient during intravitreal injections. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of endophthalmitis, microbial spectrum, and visual acuity (VA). RESULTS: Of 505 968 intravitreal injections administered in 110 547 eyes, 85 of 294 514 (0.0289%; 1 in 3464 injections) cases of presumed endophthalmitis occurred in the \\"no face mask\\" group, and 45 of 211 454 (0.0213%; 1 in 4699) cases occurred in the \\"universal face mask\\" group (odds ratio [OR], 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-1.18; P = 0.097).

The foxglove aphid (FA: Aulacorthum solani Kaltenbach) is an important insect pest that causes serious yield losses in soybean. The FA resistance gene Raso2 from wild soybean PI 366121 was previously mapped to a 13 cM interval on soybean chromosome 7. However, fine-mapping of Raso2 was needed to improve the effectiveness of marker-assisted selection (MAS) and to eventually clone it. The objectives of this study were to fine-map Raso2 from PI 366121 using Axiom? 180 K SoyaSNP array, to confirm the resistance and inheritance of Raso2 in a different background, and to identify candidate gene(s). The 105 F4:8 recombinant inbred lines were used to fine-map the gene and to test antibiosis and antixenosis of Raso2 to FA. These efforts resulted in the mapping of Raso2 on 1 cM interval which corresponds to 77 Kb containing eight annotated genes based on the Williams 82 reference genome assembly (Wm82.a2.v1). Interestingly, all nonsynonymous substitutions were in Glyma.07g077700 which encodes the disease resistance protein containing LRR domain and expression of the gene in PI 366121 was significantly higher than that in Williams 82. In addition, distinct SNPs within Glyma.07g077700 that can distinguish PI 366121 and diverse FA-susceptible soybeans were identified. We also confirmed that Raso2 presented the resistance to FA and the Mendelian inheritance for single dominant gene in a different background.

Automatic crowd density estimation is a technological solution that could help in guaranteeing social distancing by reducing the probability that two persons in a public area come in close proximity to each other while moving around. This paper proposes a novel low complexity RF sensing system for automatic people counting based on low cost UWB transceivers.

STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed data from United States residents in New Jersey, New York, and Washington who requested medication abortion from 3 family physicians using the online service from Aid Access between April and November 2020. This study seeks to examine individual characteristics, motivations, and geographic locations of patients receiving abortion care through the Aid Access platform. RESULTS: Over 7 months, three family physicians using the Aid Access platform provided medication abortion care to 534 residents of New Jersey, New York, and Washington. There were no demographic differences between patients seeking care in these states. A high percentage (85%) were less than 7 weeks gestation at the time of their request for care. The reasons patients chose Aid Access for abortion services were similar regardless of state residence. The majority (71%) of Aid Access users lived in urban areas. Each family physician provided care to most counties in their respective states. Among those who received services in the three states, almost one-quarter (24%) lived in high Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) counties, with roughly one-third living in medium-high SVI counties (33%), followed by another quarter (26%) living in medium-low SVI counties. CONCLUSIONS: Family physicians successfully provided medication abortion in three states using asynchronous online consultations and medications mailed directly to patients. IMPLICATIONS: Primary care patients are requesting direct-to-patient first trimester abortion services online. By providing abortion care online, a single provider can serve the entire state, thus greatly increasing geographic access to medication abortion.","output":"Family medicine provision of online medication abortion in three US states during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most abundant epigenetic modification of RNA, and its dysregulation drives aberrant transcription and translation programs that promote cancer occurrence and progression.

Understanding this counterintuitive concept can aid the design of new drugs that target m(6)A to potentially improve the outcomes of cancer immunotherapies. Here, we provide an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of how m(6)A modifications intrinsically affect immune cells and how alterations in tumor cell m(6)A modifications extrinsically affect immune cell responses in the tumor microenvironment (TME).

Strategies include: combining specific and efficient inhibitors against m(6)A regulators with immune checkpoint blockers; generating an effective programmable m(6)A gene-editing system that enables efficient manipulation of individual m(6)A sites; establishing an effective m(6)A modification system to enhance anti-tumor immune responses in T cells or natural killer cells; and using nanoparticles that specifically target tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to deliver messenger RNA or small interfering RNA of m(6)A-related molecules that repolarize TAMs, enabling them to remodel the TME. The goal of this review is to help the field understand how m(6)A modifications intrinsically and extrinsically shape immune responses in the TME so that better cancer immunotherapy can be designed and developed.","output":"Targeting the RNA m(6)A modification for cancer immunotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tailoring the surface properties of materials for biomedical applications is important to avoid clinical complications. Forming thin layers of amphiphilic molecules with apolar regions that facilitate attractive intermolecular interactions, can be a suitable and versatile approach to achieve hydrophobic surface modification and provide functional antibacterial properties. Aiming to correlate layer structure and properties starting from film formation, octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA) and dimethyloctadecyl (3-trimethoxysilylpropyl) ammonium chloride (DMOAP) layers were adsorbed onto smooth titania surfaces. Then the films were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and their interactions with aqueous environments were characterized by contact angle and zeta potential measurements. In addition, antibacterial assays were performed using E. coli and S. mutants to reveal the antibacterial properties effected by the surface modification. Immediately after sputter deposition, titania was hydrophilic; however, after air storage and adsorption of DMOAP or ODPA, an increase in the water contact angle was observed. XPS investigations after layer formation and after antibacterial tests revealed that the attachment of layers assembled from ODPA on titania substrates is considerably stronger and more stable than that observed for DMOAP films. Heat treatment strongly affects DMOAP layers. Furthermore, DMOAP layers are not stable under biological conditions.","output":"New details of assembling bioactive films from dispersions of amphiphilic molecules on titania surfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Changes in air transport networks over time may be induced by competition among carriers, changes in regulations on airline industry, and socioeconomic events such as terrorist attacks and epidemic outbreaks. Such network changes may reflect corporate strategies of each carrier. In the present study, we propose a framework for analyzing evolution patterns in temporal networks in discrete time from the viewpoint of recurrence. Recurrence implies that the network structure returns to one relatively close to that in the past. We applied the proposed methods to four major carriers in the US from 1987 to 2019. We found that the carriers were different in terms of speed of network evolution, strength of periodicity, and changes in these quantities across decades. We also found that the network structure of the individual carriers abruptly changes from time to time. Such a network change reflects changes in their operation at their hub airports rather than famous socioeconomic events that look closely related to airline industry. The proposed methods are expected to be useful for revealing, for example, evolution of airline alliances and responses to natural disasters or infectious diseases, as well as characterizing evolution of social, biological, and other networks over time.","output":"Recurrence in the evolution of air transport networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors rapidly transitioned an in-person, learner-led medical education journal club (MEJC) to the virtual environment.

METHODS: We sent an 18-item survey to 1,213 patients who underwent elective hand and upper extremity surgery at 1 academic institution from October 2020 to January 2021. The survey consisted of questions related to patient demographics, treatment delays due to COVID-19, and patient perceptions of COVID-19 precautions. Descriptive statistics were performed to analyze the survey responses. Responses for patients aged 18C50 and 51+ were compared using a chi-square analysis for categorical variables and a Student t-test for continuous variables. RESULTS: Out of 1,213 invitations, 384 survey respondents completed the survey (31.6%). Of the respondents, 16.8% reported delaying medical treatment for an average of 123.2 days because of COVID-19. The preventative measures were found to be adequate by 95% of patients. Only 2.6% of patients reported experiencing surgical delays due to preoperative COVID-19 testing or other COVID-19-related precautions. COVID-19 testing was seen as necessary by 88% of patients, and 74% did not find COVID-19 testing to be a barrier to their surgery. Patients aged 51+ were more likely to delay seeking medical treatment than younger patients (19.3% vs 9.1%, respectively). Furthermore, those that did delay seeking treatment waited longer on average than their younger counterparts (136.1 vs 72.9 days, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, patients undergoing hand and upper extremity surgery typically do not find COVID-19 precautions to be a significant barrier to care and understand their importance. Despite this, many patients, particularly older ones, are delaying medical care for extended periods of time. It is important for hand surgeons to acknowledge their patients perspectives and work to educate patients on evolving surgical safety guidelines.

Vector-borne infections are gaining significance because of increasing travel and import of pets from abroad as well as the changing climate in Europe. The main objective of this study was to assess the percentage of cats with positive test results for selected vector-borne pathogens in Germany and explore any possible association of such results with time spent abroad. METHODS: This retrospective study included test results from cats included in the Feline Travel Profile established by the LABOKLIN laboratory at the request of veterinarians in Germany between April 2012 and March 2020. This diagnostic panel includes the direct detection of Hepatozoon spp. and Dirofilaria spp. via PCR as well as indirect detection assays (IFAT) for Ehrlichia spp. and Leishmania spp. The panel was expanded to include an IFAT for Rickettsia spp. from July 2015 onwards. RESULTS: A total of 624 cats were tested using the Feline Travel Profile. Serum for indirect detection assays was available for all 624 cats; EDTA samples for direct detection methods were available from 618 cats. Positive test results were as follows: Ehrlichia spp. IFAT 73 out of 624 (12%), Leishmania spp. IFAT 22 out of 624 (4%), Hepatozoon spp. PCR 53 out of 618 (9%), Dirofilaria spp. PCR 1 out of 618 cats (0.2%), and Rickettsia spp. IFAT 52 out of 467 cats (11%) tested from July 2015 onwards. Three cats had positive test results for more than one pathogen before 2015. After testing for Rickettsia spp. was included in 2015, 19 cats had positive test results for more than one pathogen (Rickettsia spp. were involved in 14 out of these 19 cats). CONCLUSIONS: At least one pathogen could be detected in 175 out of 624 cats (28%) via indirect and/or direct detection methods. Four percent had positive test results for more than one pathogen.

In this work we describe the tissue distribution of fAGPrP during FIP, and its relationship with feline coronavirus (FCoV) and myeloid cells. Tissues from five control cats and from 15 cats with FIP were examined by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against human AGP, FCoV and myeloid antigens. Diffuse fAGPrP positivity within the lesions, likely due to vascular plasma leakage, endothelial and epithelial lining were detectable. Compared to controls, fAGPrP-expressing cells often increased in number and were diffusely distributed in lymph nodes, as usually occurs for IgM-producing plasma cells during early immune responses. These findings did not depend on the presence of FCoVs or of myeloid cells, suggesting that fAGPrP is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of FIP.","output":"Tissue distribution of a feline AGP related protein (fAGPrP) in cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review provides an update on the immunopathogenesis of tuberculous pericarditis (TBP), investigations to confirm tuberculous etiology, the limitations of anti-tuberculous therapy (ATT), and recent efficacy trials. RECENT FINDINGS: A profibrotic immune response characterizes TBP, with low levels of AcSDKP, high levels of -interferon and IL-10 in the pericardium, and high levels of TGF- and IL-10 in the blood. These findings may have implications for future therapeutic targets. Despite advances in nucleic acid amplification approaches, these tests remain disappointing for TBP. Trials of corticosteroids and colchicine have had mixed results, with no impact on mortality, evidence of a reduction in rates of constrictive pericarditis and potential harm in those with advanced HIV. Small studies suggest that ATT penetrates the pericardium poorly. Given that there is a close association between high bacillary burden and mortality, a rethink about the optimal drug doses and duration may be required. SUMMARY: The high mortality and morbidity from TBP despite use of anti-tuberculous drugs call for researches targeting host-directed immunological determinants of treatment outcome.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) complicates up to 10% of pulmonary blastomycosis in hospitalized patients and carries a mortality of 50-90%. This report describes the clinical course of four consecutive patients with blastomycosis-related ARDS treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during 2009-2014. CLINICAL FEATURES: Four adults were referred from northwestern Ontario, Canada with progressive respiratory illnesses. All patients developed diffuse bilateral opacities on chest radiography and required mechanical ventilation within 6-72 hr. Patients satisfied Berlin criteria for severe ARDS with trough P(a)O(2)/F(i)O(2) ratios of 44-61 on positive end-expiratory pressure of 12-24 cm H(2)O. Wet mount microscopy from respiratory samples showed broad-based yeast consistent with B.dermatitidis. Despite lung protective ventilation strategies with maximal F(i)O(2) (patients A-D), neuromuscular blockade (patients A-D), inhaled nitric oxide (patients A and D), and prone positioning (patient D), progressive hypoxemia resulted in initiation of venovenous ECMO by hours 24-90 of mechanical ventilation with subsequent de-escalation of ventilatory support. In all four cases, ECMO decannulation was performed (7-23 days), mechanical ventilation was withdrawn (18-52 days), and the patients survived to hospital discharge (31-87 days). CONCLUSION: This report describes the successful application of ECMO as rescue therapy in aid of four patients with refractory blastomycosis-associated ARDS. In addition to early appropriate antimicrobial therapy, transfer to an institution experienced with ECMO should be considered when caring for patients from endemic areas with rapidly progressive respiratory failure.","output":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for blastomycosis-related acute respiratory distress syndrome: a case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the association between ventilator type and hospital mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to COVID-19 (SARS-CoV2 infection), a single-center prospective observational study in France. RESULTS: We prospectively included consecutive adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a university-affiliated tertiary hospital for ARDS related to proven COVID-19, between March 2020 and July 2021. All patients were intubated. We compared two patient groups defined by whether an ICU ventilator or a less sophisticated ventilator such as a sophisticated turbine-based transport ventilator was used. KaplanCMeier survival curves were plotted. Cox multivariate regression was performed to identify associations between patient characteristics and hospital mortality. We included 189 patients (140 [74.1%] men) with a median age of 65 years [IQR, 55C73], of whom 61 (32.3%) died before hospital discharge. By multivariate analysis, factors associated with in-hospital mortality were age  70 years (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.24C3.59; P = 0.006), immunodeficiency (HR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.16C5.09; P = 0.02) and serum creatinine  100 mol/L (HR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.77C5.10; P < 0.001) but not ventilator type. As compared to conventional ICU (equipped with ICU and anesthesiology ventilators), management in transient ICU (equipped with non-ICU turbine-based ventilators) was associated neither with a longer duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (18 [IQR, 11C32] vs. 21 [13C37] days, respectively; P = 0.39) nor with a longer ICU stay (24 [IQR, 14C40] vs. 27 [15C44] days, respectively; P = 0.44). CONCLUSIONS: In ventilated patients with ARDS due to COVID-19, management in transient ICU equipped with non-ICU sophisticated turbine-based ventilators was not associated with worse outcomes compared to standard ICU, equipped with ICU ventilators. Although our study design is not powered to demonstrate any difference in outcome, our results after adjustment do not suggest any signal of harm when using these transport type ventilators as an alternative to ICU ventilators during COVID-19 surge.

A recombinant nucleocapsid antigen specifically captures SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patient specimens. A labelled anti-human IgA reveals the bound IgA fraction. A dual colorimetric and chemiluminescence detection enables the affordable and ultrasensitive determination of IgA to SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, a simple smartphone-camera-based device measures the colour signal provided by nanogold-labelled anti-human IgA. For the ultrasensitive chemiluminescence transduction, we used a contact imaging portable device based on cooled CCD, and measured the light signal resulting from the reaction of the HRP-labelled anti-human IgA with a H2O2/luminol/enhancers substrate. A total of 25 serum and 9 saliva samples from infected and/or recovered individuals were analysed by the colorimetric LFIA, which was sensitive and reproducible enough for the semi-quantification of IgA in subjects with a strong serological response and in the early stage of COVID-19 infection. Switching to CL detection, the same immunosensor exhibited higher detection capability, revealing the presence of salivary IgA in infected individuals. For the patients included in the study (n = 4), the level of salivary IgA correlated with the time elapsed from diagnosis and with the severity of the disease. This IgA-LFIA immunosensor could be useful for noninvasively monitoring early immune responses to COVID-19 and for investigating the diagnostic/prognostic utility of salivary IgA in the context of large-scale screening to assess the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","output":"Dual lateral flow optical/chemiluminescence immunosensors for the rapid detection of salivary and serum IgA in patients with COVID-19 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Article explores the role of investment law and investment arbitration in (and after) the COVID-19 crisis in the context of transnational health policy This Article discusses a technical possibility (COVID-19 measures can give rise to investor-state disputes) and explains why most of these claims will probably not be successful (most COVID-19 measures are covered by international defenses) Through a comprehensive survey of measures adopted across 50 jurisdictions, the Article shows that most of these measures are in line with the World Health Organization regulations Furthermore, these domestic measures could be subject to a number of international law exceptions, allowing States to justify the potential violations Nevertheless, the Article identifies a minority of measures that may have the potential to lead to successful claims Paradoxically, the most problematic measures (such as taxation measures and sovereign debt increase) only indirectly address the pandemic","output":"Both Possible and Improbable-could Covid-19 Measures Give Rise to Investor-state Disputes?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has had significant negative impacts on financial markets, including energy stock markets However, recently proposed and implemented green recovery plans may mean that clean energy firms demonstrate better performance than fossil fuel firms after the pandemic As more voices call for the update of clean energy, theory on investor attention suggests investors will pay more attention to the potential to invest in clean energy stocks Using a sample period of eight weeks before and during the pandemic, we find that the negative impact of the outbreak on both clean energy and fossil fuel firms is more significant for fossil fuel firms Our results further show that during the pandemic there have been improved returns for clean energy firms as a consequence of investor attention, but not for fossil fuel firms Our findings provide empirical evidence for the advantages of green recovery schemes in influencing financial markets, especially for clean energy stocks These results suggest there are benefits for further promotion and implementation of green recovery stimulus measures post-pandemic","output":"The impact of investor attention during COVID-19 on investment in clean energy versus fossil fuel firms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This essay describes several resonances between psychoanalysis and Argentine tango.

This has led to substantial interest in their test, trace, isolate strategy. However, it is important to understand the epidemiological peculiarities of South Koreas outbreak and characterise their response before attempting to emulate these measures elsewhere. METHODS: We systematically extracted numbers of suspected cases tested, PCR-confirmed cases, deaths, isolated confirmed cases, and numbers of confirmed cases with an identified epidemiological link from publicly available data. We estimated the time-varying reproduction number, R(t), using an established Bayesian framework, and reviewed the package of interventions implemented by South Korea using our extracted data, plus published literature and government sources. RESULTS: We estimated that after the initial rapid growth in cases, R(t) dropped below one in early April before increasing to a maximum of 1.94 (95%CrI, 1.64C2.27) in May following outbreaks in Seoul Metropolitan Region. By mid-June, R(t) was back below one where it remained until the end of our study (July 13th). Despite less stringent lockdown measures, strong social distancing measures were implemented in high-incidence areas and studies measured a considerable national decrease in movement in late February. Testing the capacity was swiftly increased, and protocols were in place to isolate suspected and confirmed cases quickly; however, we could not estimate the delay to isolation using our data. Accounting for just 10% of cases, individual case-based contact tracing picked up a relatively minor proportion of total cases, with cluster investigations accounting for 66%. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst early adoption of testing and contact tracing is likely to be important for South Koreas successful outbreak control, other factors including regional implementation of strong social distancing measures likely also contributed. The high volume of testing and the low number of deaths suggest that South Korea experienced a small epidemic relative to other countries. Caution is needed in attempting to replicate the South Korean response in populations with larger more geographically widespread epidemics where finding, testing, and isolating cases that are linked to clusters may be more difficult.","output":"Response to COVID-19 in South Korea and implications for lifting stringent interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nitric oxide, NO, has been explored as a therapeutic agent to treat thrombosis. In particular, NO has potential in treating mechanical device-associated thrombosis due to its ability to reduce platelet activation and due to the central role of platelet activation and adhesion in device thrombosis. Nitrite is a unique NO donor that reduces platelet activation in that it's activity requires the presence of red blood cells whereas NO activity of other NO donors is blunted by red blood cells. Interestingly, we have previously shown that red blood cell mediated inhibition of platelet activation by adenosine diphosophate (ADP) is dramatically enhanced by illumination with far-red light that is likely due to photolysis of red cell surface bound NO congeners. We now report the effects of nitrite, far-red light, and their combination on several measure of blood coagulation using a variety of agonists. We employed turbidity assays in platelet rich plasma, platelet activation using flow cytometry analysis of a fluorescently labeled antibody to the activated platelet fibrinogen binding site, multiplate impedance-based platelet aggregometry, and assessment of platelet adhesion to collagen coated flow-through microslides. In all cases, the combination of far-red light and nitrite treatment decreased measures of coagulation, but in some cases mono-treatment with nitrite or light alone had no effect. Perhaps most relevant to device thrombosis, we observed that platelet adhesions was inhibited by the combination of nitrite and light treatment while nitrite alone and far-red light alone trended to decrease adhesion, but the results were mixed. These results support the potential of combined far-red light and nitrite treatment for preventing thrombosis in extra-corporeal or shallow-tissue depth devices where the far-red light can penetrate. Such a combined treatment could be advantageous due to the localized treatment afforded by far-red light illumination with minimal systemic effects.

In total, seven interviews with 12 parents and eight focus groups with 58 parents and two caregivers were conducted in four European countries. We found that parents request more positive information with a focus on quality of life and what the children can achieve rather than solely on the negative aspects and limitations of the congenital anomaly. Some parents also highlighted discrepancies between the family's need for support and the lack of support received from the local authority. Finally, it was challenging for the parents to address specific research priorities.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of HSCT recipients with HRV infection from the time molecular detection methods were implemented at our institution in 2008. Factors associated with proven or possible HRV pneumonia at the first HRV detection were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. We then characterized all episodes of proven and possible HRV pneumonia from the initial HRV infection through a 1-year follow-up period. RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2011, 63 HSCT recipients had  1 documented HRV infections. At first HRV detection, 36 (57%) patients had HRV URI and 27 (43%) had proven or possible HRV pneumonia; in multivariate analysis, hypoalbuminemia (odds ratio [OR] 9.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3C71.7; P=0.03) and isolation of respiratory co-pathogen(s) (OR 24.2, 95%CI 2.0C288.4; P=0.01) were independently associated with pneumonia. During the study period, 22 patients had 25 episodes of proven HRV pneumonia. Fever (60%), cough (92%), sputum production (61%), and dyspnea (60%) were common symptoms. Fifteen (60%) episodes demonstrated bacterial (n=n=7), fungal (n=n=5), or viral (n=n=3) co-infection. Among the remaining 10 (40%) cases of HRV monoinfection, patients oxygen saturations ranged from 80% to 97% on ambient air, and computed tomography scans showed peribronchiolar, patchy, ground glass infiltrates. CONCLUSIONS: HRV pneumonia is relatively common after HSCT and frequently accompanied by bacterial co-infection. As use of molecular assays for respiratory viral diagnosis becomes widespread, HRV will be increasingly recognized as a significant cause of pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts.","output":"Human rhinovirus infections of the lower respiratory tract in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) of biomedical images assists physicians for a fast facilitated tissue characterization. A scheme based on combining fuzzy logic (FL) and deep learning (DL) for automatic semantic segmentation (SS) of tumors in breast ultrasound (BUS) images is proposed. The proposed scheme consists of two steps: the first is a FL based preprocessing, and the second is a Convolutional neural network (CNN) based SS. Eight well-known CNN based SS models have been utilized in the study. Studying the scheme was by a dataset of 400 cancerous BUS images and their corresponding 400 ground truth images. SS process has been applied in two modes: batch and one by one image processing. Three quantitative performance evaluation metrics have been utilized: global accuracy (GA), mean Jaccard Index (mean intersection over union (IoU)), and mean BF (Boundary F1) Score. In the batch processing mode: quantitative metrics average results over the eight utilized CNNs based SS models over the 400 cancerous BUS images were: 95.45% GA instead of 86.08% without applying fuzzy preprocessing step, 78.70% mean IoU instead of 49.61%, and 68.08% mean BF score instead of 42.63%. Moreover, the resulted segmented images could show tumors regions more accurate than with only CNN based SS. While, in one by one image processing mode: there has been no enhancement neither qualitatively nor quantitatively. So, only when a batch processing is needed, utilizing the proposed scheme may be helpful in enhancing automatic ss of tumors in BUS images. Otherwise applying the proposed approach on a one-by-one image mode will disrupt segmentations efficiency. The proposed batch processing scheme may be generalized for an enhanced CNN based SS of a targeted region of interest (ROI) in any batch of digital images.

We conducted polymerase chain reaction for detecting CAdV-2 and other related pathogens in 224 rectal swabs of pet dogs and the co-infection of canine diseases was also analyzed. In addition, the structural protein genesFiber, Hexon, and Pentonof the isolated CAdV-2 strains were sequenced and analyzed. The similarity between Hexon and Penton among the 19 strains was 97.4%, as revealed by sequence alignment. Multiple sequence alignment results showed that the Fiber gene sequences of these CAdV-2 strains shared 97.4C99.8% nucleotide and 94.1C99.3% amino acid identity with reference sequences and shared only 79.0C80.5% nucleotide and 77.3C80.5% amino acid identity with the vaccine strain CLL, indicating that Fiber harbored most of the variant sites. Furthermore, pairwise sequence comparisons of Hexon of CH-JS-1901 and CH-HN-1801 with that of India2006 revealed a novel genotype. Furthermore, protein model prediction showed that the amino acid mutation of fiber protein in 19 strains was located in the head region, that may cause structural changes on the surface of the fiber protein.

It is an important consequence of the aging adult population, generating a plethora of spine-related interventions with variable treatment efficacy and consistently high costs. Recent years have witnessed more than a threefold increase in the prevalence and treatment of ASD, and further increases over the coming decades are expected with the growing elderly population worldwide. The ability to monitor and assess clinical outcomes has not kept pace with these developments. This paper addresses the pressing need to provide a set of common outcome metrics for this growing group of patients with back pain and other disabilities due to an adult spinal deformity. METHODS: The standard outcome set was created by a panel with global representation, using a thorough modified Delphi procedure. The three-tiered outcome hierarchy (Porter) was used as a framework to capture full cycle of care. The standardized language of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (WHO-ICF) was used. RESULTS: Consensus was reached on a core set of 25 WHO-ICF outcome domains ('What to measure'); on the accompanying globally available clinician and patient reported measurement instruments and definitions ('How to measure'), and on the timing of the measurements ('When to measure'). The current work has brought to light domains not routinely reported in the spinal literature (such as pulmonary function, return to work, social participation), and domains for which no adequate instruments have yet been identified (such as how to clinically quantify in routine practice lumbar spinal stenosis, neurogenic claudication, radicular pain, and loss of lower extremity motor function). CONCLUSION: A standard outcome set was developed for patients undergoing treatment for adult spinal deformity using globally available outcome metrics. The current framework can be considered a reference for further work, and may provide a starting point for routine methodical and systematic monitoring of outcomes.

The NTL is generally used as a proxy for economic activity. First, six parameters were proposed to quantify and monitor the operation status based on NTL data. Subsequently, these parameters were calculated for the parks and for 10 km buffer zones surrounding them to analyze the differences in operating conditions. The results showed that (1) despite the negative impact of COVID-19, 9 out of the 12 parks had a mean NTL greater than 1, indicating that these parks are in better operating condition in 2020 than 2019;(2) 7 out of the 10 km buffer zones around the parks showed a decline in mean NTL.

The impacts of COVID-19 pandemic and symptoms of pregnant status are highly linked with prenatal anxiety. Whereas, self-efficacy and support from family and friends could attenuate the development of prenatal anxiety. Thus, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the prevalence of prenatal anxiety and its influence factors among pregnant women during the pandemic of COVID-19 in Shenyang, China. METHODS: A cross-sectional study with face-to-face interview between April 24, 2020 and May 3, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic was applied among pregnant women in Shenyang Womens and Childrens Hospital. Chi-square tests were calculated to determine the differences in prenatal anxiety among categorical variables. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to investigate the risk factors of prenatal anxiety. RESULTS: The percentage of prenatal anxiety (GAD-7 score  7) among pregnant women during the pandemic of COVID-19 was 34/304 (11.18%). Logistic regression indicated that vomiting (OR 4.454, 95% CI 1.113C17.821) and feeling susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR 2.966, 95% CI 1.151C7.642) increased the odds of prenatal anxiety. Satisfaction with medical care (OR 0.303, 95% CI 0.113C0.813) and self-efficacy (OR 0.253, 95% CI 0.100C0.639) decreased the odds of prenatal anxiety. High monthly income (OR 0.246, 95% CI 0.078 ~ 0.780) reduced the chances of suffering from prenatal anxiety. CONCLUSION: The pregnant women in China exerted a higher prevalence of prenatal anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic than that without COVID-19 pandemic. Effective management on symptoms of pregnant status should be delivered to relieve prenatal anxiety for the pregnant women. Furthermore, interventions on self-efficacy enhancement and high-quality medical prenatal care should be provided to prevent from the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduce prenatal anxiety.","output":"Prenatal anxiety and the associated factors among Chinese pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemica smartphone questionnaire survey study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To prospectively assess the early changes in the quadriceps and patellar tendons before and after total knee arthroplasty using ultrasound, shear wave elastography, and X-rays.

Improved identification and management of neonates with potentially life-threatening illness is critical to meet the WHOs target of 12 neonatal deaths per 1000 live births by 2035. We developed an interactive (two-way) short messaging service (SMS) communication intervention, Mobile Solutions for Neonatal Health (Mobile womens and childrens health (WACh) NEO), focused on the perinatal period. Mobile WACh NEO sends automated tailored SMS messages to mothers during pregnancy and up to 6 weeks post partum. Messages employ the Information-Motivation-Behaviour Skills framework to promote (1) maternal implementation of essential newborn care (ENC, including early, exclusive breast feeding, cord care and thermal care), (2) maternal identification of neonatal danger signs and care-seeking, and (3) maternal social support and self-efficacy. Participants can also send SMS to the study nurse, enabling on-demand remote support. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We describe a two-arm unblinded randomised controlled trial of the Mobile WACh NEO intervention. We will enrol 5000 pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy at 4 facilities in Kenya and randomise them 1:1 to receive interactive SMS or no SMS (control), and conduct follow-up visits at 2 and 6 weeks post partum.

The control of food prices and managing physical distancing reduces suspected coronavirus cases; however, it negatively affects the services sector's value share. The smart lockdown and sound economic activities do not decrease coronavirus cases, while they support increasing the percentage of the services sector to the global GDP. The innovation accounting matrix suggested that smart lockdown, managing physical distancing, effective price control, and sound financial activities will help to reduce coronavirus cases that will further translate into increased services value-added for the next ten years. The social distancing will exert a more considerable variance error shock to the services industry, which indicates the viability of these measures to contained novel coronavirus over a time horizon. The study used the number of proxies to the COVID-19 measures on the service sector that can be continued with real-time variables to obtain more inferences.","output":"Nationwide Lockdown, Population Density, and Financial Distress Brings Inadequacy to Manage COVID-19: Leading the Services Sector into the Trajectory of Global Depression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polysorbate 20 (PS20) is a commonly used surfactant in biopharmaceutical formulations. It is a heterogeneous surfactant containing a distribution of fatty acid esters, which are subject to hydrolytic degradation, generating free fatty acids (FFAs). The FFAs can form visible or subvisible particles in drug product on stability. A previous FFA solubility model, developed by our group, predicts solubility limits for the three most prevalent FFA degradation products of PS20: lauric, myristic, and palmitic acid. The model takes into account two formulation parameters, pH and PS20 concentration, and their effect on FFA solubility. This work identifies a third parameter that has an impact on FFA solubility: PS20 ester distribution. When PS20 is hydrolytically degraded, the ester distribution of the remaining surfactant changes on stability. Ester distribution is known to influence the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of PS20 such that the monoesters have a much higher CMC compared to the higher-order esters (HOE). We hypothesize that as PS20 degrades, the CMC changes, affecting the proportion of PS20 that is present in micelles and capable of sequestering and solubilizing FFAs in these micelles. Here, PS20 was separated into monoester, HOE, and polyol fractions. The monoester and HOE fractions were mixed together to generate the mock degradation profiles of hydrolytically degraded PS20. FFA solubility was measured as a function of the concentration of these mock-degraded (MD) PS20s. The results indicate that ester distribution does have an impact on FFA solubility, especially at higher MD PS20 concentrations. HOEs solubilize up to 30 g/mL more lauric acid than an equivalent amount of monoesters at a MD PS20 level of 0.06% w/v. With the addition of % HOE peak area fraction as a third parameter representing the ester distribution of PS20, the refined FFA solubility model more accurately predicts FFA solubility in protein formulations at 5 C. The refined model suggests that drug products containing trace levels of host cell proteins (HCPs) that preferentially degrade HOEs of PS20 are at a higher risk of particle formation.","output":"Improving Prediction of Free Fatty Acid Particle Formation in Biopharmaceutical Drug Products: Incorporating Ester Distribution during Polysorbate 20 Degradation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Optimal treatment of patients with intracranial subocclusive thrombus remains unclear. Such a rare case successfully managed with endovascular mechanical thrombectomy is presented. A 71-year-old man experienced a sudden onset of dysarthria and motor deficits. At the time of admission his National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 4. DWI demonstrated incomplete infarction within the left lenticulostriate artery (LSA) territory, MRA showed partial flow defect in the distal left M1 segment and non-visualization of the LSA, and ECG revealed atrial fibrillation, thus ischemic stroke caused by cardiogenic embolism was diagnosed. Tissue plasminogen activator was administered, but symptoms progressed and NIHSS score increased up to 8. Diagnostic angiogrpahy confirmed presence of the subocclusive thrombus within the distal left M1 segment and complete occlusion of LSA at its origin. Since conservative therapy was ineffective, mechanical thrombectomy utilizing ADAPT (a direct aspiration first-pass thrombectomy) technique was performed resulting in compete recanalization of the LSA accompanied by the prompt regress of neurological symptoms. Eventally, the patient demonstrated nearly full recovery (modified Rankin Scale score 1). Thus, mechanical thrombectomy should be considered as a reasonable option in cases of acute cerebral stroke caused by subocclusive thrombus and progressive neurological deficits despite standard conservative therapy.

Further, ethnoracial status' intersectionality with other identity variables (e.g., gender) may relate to structural barriers to care and effectiveness of care, an area in need of further research. METHOD: The Florida State University Psychology Clinic, a low-cost population-facing treatment center, has routinely collected clinically relevant information on all consenting clients, including severity of clinical presentation at intake and over time, number of therapy sessions attended and of no-shows, premature termination, demographics, etc. A large sample of clients (N = 2,076; 57% women; 67.9% non-Hispanic White) on whom we collected and entered at least some data, though missing data were common, has accrued. We conducted chi-square tests to examine treatment utilization gaps, analysis of variance to measure differences in intake severity, and analysis of covariance to measure differences in treatment effectiveness. RESULTS: Based on the percentages of ethnoracial minority groups with mental disorders in the broader local community, we are falling short in outreach to Black clients, and when we do engage them, we retain them suboptimally. Once well engaged, however, results across groups suggest few differences in outcomes by ethnoracial status, gender, or their intersection. Ethnoracial match was associated with more sessions attended in Black people.

These changes affected their situation in the labour market. Purpose of the article: The aim of the study is to assess changes in the situation in the labour market in the EU with particular emphasis on the post-communist countries in the period 2002-2019. Methods: The situation of countries in the European labour market was estimated using the TOPSIS method. A similarity matrix of changes in the composite variable for each country was then constructed using the Dynamic Time Warping method. On its basis, homogeneous clusters of countries were determined using the Ward's method. Findings & value added: Four homogenous clusters of countries were formed. The post-communist ones belonged to two groups. In one, there were two countries Croatia and Slovakia. The rest of the post-communist countries were in a large cluster, which also included Germany, Malta, Finland. Portugal. France and Belgium. Changes of the situation in the post-communist countries in this group improved very much during the analysed period (this was particularly evident for Czechia, Estonia and Poland). It is interesting to investigate whether the reaction of labour markets to changes in the global economic situation in post-communist countries is similar to that in the old EU countries. The similarity of changes can be measured using lie DTW method. There is an empirical research gap in this respect. Therefore, the added value is the use of this method in assessing similarities of changes in the labour market situation in post-communist countries in comparison to the Western European ones.","output":"Comparison of changes in the labour markets of post-communist countries with other EU member states"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite comprising 70% of the health workforce, women fill only 25% of senior and 5% of top health organization positions.

Data on the safety of inducing transient further anemia and the benefits of IHD-RCE is limited and occasionally contradictory. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS In this retrospective crossover analysis of six patients with SCD who underwent chronic exchange with standard RCE (Cobe Spectra) followed by IHD-RCE (Spectra Optia), we compared safety and benefit outcomes with IHD-RCE vs standard RCE. RESULTS There were statistically but not clinically significant drops in blood pressure in the post-IHD phase. With IHD-RCE, there were significant reductions in red blood cell (RBC) usage and/or lower fraction of cells and significant increases in postprocedure hematocrit (Hct) associated with increased preprocedure Hct. There were no differences achieved in the time interval between procedures or in the net RBC gain with IHD-RCE. Overall, there were also no significant differences in pre- and postprocedure percentage of hemoglobin S, reticulocyte count, interval daily hemoglobin A decrement, or postprocedure white blood cell, neutrophil, or platelet counts. CONCLUSIONS Our study supports that IHD-RCE can be safely used in patients with stroke risk and compared to standard RCE, results in benefits of lower RBC usage and/or fraction of cells remaining and higher postprocedure Hct associated with higher preprocedure Hct.

Inflammation of the lungs is the main factor leading to respiratory distress in patients with chronic respiratory disease and in patients with severe COVID-19. Several studies have shown that inflammation of the lungs in general and Type 2 diabetes are accompanied by the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), especially heparan sulfate (HS). Several studies have also shown the importance of countering the degradation of HS in lung infections and Type 2 diabetes. D-xylose, which is the initiating element for different sulfate GAG chains (especially HS), has shown regeneration properties for GAGs. D-xylose and xylitol have demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antiglycemic, antiviral, and antibacterial properties in lung infections, alone or in combination with antibiotics. Considering the existing research on COVID-19 and related to D-xylose/xylitol, this review offers a perspective on why the association between D-xylose and antibiotics may contribute to significantly reducing the duration of treatment of COVID-19 patients and why some anti-inflammatory drugs may increase the severity of COVID-19.

As of June 2020, gaps and longitudinal trends in the COVID-19 medical literature remain unidentified, despite potential benefits for research prioritisation and policy setting in both the COVID-19 pandemic and future large-scale public health crises. METHODS: In this paper, we searched PubMed and Embase for medical literature on COVID-19 between 1 January and 24 March 2020. We characterised the growth of the early COVID-19 medical literature using evidence maps and bibliometric analyses to elicit cross-sectional and longitudinal trends and systematically identify gaps. RESULTS: The early COVID-19 medical literature originated primarily from Asia and focused mainly on clinical features and diagnosis of the disease. Many areas of potential research remain underexplored, such as mental health, the use of novel technologies and artificial intelligence, pathophysiology of COVID-19 within different body systems, and indirect effects of COVID-19 on the care of non-COVID-19 patients. Few articles involved research collaboration at the international level (24.7%). The median submission-to-publication duration was 8 days (interquartile range: 4-16). CONCLUSIONS: Although in its early phase, COVID-19 research has generated a large volume of publications.

In the current study, we kept a 95% level of confidence, precision error of 5%, and we anticipated the awareness among targeted population to be 85%. The sample size for our study was 200. Patients attending the Prosthodontic department for any dental consultation with a prosthetically unrestored partial edentulous areas in oral cavity were the target population. RESULTS: Out of total 200 patients 50% of them were male while 50% of them were female. Mean Age  S.D = 57.8  22.5. We have observed that demographical variables have significant relationship regarding teeth awareness and treatment. CONCLUSION: Although tooth loss has a high prevalence, the common causes found were dental caries and loosing of teeth. As both these conditions can be prevented, repeated awareness campaign should be carried out in order to increase the awareness regarding oral hygiene..","output":"Awareness to consequences of teeth missing and prosthodontics treatment options among people of Aseer region, Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper focuses on modeling of public health measures to control the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

A wide range of macromolecules can be quickly recruited within the microdroplets, including small peptides, enzymes as large as 430 kDa and messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The therapeutic-loaded coacervates bypass classical endocytic pathways to enter the cytosol, where they undergo glutathione-mediated release of payload, the bioactivity of which is retained in the cell, while mRNAs exhibit a high transfection efficiency. These peptide coacervates represent a promising platform for the intracellular delivery of a large palette of macromolecular therapeutics that have potential for treating various pathologies (for example, cancers and metabolic diseases) or as carriers for mRNA-based vaccines.","output":"Phase-separating peptides for direct cytosolic delivery and redox-activated release of macromolecular therapeutics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Classification of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) and drug-sensitive tuberculosis (DS-TB) from chest radiographs remains an open problem.

A comparison of radiologist-annotated lesion locations in the lung and the trained models localization of areas of interest, using GradCAM, did not show much overlap. Using the same network architecture, a multi-country classifier was able to identify the country of origin of the X-ray with high accuracy (86%), suggesting that image acquisition differences and the distribution of non-pathological and non-anatomical aspects of the images are affecting the generalization and localization of the drug resistance classification model as well. When CXR images were severely corrupted, the performance on the validation set was still better than 60% AUC. The model overfitted to the data from countries in the cross validation set but did not generalize to the held out country. Finally, we applied a multi-task based approach that uses prior TB lesions location information to guide the classifier network to focus its attention on improving the generalization performance on the held out set from another country to 68% AUC.","output":"Generalization Challenges in Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Detection from Chest X-rays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Vaccine hesitancy is caused by a variety of factors, which are complex and multifaceted. The perceived risks of vaccines, the relationship between parents and health-care providers, and the social norm of vaccination are all factors that influence vaccine decision making. Objective: This study aimed to conclude the prevalence of vaccine indecision amongst parents visiting PHC in Al-Madinah city, to identify socio-demographic determinants of vaccine hesitancy and to recognize agents and host-related factors, which leads to hesitancy. Methods: A cross-sectional research was implemented on parents who attended the PHC using a valid questionnaire filled by interviewing the parents. All data was confirmed manually then was implied and entered into SPSS software. Then the data were analyzed using the appropriate statistical test. Results: Vaccines can protect children from dangerous diseases, according to 98.1% of the 375 people who took part in our study. 88.5% of parents preferred to get their children vaccinated with all of the vaccines that are recommended. 69.9% of participants had ever been hesitant or unwilling to have their child vaccinated. 9.6% of parents were unable to get their child vaccinated due to distance, clinic timing, time needed to get the clinic or wait at the clinic, and/or the cost of getting to the clinic. Conclusion: Finally, our findings demonstrated that vaccine apprehension is a prominent issue among parents in Saudi Arabia. We discovered that vaccine fear is widespread, and that it spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: The real-world study included patients treated with intravenous PMB for at least 7 days during the period of October 2018 through June 2019. Associations between these clinical features and 28-day mortality or all-cause hospital mortality were explored through univariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: The study included 100 patients. Many patients presented with combined chronic conditions, septic shock, mechanical ventilation, and the presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The mean duration of PMB therapy was 11 days (range 7C38 days).

We will also discuss the double-edged effect of STAT3 activation in the muscles, including the role of STAT3 signaling in muscle hypertrophy induced by exercise training or muscle wasting in cachectic diseases and muscular dystrophies. STAT3 is a critical regulator of satellite cell self-renewal after muscle injury. STAT3 knock out affects satellite cell myogenic progression by impairing proliferation and inducing premature differentiation. Recent studies in STAT3 signaling demonstrated its direct role in controlling myogenic capacity of myoblasts and satellite cells, as well as the potential benefit in using STAT3 inhibitors to treat muscle diseases. However, prolonged STAT3 activation in muscles has been shown to be responsible for muscle wasting by activating protein degradation pathways. It is important to balance the extent of STAT3 activation and the duration and location (cell types) of the STAT3 signaling when developing therapeutic interventions.

Psychological resilience is a fundamental variable for reducing and preventing the negative psychological effects of the pandemic and is associated with lower levels of depression, anxiety and burnout. At the individual and organizational level, resilience plays a crucial role in enhancing wellbeing in healthcare and non-healthcare workers. Connected to resilience, adaptive coping strategies are essential for managing the emergency and work-related stress. Several positive factors influencing resilience have been highlighted in the development of PTG.

A number of studies have used such recordings for analysis, even though information about bandwidth and fidelity has not been provided by the manufacturers. In this study we consider these systems purely as EEG recording devices, and evaluate their suitability for quantitative analysis. Using a calibrated electronic testing system, we played an artificial test signal of known amplitude with frequency varying from 0.01 to 400 Hz into the BIS and Entropy EEG systems, and saved the recording in each of their supported recording modes. The amplitude of the recording at each frequency was then used to derive the frequency response curves, as well as the 3 dB and 0.5 dB points for each mode. There are important differences between the various BIS and Entropy recordings. The BIS 256 Hz and the Entropy 400 Hz recordings are broadly comparable, although Entropy has a slightly reduced response above 50 Hz and below 1 Hz. The BIS 128 Hz recording has a somewhat reduced bandwidth, due to its relatively low sampling rate. The Entropy 100 Hz recording in the Datex-Ohmeda S/5 monitor has a flawed implementation, leading to aliasing of signals over 50 Hz and potential distortion of the recording, while in the GE Carescape it has an uneven response and a narrowed bandwidth. Consequently, it is important to know which specific host monitor was used when an Entropy 100 Hz recording was made.

Although telemedicine has been used in different areas of healthcare management for several years, its importance was highlighted during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of this survey was to assess patient satisfaction with the use of telemedicine in the management of hyperthyroidism. Materials and methods A postal survey was administered to all patients who had received at least one telemedicine session during the months January to May 2020 for the management of hyperthyroidism. Patients were asked to respond to nine statements using the five-point Likert scale. A suggestion box was included for comments and suggestions for improvement. Results There were 106 patients (26 males vs 80 females) with an average age of 53 years who received one to three calls over a five-month study period. A total of 65 respondents returned completed survey forms (61.3% response rate). Approximately 97% of respondents were satisfied with the overall quality of service provided during the use of telemedicine in the management of hyperthyroidism. The telemedicine service was time saving and met their needs. Approximately 14% of respondents were undecided about whether telemedicine was as good as the traditional face-to-face consultation. The respondents also made useful comments and suggestions concerning the provision of adequate time slots, occasional face-to-face appointments, and the introduction of text messaging and emailing to the telemedicine service. Conclusions This survey has demonstrated that the use of telemedicine in the management of hyperthyroidism is desirable to a majority of patients, as long as adequate time slots are dedicated to the telemedicine sessions and patients are reassured of the availability of face-to-face consultation sessions.

In this systematic review, we aimed to (1) explore the effectiveness of tDCS on the clinical symptoms and neuropsychological deficits of ADHD patients, (2) evaluate the safety of tDCS application, especially in children with ADHD, (3) model the electrical field intensity in the target regions based on the commonly-applied and effective versus less-effective protocols, and (4) discuss and propose advanced tDCS parameters. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses approach, a literature search identified 14 empirical experiments investigating tDCS effects in ADHD. Partial improving effects of tDCS on cognitive deficits (response inhibition, working memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility) or clinical symptoms (e.g., impulsivity and inattention) are reported in 10 studies. No serious adverse effects are reported in 747 sessions of tDCS. The left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are the regions most often targeted, and anodal tDCS the protocol most often applied. An intensity of 2 mA induced stronger electrical fields than 1 mA in adults with ADHD and was associated with significant behavioral changes. In ADHD children, however, the electrical field induced by 1 mA, which is likely larger than the electrical field induced by 1 mA in adults due to the smaller head size of children, was sufficient to result in significant behavioral change. Overall, tDCS seems to be a promising method for improving ADHD deficits. However, the clinical utility of tDCS in ADHD cannot yet be concluded and requires further systematic investigation in larger sample sizes. Cortical regions involved in ADHD pathophysiology, stimulation parameters (e.g. intensity, duration, polarity, and electrode size), and types of symptom/deficit are potential determinants of tDCS efficacy in ADHD. Developmental aspects of tDCS in childhood ADHD should be considered as well.","output":"Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in ADHD: A Systematic Review of Efficacy, Safety, and Protocol-induced Electrical Field Modeling Results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infects human by destroying the immune system.

The key point of aspect sentiment classification is to capture valuable information from sentence. Existing methods have acknowledged the importance of the relationship between the target and the sentence. However, these approaches only focus on the local information of the target, such as the positional relationship and the semantic similarity between the words in a sentence and the target. Moreover, the global information of the interaction of words in sentence and their influence on the final prediction of sentiment polarity are ignored in related works. To tackle this issue, the present paper proposes Joint Modeling of Local and Global Attention (LGAJM), with the following two aspects: (1) the study develops a position-based attention network concentrating on the local information of semantic similarity and position information of the target. (2) In order to fetch global information, such as context information and interaction between words in sentences, the self-attention network is introduced. Besides, a BiGRU-based gating mechanism is proposed to weight the outputs of these two attention networks. The model is evaluated on two datasets: laptop and restaurant from SemEval 2014. Experimental results demonstrate the high effectiveness of the proposed method in aspect sentiment classification.","output":"Learn More from Context: Joint Modeling of Local and Global Attention for Aspect Sentiment Classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Postpartum hemorrhage is the cumulative blood loss of 500 milliliters or more in a spontaneous vaginal delivery and approximately 1,000 milliliters or more for caesarean section birth and a leading cause of maternal mortality1. Objective The overall aim of the study was to determine midwives' factors that influence the management of PPH. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study that employed a quantitative approach through the use of a research self- administered questionnaire and an observational checklist targeting midwives were used. 85 midwives filled the questionnaire and 71 were observed respectively. The study was hospital- based conducted in Muranga County, Kenya. Convenience sampling technique was used to select the midwives in the study sites. Results The following factors were statistically significant in influencing management of postpartum hemorrhage; age (P-value = 0.021). professional qualification (P= 0.047), experience in management of PPH (P= 0.032) and training on emergency PPH (P= 0.010), knowledge factors that were found to influence the management of PPH positively include knowledge on; prevention of PPH (p value-0.000), correct use of prophylactic uterotonic agents (P= 0.000), uterotonics use (P= 0.043), uterine massage during 3rd stage of labour (P= 0.012), examination of the placenta (P= 0.034), management of PPH (P= 0.028), causes and diagnosis of PPH (P= 0.001), (Fischer's exact value= 0.043).

Tomographic tilt series of X-ray images were used to yield three-dimensional reconstructions showing different cell organelles (nuclei, mitochondria, filaments), together with other structures derived from the virus infection. Among them, it was possible to detect viral factories and two types of viral particles related to different maturation steps of VACV (immature and mature particles), which were compared to images obtained by standard electron microscopy of the same type of cells. In addition, the effect of radiation damage during X-ray tomographic acquisition was analyzed. Thin sections studied by electron microscopy revealed that the morphological features of the cells do not present noticeable changes after irradiation. Our findings show that cryo X-ray nano-tomography is a powerful tool for collecting three-dimensional structural information from frozen, unfixed, unstained whole cells with sufficient resolution to detect different virus particles exhibiting distinct maturation levels.","output":"Cryo X-ray nano-tomography of vaccinia virus infected cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dementia is a cognitive impairment that poses a global threat. Current dementia treatments slow the progression of the disease. The timing of starting such treatment markedly affects the effectiveness of the treatment. Some experts mentioned that the optimal timing for starting the currently available treatment in order to delay progression to dementia is the mild cognitive impairment stage, which is the prior stage of dementia. However, medical records are typically only available at a later stage, i.e., from the early or middle stage of dementia. In order to address this limitation, this study developed a model using national health information data from 5 years prior, to predict dementia development 5 years in the future. The Senior Cohort Database, comprising 550,000 samples, were used for model development. The F-measure of the model predicting dementia development after a 5-year incubation period was 77.38%. Models for a 1- and 3-year incubation period were also developed for comparative analysis of dementia risk factors. The three models had some risk factors in common, but also had unique risk factors, depending on the stage. For the common risk factors, a difference in disease severity was confirmed. These findings indicate that the diagnostic criteria and treatment strategy for dementia should differ depending on the timing. Furthermore, since the results of this study present new dementia risk factors that have not been reported previously, this study may also contribute to identification of new dementia risk factors.","output":"Medical Health Records-Based Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Prediction for Effective Dementia Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"P. aeruginosa is classified as a priority one pathogen by the World Health Organisation, and new drugs are urgently needed, due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. Antimicrobial-resistant nosocomial pathogens such as P. aeruginosa pose unwavering and increasing threats. Antimicrobial stewardship has been a challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a majority of those hospitalized with SARS-CoV2 infection given antibiotics as a safeguard against secondary bacterial infection. This increased usage, along with increased handling of sanitizers and disinfectants globally, may further accelerate the development and spread of cross-resistance to antibiotics. In addition, P. aeruginosa is the primary causative agent of morbidity and mortality in people with the life-shortening genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). Prolonged periods of selective pressure, associated with extended antibiotic treatment and the actions of host immune effectors, results in widespread adaptive and acquired resistance in P. aeruginosa found colonizing the lungs of people with CF. This review discusses the arsenal of resistance mechanisms utilized by P. aeruginosa, how these operate under high-stress environments such as the CF lung and how their interconnectedness can result in resistance to multiple antibiotic classes. Intrinsic, adaptive and acquired resistance mechanisms will be described, with a focus on how each layer of resistance can serve as a building block, contributing to multi-tiered resistance to antimicrobial activity. Recent progress in the development of anti-resistance adjuvant therapies, targeting one or more of these building blocks, should lead to novel strategies for combatting multidrug resistant P. aeruginosa. Anti-resistance adjuvant therapy holds great promise, not least because resistance against such therapeutics is predicted to be rare. The non-bactericidal nature of anti-resistance adjuvants reduce the selective pressures that drive resistance. Anti-resistance adjuvant therapy may also be advantageous in facilitating efficacious use of traditional antimicrobials, through enhanced penetration of the antibiotic into the bacterial cell. Promising anti-resistance adjuvant therapeutics and targets will be described, and key remaining challenges highlighted. As antimicrobial stewardship becomes more challenging in an era of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and global conflict, innovation in antibiotic adjuvant therapy can play an important role in extending the shelf-life of our existing antimicrobial therapeutic agents.","output":"The Building Blocks of Antimicrobial Resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Implications for Current Resistance-Breaking Therapies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To study the epidemiological and clinical features of children with mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS The children who were diagnosed with mild COVID-19 in the Wuchang Shelter Hospital in Wuhan from February 5 to March 10, 2020 were enrolled as subjects. The clinical, laboratory, and lung imaging data were collected during hospitalization and isolation. This was a retrospective single-center case series analysis. RESULTS A total of 1 124 patients with mild COVID-19 were admitted from February 5 to March 10, 2020, including 13 children (1.16%). All the 13 children (7 boys and 6 girls) were residents of Wuhan in China, with a median age of 16 years (range: 10-18 years). Of all the 13 children, 9(69%) were from family clusters of COVID-19 and 4(31%) had unknown sources of infection. The mean time from exposure to onset was 6.8 days (range: 2-13 days) in 9 children with a definite history of exposure. There were 6 symptomatic children with the main manifestations of fever, cough, weakness, and myalgia, and the mean time from onset to hospitalization was 9.2 days. Of all the 13 children, 7(54%) were asymptomatic with positive nucleic acid test of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). There were 4 children (31%) with abnormal lung CT findings, mainly patchy shadows or ground-glass opacities in the lung field, and 6 children (46%) had no symptoms with normal lung CT findings. All children had normal routine blood test results and C-reactive protein levels. Eight children underwent SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG tests at least once, among whom 6 had negative SARS-CoV-2 IgM but positive IgG, and 2 underwent SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG tests twice and had negative results. Of all the 13 children, 11(85%) had negative results of two SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests during hospitalization and were discharged, and 2(15%) had positive results of four SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests and were transferred to another hospital and lost to follow-up. Among the 11 children who were followed up, 1 had positive results of two SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests at the isolation point, and 10 had negative results. The mean hospital stay was 10.9 days for the 13 children. Eleven children recovered during follow-up, with good living and learning conditions. CONCLUSIONS Children with mild COVID-19 often have an uncertain history of exposure and may not have any clinical symptoms. Etiological diagnosis is more important than clinical diagnosis. The disappearance of clinical manifestations may not parallel with the result of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. SARS-CoV-2 has a long detoxification time, and there may be recurrent cases of SARS-CoV-2 positivity.

This study aimed at comparing the safety, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC, within 72 h after admission) versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC, beyond 72 h after admission) for patients with mild acute biliary pancreatitis. METHODS: We performed a systematic search in the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane library. We only included articles from RCTs which designed to evaluate the complications, conversion to open cholecystectomy, recurrence of acute pancreatitis, the length of hospital stay, and costs between patients undergoing ELC and those undergoing DLC. We schemed to analyze data using STATA 15.0 with both the random-effects and the fixed-effect models. We computed relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. RESULTS: A total of 4 studies involving 439 (215 vs 224) patients were included. The difference of complication rate [3.3% vs 3.2%; RR 1.03 (0.35, 3.01), P = 0.961] and rate of conversion to open cholecystectomy [3.8% vs 3.3%; RR 1.13 (0.37, 3.43), P = 0.830] are insignificant between patients who underwent ELC and ones who underwent DLC. The difference of rate of recurrence of acute pancreatitis is significant between ELC and DLC (2.17% vs 8.99%; RR 0.24 (0.08-0.70), P = 0.009). ELC does not shorten the length of hospital stay (random-effects model analysis: WMD -1.09 days (-2.67, 0.48), P = 0.173; fixed-effect model analysis: WMD -0.62 days (-1.00, -0.24), P = 0.001).

On April 29th 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared 26,277 infected cases; among them, 10,884 have deceased. The epidemic is still ongoing, particularly in Sierra Leone. It is now clear that northern countries will be implicated in the care of EVD patients, both in the field and back at home. Because of the severity of EVD, a fair amount of patients may require intensive care. It is highly probable that intensive care would be able to significantly reduce the mortality linked with EVD. The preparation of a modern Intensive Care Unit (ICU) to treat an EVD patient in good conditions requires time and specific equipment. The cornerstone of this preparation includes two main goals: treating the patient and protecting healthcare providers. Staff training is time consuming and must be performed far in advance of patient arrival. To be efficient, preparation should be planned at a national level with help from public authorities, as was the case in France during the summer of 2014.

Methods: We analyzed electronic medical record data from infants born at less than 32 weeks gestational age (GA) cared for in the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in a COVID-19-affected period (March 8, 2020 to May 31, 2020) and the analogous period in 2019. Our final sample consisted of 52 infants (n=27, 2019 cohort; n=25, 2020 cohort). Rates of family visitation and of family- and clinical staff-delivered developmental care were compared across cohorts, adjusting for GA at start of study period. Results: Results indicated that families of infants in the 2020 cohort visited less frequently (47% of available days) than those in the 2019 cohort (97%; p=0.001). Infants received developmental care activities less frequently in the 2020 cohort (3.51 vs. 4.72 activities per day; p=0.04), with a lower number of minutes per day (99.91 vs. 145.14; p=0.04) and a shorter duration per instance (23.41 vs. 29.65; p=0.03). Similar reductions occurred in both family- and staff-delivered developmental care activities. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted family visitation and preterm infant developmental care practices in the NICU, both experiences associated with positive health benefits.

Hence, global vaccination becomes non-negotiable to support immunity to reduce morbidity and mortality burdens. The COVID-19 vaccine campaign hinges on health promotion and equitable distribution, especially among minority groups. Therefore, the current study investigated the determinants of perceived vaccine efficacy and willingness to pay among foreign migrants in China. Methods: The study appraised data from an online-based survey carried out among foreign migrants in mainland China through the WeChat platform. Data analysis was carried out through bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: A total of 498 foreign migrants were recruited, with male 47.65%, female 45.2%, and other gender minority groups (7.15%). The study found that females, gender minorities, students, preference for alternative medicine, culture neutrality, belief against vaccination, and prefer free vaccination were less likely to pay for COVID-19 vaccination. Meanwhile, those whose families/relatives are opposed to vaccination and have good subjective health than others in their age group were less likely to believe in vaccine efficacy. Those who have received at least a dose of COVI D-19 vaccine (AoR: 3.32, 95% CI: 1.94-5.58, p<0.001), believe vaccines are accessible (AoR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.52-3.98, p<0.001) and have high perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 (AoR: 1.97,95% CI: 1.18-3.28, p<0.01) were more likely to believe in vaccine efficacy.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of nebulised surfactant in COVID-19 adult patients requiring mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. TRIAL DESIGN: This study is a dose-escalating randomized open-label clinical trial of 20 COVID-19 patients. PARTICIPANTS: This study is conducted in two centres: University Hospital Southampton and University College London Hospitals. Eligible participants are aged 18, hospitalised with COVID-19 (confirmed by PCR), who require endotracheal intubation and are enrolled within 24 hours of mechanical ventilation. For patients unable to consent, assent is obtained from a personal legal representative (PerLR) or professional legal representative (ProfLR) prior to enrolment. The following are exclusion criteria: imminent expected death within 24 hours; specific contraindications to surfactant administration (e.g. known allergy, pneumothorax, pulmonary hemorrhage); known or suspected pregnancy; stage 4 chronic kidney disease or requiring dialysis (i.e., eGFR < 30); liver failure (Child-Pugh Class C); anticipated transfer to another hospital, which is not a study site, within 72 hours; current or recent (within 1 month) participation in another study that, in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent enrollment for safety reasons; and declined consent or assent. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: The study is based on an investigational drug/device combination product. The surfactant product is Bovactant (Alveofact?), a natural animal derived (bovine) lung surfactant formulated as a lyophilized powder in 108 mg vials and reconstituted to 45 mg/mL in buffer supplied in a prefilled syringe. It is isolated by lung lavage and, by weight, is a mixture of: phospholipid (75% phosphatidylcholine, 13% phosphatidylglycerol, 3% phosphatidylethanolamine, 1% phosphatidylinositol and 1% sphingomyelin), 5% cholesterol, 1% lipid-soluble surfactant-associated proteins (SP-B and SP-C), very low levels of free fatty acid, lyso-phosphatidylcholine, water and 0.3% calcium. The Drug Delivery Device is the AeroFact-COVID? nebulizer, an investigational device based on the Aerogen? Solo vibrating mesh nebulizer. The timing and escalation dosing plans for the surfactant are as follows. Cohort 1: Three patients will receive 10 vials (1080 mg) each of surfactant at dosing times of 0 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours. 2 controls with no placebo intervention.

We identified several host factors critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including various components belonging to the Clathrin-dependent transport pathway, ubiquitination, Heparan sulfate biogenesis and host phosphatidylglycerol biosynthesis. Comparative analysis of the different VOCs revealed the host factors KREMEN2 and SETDB1 as potential unique candidates required only to the Alpha variant. Furthermore, the analysis identified GATA6, a zinc finger transcription factor, as an essential proviral gene for all variants inspected. We show that GATA6 directly regulates ACE2 transcription and accordingly, is critical for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Analysis of clinical samples collected from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals shows elevated levels of GATA6, suggesting a role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of GATA6 resulted in down-modulation of ACE2 and inhibition of viral infectivity.

Clinicians increasingly relied on telemedicine during the global pandemic. To assess the ongoing role for telemedicine in orthopaedics, we prospectively analyzed the failure rate, safety and patient-reported experience of telephone consultations for 12 months. METHODS: 265 telephone Foot/Ankle consultations were conducted in April 2020 and were prospectively analyzed over 12 months. The primary outcome measure was the rate of failed telephone consultations. A consultation was deemed unacceptable if the patient did not answer, if the clinician could not reach a conclusion or if any outcome changed over 12 months. Secondary outcome measures included patient-reported satisfaction and time saved by avoiding a face-to-face visit. RESULTS: A clinical decision was reached in 84% of follow-up telephone consultations and 64% of new patient consultations (P = 0.001). Sixty-six percent were managed with nonoperative therapies, 16% were discharged, and 11% were added to the waiting list for surgery. The reasons for failing to achieve a clinical decision included failure to contact the patient (12.8%), inappropriate discharge with subsequent rereferral (1.9%), and insufficient clinical information (1.5%). Overall, 84.7% of patients reported that the telephone consultation was highly useful and 71.9% would recommend it to a friend or family member. Patients reported a mean time saving of 120 minutes. CONCLUSION: Based on our experience, we provide recommended criteria for the safe and practical use of telephone consultations and suggest versatile patient care pathways into which a telephone consultation can be incorporated.

Objectives: To describe variation in ICU admission rates over time and by geography during the first wave of the epidemic in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland; to describe trends in patient characteristics on admission to ICU, first-24-hours physiology in ICU, processes of care in ICU and patient outcomes; and to explore deviations in trends during the peak period. Methods: A cohort of 10,741 patients with COVID-19 in the Case Mix Program national clinical audit from February 1 to July 31, 2020, was used. Analyses were stratified by time period (prepeak, peak, and postpeak periods) and geographical region. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted differences in 28-day in-hospital mortality between periods. Measurements and Main Results: Admissions to ICUs peaked almost simultaneously across regions but varied 4.6-fold in magnitude. Compared with patients admitted in the prepeak period, patients admitted in the postpeak period were slightly younger but with higher degrees of dependency and comorbidity on admission to ICUs and more deranged first-24-hours physiology. Despite this, receipt of invasive ventilation and renal replacement therapy decreased, and adjusted 28-day in-hospital mortality was reduced by 11.8% (95% confidence interval, 8.7%C15.0%). Many variables exhibited u-shaped or n-shaped curves during the peak.

OC43 apparently emerged from a bovine coronavirus (BCoV) spillover. All three viruses attach to 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans via spike protein S with hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) acting as a receptor-destroying enzyme. In BCoV, an HE lectin domain promotes esterase activity toward clustered substrates. OC43 and HKU1, however, lost HE lectin function as an adaptation to humans. Replaying OC43 evolution, we knocked out BCoV HE lectin function and performed forced evolution-population dynamics analysis. Loss of HE receptor binding selected for second-site mutations in S, decreasing S binding affinity by orders of magnitude. Irreversible HE mutations led to cooperativity in virus swarms with low-affinity S minority variants sustaining propagation of high-affinity majority phenotypes. Salvageable HE mutations induced successive second-site substitutions in both S and HE. Apparently, S and HE are functionally interdependent and coevolve to optimize the balance between attachment and release. This mechanism of glycan-based receptor usage, entailing a concerted, fine-tuned activity of two envelope protein species, is unique among CoVs, but reminiscent of that of influenza A viruses. Apparently, general principles fundamental to virion-sialoglycan interactions prompted convergent evolution of two important groups of human and animal pathogens.","output":"Coronavirus hemagglutinin-esterase and spike proteins coevolve for functional balance and optimal virion avidity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Little is known about changes in lymphocyte subsets after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The relation of lymphocyte subsets and severity or prognosis of disease were analyzed. Results: At 2-3 weeks after the onset of symptoms, lymphocyte subsets decreased to the lowest levels. The levels of lymphocyte subsets in asymptomatic patients were close to healthy persons, except for CD8+ T lymphocyte cells. The levels of lymphocyte subsets in patients with severe illness were lower than that in patients with mild-to-moderate illness (P < 0.01). Similarly, among patients with severe illness, lower levels of lymphocyte subsets were found in dead patients compared to survivors (P < 0.001). Moreover, by comparing the results of the same patients at different stages of the disease, we found levels of lymphocyte subsets were lower in the acute phase compared to that in convalescent-phase (P < 0.001). However, the levels of lymphocyte subsets in patients who had SARS-CoV-2 viral load >5000 copies/ml and 500-5000 copies/ml were at similar levels.

Over 170 immunological markers were investigated in a discovery cohort (n=98 patients) of the Lausanne University Hospital (LUH-1). While cellular immunological markers lacked power in discriminating between ICU and non-ICU patients, 13 out of 49 cytokines were significantly associated with ICU admission in the three cohorts (P<0.05 to P<0.001). The cytokine results were confirmed in two validation cohorts, i.e. the French COVID-19 Study (FCS;n=62) and a second LUH-2 cohort (n=47). Of note, HGF is a pleiotropic cytokine with anti-inflammatory properties playing a fundamental role in lung tissue repair, and CXCL13, a pro-inflammatory chemokine associated with pulmonary fibrosis and regulating the maturation of B cell response. The two cytokines in combination were the best predictors of ICU admission (positive and negative predictive values ranging from 81.8% to 93.1% and 85.2% to 94.4% in the 3 cohorts) and occurrence of death during patient follow-up (8.8 fold higher likelihood of death when both cytokines were increased).

However, the external price shocks can result in a higher level of volatility as well as domestic policy instability. Therefore, an efficient risk measure and hedging strategies are needed to help investors protect their investments against this risk. In this paper, a daily systemic risk measure, called FRM (Financial Risk Meter) is proposed. The FRM-EM is applied to capture systemic risk behavior embedded in the returns of the 25 largest EMs FIs, covering the BRIMST (Brazil, Russia, India, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey), and thereby reflects the financial linkages between these economies. Concerning the Macro factors, in addition to the Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016) Macro, we include the EM sovereign yield spread over respective US Treasuries and the above-mentioned countries currencies. The results indicated that the FRM of EMs FIs reached its maximum during the US financial crisis following by COVID 19 crisis and the Macro factors explain the BRIMST FIs with various degrees of sensibility.

A proper understanding of these animals ecology is useful as a necessary input to plan strategies to control these populations. The present study addresses the population dynamics and the effectiveness of the sterilization of unrestricted dogs using capture and recapture procedures suitable for open animal populations. Every two months, over a period of 14 months, we captured, tagged, released and recaptured dogs in two regions in a city in the southeast region of Brazil. In one of these regions the animals were also sterilized. Both regions had similar social, environmental and demographic features. We estimated the presence of 148 females and 227 males during the period of study. The average dog:man ratio was 1 dog for each 42 and 51 human beings, in the areas without and with sterilization, respectively. The animal population size increased in both regions, due mainly to the abandonment of domestic dogs. Mortality rate decreased throughout the study period. Survival probabilities did not differ between genders, but males entered the population in higher numbers. There were no differences in abundance, survival and recruitment between the regions, indicating that sterilization did not affect the population dynamics. Our findings indicate that the observed animal dynamics were influenced by density-independent factors, and that sterilization might not be a viable and effective strategy in regions where availability of resources is low and animal abandonment rates are high. Furthermore, the high demographic turnover rates observed render the canine free-roaming population younger, thus more susceptible to diseases, especially to rabies and leishmaniasis. We conclude by stressing the importance of implementing educational programs to promote responsible animal ownership and effective strategies against abandonment practices.","output":"Abundance, survival, recruitment and effectiveness of sterilization of free-roaming dogs: A capture and recapture study in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Of the many impacts of COVID-19 on contemporary healthcare is the rapid and overwhelming shift to remote telehealth (TH) service The precise effect of TH on treatment is yet unknown, and the possible child/adult differences are an essential point of clarification for the utility of TH services and efforts to improve upon them Methods The current study considers data reflecting pre-, during-, and post-COVID-19 lockdown over the first six months of 2020 Data comprise records of N = 43,294 services delivered to N = 2520 unique clients across multiple outpatient mental health sites at a Certified Community Based Mental Health Clinic (CCBHC) in Rockland County, NY, an area hard hit by COVID-19 Results Results demonstrate significant differences between child and adult sessions with a relative decrease in the number of child mental health services with the switch to TH in March 2020 (onset of lockdown) and a relatively rapid shift back to face-to-face among child services when in-person services resumed in May and June 2020 Results further highlight significant differences between child age and service type, with psychiatry less affected by TH than psychotherapy Conclusions Implicit in the data is the ability to offer remotely, a high volume of ongoing behavioral intervention Findings support TH as less preferred for children than adults while indicating that child TH is favored for psychiatry and support services, less so for psychotherapy Implications for enhancing child TH delivery and directions for continued research include relational factors, platform (phone/video) and screen salience","output":"Children and Telehealth in Mental Healthcare: What We Have Learned From COVID-19 and 40,000+ Sessions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Jupyter Notebooks have been widely adopted by many different communities, both in science and industry.

Of these, 8.6% suffered from DM, 11.6% from hypertension, and 9.7% from obesity. Of the total of 2,260,156 persons, 666,694 tested positive (29.5%) to SARS CoV-2, (with a mean age of 45). During the first wave, 82,489 tested positive; in the interwave period, 112,115; and during the second wave, 472,090. That is, a considerable increase in the number of cases of infection was observed in all age groups between the first and second waves (an increase of +472% on the first wave). Of the infected persons, a total of 85,587 (12.8%) were hospitalized: 24,023 in the first wave (29.1% of those who tested positive in this period); 16,935 (15.1%) during the interwave period, and 44,629 (9.5%) in the second wave, which represents an increase of 85.77% on the first wave. Of the hospitalized patients, there were 42,979 deaths (50.2% of those hospitalized), in the first wave, 11,964 (49.8% of those hospitalized in this period), during the interwave period, 6,794 (40.1%), and in the second wave 24,221 (54.3%), an increase of +102.4% between the first wave and the second. While within the general population, the probability of a patient dying having both COVID-19 and one of the specified comorbidities (DM, obesity, or arterial hypertension) showed a systematic reduction across all age groups, the probability of death for a hospitalized patient with comorbidities increased across all age groups during the second wave. When comparing the fatality rate of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the second wave with those of the first wave and the interwave period, a significant increase was observed across all age groups, even in individuals without comorbidities. ConclusionThe data from this study show a considerable increase in the number of detected cases of infection in all age groups between the first and second waves. In addition, 12.8% of those infected were hospitalized for severe COVID-19, representing an increase of +85.9% from the first wave to the second. A high mortality rate was observed among hospitalized patients (>50%), as was a higher probability of death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with comorbidities for all age groups during the second wave, although there had been a slight decrease during the interwave period. SUMMARY BOXO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABSWorldwide the resurging of COVID-19 cases in waves has been observed. In Mexico, like in the rest of the world, we have observed surges of SARS CoV-2 infections, COVID-19 hospitalizations and fatal outcomes followed by decreases leading to local minima. Pre-existing health conditions such as being older, having diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension and/or obesity has been observed to be associated with an increase in the severity of COVID-19. What are the new findings?O_LIBetween the first and second waves, considerable increases were observed in the number of detected cases of infection (+472%), in the number of hospitalized subjects (+85.9%), and the number of hospitalized subjects and deaths (+102.4%) in all age groups. C_LIO_LIWhen analysing only hospitalized individuals, with or without comorbidities, the Case Fatality Rate was high (50.2%), the probability of death increased considerably in all age groups between the first and second waves. This increase was more noticeable in those individuals with previously identified comorbidities (DM, hypertension, or obesity). C_LIO_LIAn increased probability of death among individuals without comorbidities was observed between the first and second waves. C_LI What do the new findings imply?During the second wave, demand for hospitalization increased, magnifying the impact of age and comorbidities as risk factors. This situation highlights the importance of decreasing the prevalence of comorbidities among the population.","output":"Probability of Hospitalization and Death among Covid-19 Patients with Comorbidity during Outbreaks Occurring in Mexico City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Considering the immense pace of developments in deep learning (DL), its applications in medicine are relatively limited. One main issue that hinders the utilization of DL in the medical practice workflow is its reliability. A radiologist interpreting an image can easily say \\"I don't know\\", while a DL model is forced to output a result. Evidential deep learning (EDL) is one of the methods for uncertainty quantification (UQ). In this work, we aimed to use EDL to express model uncertainty in detecting COVID-19. We used SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA COVID-19 chest x-ray dataset and trained a model to diagnose typical COVID-19 pneumonia. When applied to a separate test set, it yielded an accuracy of 88% with median uncertainty scores of 0.25 and 0.07 for normal and typical COVID-19 images, respectively. Moreover, the model labeled unseen indeterminate and atypical COVID-19 x-rays with median uncertainties of 0.32 and 0.35, respectively. Our model's performance was superior to the exact model trained with conventional approach of DL (i.e., using the cross-entropy loss), which is not able to express the uncertainty level. Overall, this study demonstrates applicability of UQ in disease detection that could facilitate the use of DL in practice by increasing its reliability.","output":"Uncertainty Quantification in COVID-19 Detection Using Evidential Deep Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The daily fluctuations in the released number of Covid-19 cases played a big role both at the beginning and in the most critical weeks of the outbreak, when local authorities in Italy had to decide whether to impose a lockdown and at which level.

When an increase/decrease was communicated, especially a large one, it was not easy to understand if it was due to a change in the epidemic evolution or if it was a fluctuation due to other reasons, such as an increase in the number of swabs or a delay in the swab processing. In this work, we propose a nonlinear asymmetric diffusion model, which includes information on the daily number of swabs, to describe daily fluctuations in the number of confirmed cases in addition to the main trend of the outbreak evolution. The class of diffusion models has been selected to develop our proposal, as it also allows estimation of the total number of confirmed cases at the end of the outbreak.

The patterns of healthcare utilization change during pandemic disease outbreaks. Identifying the patterns of changes of this particular fragile subpopulation is important for future preparedness and response. Overcrowding in the emergency department (ED) can occur because of the volume of patients waiting to be seen, delays in patient assessment or treatment in the ED, or impediments to leaving the ED once the treatment has been completed. Overcrowding has become a serious and growing issue globally, which represents a serious impediment to healthcare utilization. To estimate the rate of ED visits attributable to the outbreak and guide the planning of strategies for managing ED access or after the outbreak of transmittable respiratory diseases. This observational study was based on a retrospective review of the epidemiological and clinical records of patients aged > 75 years who visited the Foundation IRCCS Policlinic San Matteo during the first wave of COVID-19 outbreak (February 21 to May 1, 2020; pandemic group). The analysis methods included estimation of the changes in the epidemiological and clinical data from the annual baseline data after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcome measures and analysis: Primary objective is the evaluation of ED admission rate change and ED overcrowding. Secondary objectives are the evaluation of modes of ED access by reason and triage code, access types, clinical outcomes (such as admission and mortality rates). During the pandemic, ED crowding increased dramatically, although the overall number of patients decreased, in the face of a percentage increase in those with high-acuity conditions, because of changes in patient management that have prolonged length of stay (LOS) and increased rates of access block. Overcrowding during the COVID-19 pandemic can be attributed to the Access Block. Access Block solutions are hence required to prevent a recurrence of crowding to any new viral wave or new epidemic in the future.

This study investigated whether laboratory blood tests can discriminate between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infections at emergency department (ED) presentation. Methods: 723 influenza A/B positive (2018/1/1 to 2020/3/15) and 1,281 SARS-CoV-2 positive (2020/3/11 to 2020/6/30) ED patients were retrospectively analyzed. Laboratory test results completed within 48 hours prior to reporting of virus RT-PCR results, as well as patient demographics were included to train and validate a random forest (RF) model. The dataset was randomly divided into training (2/3) and testing (1/3) sets with the same SARS-CoV-2/influenza ratio. The Shapley Additive Explanations technique was employed to visualize the impact of each laboratory test on the differentiation. Results: The RF model incorporating results from 15 laboratory tests and demographic characteristics discriminated SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infections, with an area under the ROC curve value 0.90 in the independent testing set. The overall agreement with the RT-PCR results was 83% (95% CI: 80-86%). The test with the greatest impact on the differentiation was serum total calcium level. Further, the model achieved an AUC of 0.82 in a new dataset including 519 SARS-CoV-2 ED patients (2020/12/1 to 2021/2/28) and the previous 723 influenza positive patients.

Several investigations assessed type I, II, and III interferon (IFN) signatures in SARS-CoV-2 infected adults, however no data are available for pediatric patients. TRIM28 and SETDB1 regulate the transcription of multiple genes involved in the immune response as well as of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs). Exogenous viral infections can trigger the activation of HERVs, which in turn can induce inflammatory and immune reactions. Despite the potential cross-talks between SARS-CoV-2 infection and TRIM28, SETDB1, and HERVs, information on their expressions in COVID-19 patients is lacking. We assessed, through a PCR real time Taqman amplification assay, the transcription levels of six IFN-I stimulated genes, IFN-II and three of its sensitive genes, three IFN-lIIs, as well as of TRIM28, SETDB1, pol genes of HERV-H, -K, and -W families, and of env genes of Syncytin (SYN)1, SYN2, and multiple sclerosis-associated retrovirus (MRSV) in peripheral blood from COVID-19 children and in control uninfected subjects. Higher expression levels of IFN-I and IFN-II inducible genes were observed in 36 COVID-19 children with mild or moderate disease as compared to uninfected controls, whereas their concentrations decreased in 17 children with severe disease and in 11 with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Similar findings were found for the expression of TRIM-28, SETDB1, and every HERV gene. Positive correlations emerged between the transcriptional levels of type I and II IFNs, TRIM28, SETDB1, and HERVs in COVID-19 patients. IFN-III expressions were comparable in each group of subjects. This preserved induction of IFN-s could contribute to the better control of the infection in children as compared to adults, in whom IFN-III deficiency has been reported. The upregulation of IFN-I, IFN-II, TRIM28, SETDB1, and HERVs in children with mild symptoms, their declines in severe cases or with MIS-C, and the positive correlations of their transcription in SARS-CoV-2-infected children suggest that they may play important roles in conditioning the evolution of the infection.","output":"COVID-19 in Children: Expressions of Type I/II/III Interferons, TRIM28, SETDB1, and Endogenous Retroviruses in Mild and Severe Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel wearable devices for heart rhythm analysis using either photoplethysmography (PPG) or electrocardiogram (ECG) are in daily clinical practice.

The online survey included 22 questions, focusing on the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF) based on wearable rhythm device recordings, suitable indications for wearable rhythm devices, data presentation and processing, reimbursement, and future perspectives. A total of 539 respondents {median age 38 [interquartile range (IQR) 34-46] years, 29% female} from 51 countries world-wide completed the survey. Whilst most respondents would diagnose AF (83%), fewer would initiate oral anticoagulation therapy based on a single-lead ECG tracing. Significantly fewer still (27%) would make the diagnosis based on PPG-based tracing. Wearable ECG technology is acceptable for the majority of respondents for screening, diagnostics, monitoring, and follow-up of arrhythmia patients, while respondents were more reluctant to use PPG technology for these indications. Most respondents (74%) would advocate systematic screening for AF using wearable rhythm devices, starting at patients' median age of 60 (IQR 50-65) years. Thirty-six percent of respondents stated that there is no reimbursement for diagnostics involving wearable rhythm devices in their countries.

By tracing the development of sanitary regulations for aerial navigation, from their origins in the 1920s through the twentieth century in particular, we document the emergence of a series of public health interventions that were designed to limit the public health threat associated with increased international air travel and the concomitant rise in the mobility of infectious diseases. From inoculation certificates to quarantine and the routine disinsection of passenger aircraft with powerful insecticides, modern air travel is replete with a complex set of procedures designed to lessen the risks associated with flying between different climatic and ecological zones. Our detailed examination of the historical context in which these procedures were devised and implemented leads us to consider the importance of time and space, power and efficacy, to the development of a more nuanced understanding of the shifting public health response to an increasingly fluid, mobile, and inter-connected society.","output":"Of plagues, planes and politics: Controlling the global spread of infectious diseases by air"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present to you a case of life-threatening haemoptysis secondary to non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis complicated by bronchial artery pseudoaneurysms.

The MHU program began as a location-based SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy coordinated with local and state public health agencies. Community needs motivated further program expansion to include additional preventive healthcare and social services. MHU deployment was targeted to disease hotspots based on publicly available SARS-CoV-2 testing data and community-level information about social vulnerability. This formative evaluation explores whether our MHU deployment strategy enabled us to reach patients from communities with heightened social vulnerability as intended.

BRD is a multifactorial disease resulting from the interaction between environmental stressors and infectious agents. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying BRD are not fully understood yet. Therefore, this study aimed to use a systems biology approach to systematically evaluate this disorder to better understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for BRD. Methods: Previously published RNA-seq data from whole blood of 18 healthy and 25 BRD samples were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and then analyzed. Next, two distinct methods of weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), i.e., moduleCtrait relationships (MTRs) and module preservation (MP) analysis were used to identify significant highly correlated modules with clinical traits of BRD and non-preserved modules between healthy and BRD samples, respectively. After identifying respective modules by the two mentioned methods of WGCNA, functional enrichment analysis was performed to extract the modules that are biologically related to BRD. Gene coexpression networks based on the hub genes from the candidate modules were then integrated with proteinCprotein interaction (PPI) networks to identify hubChub genes and potential transcription factors (TFs). Results: Four significant highly correlated modules with clinical traits of BRD as well as 29 non-preserved modules were identified by MTRs and MP methods, respectively. Among them, two significant highly correlated modules (identified by MTRs) and six nonpreserved modules (identified by MP) were biologically associated with immune response, pulmonary inflammation, and pathogenesis of BRD. After aggregation of gene coexpression networks based on the hub genes with PPI networks, a total of 307 hubChub genes were identified in the eight candidate modules. Interestingly, most of these hubChub genes were reported to play an important role in the immune response and BRD pathogenesis. Among the eight candidate modules, the turquoise (identified by MTRs) and purple (identified by MP) modules were highly biologically enriched in BRD. Moreover, STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, IRF7, and IRF9 TFs were suggested to play an important role in the immune system during BRD by regulating the coexpressed genes of these modules. Additionally, a gene set containing several hubChub genes was identified in the eight candidate modules, such as TLR2, TLR4, IL10, SOCS3, GZMB, ANXA1, ANXA5, PTEN, SGK1, IFI6, ISG15, MX1, MX2, OAS2, IFIH1, DDX58, DHX58, RSAD2, IFI44, IFI44L, EIF2AK2, ISG20, IFIT5, IFITM3, OAS1Y, HERC5, and PRF1, which are potentially critical during infection with agents of bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC). Conclusion: This study not only helps us to better understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for BRD but also suggested eight candidate modules along with several promising hubChub genes as diagnosis biomarkers and therapeutic targets for BRD.","output":"Integrated Network Analysis to Identify Key Modules and Potential Hub Genes Involved in Bovine Respiratory Disease: A Systems Biology Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study analyzes the situation on the labor market in four regions of the Volga Federal District of the Russian Federation in the context of a professional group of engineering and technical specialties.

RECENT FINDINGS: New data strengthen the evidence against a causal link between MS and vaccination. Recent consensus statements agree on the need to start vaccination early. Timings for vaccine administration should be adjusted to ensure safety and optimize vaccine responses, given the potential interference of DMDs. Patients treated with Ocrelizumab (and potentially other B-cell depleting therapies) are at risk of diminished immunogenicity to vaccines. This has relevant implications for the upcoming vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. SUMMARY: An early assessment and immunization of MS patients allows optimizing vaccine responses and avoiding potential interference with treatment plans. Vaccinations are safe and effective but some specific considerations should be followed when vaccinating before, during, and after receiving immunotherapy. A time-window for vaccination taking into account the kinetics of B cell repopulation could potentially improve vaccine responses. Further understanding of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine response dynamics in MS patients under specific therapies will be key for defining the best vaccination strategy.","output":"Vaccinations in multiple sclerosis patients receiving disease-modifying drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to evaluate whether a digital thoracic drainage system (group D) is clinically useful compared with a traditional thoracic drainage system (group T) in chest tube management following anatomic lung resection. METHODS Patients scheduled to undergo segmentectomy or lobectomy were prospectively randomized before surgery to group D or T. A stratification randomization was performed according to the following air leak risk factors: age, sex, smoking status, and presence of emphysema and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The primary end point was the duration of chest tube placement. RESULTS No statistically significant differences were found between groups D (n = 135) and T (n = 164) with regard to the duration of chest tube placement (median, 2.0 vs 3.0 days; P = .149), duration of hospitalization (median, 6.0 vs 7.0 days; P = .548), or frequency of postoperative adverse events (25.1% vs 20.7%; P = .361). In subgroup analyses of the 64 patients with postoperative air leak (20 in group D and 44 in group T), the duration of chest tube placement (median, 4.5 vs 4.0 days; P = .225) and duration of postoperative air leak (median, 3.0 vs 3.0 days; P = .226) were not significantly different between subgroups.

However, the relative severity of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs in children is unknown. MethodsThis retrospective single-center cohort study was performed at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Childrens Hospital of Chicago, academic free-standing childrens hospital. We included all children [] 18 years-old diagnosed with COVID-19 between October 15th, 2020 and August 31st, 2021 and whose SARS-CoV-2 isolate was sequenced using the Illumina platform. For each patient sample, we identified the SARS-CoV-2 lineage, which was assigned to one of the following groups: Non-VOC, alpha VOC, beta VOC, gamma VOC, or delta VOC. We measured frequency of 5 markers of COVID-19 severity: hospitalization; COVID-19 pharmacologic treatment; respiratory support; intensive care unit admission; and severe disease as classified by the COVID-19 World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Progression Scale (severe disease; score [] 6). A series of logistic regression models were fitted to estimate odds of each severity marker with each VOC (in comparison to non-VOCs), adjusting for COVID-19 community incidence and demographic and clinical co-variates. ResultsDuring the study period, 2,025 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 1,422 (70.2%) had sufficient viral load to permit sequencing. Among the 499 (35.1%) patients whose isolate was sequenced, median (inter-quartile range) age was 7 (1,12) years; 256 (51.3%) isolates were a VOC: 96 (37.5%) alpha, 38 (14.8%) gamma, and 119 (46.5%) delta. After adjusting for age, Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, high-risk medical conditions, and COVID-19 community incidence, neither alpha nor delta was associated with severe COVID-19. Gamma was independently associated with hospitalization (OR 5.9, 95% CI 1.6-21.5, p=0.007), respiratory support (OR 8.3, 95% CI 1.5-56.3, p=0.02), and severe disease as classified by the WHO Clinical Progression Scale (OR 7.7, 95% CI 1.0-78.1, p=0.05). ConclusionsCompared to non-VOC COVID-19 infections, the gamma VOC, but not the alpha or delta VOCs, was associated with increased severity. These data suggest that recent increased in pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations are related to increased delta COVID-19 incidence rather than increased delta virulence in children.","output":"Severity of Illness Caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Variants of Concern in Children: A Single-Center Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following rising unemployment rates and consequent loss of income due to COVID-19, many people have been seeking meal assistance.

METHODS: Respondents completed an online survey between September and October 2020 to estimate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on a scale of 0C10 for different social and educational activities prior to the availability of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Demographic information and experiences during the pandemic were also collected. The risk assessment was emailed to three listservs of healthcare providers, including national listservs of pediatric (PID) and adult infectious diseases (AID) providers, and a listserv of general pediatric practitioners in the St Louis, USA metropolitan area. RESULTS: Respondents identified the highest risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in spending time in a bar, eating at a restaurant, and attending an indoor sporting event. In the school setting, lower risk was identified in elementary and daycare students compared to high school or university-level students. Comparatively, the risk of transmission to students and teachers was lower than the identified high-risk social activities. Factors increasing risk perception in social activities included the absence of children in the respondents household and female gender. For the school setting, AID providers perceived greater risk compared to PID providers or pediatric practitioners. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents identified high risk activities that were associated with a high density of participants in an indoor space where masks are removed for eating and drinking.

Initially, tetherin was shown to restrict replication of various enveloped viruses by inhibiting the release of budding virions from infected cells. More recently, it has become clear that tetherin also acts as a pattern recognition receptor inducing NF-B-dependent proinflammatory gene expression in virus infected cells. Whereas the ability to restrict virion release is highly conserved among mammalian tetherin orthologs and thus probably an ancient function of this protein, innate sensing seems to be an evolutionarily recent activity. The potent and broad antiviral activity of tetherin is reflected by the fact that many viruses evolved means to counteract this restriction factor. A continuous arms race with viruses has apparently driven the evolution of different isoforms of tetherin with different functional properties. Interestingly, tetherin has also been implicated in cellular processes that are unrelated to immunity, such as the organization of the apical actin network and membrane microdomains or stabilization of the Golgi apparatus. In this review, I summarize our current knowledge of the different functions of tetherin and describe the molecular strategies that viruses have evolved to antagonize or evade this multifunctional host restriction factor.","output":"Counteraction of the multifunctional restriction factor tetherin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is an acute viral zoonotic disease.

Measurements and Main ResultsAll patients were scanned using a standardized protocol including 12 lung zones and followed to determine clinical outcomes until hospital discharge and vital status at 28-days. Ultrasounds were independently reviewed for lung and pleural line artifacts and abnormalities, and the mean Lung Ultrasound Score (ranging from 0 to 3) across lung zones (mLUSS) was determined. The primary outcome was time to ICU-level care, defined as high flow oxygen, noninvasive, or mechanical ventilation, within 28-days of the initial ultrasound. Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for age and sex were fit for mLUSS and each ultrasound covariate. A total of 264 participants were enrolled in the study; the median age was 59 years and 114 (43.2) % of participants were female. The median mLUSS was 1 (interquartile range: 0.5 to 1.3). Following enrollment, 29 (11.0%) participants went on to require ICU-level care and 14 (5.3%) subsequently died by 28 days. Each increase in mLUSS at enrollment was associated with disease progression to ICU-level care (aHR = 3.63; 95% CI: 1.23 to 10.65) and 28-day mortality (aHR = 4.50; 95% CI: 1.52 to 13.31).

These diseases include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Ebola. With the current (SARS-CoV-2) global pandemic, it is critical to delineate appropriate contextual respiratory protection for HCWs. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) as part of respiratory protection versus another device (egN95/FFP2) on HCW infection rates and contamination. METHODS: Our primary outcomes included HCW infection rates with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, Ebola, or MERS when utilizing PAPR. We included randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and observational studies. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CENTRAL). Two reviewers independently screened all citations, full-text articles, and abstracted data. Due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity, we did not conduct a meta-analysis. Where applicable, we constructed evidence profile (EP) tables for each individual outcome. Confidence in cumulative evidence for each outcome was classified according to the GRADE system. RESULTS: We identified 689 studies during literature searches. We included 10 full-text studies. A narrative synthesis was provided. Two on-field studies reported no difference in the rates of healthcare workers performing airway procedures during the care of critical patients with SARS-CoV-2. A single simulation trial reported a lower level of cross-contamination of participants using PAPR compared to alternative respiratory protection. There is moderate quality evidence that PAPR use is associated with greater heat tolerance but lower scores for mobility and communication ability. We identified a trend towards greater self-reported wearer comfort with PAPR technology in low-quality observational simulation studies. CONCLUSION: Field observational studies do not indicate a difference in healthcare worker infection utilizing PAPR devices versus other compliant respiratory equipment. Greater heat tolerance accompanied by lower scores of mobility and audibility in PAPR was identified. Further pragmatic studies are needed in order to delineate actual effectiveness and provider satisfaction with PAPR technology.

Data was collected by means of an online questionnaire, which retrospectively investigated nostalgic music during the lockdown. Participants listened to a self-selected piece of music that they had listened to 3 months prior whichinduced feelings of nostalgia, reported their resulting emotion and the content of memories associated with their nostalgia, and completed a questionnaire rating their experienced effect of nostalgia in relation to their piece of music.

We observed a high 28-day mortality rate of patients that did not complete the 14-day treatment with proxalutamide, compared to the placebo arm. These differences may raise hypotheses to explain the wide differences between ITT and on-treatment (OT) analysis in terms of efficacy. Despite the inherent limitations of OT analysis, we aimed to respond to unanswered questions regarding the drug efficacy when the 14-day treatment with proxalutamide was complete, and secondarily understand the causality relationship between treatment interruption and mortality rate. MethodsThis is a post-hoc exploratory analysis of a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective, multicentric, two-arm RCT of 300mg-daily 14-day proxalutamide therapy for hospitalized COVID-19 patients not requiring mechanical ventilation. OT population excluded patients that did not complete the full 14-day course of therapy or died from COVID-19 complications within 24 hours of randomization. The primary outcome was the 28-day COVID-19 mortality rate. Secondary outcomes included median hospital length, 14-day and 28-day alive hospital discharge rate and 28-day all-cause mortality rate of those who discontinued intervention. ResultsIn total, 580 patients completed the 14-day treatment or died during treatment, including 288 patients in the proxalutamide arm and 292 patients in the placebo arm, with similar baseline characteristics between groups. The 28-day COVID-19 mortality rate was 4.2% in the proxalutamide group and 49.0% in the placebo group. The mortality risk ratio (RR) was 0.08 (95% CI, 0.05-0.15), with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 2.2 to prevent death. The median hospital length stay after randomization was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR] = 3 to 7.2 days) in the proxalutamide group and 9 days (IQR = 6 to 15 days) in the placebo group (p <0.001). The 28-day all-cause mortality rate of patients that received proxalutamide but interrupted treatment before 14 days was 79.3%, while those that received placebo and interrupted before 14 days was 52.8% (p = 0.054 between groups). ConclusionThe reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality rate with 14-day proxalutamide treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients was more significant while on treatment adhesion (92%), compared to the reduction when all patients enrolled in the proxalutamide arm were considered (77.7%). However, the magnitude of statistical significance of the reduction in all-cause mortality and the NNT were similar between the OT and ITT analysis. The apparent high mortality risk rate with early interruption of proxalutamide treatments suggests that strategies for treatment compliance should be reinforced for future RCTs with proxalutamide.

Those diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) may be negatively impacted by the global pandemic due to social isolation, feelings of loneliness or lack of access to care. This study seeks to assess the impact of the 1st lockdown C pre-, during and post C in adults with a recent history of MDD across multiple centres. METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis of an on-going cohort study, RADAR-MDD project, a multi-centre study examining the use of remote measurement technology (RMT) in monitoring MDD. Self-reported questionnaire and passive data streams were analysed from participants who had joined the project prior to 1st December 2019 and had completed Patient Health and Self-esteem Questionnaires during the pandemic (n = 252). We used mixed models for repeated measures to estimate trajectories of depressive symptoms, self-esteem, and sleep duration. RESULTS: In our sample of 252 participants, 48% (n = 121) had clinically relevant depressive symptoms shortly before the pandemic. For the sample as a whole, we found no evidence that depressive symptoms or self-esteem changed between pre-, during- and post-lockdown. However, we found evidence that mean sleep duration (in minutes) decreased significantly between during- and post- lockdown (? 12.16; 95% CI ? 18.39 to ? 5.92; p < 0.001). We also found that those experiencing clinically relevant depressive symptoms shortly before the pandemic showed a decrease in depressive symptoms, self-esteem and sleep duration between pre- and during- lockdown (interaction p = 0.047, p = 0.045 and p < 0.001, respectively) as compared to those who were not. CONCLUSIONS: We identified changes in depressive symptoms and sleep duration over the course of lockdown, some of which varied according to whether participants were experiencing clinically relevant depressive symptoms shortly prior to the pandemic. However, the results of this study suggest that those with MDD do not experience a significant worsening in symptoms during the first months of the Covid ? 19 pandemic.

Their biogenesis mostly utilizes exoribonucleases of host cells that degrade viral genomic or subgenomic RNAs in the 5'-to-3' direction until being stalled by well-defined RNA structures. Here we report a viral lncRNA that is produced by a novel replication-dependent mechanism. This lncRNA corresponds to the last 283 nucleotides of the turnip crinkle virus (TCV) genome, hence is designated tiny TCV subgenomic RNA (ttsgR). ttsgR accumulated to high levels in TCV-infected Nicotiana benthamiana cells when the TCV-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), also known as p88, was overexpressed. Both (+) and (-) strand forms of ttsgR were produced in a manner dependent on the RdRp functionality. Strikingly, templates as short as ttsgR itself were sufficient to program ttsgR amplification, as long as the TCV-encoded replication proteins, p28 and p88, were provided in trans. Consistent with its replicational origin, ttsgR accumulation required a 5' terminal carmovirus consensus sequence (CCS), a sequence motif shared by genomic and subgenomic RNAs of many viruses phylogenetically related to TCV. More importantly, introducing a new CCS motif elsewhere in the TCV genome was alone sufficient to cause the emergence of another lncRNA. Finally, abolishing ttsgR by mutating its 5' CCS gave rise to a TCV mutant that failed to compete with wildtype TCV in Arabidopsis. Collectively our results unveil a replication-dependent mechanism for the biogenesis of viral lncRNAs, thus suggesting that multiple mechanisms, individually or in combination, may be responsible for viral lncRNA production. Importance Many positive strand (+) RNA viruses produce long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) during the process of cellular infections, and mobilize these lncRNAs to counteract antiviral defenses, as well as coordinate the translation of viral proteins. Most viral lncRNAs arise from 5'-to-3' degradation of longer viral RNAs being stalled at stable secondary structures. We report a viral lncRNA that is produced by the replication machinery of turnip crinkle virus (TCV). This lncRNA, designated ttsgR, shares the terminal characteristics with TCV genomic and subgenomic RNAs, and over-accumulates in the presence of moderately overexpressed TCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Furthermore, templates that are of similar sizes as ttsgR itself are readily replicated by TCV replication proteins (p28 and RdRp) provided from non-viral sources. In summary, this study establishes an approach for uncovering low abundance viral lncRNAs, and characterizes a replicating TCV lncRNA. Similar investigations on human-pathogenic (+) RNA viruses could yield novel therapeutic targets.","output":"Replication-dependent biogenesis of turnip crinkle virus long noncoding RNAs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A COVID-19 pandemic-related rise in suicide rates has been predicted due to social isolation, fear, uncertainty, economic turndown and grief. Detecting an increase in suicide rates is difficult in the absence of real-time data. Alternative data sources for such trends in psychopathology and suicidal behavior must be sought. METHODS: Data from a national chat-based crisis hotline for the first half of 2019 (pre-COVID-19), were compared to data from the first half of 2020 (during COVID-19). Chat sessions were classified by content and demographics and the data compared between the two time periods. OUTCOME: Total chats (n = 6756) were 48% higher during COVID-19 (p < .05). Suicide-related chat (SRC) number was also higher, although the proportion relative to all chats was slightly lower during COVID-19, compared to pre-COVID-19 (p < .05). SRCs increased during the COVID-19 lockdown. The number of severe SRCs resulting in urgent police intervention, increased during the lockdown (April-May 2020) compared with the same period in 2019 (p = .04). Issues of anxiety were higher in 2020 (19.4%) vs. 2019 (16.5%) (p < .00001) while issues of depression were lower (22.4% vs 33%, respectively) (p < .00001). The overall use of chats among adults aged >50 yrs increased during COVID-19 and likewise, the rate of SRCs in this age-group increased 30-fold in this period when compared to pre-COVID-19 (p < .00001). SRCs included more women than men (p < .0001) in both pre-COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 period, when the proportion of women increased from 62% in 2019 to 73% during COVID-19 (p < .0001). INTERPRETATION: The rise in total chats, SRCs and SRCs resulting in police action, commenced during lockdown and was ameliorated by end of the lockdown, indicating that distress created by the lockdown was more impactful than mourning deaths of loved ones, fear and uncertainty, because all these factors persisted beyond the end of the lockdown. Older populations were probably more distressed due to greater risk and less adaptability to isolation, social media and staying home. More calls by women may reflect women's better help-seeking capacity. The increase in SRCs indicates the potential for more suicides and the need for bolstering mental health services and reach-out to older people during pandemic lock-downs.","output":"Suicide-related calls to a national crisis chat hotline service during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AREAS COVERED: This review article summarizes the most important synthetic PLA2 inhibitors developed to target each one of the four major types of human PLA2 (cytosolic cPLA2, calcium-independent iPLA2, secreted sPLA2, and lipoprotein-associated Lp-PLA2), discussing their in vitro and in vivo activities as well as their recent applications and therapeutic properties.

The scale and determinants of antibiotic use in the early phase of the pandemic, and whether antibiotic prescribing is beneficial to treatment effectiveness in COVID-19 patients, are still unknown. Unwarranted treatment of this viral infection with antibiotics may exacerbate the problem of antibiotic resistance, while antibiotic resistance may render presumptive treatment of secondary infections in COVID-19 patients ineffective. Methods: This rapid review was undertaken to identify studies reporting antimicrobial use in the treatment of hospitalised COVID-19 patients. The review was conducted to comply with PRISMA guidelines for Scoping Reviews (http://www.prisma-statement.org/Extensions/ScopingReviews) and the protocol was registered with the Open Science Framework (OSF): http://osf.io/vp6t5. The following databases: Web of Science, EMBASE, PubMed, CNKI & VIP were searched to identify the relevant studies from 1 Dec 2019 up to 15 June 2020; no limits were set on the language or the country where studies were conducted. The search terms used were: ((Covid-19 or SARS-CoV-2 or Coronavirus disease 2019 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) and ((antibiotic prescribing or antibiotic use or antibiotic*) or antimicrobial* or antimicrobial therapy or antimicrobial resistance or antimicrobial stewardship)). A total of 1216 records were identified through database searching and 118 clinical studies met the inclusion criteria and were taken into data extraction. A bespoke data extraction form was developed and validated through two independent, duplicate extraction of data from five Records. As all the included studies were descriptive in nature, we conducted descriptive synthesis of data and reported pooled estimates such as mean, percentage and frequency. We created a series of scenarios to capture the range of rationales for antibiotic prescribing presented in the included studies. Results: Our results show that during the early phase of the pandemic, 8501 out of 10 329 COVID-19 patients (82.3%) were prescribed antibiotics; antibiotics were prescribed for COVID-19 patients regardless of reported severity, with a similar mean antibiotic prescribing rate between patients with severe or critical illness (75.4%) and patients with mild or moderate illness (75.1%). The top five frequently prescribed antibiotics for hospitalised COVID-19 patients were azithromycin (28.0 % of studies), ceftriaxone (17.8%), moxifloxacin (14.4%), meropenem (14.4%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (12.7%). The proportion of patients prescribed antibiotics without clinical justification was 51.5% vs 41.9 % for patients with mild or moderate illness and those with severe or critical illness respectively. Comparison of patients who were provided antibiotics with a clinical justification with those who were given antibiotics without clinical justification showed lower mortality rates (9.5% vs 13.1%), higher discharge rates (80.9% vs 69.3%) and shorter length of hospital of stay (9.3 days vs 12.2 days). Only 9.7% of patients in our included studies were reported to have secondary infections. Conclusions: Antibiotics were prescribed indiscriminately for hospitalised COVID-19 patients regardless of severity of illness during the early phase of the pandemic. COVID-19 related concerns and lack of knowledge drove a large proportion of antibiotic use without specific clinical justification.

Based on results as obtained on the first and fourth weeks after admission, five indices consisting of NLR, white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes (LY) and monocytes (MON) were selected to generate receiver operating characteristic curves, while optimal cutoff values, sensitivities and specificities were obtained according to the Yuden index. Statistically significant differences in neutrophils, LY and the NLR were present in the severe vs. moderate COVID-19 group from the first to the fourth week of their hospitalisation. The cut-off value of NLR for predicting the severity of COVID-19 was 4.425, with a sensitivity of 0.855 and a specificity of 0.979. A statistically significant positive correlation was present between PCT and NLR in the severe group as determined within the first week of admission. NLR can serve as a predictor of COVID-19 disease severity as patients' progress from the first to the fourth week of their hospitalisation. The statistically significant positive correlation between levels of NLR and PCT in severe patients indicated that increases in NLR were accompanied with gradual increases in PCT.","output":"Relationship between changes in the course of COVID-19 and ratio of neutrophils-to-lymphocytes and related parameters in patients with severe vs. common disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on a global scale urges prompt and effective countermeasures. Recently, a study has reported that coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is associated with a decrease in albumin level, an increase in NETosis, blood coagulation, and cytokine level. Here, we present drug-loaded albumin nanoparticles as a therapeutic agent to resolve the clinical outcomes observed in severe SARS-CoV-2 patients. PEGylated nanoparticle albumin-bound (PNAB) was used to promote prolonged bioactivity of steroidal ginsenoside saponins, PNAB-Rg6 and PNAB-Rgx365. Our data indicate that the application of PNAB-steroidal ginsenoside can effectively reduce histone H4 and NETosis-related factors in the plasma, and alleviate SREBP2-mediated systemic inflammation in the PBMCs of SARS-CoV-2 ICU patients. The engineered blood vessel model confirmed that these drugs are effective in suppressing blood clot formation and vascular inflammation. Moreover, the animal model experiment showed that these drugs are effective in promoting the survival rate by alleviating tissue damage and cytokine storm. Altogether, our findings suggest that these PNAB-steroidal ginsenoside drugs have potential applications in the treatment of symptoms associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 patients, such as coagulation and cytokine storm.","output":"PEGylated nanoparticle albumin-bound steroidal ginsenoside derivatives ameliorate SARS-CoV-2-mediated hyper-inflammatory responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives We aim to assess the evidence on the usefulness of post-vaccination testing of Covid-19 antibodies.

However, the factors and mechanisms behind the persistence and prevalence of human rabies have not become well understood. The monthly data of human rabies cases reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health exhibits a periodic pattern on an annual base. The cases in the summer and autumn are significantly higher than in the spring and winter. Based on this observation, we propose a susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered (SEIRS) model with periodic transmission rates to investigate the seasonal rabies epidemics. We evaluate the basic reproduction number R (0), analyze the dynamical behavior of the model, and use the model to simulate the monthly data of human rabies cases reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health. We also carry out some sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number R (0) in terms of various model parameters. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is more reasonable to regard R (0) rather than the average basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] or the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] of the corresponding autonomous system as a threshold for the disease.

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), which uses nucleic acid amplification tests to detect viral fragments, is a reliable proxy of COVID-19 incidence and prevalence, and thus offers the potential to monitor VOC viral load in a given population.

We evaluated the utility of high-resolution C-arm CT combined with streak metal artifact removal technology for stent-assisted embolization of intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS From October 2017 to July 2018, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University treated 107 patients with intracranial aneurysms (118 aneurysms in total) with stent-assisted embolization. Conventional C-arm CT and high-resolution C-arm CT scanning of the stented area were performed during and after treatment. 3D images were reconstructed with and without streak metal artifact removal techniques. Subsequently, the image quality was compared. The reconstructed images indicated the stent deployment degree and packing density. Follow-up assessments included clinical and angiographic outcomes and complications. RESULTS In total, 118 aneurysms were successfully embolized using 118 stents. Image quality was significantly higher (P < .05) with high-resolution C-arm CT combined with streak metal artifact removal reconstruction. Streak metal artifact removal reconstruction and 2D angiography at working angles showed incomplete deployment of 6 stents and incomplete aneurysm embolization of 15 patients, which were subsequently resolved. One case of hemorrhage was noted postoperatively. Follow-up of 93 patients at 6-13 months indicated 3 cases of aneurysm recurrence. CONCLUSIONS High-resolution C-arm CT combined with the streak metal artifact removal technique effectively reduced metal artifacts from stents and coils during aneurysm embolization.

Methods: Test results for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies of 221 confirmed COVID-19 patients were retrospectively examined, and their clinical data were collected and analyzed based on various subgroups. SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were determined with the chemiluminescence method. Findings: The concentration (S/CO) of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies peaked on day 19-21 after symptom onset, with a median of 17.38 (IQR 4.39-36.4) for IgM and 5.59 (IQR 0.73-13.65) for IgG. Detection rates reached highest on day 16-18 and day 19-21 for IgM and IgG, which were 73.6% and 98.6%, respectively, with significantly higher concentration of IgG in critically ill patients than in those with mild to moderate disease (P=0.027). The concentration of the antibodies on day 16-21 is not correlated with the course or outcome of the disease (Spearman r < 0.20, P > 0.05). Nasopharyngeal swabs revealed positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in up to 52.7% of recovered patients after discharge, whose IgG proved to be significantly lower than that of those with negative RNA results (P = 0.009). IgG and IgM were tested twice within 14 days after discharge with a 7-day interval, and the second testing of these antibodies displayed a decrease in concentration of 21.2% (IQR, 11.2%34.48%) for IgG and 23.05% (IQR, -27.96%46.13%) for IgM, without statistical significance between the patients with re-detectable positive RNA results and those with negative RNA results after discharge. However, those with positive results experienced a count decrease in lymphocyte subsets. Interpretation: The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies peaked on day 19-21 after symptom onset, and antibody testing on day 16-21 is associated with increased detection rates, but the antibody concentration does not affect the course and outcome of the infection.

As the immune microenvironment may play a role in clinical progression, it is crucial to examine molecular interactions to gain insight into host response. Therefore, to elucidate any differences in host response related to age, the present study imputed ligand-receptor interactions within the nasopharyngeal immune microenvironment in patients affected with SARS-COV-2. Tissue purities, the proportion of non-immune cells in the tissue sample, of 467 nasopharyngeal transcriptome profiles were estimated using known mRNA expression signatures of stromal/immune cells. Using the purity estimates and bulk tissue expression values, non-negative linear regression was used to estimate average expression of each gene in the stromal/tumor compartments. The inferred expression profiles were annotated with a curated database of ligand-receptor interactions and assumed as reasonable proxies for the law of mass action, allowing for quantification of directional ligand-receptor complex concentrations under equilibrium. It was found that older patients (>60 years) exhibited decreased interactions with receptors selectin L receptor SELL and increased interactions with pro-inflammatory chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CCR1. Younger patients showed increased interactions with various members of the TNF receptor super family (TNFRSF). The interactions were further related to immune cell subtypes, with older patients predicted to have less CD8+ and CD4+ resting T cells but increased neutrophil proportions.

The demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and cluster characteristics were described and analyzed. RESULTS From January 27 to February 13, 2020, a total of 10 individuals were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 by the nucleic acid testing of nasopharyngeal swabs from 2 families and 1 hospital. Among the confirmed cases, 7 had atypical clinical symptoms and 3 were asymptomatic. The median times from onset to diagnosis and to discharge were 3.5 days (range, 1-5 days) and 19.5 days (range, 16-38 days), respectively. There were 4 patients whose exposure dates were 1, 3, 3, and 2 days earlier than the onset dates of their previous-generation cases, respectively. Four prevention and control measures were effectively used to interrupt the disease transmission. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 can be easily transmitted within families and in hospitals, and asymptomatic patients could act as a source of disease transmission. The results of this outbreak at the early epidemic stage support the recommendation that individuals with confirmed COVID-19 and all their close contacts should be subjected to medical quarantined observation and nucleic acid screening as early as possible, even if they do not have any symptoms.

An adverse effect of its use is reactivation of latent infections, such as tuberculosis (TB). TB is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and continues to be an important public health problem in some developing countries, such as Brazil.

Authorities had to communicate with the public regularly to explain and ensure compliance with these measures and promote safety. The information given by authorities was mainly developed for adults, but children and adolescents may have different needs when it comes to information. This study examined how adolescents perceived information about Covid-19 provided by the media and other sources, and about what topics adolescents reported they lacked information during the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: Three hundred seventy-seven adolescents in 11th, 12th, and 13th grade in Norwegian upper secondary schools (67% girls) completed an online questionnaire. Analyses included descriptive statistics, in addition to Generalized Linear Mixed Models analyses to examine gender differences in adolescents satisfaction with the information provided about Covid-19, to what extent the pandemic affected their everyday life, and to what extent they were concerned about becoming infected with Covid-19. RESULTS: The results showed that the majority of adolescents used the internet as the main source of information about Covid-19, followed by (online) newspapers. About half (49%) reported that they were satisfied with the information available, while 39% were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, and 12% were dissatisfied. Adolescents wanted more information about the school situation, as well as virus- and future-related topics. A total of 21% reported that they were concerned about becoming infected with Covid-19. There was no significant gender difference in overall satisfaction with the information provided about Covid-19. Girls reported being significantly more affected by the pandemic than boys, and that they were significantly more concerned than boys about becoming infected with Covid-19.

Potential harm to self and baby due to COVID-19 infection as well as uncertainties about delivery are among contributors to maternal anxiety. We aimed to assess the prevalence of psychological distress among pregnant women during the Malaysian Movement Control Order (MCO). Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between May and June 2020 in a teaching hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. A self-administered electronic questionnaire was distributed which included the following; (1) Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS 21), (2) Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS), (3) MCO effect questionnaire, and (4) newly designed COVID-19 pregnancy-related anxiety. Chi-square test and logistic regression were performed to determine significant associations whilst mean scores comparison were conducted through Mann-Whitney-U-test. Results: Four hundred and fifteen women were included in the final analysis. The prevalence of psychological distress among our cohort was 14.7%; with a two-fold increase of risk among the non-Malays (AOR 1.98, 95% CI 1.00C3.89) whilst a greater number of social support showed a protective effect (AOR 0.51, 95%CI 0.28C0.92). Malay ethnicity (p < 0.001) alongside greater household income (p = 0.014) were positive predictors of a higher sense of maternal wellbeing. Multiparous women and those of higher economic status experienced the more negative effect of the MCO. Around 88% of our women reported a higher level of COVID-19 pregnancy-related anxiety. Younger (p = 0.017) and first-time mothers (p = 0.039) were more likely to be anxious. Although adequate maternal knowledge on COVID-19 was associated with a greater sense of maternal wellbeing (p = 0.028), it was also linked to a higher level of COVID-19 related anxiety (AOR 3.54, 95% 1.29C9.70). Conclusion: There was a relatively low prevalence of psychological distress among expectant mothers in Malaysia during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Expectant mothers should receive accurate and reliable information on the effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy to relieve some maternal anxiety.

Though it is a simplification to suggest that women are a uniquely privileged group in this respect, it remains true that the instability of lockdowns and their aftermath, in the UK and elsewhere, has taken a specific toll on women's modes of experiencing and inhabiting the world.

The concept of cytokine storm syndromes (CSS) encompasses diverse conditions or circumstances that coalesce around potentially lethal hyperinflammation with hemodynamic compromise and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a prototypic form of CSS that develops in the context of rheumatic diseases, particularly systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The treatment of MAS relies heavily upon corticosteroids and cytokine inhibitors, which have proven to be lifesaving therapies in MAS, as well as in other forms of CSS. Within months of the recognition of SARS-CoV2 as a human pathogen, descriptions of COVID-19 patients with hyperinflammation emerged. Physicians immediately grappled with identifying optimal therapeutic strategies for these patients, and despite clinical distinctions such as marked coagulopathy with endothelial injury associated with COVID-19, borrowed from the experiences with MAS and other CSS. Initial reports of patients treated with anti-cytokine agents in COVID-19 were promising, but recent large, better-controlled studies of these agents have had mixed results suggesting a more complex pathophysiology.

OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to describe the current landscape of POCT in Wisconsin community pharmacies and identify opportunities for the advancement of testing and the key factors influencing the realization of these opportunities. METHODS: A survey was administered over the telephone to pharmacy managers of community pharmacies in Wisconsin. The sites were randomly selected from predefined geographic regions to mirror pharmacy distribution across Wisconsin. The survey items evaluated provision of POCT, future direction of POCT, barriers and motivators to offering POCT, and pharmacy demographics. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis were used to analyze data. RESULTS: Pharmacy managers from 147 of the 938 registered community pharmacies (15.7%) participated in the survey. Only 17.1% of the pharmacies were offering POCT; however, 48.3% of managers reported that their pharmacy would likely implement or expand POCT within the next 5 years. The most commonly reported barriers to initiating or expanding POCT were the limitations on pharmacist availability to oversee testing and workflow restrictions. Continuing to advance the pharmacy profession was a top reason for offering or expanding testing services. DISCUSSION: While few pharmacies are offering POCT in Wisconsin, there is motivation for expansion in coming years. Understanding, anticipating and addressing common barriers can faciliate this process.

However, there is a consistent need for comprehensive and standardized ultrasound training to improve ultrasound knowledge, manual skills, and workflow understanding of nonphysician providers. MATERIALS AND METHODS Our team designed a multimodal ultrasound course to improve ultrasound knowledge, manual skills, and workflow understanding of nine Special Operations combat medics and Special Operations tactical medics. The course was based on a flipped classroom model with a total time of 43 hours, consisting of an online component followed by live lectures and hands-on workshops. The effectiveness of the course was determined using a knowledge exam, expert ratings of manual skills using a global rating scale, and an objective structured clinical skills examination (OSCE). RESULTS The average knowledge exam score of the medics increased from pre-course (56%  6.8%) to post-course (80%  5.0%, p < .001). Based on expert ratings, their manual skills improved from baseline to day 4 of the course for image finding (p = .007), image optimization (p = .008), image acquisition speed (p = .008), final image quality (p = .008), and global assessment (p = .008).

The aims were to explore the toxic effect and mechanism of BAC (C12) on M. aeruginosa growth within 96 h via morphological, physiological, and the relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomics variations. The results found that BAC(C12) significantly inhibited cell density of M. aeruginosa at concentrations from 1 mg/L to 10 mg/L, and the 96-h EC50 value was identified to be 3.61 mg/L. Under EC50 concentration, BAC(C12) depressed the photosynthesis activities of M. aeruginosa exhibited by 36% decline of the maximum quantum yield for primary photochemistry (Fv/Fm) value and denaturation of photosynthetic organelle, caused oxidative stress response displayed by the increase of three indexes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and destroyed the integrity of cell membranes demonstrated by TEM images and the increase of ex-cellular substances. Then, the iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis demonstrated that BAC(C12) depressed photosynthesis activities through inhibiting the expressions of photosynthetic protein and photosynthetic electron transport related proteins. The suppression of electron transport also led to the increase of superoxide radicals and then posed oxidative stress on cell. Meantime, the 63.63% ascent of extracellular microcystin production of M. aeruginosa was observed, attributing to the high expression of microcystin synthesis proteins and the damage of cell membrane. In sum, BAC(C12) exposure inhibited the growth of M. aeruginosa mainly by depressing photosynthesis, inducing oxidative stress, and breaking the cell membrane. And, it enhanced the release of microcystin from the cyanobacterial cells via up-regulating the microcystin synthesis proteins and inducing the membrane damage, which could enlarge its toxicity to aquatic species.","output":"Benzalkonium chlorides (C12) inhibits growth but motivates microcystins release of Microcystis aeruginosa revealed by morphological, physiological, and iTRAQ investigation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: We selectively place carotid shunting when ipsilateral mean stump pressure is less than 40 mmHg during carotid endarterectomy (CEA). This study aimed to assess the validity of our selective shunting criterion by 1D-0D hemodynamic simulation technology. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 88 patients (95 cases) of CEA and divided them into two groups based on the degree of contralateral internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis ratio, which was determined as severe when the peak systolic velocity ratio of the ICA to the common carotid artery was 4 by carotid duplex ultrasonography. Patients with severe stenosis or occlusion in contralateral ICA were classified as hypoperfusion group, and those without such contralateral ICA obstruction were classified as control group. Results: Perioperatively, the mean carotid stump pressures were 33 mmHg in hypoperfusion group and 46 mmHg in the control group (P=0.006). We simulated changes in carotid stump pressure according to the changes in the contralateral ICA stenosis ratio. 1D-0D simulation indicated a sharp decline in carotid stump pressure when the contralateral stenosis ratio was >50%, while peripheral pressure of the middle cerebral arteries declined sharply at a 70% contralateral stenosis ratio. At this ratio, the direction of the ipsilateral cerebral arterial flow became inverted, the carotid stump pressure became dependent on the basilar artery circulation, and the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery became hypoperfused. Conclusion: Our clinical and computer-simulated results confirmed the validation of our carotid shunting criterion and suggested that contralateral ICA stenosis ratio over 70% is a safe indication of selective shunting during CEA.","output":"Carotid Stump Pressure and Contralateral Internal Carotid Stenosis Ratio During Carotid Endarterectomies: 1D-0D Hemodynamic Simulation of Cerebral Perfusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The proceedings contain 17 papers.

In this work, we implemented a 3D model of intestine and liver slices from hamsters that were infected ex vivo with virulent E. histolytica trophozoites. Results show preserved histology in both uninfected tissues as well as ulcerations, destruction of the epithelial cells, and inflammatory reaction in intestine slices and formation of micro abscesses, and the presence of amoebae in the sinusoidal spaces and in the interior of central veins in liver slices. The three chemically synthetized compounds T-001, T-011, and T-016, which act as amoebicides in vitro, were active in both infected tissues, as they decreased the number of trophozoites, and provoked death by disintegration of the amoeba, similar to metronidazole. However, compound T-011 induced signs of cytotoxicity to liver slices. Our results suggest that ex vivo cultures of precision-cut intestinal and liver slices represent a reliable 3D approach to evaluate novel amoebicidal compounds, and to simultaneously detect their toxicity, while reducing the number of experimental animals commonly required by other model systems.","output":"Development of a Novel Ex-vivo 3D Model to Screen Amoebicidal Activity on Infected Tissue"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are now several reports on neurologic features of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection.(1 2) In a recent study of 214 patients with COVID\\\\19, 78 (36.4%) patients had neurological manifestations, including headache, dizziness, acute cerebrovascular diseases, and impaired consciousness.(2)","output":"Guillain\\\\Barr syndrome in a patient with antibodies against SARS\\\\COV\\\\2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak is a global public health issue, having profound effects on most aspects of societal well-being, including physical and mental health. A plethora of studies, globally, have suggested the existence of a sex disparity in the outcome of COVID-19 patients, that is mainly due to mechanisms of viral infection, immune response to the virus, development of a hyperinflammation, and development of systemic complications, particularly thromboembolism. These differences appear to be more pronounced in elderly COVID-19 patients. Epidemiological data report a sex difference in the severity and outcome of COVID-19 disease with a more favourable course of the disease in women compared to men, regardless of age range although the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to be similar in both sexes. Sex hormones, including androgens and estrogens, may not only impact viral entry and load, but also shape the clinical manifestations, complications and, ultimately, the outcome of COVID-19 disease. The current review comprehensively summarizes current literature on sex disparities in susceptibility and outcomes of COVID-19 disease as well as the literature underpinning the pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms, which may provide a rationale to a sex disparity. These include sex hormone influences on molecules that facilitate virus entry and priming, as well as the immune and inflammatory response, as well as coagulation and thrombosis diathesis. Based on present evidence, women appear to be relatively protected from COVID-19 because of a more effective immune response and a less pronounced systemic inflammation, with consequent moderate clinical manifestations of the disease, together with a lesser predisposition to thromboembolism. Conversely, men appear to be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 disease because of a less effective immune response with consequent increased susceptibility to infections, together with a greater predisposition to thromboembolism. In elderlies, sex disparities in overall mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection is even more palpable, as elderly men appear more prone to severe COVID-19 because of a greater predisposition to infections, a weaker immune defence and an enhanced thrombotic state compared to women.

METHODS: Institutional Review Board evaluation and written consent was not indicated as the data does not pertain to any human subjects. Data files pertaining to new membership activity, posts, comments and reactions of eight closed Facebook groups. The pandemic group was defined as March 19th to April 30, 2020. The pre-pandemic group was defined as February 6th, to March 18th, 2020. The percentage increase of new memberships, posts, comments and reactions were calculated for each period. A two-tailed t-test, using a significance level of 0.05 was used to evaluate significance. RESULTS: A statistically significant increase in membership during the pandemic period was noted for each group. In regards to posts, the Flex Endo, Acute Care, Colorectal, Foregut, and Bariatric groups were noted to have a statistically significant increase in the pandemic period.

This potential relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and clock genes, coupled with previously reported effects of night shift work on health, leads us to hypothesize that night shift workers may be at an increased physiological risk of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Shift work, especially night shift work, has long been associated with several chronic health conditions. The mechanisms that drive these associations are not well understood; however, current literature suggests that the disruption of circadian rhythms may cause downstream hormonal and immune effects that render night shift workers more susceptible to disease. First, circadian rhythms may play a role in the mechanism of viral infection, as viral vaccines administered in the morning elicit greater immune responses than those administered in the afternoon. Next, increased exposure to light at night may inhibit the production of melatonin, which has been observed to enhance DNA repair and shown to upregulate expression of Bmal1, an established inhibitor of herpes simplex virus and influenza. Finally, abnormal immune cell and cytokine levels have been observed following night-shift work.

We use high-resolution spatial data on household internet traffic as a surrogate for adaptation to home-based work, together with the geographical clustering of occupation types, to investigate the relationship between occupational factors and increased internet traffic during work hours under lockdown in two Australian cities. By testing our hypothesis based on the observed trends, and exploring demographic factors associated with divergences from our hypothesis, we are left with a picture of unequal impact dominated by two major influences: the types of occupations in which people are engaged, and the composition of households and families. During lockdown, increased internet traffic was correlated with income security and, when school activity was conducted remotely, to the proportion of families with children. Our findings suggest that response planning and provision of social and economic support for residents within lockdown areas should explicitly account for income security and household structure.

We previously showed that T-705 is able to significantly inhibit the replication of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an arbovirus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, in mammalian cells and in mouse models. In contrast, the effect of T-705 on CHIKV infection and replication in the mosquito vector is unknown. Since the antiviral activity of T-705 has been shown to be cell line-dependent, we studied here its antiviral efficacy in Aedes-derived mosquito cells and in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Interestingly, T-705 was devoid of anti-CHIKV activity in mosquito cells, despite being effective against CHIKV in Vero cells. By investigating the metabolic activation profile, we showed that, unlike Vero cells, mosquito cells were not able to convert T-705 into its active form. To explore whether alternative metabolization pathways might exist in vivo, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were infected with CHIKV and administered T-705 via an artificial blood meal. Virus titrations of whole mosquitoes showed that T-705 was not able to reduce CHIKV infection in mosquitoes. Combined, these in vitro and in vivo data indicate that T-705 lacks antiviral activity in mosquitoes due to inadequate metabolic activation in this animal species.","output":"Favipiravir Does Not Inhibit Chikungunya Virus Replication in Mosquito Cells and Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is causing serious impacts in the world, and safe and effective vaccines and medicines are the best methods to combat the disease. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein plays a key role in interacting with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, and is regarded as an important target of vaccines. Herein, we constructed the adjuvant-protein conjugate Pam3CSK4-RBD as a vaccine candidate, in which the N-terminal of the RBD was site-selectively oxidized by transamination and conjugated with the TLR1/2 agonist Pam3CSK4. This demonstrated that the conjugation of Pam3CSK4 significantly enhanced the anti-RBD antibody response and cellular response. In addition, sera from the Pam3CSK4-RBD immunized group efficiently inhibited the binding of the RBD to ACE2 and protected cells from SARS-CoV-2 and four variants of concern (alpha, beta, gamma and delta), indicating that this adjuvant strategy could be one of the effective means for protein vaccine development.","output":"RBD conjugate vaccine with a built-in TLR1/2 agonist is highly immunogenic against SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been reported that up to 90% of organ transplant recipients have suboptimal blood pressure control.

We partitioned the subjects into quartiles according to the e24hUNa/K. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD/EPI) formula and renal function decline was defined as an absolute value at or above the third quartile of the eGFR decline rate. A multivariable logistic regression model was used for estimation. Compared with the first quartile of the e24hUNa/K, multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for eGFR decline in the second, third, and fourth quartiles were 0.96 (95% confidence interval: 0.61-1.51), 1.06 (0.67-1.66), and 1.65 (1.06-2.57), respectively. These results were similar when the simple spot urine Na/K ratio was used in place of the e24hUNa/K.

In order to find predictors for those nonurgent visits, we performed a retrospective analysis of unscheduled visits at the Pediatric Emergency Department of the University Hospital of Bonn, Germany, in the year 2017. Additionally, we compared these findings to unscheduled visits during the first peak of the worldwide pandemic of the Coronavirus disease 2019, to see if there would be an effect on nonurgent pediatric Emergency Department attendances. METHODS: For our retrospective cohort study, we analyzed more than 5.000 visits at the pediatric Emergency Department of the University Hospital of Bonn, Germany, before and during the first peak of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of the Coronavirus disease 2019, particularly with regard to their urgency. Data included gender, age, zip code, urgency, and preexisting conditions. RESULTS: Our study shows that more than half of unscheduled pediatric Emergency Department visits (69%) at the University Hospital in Bonn are for nonurgent reasons, with short living distance being a factor to present children to a pediatric Emergency Department, even with minor complaints. During the first peak of the pandemic of the Coronavirus disease 2019, nonurgent visits decreased significantly, potentially due to hesitation to attend a pediatric Emergency Department with minor issues, fearing an infection with SARS-CoV-2 at the hospital. CONCLUSION: Many people use pediatric Emergency Departments for nonemergency complaints. In order to address the reasons for nonurgent visits to pediatric Emergency Departments and to prevent parents from doing so, further studies and targeted education concepts for parents are needed.","output":"Nonurgent Visits to the Pediatric Emergency Department before and during the First Peak of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging disease with fatal outcomes. In this study, a fundamental knowledge gap question is to be resolved by evaluating the differences in biological and pathogenic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and the changes in SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with the two prior major COV epidemics, SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses. METHODS: The genome composition, nucleotide analysis, codon usage indices, relative synonymous codons usage, and effective number of codons (ENc) were analyzed in the four structural genes; Spike (S), Envelope (E), membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) genes, and two of the most important nonstructural genes comprising RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, Beta-CoV from pangolins, bat SARS, MERS, and SARS CoVs. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 prefers pyrimidine rich codons to purines. Most high-frequency codons were ending with A or T, while the low frequency and rare codons were ending with G or C. SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins showed 5 to 20 lower ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoVs. This implies higher codon bias and higher gene expression efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. SARS-CoV-2 encoded the highest number of over-biased and negatively biased codons. Pangolin Beta-CoV showed little differences with SARS-CoV-2 ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoV. CONCLUSION: Extreme bias and lower ENc values of SARS-CoV-2, especially in Spike, Envelope, and Mpro genes, are suggestive for higher gene expression efficiency, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoVs.","output":"From SARS and MERS CoVs to SARS-CoV-2: Moving toward more biased codon usage in viral structural and nonstructural genes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to determine the local governments policy of Kepahiang Regency to prevent the practice of early marriage during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Clinical trials for vaccine and ribonucleic acid (RNA)-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor are going on. The study was conducted to analyze SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences submitted from India to identify mutations and their geographical distribution. Material and Methods: Three hundred and sixty-three sequences submitted from India were archived (GISAID database), compared with reference sequence (Wuhan, China), and phylogenetic tree was prepared. Sequences with more than 1% nucleotide stretching were excluded for mutation analysis, and multiple sequence analysis for 317 sequences was done. Mutations were analyzed as per phases of lockdown and geographical distribution. Results: Clade 'GH' appears in the second and third phases of lockdown;the clade 'V' has not been reported after March 17, 2020, in India.

Results At least one respiratory pathogen was detected in 26,138 (78%) of patients. Together, human rhinoviruses (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza viruses comprised nearly two-thirds of all cases, affecting 24%, 19.7%, and 18.5%, respectively. A prevalence of 5-10% was recorded for adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), human bocavirus (HboV), and human coronaviruses (HCoVs). Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), enteroviruses, M. pneumonia, and parechovirus had prevalences below 5%. While RSV, influenza, and HMPV exhibited strong seasonal activity in the winter, HRV was active during low RSV and influenza circulation. The burden of RSV exceeds that of influenza among young age groups, whereas influenza correlated positively with age.

OBJECTIVE: We aim to conduct an umbrella review of systematic reviews available on the literature and evidence-based guidance on telemental health, including both qualitative and quantitative literature. METHODS: Three databases were searched between January 2010 and August 2020 for systematic reviews meeting the predefined criteria. The retrieved reviews were independently screened, and those meeting the inclusion criteria were synthesized and assessed for risk of bias. Narrative synthesis was used to report these findings. RESULTS: In total, 19 systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. A total of 15 reviews examined clinical effectiveness, 8 reported on the aspects of telemental health implementation, 10 reported on acceptability to service users and clinicians, 2 reported on cost-effectiveness, and 1 reported on guidance. Most reviews were assessed to be of low quality. The findings suggested that video-based communication could be as effective and acceptable as face-to-face formats, at least in the short term. Evidence on the extent of digital exclusion and how it can be overcome and that on some significant contexts, such as children and young peoples services and inpatient settings, was found to be lacking.

At this current point in time there are 4 known major variants of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus, namely the English variant (B.1.1.7), the South African variant (B.1.351), Brazilian variants (VOC202101/02 (P.1) and VUI202101/01) and a variant similar to that of the South African variant found in North America (B.1.526), all of which have varying levels of resistance and infectivity. It is evident that the SARS-CoV-2 variants pose an international health risk, the mutations of E484K and N501Y are the two most implicated mutations. E484K being the most concerning as it aids in immune evasion and drastically causes the efficacy of the current vaccines to be reduced by large margins. The most worrisome variant is the South African or B.1.351 which harbors the above mutations. It is of the upmost importance that targeted vaccines are synthesized to ensure that immunized individuals have effective protection against these variants. Until these specific targeted vaccines are synthesized the current vaccines offer little long-term protection, however do confer a level of immunity to stop severe infections. It is thus advised that current vaccination programs should continue in earnest as a degree of protection is conferred.","output":"COVID-19 and mutations a threat level assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, the asymmetric Granger causality relationship between tourist arrivals and world pandemic uncertainty index is examined by controlling inflation, consumer confidence index, and industrial production for the period 2000M1 and 2020M1 in Italy. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is one of the few studies to investigate the relationship between tourist arrivals and world pandemic uncertainty in an asymmetric framework. The empirical results show that using the Granger causality test in a linear framework causes bias results due to misspecification. Therefore, the study relies on asymmetric Granger causality test results which reveal that the positive shock of world pandemic uncertainty Granger causes a negative shock of tourist arrivals. It is suggested that international tourist arrivals are sensitive to external shocks such as pandemics and in such instances the government of the concerned country can insulate the tourism-service and hospitality industry against the shocks by developing strategies to promote full information between all stakeholders.","output":"Do pandemics have an asymmetric effect on tourism in Italy?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Arab ethnic minority makes up 21% of Israels population, yet comprised just 8.8% of confirmed cases and 3.6% of deaths from COVID-19, despite their higher risk profile and greater burden of underlying illness. This paper presents differences in patterns of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 in the Arab, ultra-Orthodox and overall populations in Israel, and suggests possible reasons for the low rates of infection in the Arab population. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Israeli Ministry of Healths (MOH) open COVID-19 database, which includes information on 1270 localities and is updated daily. The database contains the number of COVID-19 diagnostic tests performed, the number of confirmed cases and deaths in Israel. RESULTS: In the first 4 months of Israels COVID-19 outbreak, just 2060 cases were confirmed in the Arab population, comprising 8.8% of the 23,345 confirmed cases, or 2.38 times less than would be expected relative to the population size. In contrast, the ultra-Orthodox made up 30.1% of confirmed cases yet just 10.1% of the population. Confirmed case rate per 100,000 was twice as high in the general Jewish population compared to the Arab population. The Arab mortality rate was 0.57 per 100,000, compared to 3.37 in the overall population, and to 7.26 in the ultra-Orthodox community. We discuss possible reasons for this low morbidity and mortality including less use of nursing homes, and effective leadership which led to early closure of mosques and high adherence to social distancing measures, even during the month of Ramadan. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a disproportionate burden of underlying illness, the Arab population did not fulfil initial predictions during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak and maintained low numbers of infections and deaths. This contrasts with reports of increased mortality in ethnic minorities and economically disadvantaged populations in other countries, and with high rates of infection in the ultra-Orthodox sector in Israel. Effective leadership and cooperation between individuals and institutions, particularly engagement of community and religious leaders, can reduce a groups vulnerability and build resilience in an emergency situation such as the current pandemic.","output":"Coping with the COVID-19 pandemic C the role of leadership in the Arab ethnic minority in Israel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunogenic T-cell epitopes have a central role in the cellular immunity against pathogens and tumors.

This leads to indirect modulation of oxidative phosphorylation, which is/may be fundamental for both cancer and cancer stem cell survival. Furthermore, given the crucial contribution of mitochondria to intrinsic apoptosis, modulation of their ion channels leading to cytochrome c release may be of great advantage in case of resistance to drugs triggering apoptotic events upstream of the mitochondrial phase. In the present review, we give an overview of the known mitochondrial ion channels and of their modulators capable of killing cancer cells.

PATIENTS AND METHODS This study was designed as a matched case-controlled study from our institute's RCC database. Nineteen consecutive patients who were undergoing LESS radical nephrectomy were compared with 38 patients who were undergoing conventional laparoscopic radical nephrectomy. The matching process accounted for sex, age, operative side, and tumor size. RESULTS No significant differences were observed in mean operative time (190.8 vs 172.4 min, P = 0.249), estimated blood loss (143.2 vs 199.5 mL, P = 0.235), and complication rate (15.8% vs 21.1 %, P = 0.635) between the LESS and conventional laparoscopy groups. Postoperative hospital stay after LESS radical nephrectomy was 2.7 (2-4) days, compared with 3.9 (3-7) days in the conventional laparoscopy group (P < 0.001). Postoperative pain, as measured by visual analog scale at postoperative day 1 (4.7 vs 5.8 points, P = 0.001), 2 (3.4 vs 4.6 points, P < 0.001), and 3 (2.7 vs 4.0 points, P = 0.008) was significantly lower in the LESS group. CONCLUSION LESS radical nephrectomy is a feasible and safe surgical option for localized RCC that demonstrates improved cosmetic outcomes and the additional benefits of decreased postoperative pain and decreased hospital stay.","output":"Comparison of laparoendoscopic single-site radical nephrectomy with conventional laparoscopic radical nephrectomy for localized renal-cell carcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resurgent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases that have previously been controlled or eliminated have been observed in many settings. Reactive vaccination campaigns may successfully control outbreaks but must necessarily be implemented in the face of considerable uncertainty. Real-time surveillance may provide critical information about at-risk population and optimal vaccination targets, but may itself be limited by the specificity of disease confirmation. We propose an integrated modelling approach that synthesizes historical demographic and vaccination data with real-time outbreak surveillance via a dynamic transmission model and an age-specific disease confirmation model. We apply this framework to data from the 1996-1997 measles outbreak in S?o Paulo, Brazil. To simulate the information available to decision-makers, we truncated the surveillance data to what would have been available at 1 or 2 months prior to the realized interventions. We use the model, fitted to real-time observations, to evaluate the likelihood that candidate age-targeted interventions could control the outbreak. Using only data available prior to the interventions, we estimate that a significant excess of susceptible adults would prevent child-targeted campaigns from controlling the outbreak and that failing to account for age-specific confirmation rates would underestimate the importance of adult-targeted vaccination.","output":"Measles outbreak response decision-making under uncertainty: a retrospective analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: ALS patients have changed peripheral immunity. It is unknown whether peripheral immunity is related to cognitive dysfunction in ALS patients. OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between the peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and the cognitive status in ALS patients. METHODS: Among 81 ALS patients, we compared the demographic, clinical, and peripheral levels of total T lymphocyte, CD4+ T lymphocyte, CD8+ T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte, and NK cell between those with cognitive impairment (ALS-ci) and those without (ALS-nci). The cognitive status was evaluated via the Chinese version of the Edinburgh cognitive and behavioral screen (ECAS). Significant predictors of cognitive impairment in univariate logistic regression analysis were further examined using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: 39.5% of all ALS patients had cognitive impairment. The ALS-ci group had shorter education time, older age at both symptom onset and testing, longer disease duration, and lower levels of peripheral total, CD4+, and CD8+ T lymphocyte and B lymphocyte than the ALS-nci group. Frequency of behavioral impairment did not differ between the two groups. While parameters with significant differences identified by group comparison were also significant predictors of cognitive impairment in univariate logistic regression analysis except the level of B lymphocyte, only older age at testing, education time less than 9 years, and lower level of CD4+ T lymphocyte remained significant in multivariate logistic regression analysis. The predictive model combining these three parameters had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.842 with a sensitivity of 90.6% and a specificity of 67.3%.

We sought to determine the effectiveness of thermal screening as a key step in diagnosing COVID-19 in a resource-limited setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study based on a review of body temperature and Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 test results records for truck drivers entering Uganda through Mutukula between 15th May and 30th July 2020. All records missing information for body temperature, age, gender, and Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 status were excluded from the data set. A data set of 7,181 entries was used to compare thermal screening and Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 assay test results using the diagnostic statistical test in STATAv15 software. The prevalence of COVID-19 amongst the truck drivers based on Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 assay results was determined. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive and negative Likelihood ratios were obtained using Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 assay as the gold standard. RESULTS: Based on our gold standard test, the proportion of persons that tested positive for COVID-19 was 6.7% (95% CI: 6.1-7.3). Of the 7,181 persons that were thermally screened, 6,844 (95.3%) were male. The sample median age was 38 years (interquartile range, IQR: 31-45 years). The median body temperature was 36.5C (IQR: 36.3-36.7) and only n (1.2%) had a body temperature above 37.5C. The sensitivity and specificity of thermal screening were 9.9% (95% CI: 7.4-13.0) and 99.5% (95% CI: 99.3-99.6) respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 57.8 (95% CI: 46.5-68.6) and 93.9 (95% CI: 93.3-94.4) respectively. The positive and negative Likelihood Ratios (LRs) were 19 (95% CI: 12.4-29.1) and 0.9 (95% CI: 0.88-0.93) respectively. CONCLUSION: In this study population, the use of Thermal screening alone is ineffective in the detection of potential COVID-19 cases at point of entry.

Multivariable logistic analyses were carried out to identify the factors associated with the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among HCWs. A total of 1800 HCWs have completed the survey. Around half (58.10%) of them were frontline HCWs and aged between (30C49) years old. Over two-thirds (67.33%) of the participants have received the seasonal influenza vaccine.

HCWs who were male (aOR = 1.99, 95% CI (1.41C2.80)), working in the frontlines (aOR = 1.61, 95% CI (1.17C2.21), and those who have received influenza vaccination for the current year (aOR = 1.38, 95% CI(0.99C1.92)) were more willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine. However, factors such as living in rural areas (aOR = 0.61, 95% CI (0.44C0.84)), and being previously diagnosed with COVID-19 (aOR = 0.66, 95%CI (0.45C0.96) were found negatively associated with vaccine acceptance. In terms of health beliefs items, concerns related to the novelty of vaccine (aOR = 0.42, 95% CI (0.25C0.71)), side effects/vaccine safety (aOR = 0.41, 95% CI (0.23C0.73), reliability of manufacturer (aOR = 0.43, 95% CI (0.30C0.63)), and the number of required doses (aOR = 0.58, 95% CI (0.40C0.84)) were also negatively associated with the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Remarkably, concerns such as the limited accessibility (aOR = 1.68, 95% CI (1.14C2.47)), and availability of vaccines (aOR = 2.16, 95% CI (1.46C3.20)) were associated with an increased likelihood of willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

Given their antiviral properties and the fact that the development of an effective coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment is an urgent public health priority, they and their derivatives are being explored as potential therapies against COVID-19. These explorations using various strategies, range from their direct interaction with the virus to using them as vaccine adjuvants. However, AMPs do not work in isolation, specifically in their role as potent immune modulators, where they interact with toll-like receptors (TLRs) and chemokine receptors. Both of these receptors have been shown to play roles in COVID-19 pathogenesis. In addition, it is known that a healthy lifestyle accompanied by controlled physical activity can represent a natural weapon against COVID-19. In competitive athletes, an increase in serum defensins has been shown to function as self-protection from the attack of microorganisms, consequently a controlled physical activity could act as a support to any therapies in fighting COVID-19.

However, their capacity to do so is shaped by the contexts in which they operate nationally and internationally. The aim of this paper is to explore the lived experience of civil society participation in these contexts, both from the perspective of CSOs engaged in harm reduction advocacy, and the institutions they engage with, in order to inform future policy development. METHODS: This paper is based on the presentations and discussions from a workshop on Civil Society Involvement in Drug Policy hosted by the Correlation - European Harm Reduction Network at the International Society for the Study of Drugs Policy (ISSDP) annual conference in Paris, 2019. In the aftermath of the workshop, the authors analysed the papers and discussions and identified the key themes arising to inform CSI in developing future harm reduction policy and practice. RESULTS: Civil society involvement (CSI) in policy decision-making and implementation is acknowledged as an important benefit to representative democracy. Yet, the accounts of CSOs demonstrate the challenges they experience in seeking to shape the contested field of drug policy. Negotiating the complex workings of political institutions, often in adversarial and heavily bureaucratic environments, proved difficult. Nonetheless, an increase in structures which formalised and resourced CSI enabled more meaningful participation at different levels and at different stages of policy making. CONCLUSIONS: Civil society spaces are colonised by a broad range of civil society actors lobbying from different ideological standpoints including those advocating for a drug free world and those advocating for harm reduction. In these competitive arena, it may be difficult for harm reduction orientated CSOs to influence the policy process. However, the current COVID-19 public health crisis clearly demonstrates the benefits of partnership between CSOs and political institutions to address the harm reduction needs of people who use drugs.

A 7-day course of a single oral antimicrobial such as ciprofloxacin, cefixime or azithromycin is commonly used for its treatment. Increasing antimicrobial resistance threatens the effectiveness of these treatment choices. We hypothesize that combined treatment with azithromycin (active mainly intracellularly) and cefixime (active mainly extracellularly) will be a better option for the treatment of typhoid fever in South Asia. Methods: This is a phase IV, international multi-centre, multi-country, comparative participant-and observer-blind, 1:1 randomised clinical trial. Patients with suspected uncomplicated typhoid fever will be randomised to one of the two interventions: Arm A: azithromycin 20mg/kg/day oral dose once daily (maximum 1gm/day) and cefixime 20mg/kg/day oral dose in two divided doses (maximum 400mg bd) for 7 days, Arm B: azithromycin 20mg/kg/day oral dose once daily (max 1gm/day) for 7 days AND cefixime-matched placebo for 7 days. We will recruit 1500 patients across sites in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. We will assess whether treatment outcomes are better with the combination after one week of treatment and at one- and three-months follow-up. Discussion: Combined treatment may limit the emergence of resistance if one of the components is active against resistant sub-populations not covered by the other antimicrobial's activity. If the combined treatment is better than the single antimicrobial treatment, this will be an important result for patients across South Asia and other typhoid endemic areas.

Therefore, continuous monitoring of IBV genotypes and lineages recently circulating in chickens worldwide is essential. In this study, we characterized the complete S1 gene from 120 IBVs circulating in chickens in Thailand from 2014 to 2016. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete S1 gene of 120 Thai IBVs revealed that the 2014C2016 Thai IBVs were divided into 3 lineages (GI-1, GI-13, and GI-19) and a novel IBV variant. Our results also showed that GI-19 lineage has become the predominant lineage of IBV circulating in chicken flocks in Thailand from 2014 to 2016. It is interesting to note that a novel IBV variant, which was genetically different from the established IBV lineages, was identified in this study. The recombination analysis demonstrated that this novel IBV variant was a recombinant virus, which was originated from the GI-19 and GI-13 lineage viruses. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the circulation of different lineages of IBV and the presence of a novel recombinant IBV variant in chicken flocks in Thailand. This study highlights the high genetic diversity and continued evolution of IBVs in chickens in Thailand, and the importance of continued IBV surveillance for effective control and prevention of IB.","output":"Genetic characterization of infectious bronchitis viruses in Thailand, 2014C2016: identification of a novel recombinant variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To analyze effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the consumption of personal protective equipment and products (PPEP), as well as the frequency of surgical site infection (SSI) among non-COVID-19 patients submitted to cesarean sections. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in a maternity unity of a public teaching hospital which was not part of the reference service for COVID-19 treatment. It compared PPEP consumption and the occurrence of SSI after cesarean sections in monthly periods before and after the occurrence of the first case of COVID-19 in Porto Alegre, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Personal protective equipment and products consumption was measured as units of masks, gloves, gowns, and caps, and use of alcohol-based products or soap for hand sanitation as ml/patient/day. The SSI index was calculated as the proportion of cases of SSI over the number of cesarean sections performed monthly during the study period. RESULTS: There was an increase in all measured items of PPEP, with consumption of disposable masks with a median of 1,450 units in the pre-COVID period, and of 2550 in the post-COVID period (a 75.9% increase). A decrease of 49% in SSI was detected, with a median of 1.74 in the pre-COVID period and of 0.89 in the post-COVID period. CONCLUSION: The increase in consumption of PPEP could be a result of safer practices adopted by healthcare workers with the advent of COVID-19, of which the following reduction in the occurrence of SSI could be a direct consequence. Despite the severity of the crisis, one could state that extreme situations can lead to valuable reflections and opportunities for improvement.","output":"Surgical Site Infection after Cesarean Delivery in Times of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rideshare and taxi services may commonly be perceived as safer modes of travel, particularly in comparison to public transport, and the introduction of rideshare services such as Uber has transformed urban mobilities.

However, its 2012 survey found that the recurrence rate had increased to 4% for the transabdominal preperitoneal procedure and 5% for the totally extraperitoneal procedure. We held 14 hernia repair training courses from 2011 to 2016 with help from Covidien. This study aimed to determine the effect of this training on the recurrence rate. METHODS Training was composed of a theoretical revision of inguinal anatomy, dry laboratory suturing, a video lecture, and practice on an animal model. We made inquiries about the length of each surgeon's career, post-training changes in surgical methods, and recurrence rates before and after training. RESULTS We received responses from 159 of 300 trainees (53%). The mean career length was 12.7  8.2 years. The annual number of transabdominal preperitoneal procedures performed increased from 20.9  29.9 to 32.4  56.1 after training (P < 0.001), and the number of totally extraperitoneal procedures increased from 9.5  13.9 to 13.9  16.9 (P = 0.0218). The annual number of procedures performed via the anterior approach decreased from 153.1  28.4 to 28.4  52.2 after training (P < 0.001). The pre-training transabdominal preperitoneal procedure recurrence rate was 0.9%, and this decreased to 0.4% after training. There was no pre-training recurrence rate for the totally extraperitoneal procedure, but this was 0.4% after training. CONCLUSION The high recurrence rate after inguinal hernia repair in Japan was mainly due to inadequate training in the laparoscopic method. Our laparoscopic hernia repair training course achieved low recurrence rates.","output":"Proper training in laparoscopic hernia repair is necessary to minimize the rising recurrence rate in Japan."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: Obese patients represent a vulnerable population at risk of developing severe COVID-19 infections. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia are at increased risk for developing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Prone positioning has long been studied as a measure to improve hypoxemia in ARDS. We hypothesize that the critically ill obese patient may represent a unique subset of the population when considering their innate respiratory mechanic variations and distinctive physiology who may benefit most from prone positioning as an adjunctive measure to improve oxygenation in COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, dual-hospital, single institution cohort analysis of confirmed diagnosed COVID-19 infection patients admitted to our 1227-bed tertiary care center. The data pool was subdivided into obese and non-obese adult patients, defined by body mass index  30 kg/m2. Proning was defined by at least 4 hours a day spent fully pronated. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included the requirement of mechanical ventilation (MV) and ICU length of stay (LOS). Results: Between February and August 2020, 55% (144/259) of the total study population patients admitted to our ICU for AHRF secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia were obese. Of these obese patients, 25% (36/144) were proned and 75% (108/144) were not proned. In-hospital mortality was 11.11% in the proned/obese patients compared to 30.55% in the non-proned/obese patients (p=0.0207). In comparison, 26% (30/115) of the non-obese patients were proned and 74% (85/115) were not proned. In-hospital mortality was 36.66% in the proned/nonobese patients compared to 34.11% in the non-proned/non-obese patients (p=0.8010). A total of 43.05% (62/144) of obese versus 43.47% (50/115) of the non-obese patients required mechanical ventilation (MV) at some point in their ICU stay. In the obese population, 41.66% of proned/obese patients compared to 43.51% of the non-proned/obese patients required MV (p=0.8459). While in the non-obese population 46.66% of proned/non-obese patients compared to 42.35% of the non-proned/non-obese patients required MV (p=0.6819). The average ICU LOS was 8.17 days in non-proned compared to 6.77 days in proned obese patients. Conclusion: In regards to obese patients, there was a clinically significant improvement in mortality between patients that were proned versus non-proned patients. There was no clinically significant difference in the effect of proning on non-obese patients in terms of mortality. There was also no clinically significant difference in the effects of proning in obese and non-obese patients in regards to the requirement of mechanical ventilation.","output":"Clinical outcomes in proning critically ill obese patients infected with COVID-19 pneumonia-the prosecova trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused colleges and universities in the United States to transition from face-to-face to remote learning Academic leaders need to understand how to better serve both their customers (parents) and their consumers (students) after this disruption in the academic business model Strategic communication will be critical for rebuilding this industry sector Taking a snapshot of communication patterns in the midst of change provides a baseline for future decision-making This study builds on literature regarding emerging adulthood, family communication patterns, and crisis communication to examine two areas: (a) communication between parents/guardians and their students, and (b) communication between the institution and parents/guardians In a study of 525 parents/family members, communication patterns reflect differences in stages of progression through the developmental stage of emerging adulthood Digital communication tools dominated family communication and video calling increased Parents/guardians of students who plan to return to their former institution were most satisfied with crisis communication, communication across the student life cycle, and measures of institutional quality Parents/guardians of those who graduated were least satisfied on most measures The potential for future philanthropy was relatively high across the sample Recommendations are provided for applying insights to other strategic communication contexts ? 2020 The Author(s) This open access article is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) 4 0 license","output":"COVID-19 and strategic communication with parents and guardians of college students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?3-secretase is a macromolecular complex that catalyzes intramembranous hydrolysis of more than 100 membrane-bound substrates.

The goal of this review is to systematically identify and describe the survey data and findings to date examining the effect on individual gambling and gambling disorder. RECENT FINDINGS: Of the 17 publications meeting inclusion criteria, the majority reported cross-sectional assessments (n = 11, 65%) and remainder were longitudinal in that they had earlier gambling data for participants (n = 6, 35%). Not surprisingly given the closure of land-based gambling, an overall reduction in gambling frequency and expenditure was reported in all studies. The estimate of the proportion of participants in both the general population and the population that gambles who increased overall gambling or online gambling was variable. The most consistent correlates of increased gambling during the lockdown were increased problem gambling severity, younger age groups, and being male. SUMMARY: These results suggest that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on gambling and problematic gambling are diverse C possibly causing a reduction in current or future problems in some, but also promoting increased problematic gambling in others. The longer-term implications of both the reduction in overall gambling, and the increase in some vulnerable groups are unclear, and requires assessment in subsequent follow-up studies. However, in the short term, individuals with existing gambling problems should be recognized as a vulnerable group.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on gambling and gambling disorder: emerging data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the early turmoil of the COVID-19 pandemic on societies in Europe, the foundations of financing the European Union have been overturned.

BACKGROUND: Cystic artery pseudoaneurysm is an uncommon entity with varied clinical presentation. Inflammation and trauma are associated with most of the cases. Limited experience with the condition challenges the management of individual cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrieved all the reported cases of cystic artery pseudoaneurysm, published up to December 2019, from the PubMed database and excluded those arising as postoperative complications. A total of 59 cases were analyzed, and we also included our experience of managing a case of cystic artery pseudoaneurysm. RESULTS: Abdominal pain (77.9%) was the most common presentation followed by upper GI bleed (64.4%), while 19 patients (32.2%) had presented with classic Quincke's Triad. Most of the cases were diagnosed following the rupture of the pseudoaneurysm (n = 49, 83.05%). Fifteen patients presented with shock. Hyperbilirubinemia (59.3%) and anemia (55.9%) were the commonest laboratory findings. Although CT angiogram remains the investigation of choice, a conventional angiogram is the gold standard and sufficed as the definitive management in 20 cases. Cholecystectomy formed the definitive management in the rest of the cases. We successfully managed a middle-aged female patient of cystic artery aneurysm with xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis by open cholecystectomy.

Worldwide, prevalence estimates of gaming disorder are considerably heterogeneous and often appear to be exceedingly high. However, few studies have examined the methodological, cultural and/or demographic factors that might explain this phenomenon. This review employed meta-analytic techniques to compute the worldwide-pooled prevalence of gaming disorder and evaluate the potential contributing factors for varied prevalence estimates. METHOD Prevalence estimates were extracted from 53 studies conducted between 2009 and 2019, which included 226,247 participants across 17 different countries. Study findings were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model. Subgroup and moderator analyses examined potential sources of heterogeneity, including assessment tool and cut-off, participant age and gender, sample size and type, study region, and year of data collection. RESULTS The worldwide prevalence of gaming disorder was 3.05% (confidence interval: [2.38, 3.91]); this figure was adjusted to 1.96% [0.19, 17.12] when considering only studies that met more stringent sampling criteria (e.g. stratified random sampling). However, these estimates were associated with significant variability. The choice of screening tool accounted for 77% of the variance, with the Lemmens Internet gaming disorder-9, Gaming Addiction Identification Test and Problematic Videogame Playing scales associated with the highest estimates. Adolescent samples, lower cut-off scores and smaller sample size were significant predictors of higher prevalence.

For this, the Gd content of different weight fractions obtained via ultracentrifugation of incubation solutions of humic acids with a linear (gadodiamide) and a macrocyclic GBCA (gadobutrol) were analyzed via inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). This enabled the fractionation of Gd-humic acid adducts and intact GBCAs, since Gd bound to macromolecules would be present in the macromolecular fraction of the filter residue while the low molecular weight Gd species can pass the filter with the filtrate. The Gd concentration in the different weight fractions was determined and a different reaction behavior for the examined GBCAs was observed. 73% of the total Gd amount was present in the macromolecular fraction of the linear GBCA compared to 0.41% in case of the macrocyclic GBCA. Speciation analysis of the macromolecular fractions by size exclusion chromatography-UV-ICP-MS confirmed that Gd-humic acid adducts were formed in case of the linear gadodiamide, but not with the macrocyclic gadobutrol. The findings of this study suggest that humic substance was able to react with the linear GBCA while the macrocyclic GBCA remained stable. Since free Gd ions are toxic, the question remains whether the humic acid bound Gd can be remobilized or if subsequent reactions with other molecules can take place. Furthermore, the persistence of macrocyclic GBCAs towards the humic substances indicates the potential accumulation of these compounds in the environment. However, more experiments regarding other binding partners and long term studies are needed to assess their ultimate fate after their release into the environment.","output":"Species-dependent interaction of Gd-based contrast agents with humic substances"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How does future anxiety caused by the COVID-19 pandemic relate to peoples willingness to remain vigilant and adhere to preventive measures? We examined the mediating role of message fatigue and the moderating role of autonomy satisfaction in the relationship between future anxiety due to COVID-19 and willingness to remain vigilant. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted with adults residing in the United States in June 2021 when numerous U.S. states re-opened following the CDCs relaxed guidelines for fully vaccinated individuals. Our data showed that message fatigue mediated the relationship between future anxiety due to the pandemic and willingness to remain vigilant. The data further revealed that autonomy satisfaction significantly moderated the mediation. Namely, the role of message fatigue in the indirect relationship between future anxiety and willingness to remain vigilant was significant only among people low to moderate in autonomy satisfaction; its role in the indirect path was not significant for those high in autonomy satisfaction. Notably, independent of the mechanism involving message fatigue, future anxiety was directly and positively associated with willingness to remain vigilant regardless of the levels of autonomy satisfaction. Implications of these findings are discussed in light of psychological and behavioral responses to the current pandemic and policy directions.","output":"The Relationship between Future Anxiety Due to COVID-19 and Vigilance: The Role of Message Fatigue and Autonomy Satisfaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic pain is typically defined as pain that persists after acute tissue damage and inflammation or as pain that follows a chronic disease process and lasts more than three months.

In malaria-endemic areas, the pandemic situation will very likely result in co-infection of COVID-19 and Malaria, although reports to date are still few. Meanwhile, in areas with low malaria prevalence, this disease will be challenging to diagnose because the symptoms closely resemble COVID-19.Case presentationA 23-year-old male patient presented to hospital with fever, anosmia, headache, and nausea since one week before. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 and treated for approximately ten days then discharged to continue self-quarantine at home. Two weeks later, he came back to the hospital with fever that was raised intermittently every two days, and was marked by a chilling-fever-sweating cycle. We conducted a laboratory test for malaria and nasopharyngeal swab for SARS CoV-2 PCR which confirmed both of the diagnosis. The laboratory examination showed markedly elevated D-dimer. He was treated with Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHP) 4 tablets per day for three days and Primaquine 2 tablets per day for 14 days according to Indonesian national anti-malarial treatment guidelines. After six days of treatment, the patient had no complaints, and the results of laboratory tests had improved. This report describes the key points in considering the differential diagnosis and prompt treatment of malaria infection during the pandemic of COVID-19 in an endemic country to prevent the worse clinical outcomes. COVID-19 and malaria may also cause hypercoagulable state, so a co-infection of those diseases may impact on the prognosis of the disease.ConclusionThis case report shows that considering the possibility of a co-infection in COVID-19 patient who presents with fever can prevent delayed treatment that can worsen the disease outcome. Paying more attention to a history of travel to malaria-endemic areas, a history of previous malaria infection, and exploring anamnesis regarding the fever patterns in patients are important points in making a differential diagnosis of malaria infection during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Prolonged Fever and Exaggerated Hypercoagulopathy in Malaria Vivax Relapse and COVID-19 Co-infection: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We developed an agent-based stochastic model, based on P Systems methodology, to decipher the effects of vaccination and contact tracing on the control of COVID-19 outbreak at population level under different control measures (social distancing, mask wearing and hand hygiene) and epidemiological scenarios. Our findings suggest that without the application of protection social measures, 56.1% of the Spanish population would contract the disease with a mortality of 0.4%. Assuming that 20% of the population was protected by vaccination by the end of the summer of 2021, it would be expected that 45% of the population would contract the disease and 0.3% of the population would die. However, both of these percentages are significantly lower when social measures were adopted, being the best results when social measures are in place and 40% of contacts traced. Our model shows that if 40% of the population can be vaccinated, even without social control measures, the percentage of people who die or recover from infection would fall from 0.41% and 56.1% to 0.16% and 33.5%, respectively compared with an unvaccinated population. When social control measures were applied in concert with vaccination the percentage of people who die or recover from infection diminishes until 0.10% and 14.5%, after vaccinating 40% of the population.

Antibody avidity was investigated.Results: Bacteremic patient sera (n=32) exhibited IgG antibody autoreactivity against BPI in 64.7% and 46.7% of patients with positive blood cultures for P. aeruginosa and E. coli, respectively. Autoantibody titers correlated with IgG responses to bacterial extracts and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A prospective cohort of bacteremic patient sera exhibited anti-BPI IgG responses in 23/154 (14.9%) patients with autoreactivity present at the time of positive blood cultures in patients with gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including 8/60 (13.3%) patients with S. aureus Chronic tissue infection with Staphylococcus aureus was associated with BPI antibody autoreactivity in 2/15 patients (13.3%). Previously, we have demonstrated that BPI autoreactivity in CF patient sera exhibits high avidity. Here, a similar pattern was seen in BE patient sera.

Background Respiratory viruses are known to cocirculate but this has not been described in detail during an influenza pandemic. Objectives To describe respiratory viruses, including co\\\\infection and associated attributes such as age, sex or comorbidity, in patients presenting with influenza\\\\like illness to a community sentinel network, during the pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 in Ontario, Canada. Methods Respiratory samples and epidemiologic details were collected from 1018 patients with influenza\\\\like illness as part of respiratory virus surveillance and a multiprovincial caseCcontrol study of influenza vaccine effectiveness. Results At least one virus was detected in 668 (656%) of 1018 samples; 512 (503%) had single infections and 156 (153%) co\\\\infections. Of single infections, the most common viruses were influenza A in 304 (594%) samples of which 275 (905%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and enterovirus/rhinovirus in 149 (291%) samples. The most common co\\\\infections were influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus B, and influenza A and enterovirus/rhinovirus. In multinomial logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity, and timeliness of sample collection, single infection was less often detected in the elderly and co\\\\infection more often in patients <30 years of age. Co\\\\infection, but not single infection, was more likely detected in patients who had a sample collected within 2 days of symptom onset as compared to 3C7 days. Conclusions Respiratory viral co\\\\infections are commonly detected when using molecular techniques. Early sample collection increases likelihood of detection of co\\\\infection. Further studies are needed to better understand the clinical significance of viral co\\\\infection.","output":"Community\\\\acquired respiratory viruses and co\\\\infection among patients of Ontario sentinel practices, April 2009 to February 2010"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computerized analysis of historical documents has remained an interesting research area for the pattern classification community for many decades.

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive single-stranded RNA virus, encased in a lipid bilayer derived from the host cell membrane and consists of four structural proteins (S, M, E and N), plus a haemagglutinin-sterase. The binding of the S protein to the ECA2 receptor allows the entry of the virus into the host cell and is a potential therapeutic target. 81% of patients develop mild symptoms, 14% have severe symptoms and 5% require intensive care management. Fever is the most frequent symptom, followed by cough and dyspnea. Most patients do not present leukocytosis, but they do present lymphopenia with sputum cultures that do not show other pathogens. In lung biopsies of severe patients, the most noticeable finding is diffuse alveolar damage. Radiologically, ground glass and alveolar patterns are observed; the lesions being predominantly basal, subpleural, and posterior, with a multifocal peripheral distribution, more affecting the right lower lobe. There is a marked inflammatory response, up to the cytokine storm, in which anti-inflammatory treatment with pulse therapy with methylprednisolone would be indicated.

METHODS: Air samples were collected in the room of two COVID-19 patients, one of whom had an active respiratory infection with a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. By using VIVAS air samplers that operate on a gentle water-vapor condensation principle, material was collected from room air and subjected to RT-qPCR and virus culture. The genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 collected from the air and of virus isolated in cell culture from air sampling and from a NP swab from a newly admitted patient in the room were sequenced. FINDINGS: Viable virus was isolated from air samples collected 2 to 4.8m away from the patients. The genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from the material collected by the air samplers was identical to that isolated from the NP swab from the patient with an active infection. Estimates of viable viral concentrations ranged from 6 to 74 TCID(50) units/L of air. INTERPRETATION: Patients with respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 produce aerosols in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures that contain viable SARS-CoV-2, and these aerosols may serve as a source of transmission of the virus.

METHODS: The electronic databases were searched for articles published from 1 December 2019 to 20 May 2021 with MeSH terms COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and liver transplantation. Studies reporting outcomes in more than 10 LT recipients were included for analysis. LT vs non-LT patients with COVID-19 infection were compared for all-cause mortality, which was the primary outcome studied. We also evaluated the relation between the timing of COVID-19 infection post-LT (< one year vs > one year) and mortality. FINDINGS: Eighteen articles reporting 1,522 COVID-19 infected LT recipients were included for the systematic review. The mean age (standard deviation [SD]) was 6038 (524) years, and 685% were men. The mean time (SD) to COVID-19 infection was 572 (175) years. Based on 17 studies (I(2) = 734) among 1,481 LT recipients, the cumulative incidence of mortality was 174% (95% confidence interval [CI], 154C196). Mortality was comparable between LT (n = 610) and non-LT (n = 239,704) patients, based on four studies (odds ratio [OR], 08 [06C108]; P = 014). Additionally, there was no significant difference in mortality between those infected within one year vs after one year of LT (OR, 15 [063C356]; P = 035). The cumulative incidence of graft dysfunction was 23% (13C41). Nearly 23% (2071C25) of the LT patients developed severe COVID-19 infection.

International surgical societies have issued clinical recommendations to optimize surgical management. This international study aimed to assess the degree of emergency surgical teams adoption of recommendations during the pandemic. METHODS: Emergency surgical team members from over 30 countries were invited to answer an anonymous, prospective, online survey to assess team organization, PPE-related aspects, OR preparations, anesthesiologic considerations, and surgical management for emergency surgery during the pandemic. RESULTS: One-hundred-and-thirty-four questionnaires were returned (N = 134) from 26 countries, of which 88% were surgeons, 7% surgical trainees, 4% anesthetists. 81% of the respondents got involved with COVID-19 crisis management. Social media were used by 91% of the respondents to access the recommendations, and 66% used videoconference tools for team communication. 51% had not received PPE training before the pandemic, 73% reported equipment shortage, and 55% informed about re-use of N95/FPP2/3 respirators. Dedicated COVID operating areas were cited by 77% of the respondents, 44% had performed emergency surgical procedures on COVID-19 patients, and over half (52%), favored performing laparoscopic over open surgical procedures. CONCLUSION: Surgical team members have responded with leadership to the COVID-19 pandemic, with crisis management principles. Social media and videoconference have been used by the vast majority to access guidelines or to communicate during social distancing.

We developed an objective model aiming to standardize this assessment, proposing a methodology that could be adopted in future studies designed to evaluate outcomes in the treatment of hypospadias. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the inter and intra observer reliability of a method to assess the quality of the urethral plate (UP) in hypospadias (POST - Plate Objective Scoring Tool) based on elements of glans characteristics. The reliability of such scoring methodology was compared to an analog accepted tool: the Glans-Urethral Meatus-Shaft (GMS) score. A secondary goal was to compare some characteristics of the UP in GMS score to POST values; aiming to find the threshold between favorable and unfavorable plates. METHODS Data were prospectively obtained from prepubertal boys who underwent primary hypospadias repair between January 2018 and November 2019. Intrinsic elements of the glanular UP (A: distal midline mucocutaneous junction; B: Glanular knob where the mucosal edges of the UP's edge change direction; C: Glanular/coronal junction) were marked and the AB/BC ratio calculated. The \\"G\\" and \\"M\\" components of the GMS score were measured electronically three times by four different reviewers with variable pediatric urology experience and blinded to each other values. Favorable UP, according to the GMS score was compared to measurements obtained by POST (AB/BC ratio). RESULTS 84 subjects were enrolled. The POST score had an excellent inter-observer agreement for the evaluation of the UP in distal hypospadias (Kappa = 0.832) while the \\"G\\" parameter of the GMS correlated poorly among the observers. The Inter-Class Correlation (ICC) analysis to examine the intra-rater agreement value was 0.914 (95% CI 0.87, 0.95.). AB/BC ratio values ranged from 0.6 to 1.6, with a mean of 1.12. The POST cut-off value for \\"favorable\\" UP was 1.2 (AUC = 0.62) 95% CI (0.52-0.84) (sensitivity 80% and specificity 60%). CONCLUSIONS The POST score has higher inter-observer reliability and functions favorably when compared to the GMS. In addition, it demonstrated a high intra-observer reliability among observers of variable experience. Our findings suggest that the POST score adds to evaluation of the UP and could be incorporated as an additional criterion to assess outcomes in distal hypospadias repairs.","output":"Plate Objective Scoring Tool (POST); An objective methodology for the assessment of urethral plate in distal hypospadias."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has dramatically impacted on socioeconomic structure, individual freedom, general wellbeing, psychological health and sexuality.

It is a prospective target for the development of SARS-CoV inhibitors by applying a repurposing strategy. This review focuses on a detailed overview of the chemical synthesis and computational chemistry perspectives of peptidomimetic inhibitors (PIs) and small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) targeting viral proteinase discovered from 2004-2020. The PIs and SMIs are one of the primary therapeutic inventions for SARS-CoV. The journey of different analogues towards the evolution of SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors and complete synthetic preparation of nineteen derivatives of PIs and ten derivatives of SMIs and their computational chemistry perspectives were reviewed. From each class of derivatives, we have identified and highlighted the most compelling PIs and SMIs for SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The protein-ligand interaction of 29 inhibitors were also studied that involved with the 3CLpro inhibition, and the frequent amino acid residues of the protease were also analyzed that are responsible for the interactions with the inhibitors.

The results show time-varying volatility spillovers in the considered markets. The short-term spillovers are higher than their intermediate-term counterparts. The highest jump in spillovers occurs during the COVID-19 outbreak, followed by the global financial crisis and the recent oil price crash. The spillovers are higher for oil-exporting countries than oil-importing countries.

This phenomenon could be explained by the overexpression of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) on epithelial cell surfaces of the respiratory tract. Indeed, ACE-2 is a receptor for coronaviruses including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV), and ACE-2 is overexpressed under chronic exposure to air pollution such as NO2 and PM2.5. In this review, we explain that ACE-2 acts as the sole receptor for the attachment of the SARS-CoV-2 via its spike protein. The fact that respiratory and vascular epithelial cells express ACE-2 has been previously observed during the 2003 epidemic of the SARS-CoV-1 in China, and during the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome in Saudi Arabia. High ACE-2 expression in respiratory epithelial cells under air pollution explains the positive correlation between the severity in COVID-19 patients and elevated air pollution, notably high NO2 and PM2.5 levels. Specific areas in India, China, Italy, Russia, Chile and Qatar that experience heavy air pollution also show high rates of COVID-19 infection and severity.

We hypothesised that unsedated UT endoscopy for variceal surveillance could be implemented during the routine outpatient clinic visit allowing accurate diagnosis of varices and the timely provision of prophylaxis. Methods: Patients with cirrhosis awaiting surveillance endoscopy were identified. UT endoscopy was scheduled during routine clinic review at the same time as ultrasound surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma. UGI endoscopy was performed unsedated using the E.G Scan II disposable endoscope. Varices were graded using the modified Paquet classification. Video recordings of procedures were reviewed by blinded assessors and agreement was assessed using the kappa statistic. Results: 40 patients (80% male) underwent unsedated UT endoscopy. All procedures were successful and tolerated well in 98% of cases. Median procedure time was 2 min (IQR 1-3). Varices were found in 37.5% (17.5% grade 1 and 20% grade 2). Patients with grade 2 varices were prescribed non-selective beta blockers at the clinic appointment. Kappa statistic for the finding of any varices was 0.636 (p=0.001) and 0.8-1.0 for diagnosis of grade 2 varices (p<0.0001). Conclusions: Outpatient unsedated ultrathin endoscopy in patients with cirrhosis is accurate, safe and feasible. This integrative care model is convenient, particularly for regional communities, and is likely to result in significant cost savings associated with variceal surveillance.","output":"One-stop shop for variceal surveillance: integration of unsedated ultrathin endoscopy into the routine clinic visit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 relief package for micro, small and medium enterprises and the changes to the defining criteria for MSMEs are examined While the changes in the MSME definition open the sector to larger enterprises, the composite criteria introduce fresh ambiguities to the defining of MSMEs Liquidity infusion measures at this juncture without adequate measures to revive demand will not help MSMEs tide over the COVID-19 lockdown-induced crisis ? 2020 Economic and Political Weekly All rights reserved","output":"Examining the COVID-19 relief package for MSMEs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The genome annotations of rhesus (Macaca mulatta) and cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) macaques, two of the most common nonhuman primate animal models, are limited.

The enzymatic breakdown of kinins affects the duration of their biological actions as the plasma half-life of intravenously injected BK is in the range of seconds. Kinins are cleaved in vitro and in vivo by enzymes that belong to families, such as zinc-metallopeptidases, astacin-like metallopeptidases, and catheptic enzymes. Vane noted the importance of the pulmonary circulation in the metabolism of vasoactive substances, such as BK as well as angiotensin 1 and 5- hydroxytryptamine. It is clear after decades of research that angiotensin 1-converting enzyme (ACE) on the vascular endothelial cell surface is the most important inactivator of blood-borne BK. BK may act primarily in an autocrine and paracrine fashion, establishing the importance of local regulation of its activity by enzymes on cell surfaces. Thus, the assortment of other enzymes that can inactivate BK is important in a variety of physiological and pathological situations. Most physiological systems have redundant pathways of metabolism so that the abolishment of one pathway is compensated for by the presence of others. This is demonstrated by the pharmacological inhibition of ACE in hypertension.","output":"Metabolism of Bradykinin by Peptidases in Health and Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging arbovirus associated with febrile illness often accompanied by rash and arthralgia that may persist for several years. Outbreaks are associated with high morbidity and create a public health challenge for countries affected. Recent outbreaks have occurred in both Europe and the Americas, suggesting CHIKV may continue to spread. Despite the sustained threat of the virus, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral therapy against CHIKV. Therefore, it is critical to develop a vaccine that is both well tolerated and highly protective. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we describe the construction and characterization of a modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) virus expressing CHIKV E3 and E2 proteins (MVA-CHIK) that protected several mouse models from challenge with CHIKV. In particular, BALB/c mice were completely protected against viremia upon challenge with CHIKV after two doses of MVA-CHIK. Additionally, A129 mice (deficient in IFN/) were protected from viremia, footpad swelling, and mortality. While high anti-virus antibodies were elicited, low or undetectable levels of neutralizing antibodies were produced in both mouse models. However, passive transfer of MVA-CHIK immune serum to na?ve mice did not protect against mortality, suggesting that antibodies may not be the main effectors of protection afforded by MVA-CHIK. Furthermore, depletion of CD4(+), but not CD8(+) T-cells from vaccinated mice resulted in 100% mortality, implicating the indispensable role of CD4(+) T-cells in the protection afforded by MVA-CHIK. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results presented herein demonstrate the potential of MVA to effectively express CHIKV E3-E2 proteins and generate protective immune responses. Our findings challenge the assumption that only neutralizing antibodies are effective in providing protection against CHIKV, and provides a framework for the development of novel, more effective vaccine strategies to combat CHIKV.","output":"A Novel MVA Vectored Chikungunya Virus Vaccine Elicits Protective Immunity in Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the pandemic context, diagnostic algorithms had to be adapted considering the decimated medical personnel, local technical resources, and the likelihood of contamination. Given the higher probability of thrombotic complications related to COVID-19 and the availability of a dual-layer spectral computed tomography (CT) scanner, we have recently adopted the use of low-dose, non-gated, chest CT scans performed five minutes after contrast administration among patients admitted with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) undergoing cerebrovascular CT angiography. Dual-layer spectral CT comprises a single X-ray source and two-layer detector with different photon-absorption capabilities. In addition to conventional images, the two distinct energy datasets obtained enable multiparametric spectral analysis without need to change the original scanning protocol. The two spectral features that emerge as most useful for patients with AIS are virtual monoenergetic imaging and iodine-based results. Aside from the evaluation of lung parenchyma, this novel strategy enables ruling out cardioembolic sources and simultaneously providing evidence of pulmonary and myocardial injury in a single session and immediately after CT cerebrovascular angiography. Furthermore, it involves a noninvasive, seemingly accurate, unsophisticated, safer (very low radiation dose and no contrast administration), and cheaper tool for ruling out cardioembolic sources compared to transesophageal echocardiogram and cardiac CT. Accordingly, we sought to standardize the technical aspects and overview the usefulness of delayed-phase, lowdose chest spectral CT in patients admitted with AIS.","output":"Cardiovascular thrombotic complications in acute ischemic stroke assessed by chest spectral computed tomography during COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) is still a major problem worldwide.

The objective of this study is to analyze the repercussion of the disease in a group of patients at risk such as heart transplants. MATERIAL AND METHOD: : From February 2020 to February 2021, heart transplant patients diagnosed with COVID 19 were consecutively included. The total number of transplants in outpatient follow-up at that time was 381. 3 levels of infection were determined. A) Asymptomatic patients or with trivial symptoms without the need for hospital admission (6 patients). B) Patients admitted to the hospital for respiratory symptoms (12 patients). C) Patients with severe symptoms and need for admission to the Critical Care Unit (2 patients). At each risk level, medical performance was different. Thus, group A: Close control, no therapeutic modification. Group B: Reduction of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) and substitution of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for everolimus (EVE). Group C: Reduction of ICN and withdrawal of MMF. RESULTS: : The prevalence of infection in the serie was 5.2%. Most of the patients admitted presented a pathological chest X-ray with fever, cough, dyspnea, or vomiting. The change in immunosuppression performed in group 2 patients was well tolerated and there was no graft rejection. Antiviral treatment was little used. However, boluses of steroids and some antibiotics were used frequently. The need for supplemental oxygen was 50% in group 2 and 100% in group 3. CONCLUSIONS: : A significant number of transplant patients will be affected by COVID19 (5.3%). The management of the infection will depend on the severity of the infection and must be based on a balance between reduction and adjustment of immunosuppression, strict control of the cardiological situation, and treatment of the infection.","output":"COVID 19 and heart transplantation.

These developments may have serious implications for TB progression and transmission in India. The nutritional status of a population is a strong determinant of the TB incidence, and undernutrition in adults alone accounts for 32-44% of TB incidence in India.

We believe that one unit decrease in BMI (corresponding to a 2-3 kg weight loss) may result in the poor in India as a result of the lockdown and its aftermath. This may result in an increase in estimated (uncertainty interval) incident TB by 185 610 (180 230, 190 990) cases.

RESULTS: Although the Brazilian cancer care policy has reached important achievements in overcoming access barriers to cancer diagnosis and treatment over the past decade, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused losses of timely access to health services for patients with cancer, which has compromised screening, early diagnosis and treatment, and patient follow-up. Oncology nurses have actively participated in the management and assistance strategies during the pandemic. This path has generated an increase in oncology nurses workload, leading to physical and mental stress and anxiety related to the fear of contagion for themselves and their family. CONCLUSION: The pandemic has affected the care of cancer patients, with the potential to suffer greater losses because of reductions in screening, early diagnosis and treatment, and patient follow-up. In addition to the worsening of the cancer setting, the COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed Brazilian oncology nurses, physically and mentally.","output":"Cancer care in the COVID-19 era and psychosocial impacts on oncology nursing in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW This article describes the spectrum of neurologic complications associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, their underlying pathology and pathogenic mechanisms, gaps in knowledge, and current therapeutic strategies. RECENT FINDINGS COVID-19 is the clinical syndrome caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It can affect the entire neuraxis, and presentations in the acute phase are variable, although anosmia is a common manifestation. Encephalopathy is common in patients who are hospitalized and is often associated with multiorgan involvement. Immune-mediated encephalitis is probably underrecognized; however, viral encephalitis is rare. Other manifestations include stroke, seizures, myelitis, and peripheral neuropathies, including Guillain-Barr syndrome, which sometimes has atypical manifestations. Treatment is symptomatic, and immunotherapies have been used successfully in some patients. Long-term complications include dysautonomia, exercise intolerance, malaise, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, and mood disorders. SUMMARY Neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 may occur in the acute setting and may be independent of respiratory manifestations. Immune-mediated syndromes and cerebrovascular complications are common. Large populations of patients are expected to have long-term neurologic complications of COVID-19, many of which may emerge only after recovery from the acute illness.","output":"Neurologic Manifestations of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drawing on past pandemics, scholars have suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic will bring about fertility decline.

The aim of the present study was to further understand how the organizational culture in clinical psychology may prevent or enable practitioners to step outside the conventional indoor consulting room. DESIGN Informed grounded theory methodology was used within a pragmatist philosophy. METHODS Participants (N = 15; nine male, six female) were identified using theoretical sampling. The sample consisted of experts and leaders within the profession of clinical psychology (e.g., heads of services, training programme directors, chairs of professional bodies, and developers of therapy models; M years in the profession = 34.80, SD = 9.77). One-to-one interviews and analysis ran concurrently over 9 months (April-December 2020). Mason's model of safe uncertainty was drawn upon to illuminate and organize themes. RESULTS The main themes comprised organizational factors that either support a practitioner in maintaining a position of curiosity and flexibility towards the environment where therapy is located ('environmental safe uncertainty'), or push them towards adopting a more fixed position ('environmental certainty'). Themes included influences from therapy traditions, accessibility of alternative environments, internalized risk, workplace subcultures, business models, biomedical approaches, and the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Whether therapy is located in a consulting room, outdoors, clients' homes, or digitally, practitioners, clients, and services are encouraged to maintain a position of environmental safe uncertainty. PRACTITIONER POINTS The therapy process and outcomes are influenced by the physical environment in which talking therapy is situated. Practitioners have often remained fixed in their preferred therapy environment, such as the indoor consulting room, without exploring the potential benefits of alternative environments or involving the client in this decision-making (i.e., 'environmental certainty'). Outdoor environments, as well as other alternatives to the consulting room (e.g., digital, home visits, and public places), can support access to therapy, subsequent engagement, and therefore health care equity. Practitioners and clients are encouraged to adopt a position of 'environmental safe uncertainty', which is defined as having openness, critical curiosity, and collaboration regarding the therapy environment and the possibility of other environments being more conducive to therapy.","output":"Organizational perspectives on outdoor talking therapy: Towards a position of 'environmental safe uncertainty'."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious airborne virus inducing pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This is most relevant for medical staff working under harmful conditions in emergencies often dealing with patients and an undefined SARS-CoV-2 status. We aimed to measure the effect of high-class filtering facepieces (FFP) in emergency medical service (EMS) staff by analyzing seroprevalence and history of positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. METHOD: This observational cohort study included workers in EMS, who were compared with hospital staff (HS) and staff, which was not directly involved in patient care (NPC). All direct patient contacts of EMS workers were protected by FFP2/N95 (filtering face piece protection class 2/non-oil-based particulates filter efficiency 95%) masks, whereas HS was protected by FFP2/N95 exclusively when a patient had a proven or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. NPC was not protected by higher FFP. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was analyzed by immunoassay by end of 12/2020 together with the history of a positive PCR. In addition, a self-assessment was performed regarding the quantity of SARS-CoV-2 positive contacts, about flu symptoms and personal belief of previous COVID-19 infections. RESULTS: The period in which contact to SARS-CoV-2 positive patients has been possible was 10 months (March to December 2020)with 54,681 patient contacts documented for EMSeither emergencies (n = 33,241) or transportation services (n = 21,440). Seven hundred-thirty (n = 730) participants were included into the study (n = EMS: 325, HS: 322 and NPC: 83). The analysis of the survey showed that the exposure to patients with an unknown and consecutive positive SARS-CoV-2 result was significantly higher for EMS when compared to HS (EMS 55% vs. HS 30%, p = 0.01). The incidence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort was 1.2% (EMS), 2.2% (HS) and 2.4% (NPC) within the three groups (ns) and lowest in EMS. Furthermore, the belief of previous COVID-19 was significant higher in EMS (19% vs. 10%), CONCLUSION: The consistent use of FFP2/N95 in EMS is able to prevent work-related SARS-CoV-2 infections in emergency situations. The significance of physical airway protection in exposed medical staff is still relevant especially under the aspect of new viral variants and unclear effectiveness of new vaccines.

Case reports and autopsy series have revealed that most patients with COVID-19 - associated acute kidney injury have evidence of acute tubular injury and necrosis - not unexpected in critically ill patients. Others have been found to have collapsing glomerulopathy, thrombotic microangiopathy and diverse underlying kidney diseases. A primary kidney pathology related to COVID-19 has not yet emerged. Thus far direct infection of the kidney, or its impact on clinical disease remains controversial. The management of AKI is currently supportive. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient presented here was positive for SARS-CoV-2, had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure. Within days of admission to the intensive care unit he developed oliguric acute kidney failure requiring dialysis. Acute kidney injury developed in the setting of hemodynamic instability, sepsis and a maculopapular rash. Over the ensuing days the patient also developed transfusion-requiring severe hemolysis which was Coombs negative. Schistocytes were present on the peripheral smear. Given the broad differential diagnoses for acute kidney injury, a kidney biopsy was performed and revealed granulomatous tubulo-interstitial nephritis with some acute tubular injury. Based on the biopsy findings, a decision was taken to adjust medications and initiate corticosteroids for presumed medication-induced interstitial nephritis, hemolysis and maculo-papular rash. The kidney function and hemolysis improved over the subsequent days and the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility, no-longer required dialysis. CONCLUSIONS: Acute kidney injury in patients with severe COVID-19 may have multiple causes. We present the first case of granulomatous interstitial nephritis in a patient with COVID-19. Drug-reactions may be more frequent than currently recognized in COVID-19 and are potentially reversible. The kidney biopsy findings in this case led to a change in therapy, which was associated with subsequent patient improvement. Kidney biopsy may therefore have significant value in pulling together a clinical diagnosis, and may impact outcome if a treatable cause is identified.","output":"Granulomatous interstitial nephritis in a patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Highly Transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus that emerged in late December of 2019 caused Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), which challenged human health and public safety. Severity of the disease depends on the viral load and the type of mutation that occurred in the coronavirus. Nonstructural proteins like, Nsp1, Nsp3, Nsp12 and Nsp13 including other viral proteins plays important role during viral replication life cycle. Viral Replication initiated by hacking the host cellular mechanism either by synergy or by suppression using nucleocapsid proteins of the virus. Spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) and TRMPSS as a cell entry. Once virus enters host cell, nucleocapsid proteins along with its genome is releases from endosomes into cytosol of the host cell. Ca 2+ /CaM (Calmodulin)/Calcineurin complex of the host cell plays important role during viral replication which is mediated by nucleocapsid proteins of the virus. Nsp1/Nsp3 nonstructural proteins triggers synergetic activity with CD147/CyPA/HSPG pathway and TRMP2/ADPr/Ca +2 mediated Ca 2+ /CaM (Calmodulin)/Calcineurin synthesis and free radicle generation in mitochondria leading to viral replication and severe chemokine activation pathways. Docking studies were carried out to inhibit Cyclophilin A and TRMP2 proteins as drug targets. Natural compounds like Withanolide A, Columbin, Cucurbitacin E, Boswellic acid along with Cyclosporines, Vitamin E and N-Acetyl cysteine (NAC) were selected as ligands to study docking studies. Withanolide A and Cyclosporines had shown good inhibition activity against Cyclophilin A, whereas Columbin, Boswellic acid, Cucurbitacin E, Vitamin E and N-Acetyl cysteine (NAC) had shown inhibitory activity against TRMP2.

However, there are no current effective antivirals or licensed vaccines for infection prevention. Moreover, sequence information for human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) circulating in China is inadequate. Therefore, to shed light on viral genetic diversity and evolution, we collected samples from patients infected with HPIV1C4 in China from 2012 to 2018 to sequence the viruses. We obtained 24 consensus sequences, comprising 1 for HPIV1, 2 for HPIV2, 19 for HPIV3, and 2 for HPIV4A. Phylogenetic analyses classified the 1 HPIV1 into clade 2, and the 2 HPIV4 sequences into cluster 4A. Based on the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene, a new sub-cluster was identified in one of the HPIV2, namely G1c, and the 19 HPIV3 sequences were classified into the genetic lineages of C3f and C3a. The results indicated that HPIV1C4 were co-circulated in China. Further, the lineages of sub-cluster C3 of HPIV3 were co-circulated in China. A recombination analysis indicated that a putative recombination event may have occurred in the HN gene of HPIV3. In the obtained sequences of HPIV3, we found that two amino acid substitution sites (R73K in the F protein of PUMCH14028/2014 and A281V in the HN protein of PUMCH13961/2014) and a negative selection site (amino acid position 398 in the F protein) corresponded to the previously reported neutralization-related sites. Moreover, amino acid substitution site (K108E) corresponded to the negative selection site (amino acid position 108) in the 10 F proteins of HPIV3. However, no amino acid substitution site corresponded to the glycosylation site in the obtained HPIV3 sequences.

These results indicated that FHR-E deficiency promoted LPS-induced sepsis and AKI through AP over-activation, providing a mouse model for studying AP regulation and sepsis.

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was carried out among nurses who were actively involved in COVID-19 duties at government tertiary health care institutes of India and data was collection through convenience sampling. Standardized tools (HADS, WHOQOL-BREF) were preferred for the assessment of participants' anxiety, depression and quality of life. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify predictors for anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Of 354 nurses, 12.1% were suffering from anxiety while 14.7% had depression.

Both forms of NS4 are nucleocytoplasmic proteins, but NS4-I has a stronger nuclear presence whilst NS4-II has a proportionally higher cytoplasmic distribution. A subtype of NS4-II containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS), named NLS-NS4-II, displays distinct punctate foci in the nucleus. We showed that NS4 likely enters the nucleus via passive diffusion as a result of its small size. Colocalization analysis with nuclear compartments revealed that NS4 colocalizes with promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), suggesting a role in the antiviral response or interferon signalling. Interestingly, we showed that two other AHSV proteins also interact with nuclear components. A small fraction of the NS1 tubules were present in the nucleus and associated with PML-NBs; this was more pronounced for a virus strain lacking NS4. A component of nuclear speckles, serine and arginine rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2) was recruited to viral inclusion bodies (VIBs) in the cytoplasm of AHSV-infected cells and colocalized with NS2.

Because of this, emergency department crowding and ambulance bunching, or surges in ambulance-transported patients at receiving hospitals, can have a detrimental effect on patient care and financial implications for an EMS system. The Centralized Ambulance Destination Determination (CAD-D) project was initially created as a pilot project to look at the impact of an active, online base hospital physician and paramedic supervisor to direct patient destination and distribution, as a way to improve ambulance distribution, decrease surges at hospitals, and decrease diversion status. Methods: The project was initiated March 17, 2020, with a six-week baseline period;it had three additional study phases where the CAD-D was recommended (Phase 1), mandatory (Phase 2), and modified (Phase 3), respectively. We used coefficients of variation (CV) statistical analysis to measure the relative variability between datasets (eg, CAD-D phases), with a lower variation showing better and more even distribution across the different hospitals. We used analysis of co-variability for the CV to determine whether level loading was improved systemwide across the three phases against the baseline period. The primary outcomes of this study were the following: to determine the impact of ambulance distribution across a geographical area by using the CV;to determine whether there was a decrease in surge rates at the busiest hospital in this area;and the effects on diversion. Results: We calculated the CV of all ratios and used them as a measure of EMS patient distribution among hospitals. Mean CV was lower in Phase 2 as compared to baseline (1.56 vs 0.80 P < 0.05), and to baseline and Phase 3 (1.56 vs. 0.93, P <0.05). A lower CV indicates better distribution across more hospitals, instead of the EMS transports bunching at a few hospitals. Furthermore, the proportion of surge events was shown to be lower between baseline and Phase 1 (1.43 vs 0.77, P <0.05), baseline and Phase 2 (1.43 vs. 0.33, P < 0.05), and baseline and Phase 3 (1.43 vs 0.42, P < 0.05). Diversion was shown to increase over the system as a whole, despite decreased diversion rates at the busiest hospital in the system. Conclusion: In this retrospective study, we found that ambulance distribution increased across the system with the implementation of CAD-D, leading to better level loading. The surge rates decreased at some of the most impacted hospitals, while the rates of hospitals going on diversion paradoxically increased overall. Specifically, the results of this study showed that there was an improvement when comparing the CAD-D implementation vs the baseline period for both the ambulance distribution across the system (level loading/CV), and for surge events at three of the busiest hospitals in the system.","output":"Centralized Ambulance Destination Determination: A Retrospective Data Analysis to Determine Impact on EMS System Distribution, Surge Events, and Diversion Status"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While controlled ventilation is most frequently used during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and passive ventilation of the lung synchronously with chest compressions and decompressions might represent a promising alternative approach. One benefit of CPAP during CPR is the reduction of peak airway pressures and therefore a potential enhancement in haemodynamics. We therefore evaluated the tidal volumes and airway pressures achieved during CPAP-CPR. During CPR with the LUCAS? 2 compression device, a manikin model was passively ventilated at CPAP levels of 5, 10, 20 and 30 hPa with the Boussignac tracheal tube and the ventilators Evita? V500, Medumat? Transport, Oxylator? EMX, Oxylog? 2000, Oxylog? 3000, Primus? and Servo?-i as well as the Wenoll? diver rescue system. Tidal volumes and airway pressures during CPAP-CPR were recorded and analyzed. Tidal volumes during CPAP-CPR were higher than during compression-only CPR without positive airway pressure. The passively generated tidal volumes increased with increasing CPAP levels and were significantly influenced by the ventilators used. During ventilation at 20 hPa CPAP via a tracheal tube, the mean tidal volumes ranged from 125 ml (Medumat?) to 309 ml (Wenoll?) and the peak airway pressures from 23 hPa (Primus?) to 49 hPa (Oxylog? 3000). Transport ventilators generated lower tidal volumes than intensive care ventilators or closed-circuit systems. Peak airway pressures during CPAP-CPR were lower than those during controlled ventilation CPR reported in literature. High peak airway pressures are known to limit the applicability of ventilation via facemask or via supraglottic airway devices and may adversely affect haemodynamics. Hence, the application of ventilators generating high tidal volumes with low peak airway pressures appears desirable during CPAP-CPR. The limited CPAP-CPR capabilities of transport ventilators in our study might be prerequisite for future developments of transport ventilators.","output":"Passive continuous positive airway pressure ventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a randomized cross-over manikin simulation study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemi Covid-19 berdampak pada hampir segala sektor kehidupan manusia, mulai dari sektorekonomi, pendidikan, sosial, sampai ke aspek psikologis.

The proportional increase in older people can be observed in almost all countries and regions worldwide. As a result, more people spend their later years in nursing homes. In homes where person-centered care is implemented, residents report greater satisfaction and quality of life. This approach is based on the wishes and needs of the residents. Therefore, the purpose of this scoping review is to explore the wishes and needs of nursing home residents. A scoping review of the literature was conducted in which 12 databases were systematically searched for relevant articles according to PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Both quantitative and qualitative study designs were considered. A total of 51 articles met the inclusion criteria. Included articles were subjected to thematic analysis and synthesis to categorize findings into themes. The analysis identified 12 themes to which the wishes and needs were assigned: (1) Activities, leisure, and daily routine; (2) Autonomy, independence, choice, and control; (3) Death, dying, and end-of-life; (4) Economics; (5) Environment, structural conditions, meals, and food; (6) Health condition; (7) Medication, care, treatment, and hygiene; (8) Peer relationship, company, and social contact; (9) Privacy; (10) Psychological and emotional aspects, security, and safety; (11) Religion, spirituality; and (12) Sexuality.

Three of the known human coronaviruses: MERS, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen for the COVID-19 pandemic, cause severe disease. Improved methods to predict host specificity of coronaviruses will be valuable for identifying and controlling future outbreaks. The coronavirus S protein plays a key role in host specificity by attaching the virus to receptors on the cell membrane. We analyzed 1238 spike sequences for their host specificity. Spike sequences readily segregate in t-SNE embeddings into clusters of similar hosts and/or virus species. Machine learning with SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest gave high average accuracies, [Formula: see text] scores, sensitivities and specificities of 0.95C0.99. Importantly, sites identified by Decision Tree correspond to protein regions with known biological importance.

We also manipulated incubation and reaction conditions and assessed the subsequent effects on activity and stability of -galactosidase, with comparisons between various solid support materials and free (dissolved) enzyme. Nylon-6 fiber membranes were created by electrospinning and were compared with other materials as solid supports for enzyme binding. The other materials included polyvinylidene fluoride 5-kDa nanofiltration dairy membranes, nylon-6 pellets, and silica glass beads. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the large surface area of NFM, which correlated with greater enzyme activity compared with the relatively flatter surfaces of the other solid support materials. Enzyme activity was measured spectrophotometrically with the color-changing substrate o-nitrophenyl--d-galactopyranoside. Compared with the other solid supports, NFM had greater maximum enzyme binding potential. Across pH conditions ranging from 3.5 to 6.0 (including the optimal pH of 4.0-5.0), enzyme activity was maintained on the membrane-immobilized samples, whereas free enzyme did not maintain activity. Altering the storage temperature (4, 22, and 50C) affected enzyme stability (i.e., the ability of the enzyme to maintain activity over time) of free and polyvinylidene fluoride membrane samples. However, NFM samples maintained stability across the varying storage temperatures. Increasing the immobilization solution enzyme concentration above the maximum enzyme binding capacity had no significant effect on enzyme stability for membrane-immobilized samples; however, both had lower mean stability than free enzyme by approximately 74%. With further development, -galactosidase immobilized on NFM or other membranes could be used in continuous processing in the dairy industry for a combination of filtration and lactose hydrolysis-creating products that are reduced in lactose and increased in sweetness, with no requirement for \\"added sugars\\" on the nutrition label and no enzyme listed as final product ingredient.","output":"Activity, stability, and binding capacity of -galactosidase immobilized on electrospun nylon-6 fiber membrane."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease, named COVID-19, emerged in China in December 2019, and has rapidly spread around the world. It is clearly urgent to fight COVID-19 at global scale. The development of methods for identifying drug uses based on phenotypic data can improve the efficiency of drug development. However, there are still many difficulties in identifying drug applications based on cell picture data. This work reported one state-of-the-art machine learning method to identify drug uses based on the cell image features of 1024 drugs generated in the LINCS program. Because the multi-dimensional features of the image are affected by non-experimental factors, the characteristics of similar drugs vary greatly, and the current sample number is not enough to use deep learning and other methods are used for learning optimization. As a consequence, this study is based on the supervised ITML algorithm to convert the characteristics of drugs. The results show that the characteristics of ITML conversion are more conducive to the recognition of drug functions. The analysis of feature conversion shows that different features play important roles in identifying different drug functions.

In view of the perceived benefits from collaboration, the experiences and challenges of these collaborative initiatives and the possible implications of the proposed legislation, a study of the evidence on attitudes, perceived impacts and the motivational factors towards European Member State collaboration regarding the pricing and reimbursement of medicines was conducted. This study adopted an evidenceCbased management approach by Barends and Rousseau. The main findings showed that Member States differed in their motivation for collaboration for different pharmaceutical activities. Member States favoured voluntary co-operation for all activities of pricing and reimbursement except for relative effectiveness assessments where Member State authorities had divergent attitudes and prioritised activities related to the sustainability of their healthcare systems and access to medicines. Contrastingly pharmaceutical companies strongly favoured mandatory cooperation for evaluation. Member States motivation for collaboration was highly dependent on the purpose, political will, implementation climate and cultural factors. Currently, with the experiences of ongoing collaborations, following the progress of the discussion at Council, and with a number of inititatives for new pharmaceutical strategy and policy, it is proposed that Member States use their trust, expertise and knowledge of application of evidence-based decision making for pricing and reimbursement of medicines and apply it to decide the future model for Member State collaboration.

It is also used in the therapeutic applications against certain types of neuroendocrine tumors, as exemplified by the clinically used (123/131)I-MIBG as theranostic single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) agent. With the development of more advanced positron emission tomography (PET) technology, more radiotracers targeting NET have been reported, with superior temporal and spatial resolutions, along with the possibility of functional and kinetic analysis. More recently, fluorine-18-labelled NET tracers have drawn increasing attentions from researchers, due to their longer radiological half-life relative to carbon-11 (110 min vs. 20 min), reduced dependence on on-site cyclotrons, and flexibility in the design of novel tracer structures. In the heart, certain NET tracers provide integral diagnostic information on sympathetic innervation and the nerve status. In the central nervous system, such radiotracers can reveal NET distribution and density in pathological conditions. Most radiotracers targeting cardiac NET-function for the cardiac application consistent of derivatives of either norepinephrine or MIBG with its benzylguanidine core structure, e.g. (11)C-HED and (18)F-LMI1195. In contrast, all NET tracers used in central nervous system applications are derived from clinically used antidepressants. Lastly, possible applications of NET as selective tracers over organic cation transporters (OCTs) in the kidneys and other organs controlled by sympathetic nervous system will also be discussed.

Methods and Results: An online questionnaire survey was conducted in 37 Japanese CR training facilities after the national declaration of a state of emergency in 7 prefectures. Among these facilities, 70% suspended group ambulatory CR and 43% suspended cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX). In contrast, all facilities maintained individual inpatient CR. Of the 37 facilities, 95% required CR staff to wear a surgical mask during CR. In contrast, 50% of facilities did not require patients to wear a surgical mask during CR. Cardiac telerehabilitation was only conducted by a limited number of facilities (8%), because this method was still under development. In our survey, 30% of the facilities not providing cardiac telerehabilitation had specific plans for its future use. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that ambulatory CR and CPX were suspended to avoid the spread of COVID-19.

Nonetheless, there is little agreement concerning their differential diagnosis. This paper will discuss to what extent different anatomical sites of acute respiratory tract infections can be uniquely identified or whether the overlap and consecutive development in signs and symptoms renders these distinctions meaningless. Acute respiratory tract infections are variable but definition of diagnostic categories based on the anatomical sites of the dominant complaints shows that signs and symptoms both overlap to a great extent and/or emerge successively. Thus, in common cold distinguishing between acute symptom-based diagnoses arising from different anatomical sites of the aerodigestive system remains elusive. Therefore, preferred symptomatic treatments should foster a resolution of all possible symptoms as opposed to an isolated treatment of a single symptom (e. g. mucus hypersecretion) according to the presumed anatomical site (i. e. acute bronchitis).","output":"Common Cold C an Umbrella Term for Acute Infections of Nose, Throat, Larynx and Bronchi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease, named COVID-19, has become the largest global public health crisis since it started in early 2020. CT imaging has been used as a complementary tool to assist early screening, especially for the rapid identification of COVID-19 cases from community acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases. The main challenge in early screening is how to model the confusing cases in the COVID-19 and CAP groups, with very similar clinical manifestations and imaging features. To tackle this challenge, we propose an Uncertainty Vertex-weighted Hypergraph Learning (UVHL) method to identify COVID-19 from CAP using CT images. In particular, multiple types of features (including regional features and radiomics features) are first extracted from CT image for each case. Then, the relationship among different cases is formulated by a hypergraph structure, with each case represented as a vertex in the hypergraph. The uncertainty of each vertex is further computed with an uncertainty score measurement and used as a weight in the hypergraph. Finally, a learning process of the vertex-weighted hypergraph is used to predict whether a new testing case belongs to COVID-19 or not. Experiments on a large multi-center pneumonia dataset, consisting of 2148 COVID-19 cases and 1182 CAP cases from five hospitals, are conducted to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the proposed method.

METHODS: We searched modeling publications through PubMed and associated references from 1990 to 30 September 2009. Inclusion criteria were modeling papers quantifying the effectiveness of combination strategies, both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical. RESULTS: Nineteen modeling papers on combination strategies were selected. Four studies examined combination strategies on a global scale, 14 on single countries, and one on a small community. Stochastic individual-based modeling was used in nine studies, stochastic meta-population modeling in five, and deterministic compartmental modeling in another five. As part of combination strategies, vaccination was explored in eight studies, antiviral prophylaxis and/or treatment in 16, area or household quarantine in eight, case isolation in six, social distancing measures in 10 and air travel restriction in six studies. Two studies suggested a high probability of successful influenza epicenter containment with combination strategies under favorable conditions. During a pandemic, combination strategies delayed spread, reduced overall number of cases, and delayed and reduced peak attack rate more than individual strategies. Combination strategies remained effective at high reproductive numbers compared with single strategy. Global cooperative strategies, including redistribution of antiviral drugs, were effective in reducing the global impact and attack rates of pandemic influenza.

Rapid detection and isolation of cases with highest viral loads, even in pre- or asymptomatic individuals, is essential for the mitigation of community outbreaks. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this study, we analyze Ct values from 1297 SARS-CoV-2 positive patient saliva samples collected at the Clemson University testing lab in Upstate South Carolina. Samples were identified as positive using RT-qPCR, and clade information was determined via whole genome sequencing at nearby commercial labs. We also obtained patient-reported information on symptoms and exposures at the time of testing. The lowest Ct values were observed among those infected with Delta (median: 22.61, IQR: 16.72C28.51), followed by Alpha (23.93, 18.36C28.49), Gamma (24.74, 18.84C30.64), and the more historic clade 20G (25.21, 20.50C29.916). There was a statistically significant difference in Ct value between Delta and all other clades (all p.adj<0.01), as well as between Alpha and 20G (p.adj<0.05). Additionally, pre- or asymptomatic patients (n=1093) showed the same statistical differences between Delta and all other clades (all p.adj<0.01); however, symptomatic patients (n=167) did not show any significant differences between clades. Our weekly testing strategy ensures that cases are caught earlier in the infection cycle, often before symptoms are present, reducing this sample size in our population. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 variants Alpha and Delta have substantially higher viral loads in saliva compared to more historic clades. This trend is especially observed in individuals who are pre- or asymptomatic, which provides evidence to the high transmissibility and rapid spread of emerging variants.

MIL has also been linked to mental representations-e.g., beliefs, values, attitudes, and identities-that serve as 'meaning frameworks' for interpreting the world and oneself. Combining these proposals, we predicted that beliefs, values, attitudes, and identities would foster sense of MIL to the extent that they provide feelings of coherence, purpose, and existential mattering. METHOD Using multilevel path analysis, we tested within-person associations of coherence, purpose, and existential mattering with sense of MIL across three studies (Study 1: 208 US MTurk workers; Study 2: 106 UK university students; Study 3: 296 from a UK nationally-representative Prolific sample). We explored the generality of these associations across mental representation types and individual differences. RESULTS Participants derived greater MIL most strongly from mental representations that provided sense of purpose, followed by existential mattering.

Several risk factors associated with unfavorable outcome were identified, including elderly age, selected comorbidities, immune suppression as well as laboratory markers. The role of immune system in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is indisputable: while an appropriate function of the immune system is important for a rapid clearance of the virus, progression to the severe and critical phases of the disease is related to an exaggerated immune response associated with a cytokine storm. We analyzed differences and longitudinal changes in selected immune parameters in 823 adult COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the Martin University Hospital, Martin, Slovakia. Examined parameters included the differential blood cell counts, various parameters of cellular and humoral immunity (serum concentration of immunoglobulins, C4 and C3), lymphocyte subsets (CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), CD19(+), NK cells, CD4(+)CD45RO(+)), expression of activation (HLA-DR, CD38) and inhibition markers (CD159/NKG2A). Besides already known changes in the differential blood cell counts and basic lymphocyte subsets, we found significantly higher proportion of CD8(+)CD38(+) cells and significantly lower proportion of CD8(+)NKG2A(+) and NK NKG2A(+) cells on admission in non-survivors, compared to survivors; recovery in survivors was associated with a significant increase in the expression of HLA-DR and with a significant decrease of the proportion of CD8(+)CD38(+)cells. Furthermore, patients with fatal outcome had significantly lower concentrations of C3 and IgM on admission. However, none of the examined parameters had sufficient sensitivity or specificity to be considered a biomarker of fatal outcome. Understanding the dynamic changes in immune profile of COVID-19 patients may help us to better understand the pathophysiology of the disease, potentially improve management of hospitalized patients and enable proper timing and selection of immunomodulator drugs.","output":"Activated CD8(+)CD38(+) Cells Are Associated With Worse Clinical Outcome in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To quantify the impact Covid-19 has had on vascular surgery during the pandemic at our unit compared to previous operating activity levels at a single vascular centre. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all vascular operations undertaken in the department dating from 11(th) March 2020 to 16(th) November 2020. Historical average data (HD) from the previous five years (2015-2019) over the same timeframe were then collected for comparison. RESULTS: During the Covid-19 pandemic 237 vascular operations were performed which represented a 48% operative reduction compared to average HD (454). 57 elective day-case procedures (varicose veins/temporal artery biopsies/renal access) were performed compared to a median of 259 from HD. Varicose vein surgery had an 79% reduction (37 vs 180). Renal access surgery was unaffected (15 vs 9). Major limb revascularisation procedures were reduced by 41% (36 vs 61) however this did not equate to any increase in amputation rates (79 vs 84). There was no reduction in carotid procedures performed during the pandemic (26 vs 30). There was a 60% (14 vs 35) reduction in all types of aneurysm procedures. CONCLUSION: The Covid-19 pandemic has dramatically affected vascular surgery at our unit. In terms of arterial work the largest disparities compared to previous years was major revascularisation and aneurysm surgery. In respect to elective day case procedures, venous work has unsurprisingly been hardest hit which, once resources allow, will require significant provision to overcome the shortfall.

OBJECTIVE To determine the technical feasibility, safety, and functional outcome with ADAPT using the new large-bore 6F SOFIA Plus catheter. METHODS A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from six university hospitals was performed. The following parameters of all acute stroke procedures (June 2015- January 2016) using the SOFIA Plus catheter were analyzed: accessibility of the thrombus with the catheter, recanalization success (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b), time to recanalization, procedure-related complications. Furthermore, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores at presentation and discharge and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at 90 days were recorded. RESULTS 85 patients were treated using the SOFIA Plus catheter. The occlusion site was the anterior circulation in 94.1%. Median baseline NIHSS score was 18. In 64.7%, ADAPT alone was successful after a median procedure time of 21 min. With additional use of stent retrievers in the remaining cases, the recanalization rate was 96.5%. No catheter-related complications such as dissections were observed. Thrombus migration to a new vascular territory occurred in 4.7% and symptomatic hemorrhage in 4.7%. After 3 months, mRS 0-2 was achieved in 49.4%. Mortality rate was 20%. CONCLUSIONS In the majority of cases, thrombus aspiration using the SOFIA Plus catheter results in successful recanalization after a short procedure time.

Despite the growth of Asians in the U. S, there is a gap in understanding the heterogeneity of CMDs across Asian subgroups and how these might be affected by the social determinants of health (SDOH), or the environment in which people live and work. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this systematic review is to examine the current literature on CMDs among Asian Americans and identify the SDOH that are associated with the incidence and/or prevalence of CMDs among specific Asian subgroups. METHODS PubMed, Embase, Web of Science were searched for articles published in Jan 2000-Nov 2020. The reproducible strategy yielded 2732 articles. The articles were reviewed based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) observational study published in the U.S., (2) adult population includes specific Asian subgroups, (3) exposures include SDOH, and (4) outcomes include a CMD, defined as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, or stroke. RESULTS In this review, 14 studies were identified and organized into four key themes: acculturation (n = 9), socioeconomic status (SES) (n = 6), social context (n = 2), and health literacy (n = 1). The most represented Asian subgroups in the literature were Chinese, Filipino, and South Asians. Acculturation was the most described social factor in the included reviews. Seven studies found associations between higher acculturation levels and higher prevalence of CMD. However, the measure of acculturation varied by study and included various combinations of the country of birth, number of years residing in the U.S., and English proficiency. The effects of SES, measured as income level and educational attainment, varied by racial subgroups. One study found that higher levels of education were associated with CMD among South Asians. CONCLUSION Acculturation, SES, social context, and health literacy impact the risk of CMD among Asian Americans; these vary across subgroups. Future research disentangling SDOHs on the risk of CMDs by Asian subgroup is necessary to provide better informed preventive practices and interventions.","output":"The social determinants of health associated with cardiometabolic diseases among Asian American subgroups: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hasta el 20 de julio, se han reportado 7,7 millones de casos y ms de 311,000 muertes en las Amricas La pandemia por COVID-19 no muestra signos de enlentecer en nuestra regin En la ltima semana, hubo casi 900,000 casos nuevos y casi 22,000 muertes reportadas en nuestra regin, la mayora de ellas en Brasil, Mxico y Estados Unidos","output":"Rueda de prensa semanal sobre COVID-19: palabras de apertura de la directora, 21 julio 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective was to analyze the longitudinal distribution, epidemiological characteristics, and local prevention and control measures of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in six cities in Henan Province, China, from 21 January 2020 to 17 June 2020: Xinyang City (including Gushi County), Nanyang City (including Dengzhou City), Zhumadian City (including Xincai County), Zhengzhou City (including Gongyi City), Puyang City, and Anyang City (including Hua County). Data were collected and analyzed through the COVID-19 information published on the official websites of the health commissions in the six selected cities of Henan Province. As of 17 June 2020, the cumulative incidence rate of COVID-19 in Henan Province was 1.33/100,000, the cumulative cure rate was 98.27%, the cumulative mortality rate was 1.73%, the age range of diagnosed cases was 5 days to 85 years old, and the male-to-female ratio was 1.09:1. The confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Henan Province were mainly imported cases from Hubei, accounting for 87.74% of all cases, of which the highest proportion was 70.50% in Zhumadian. The contact cases and local cases increased in a fluctuating manner over time. In this paper, epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Henan Province were analyzed from the onset of the outbreak to the effective control within 60 days, and effective and distinctive prevention and control measures in various cities were summarized to provide a favorable useful reference for the further formulation and implementation of epidemic prevention and control and a valuable theoretical basis for effectively avoiding a second outbreak.

Identifying these variables that influence such costs are essential to an organizations financial viability. To enable the U.S. healthcare system to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic CMS issued blanket waivers that permit enhanced flexibility, extension, and other emergency declaration changes to ACO reporting requirements through the unforeseen future. This relaxation and even pausing of reporting requirements encouraged the researchers to conduct a systematic review and identify variables that have influenced costs incurred by ambulatory care organizations participating in ACOs prior to the emergency declaration. The research findings identified ACO-ambulatory care variables (enhanced patient care management, health information technology improvements, and organizational ownership/reimbursement models) that helped to reduce costs to the ambulatory care organization. Additional variables (social determinants of health/environmental conditions, lack of integration/standardization, and misalignment of financial incentives) were also identified in the literature as having influenced costs for ambulatory care organizations while participating in an ACO initiative with CMS. Findings can assist ambulatory care organizations to focus on new and optimized strategies as they begin to prepare for the post-pandemic resumption of ACO quality reporting requirements once the emergency declaration is eventually lifted.","output":"Pandemic Pause: Systematic Review of Cost Variables for Ambulatory Care Organizations Participating in Accountable Care Organizations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Dark Triad traits of Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy have been found to negatively impact work behaviors including information sharing, reporting of unethical conduct, and mistreatment of colleagues and subordinates. However, research has found the Dark Triad can also be related to forms of organizational commitment which underpin positive work behaviors, including engaging in tasks and duties beyond those required (i.e., going above and beyond). Professional commitment is a broader form of commitment that has been found to be significantly related to organizational commitment, sharing antecedents, and having similar outcomes. Professional commitment, the affective, normative, and continuance commitment toward one's profession or occupation, has the benefit of applying to individuals employed by organizations as well as those working for themselves or between jobs. In this research, we explore relationships between professional commitment, using previous research on the relationship between the dark triad traits of Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and narcissism and organizational commitment, as a basis for predictions. We also explored two forms of precarious employment (career interruptions and part-time or casual work) as possible moderators of the dark triad-professional commitment relationship. Participants were 184 Australian professionals (52.2% men), a slight majority of whom had experienced a career interruption (69.6%) or a year or more of part-time or casual employment (70.7%). The results showed that psychopathy had a negative association with affective commitment, whereas Machiavellianism was positively related to normative commitment, and narcissism was positively related to normative and continuance commitment. Using regression analysis, we found that among individuals who have worked in part-time/casual employment longer, Machiavellianism and psychopathy had significantly stronger negative associations with affective commitment. In contrast, among individuals who have had a significant career interruption, Machiavellianism had significantly stronger positive association with continuance commitment.

We have characterized CHIKV nsP2 using both cell-free and cell-based assays. First, we show that Cys478 residue in the active site of CHIKV nsP2 is indispensable for P1234 processing. Second, the substrate requirements of CHIKV nsP2 are quite similar to those of nsP2 of related Semliki Forest virus (SFV). Third, substitution of Ser482 residue, recently reported to contribute to the protease activity of nsP2, with Ala has almost no negative effect on the protease activity of CHIKV nsP2. Fourth, Cys478 to Ala as well as Trp479 to Ala mutations in nsP2 completely abolished RNA replication in CHIKV and SFV trans-replication systems. In contrast, trans-replicases with Ser482 to Ala mutation were similar to wild type counterparts.

In recent years, Canadian health care organizations have faced large-scale systemic medical errors, a nation-wide generic injectable drug shortage, iatrogenic infectious disease outbreaks, and myriad other crises. These situations often have an ethical component that ethics consultants may be able to address. Organizational leaders such as health care managers and governing boards have responsibilities to oversee and direct the response to crisis situations. This study investigates the nature and degree of involvement of Canadian ethics consultants in such situations. METHODS This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews with Canadian ethics consultants to investigate the nature of their interactions with upper-level managers and governing board members in health care organizations, particularly in times of organizational crisis. We used a purposive sampling technique to identify and recruit ethics consultants throughout Canada. RESULTS We found variability in the interactions between ethics consultants and upper-level managers and governing boards. Some ethics consultants we interviewed did not participate in managing organizational crisis situations. Most ethics consultants reported that they had assisted in the management of some crises and that their participation was usually initiated by managers. Some ethics consultants reported the ability to bring issues to the attention of upper-level managers and indirectly to their governing boards. The interactions between managers and ethics consultants were characterized by varying degrees of collegiality. Ethics consultants reported participating in or chairing working groups, participating in incident management teams, and developing decision-making frameworks.

The first pandemic wave started in March to May 2020 and was characterized by the peak of confinement measures and lockdown application. The second wave started in September and peaked in November to December 2020 and was characterized by improved healthcare organization but significant burden for the hospitals and intensive care units. Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is used for evaluation of ischemia in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. Purpose: To compare DSE volume and positivity rates between 2019 and 2020 time periods in a department of a public tertiary hospital. Methods: We retrospectively analysed DSE studies performed in our department in 2020 including the peak of covid-19 restrictions and compared the data to the 2019. Results: Volume of DSE studies decreased from 1516 in 2019 to 996 in 2020 (-34.3%). The study volume reduction was greater in April (-93.7%) and May (-54.5%) when the covid-19 restrictions were at the peak. Great decreases were also recorded in November (-46.8%) and December (-53.5%) when the second wave of covid-19 disease emerged. Conversely, small increases were recorded in September (7.1%) and October (10.6%) (figure 1). Regarding positivity rates, a statistically non-significant increase was recorded (33.6% vs 34.2% in 2019 and 2020 respectively, p = 0.73). Interestingly a statistically significant increase in positivity levels was recorded during the period March to May 2020 compared to the same period of 2019 (44.7% vs 36.9%, p = 0.029). On the contrary, positivity rates were decreased at the period September to December (27.1% vs 34.2%, p = 0.019) (figure 2). Conclusions: Volume of DSE studies was significantly reduced in 2020 when compared to 2019 during respective peaks of the pandemic and the accompanying restriction measures. Positivity rates were higher during the first pandemic wave, possibly due to decreased hospital attendance of mildly symptomatic patients in combination with stricter admission criteria at the emergency department. Lower positivity rates during the second pandemic wave possibly reflect an adjustment of both healthcare systems and patients to the new conditions imposed by the covid-19 pandemic.","output":"Dobutamine stress echocardiography during covid-19 pandemic: impact on volume and positivity rates in a tertiary hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Treating infected acute and/or chronic wounds still represents a major challenge in medical care.

The antiseptic efficacy was evaluated standardly as well as under the influence of human AWF after 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours. The specific chemical formulation and concentration of the antiseptic substance (ionic or nanocrystalline silver, silver sulfadiazine, PHMB 0.1%/0.5%) embedded within the dressings seemed to play a key role. For certain dressings (two nanocrystalline and one ionic silver dressing), the antimicrobial efficacy was significantly reduced under the influence of AWF compared to unchallenged test series. Unchallenged the efficacy of PHMB was comparable to silver against P. aeruginosa and even significantly superior against S. aureus and E. coli. Challenged with AWF the reduction rates for silver adjusted or even exceeded (P. aeruginosa) those of PHMB. Within a challenging wound environment, especially some silver formulations demonstrated a reduced bacterial reduction. Regarding the presented in vitro results, the biomolecular interactions of antiseptic wound dressings with wound fluid should be part of more extensive investigations, considering varying factors such as bacterial species and wound (micro)environment to develop targeted therapeutic regimes for the individual.","output":"Influence of human acute wound fluid on the antibacterial efficacy of different antiseptic polyurethane foam dressings: An in vitro analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic and the related restrictions had a significant impact on the living and working conditions as well as the everyday behavior and mental health condition. Aim of the current analysis was to examine the impact of the input-deprived circumstances on the sexual life characteristics. An online survey carried out after a few weeks of the first nation-wide lockdown was enacted in Hungary. 1,755 persons participated in the first wave (50.4% males). Relationship and sexual life satisfaction, sexual intercourse and masturbation frequency were assessed with additional single-item questions about the subjective change (5-pont Likert scale;1=decreased significantly;5=increased significantly) in these characetristics since the epidemiological restrictions had been introduced. Furthermore, several potential protective and risk factors were measured (depressive symptoms, perceived stress, loneliness, general well being, intolerance of uncertainty, sensation seeking, and COVID-19 related health anxiety). Linear regression models were calculated to assess which of the former variables predict the subjective changes of ones sexual life. The analyses resulted in weak standardized coefficients. The subjective change in relationship satisfaction (mean 3.20, SD 0.94) and sexual satisfaction (mean 2.82, SD 0.73) were predicted positively by general well-being (=.11C0.25, p<.01), and negatively by loneliness (=-.14-0.19, p<0.01). Loneliness predicted negatively the subjective change in sexual intercourses (mean 2.75, SD 0.89) and masturbation frequency (mean 2.89, SD 0.84) (=- .10C.12, p<.01), while sensation seeking had no effect (=-.09, p<.01). The COVID-19 related health anxiety predicted negatively only the change in sexual life frequency (=-.07, p<.05).

For some diseases, such as dengue fever, the serotypes interact by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), in which infection with a single serotype is asymptomatic, but contact with a second serotype leads to higher viral load and greater infectivity. We present and analyze a dynamic compartmental model for multiple serotypes exhibiting ADE. Using center manifold techniques, we show how the dynamics rapidly collapses to a lower dimensional system. Using the constructed reduced model, we can explain previously observed synchrony between certain classes of primary and secondary infectives (Schwartz et al. in Phys Rev E 72:066201, 2005). Additionally, we show numerically that the center manifold equations apply even to noisy systems. Both deterministic and stochastic versions of the model enable prediction of asymptomatic individuals that are difficult to track during an epidemic. We also show how this technique may be applicable to other multistrain disease models, such as those with cross-immunity.","output":"Using dimension reduction to improve outbreak predictability of multistrain diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Recently, there has been a focus on the effect of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the anastomotic leakage rate after colorectal surgery. METHODS An experimental, randomized, placebo-controlled prospective study on 32 male Wistar rats was carried out. We examined the effect of diclofenac 4 mg/kg/day on the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme in the anastomotic tissue and on the breaking strength of anastomotic and incisional wounds. The operation was performed with colonic resection and hand-sewn anastomosis. After 3 days, the rats were sacrificed and the breaking strength and the COX-2 content of the anastomosis were measured. RESULTS There was a significantly reduced level of COX-2 in the rats treated with diclofenac (p = 0.001); no significant differences in any of the breaking strength measurements and no significant correlation between COX-2 levels and breaking strength of the anastomotic or incisional wounds could be found (p = 0.073 and p = 0.727). CONCLUSION This study for the first time showed that a diclofenac dose of 4 mg/kg/24 h was sufficient to reduce the level of COX-2 enzymes in the anastomotic tissue in rats. This inhibition of the inflammatory response did not lead to reduced breaking strength of either anastomotic or incisional wounds. Whether there is a detrimental effect of COX inhibition on colorectal anastomoses in the clinical setting remains controversial.","output":"Effect of diclofenac on cyclooxygenase-2 levels and early breaking strength of experimental colonic anastomoses and skin incisions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing to curb the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted medical and surgical education.

While elective activity has halted across the board nationally, the slow plateau of COVID-19 case rates prompts the question of timing of resumption of clinical activity. We sought to prospectively predict geographical \\"hot zones\\" for otolaryngological exposure to COVID-19 based on procedural volumes data from 2013 to 2017. METHODS: Otolaryngologic CPT codes were stratified based on risk-level, according to recently published specialty-specific guidelines. Using the Medicare POSPUF database, aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) were mapped based on hospital referral regions, against up-to-date COVID-19 case distribution data, as of April 24, 2020. RESULTS: The most common AGPs were diagnostic flexible laryngoscopy, diagnostic nasal endoscopy, and flexible laryngoscopy with stroboscopy. The regions with the most AGPs per otolaryngologist were Iowa City, IA, Detroit, MI, and Burlington, VT, while the states with the most COVID-19 cases as of April 24th are New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a model for predicting possible \\"hot zones\\" for otolaryngologic exposure based on both COVID-19 case density and AGP-density.

The lack of a licensed vaccine or treatment options emphasize the need to obtain more insight into the viral life cycle and CHIKV-host interactions. Infectious cDNA clones are important tools for such studies, and for mechanism of action studies on antiviral compounds. Existing CHIKV cDNA clones are based on a single genome from an individual clinical isolate, which is expected to have evolved specific characteristics in response to the host environment, and possibly also during subsequent cell culture passaging. To obtain a virus expected to have the general characteristics of the recent E1-226V CHIKV isolates, we have constructed a new CHIKV full-length cDNA clone, CHIKV LS3, based on the consensus sequence of their aligned genomes. Here we report the characterization of this synthetic virus and a green fluorescent protein-expressing variant (CHIKV LS3-GFP). Their characteristics were compared to those of natural strain ITA07-RA1, which was isolated during the 2007 outbreak in Italy. In cell culture the synthetic viruses displayed phenotypes comparable to the natural isolate, and in a mouse model they caused lethal infections that were indistinguishable from infections with a natural strain. Compared to ITA07-RA1 and clinical isolate NL10/152, the synthetic viruses displayed similar sensitivities to several antiviral compounds. 3-deaza-adenosine was identified as a new inhibitor of CHIKV replication. Cyclosporin A had no effect on CHIKV replication, suggesting that cyclophilins -opposite to what was found for other +RNA viruses- do not play an essential role in CHIKV replication. The characterization of the consensus sequence-based synthetic viruses and their comparison to natural isolates demonstrated that CHIKV LS3 and LS3-GFP are suitable and representative tools to study CHIKV-host interactions, screen for antiviral compounds and unravel their mode of action.","output":"Characterization of Synthetic Chikungunya Viruses Based on the Consensus Sequence of Recent E1-226V Isolates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent COVID-19 based emergency remote education caught educational practitioners unprepared and caused learners to rely on any technology which offered them the best pedagogical solution.

The sensing technology is highly scalable and could be integrated to a pulse oximeter probe for increased patient comfort. A tonometric cuff-less mechatronic system is used to apply pressure on the fingertip for (i) measuring oscillometric blood pressure, (ii) recording arterial waveform and for (iii) constructing central blood pressure (CBP) waveform. Clinical study on volunteers (n = 33) was performed against a commercially available arm cuff device yielding systolic and diastolic readings ((meanSD) mmHg) of (-0.9  7.3) mmHg and (-3.3  6.6) mmHg respectively. The results comply with the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard for non-invasive blood pressure monitors.

It has affected more than 200 countries, infected 5,939,234 people, and killed 367,255 in the world until 1 June 2020. While the disease epidemic could affect population mental health, this study aimed to investigate stress, anxiety, and depression during the Corona pandemic in Iran. METHODS: An online survey was designed using the depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) questionnaire. The questionnaire was available for all Iranian population from 18 to 28 April 2020. Finally, 1498 participants filled the questionnaire using snowball sampling. Data were analyzed using multivariate regression models. RESULTS: Findings showed that most participants had experienced a normal level of stress (36.6%), anxiety (57.9%) and depression (47.9%). About 2.5% of respondents report an extremely severe level of stress. This amount of anxiety and depression was 6.3 and 7.9%, respectively. Regression model showed being female (CI: - 1.299; - 0.248), living with a high risk family member (CI: 0.325; 1.400), health status (CI: - 0.857; - 0.595), economic status (CI: - 0.396; - 0.141), social capital (CI: - 0.475; - 0.244), risk of disease (CI: 0.081; 0.729), and following COVID-19 news (CI: 0.111; 0.551) have a relation with stress level. Education level (CI: - 0.252; - 0.017), living with a high risk family member (CI: 0.0301; 1.160), health status (CI: - 0.682; - 0.471), social capital (CI: - 0.236; - 0.048), risk of disease (CI: 0.154; 0.674), and following COVID-19 news (CI: 0.046; 0.401) have a relation with anxiety score. Depression score was in relation with education level (CI: - 0.263; - 0.022), having a high-risk family member (CI: 0.292; 1.155), health status (CI: - 0.687; - 0.476), social capital (CI: - 0.235; - 0.048), risk of disease (CI: 0.144; 0.667), and following Covid-19 news (CI: 0.053; 0.408). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the factors related to depression, anxiety, and stress are related to COVID-19, such as having a vulnerable person in the family, risk of disease, and following COVID-19 news.

The absence of federal oversight highlighted the critical role by states in health policymaking during a pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To identify public state-based protocols for remdesivir allocation and clinical guidance for prioritizing remdesivir use and assess approaches and inclusion of language promoting equitable access or mitigating health disparities. METHODS: We identified remdesivir allocation strategies and clinical use guidelines for all 50 states in the U.S. and the District of Columbia accessible on state health department websites or via internet searches. Public protocols dated between May 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 were included in the study. We reviewed strategies for allocation and clinical use, including whether protocols contained explicit language on equitable access to remdesivir or mitigating health disparities. RESULTS: A total of 38 states had a remdesivir allocation strategy, with 33 states (87%) making these public. States used diverse allocation strategies, and only 10 (30%) of the 33 states included language on equitable allocation. A total of 30 states had remdesivir clinical use guidelines, where all were publicly accessible. All guidelines referenced recommendations by federal agencies but varied in their presentation format. Of the 30 states, 12 (40%) had guidelines that included language on equitable use. Neither an allocation strategy or clinical use guideline were identified (public or non-public) for 10 states and the District of Columbia during the study period.

Little is known, however, about how the events during this time have affected the day-to-day experiences and concerns of American Jews. Using repeated cross-sectional data from surveys of Jewish young adults who applied to Birthright Israel, this paper analyzes recent trends in Jewish young adults experiences and perceptions of antisemitism. Despite the high-profile incidents during this period, there is no evidence of a major increase in experiences of antisemitic harassment among Jewish young adultseither on or off campusbetween 2017 and 2019. At the same time, data show a substantial increase in concerns among young Jews about antisemitism in the United States and on college campuses, with concerns about antisemitism in the United States (but not on campus) being especially concentrated among liberal Jews. These results suggest that Jewish concerns about antisemitism are linked to broader views about the climate for marginalized populations in the United States. They also point to growing Jewish anxieties over violence, safety, and acceptance in the United States. In an era of widely disseminated antisemitic conspiracy theories, even young Jews who have no first-hand experience of antisemitic harassment have become concerned.

METHODS: We enrolled 312 patients with COVID-19 admitted to seven hospitals located in Daegu. Using serum (or plasma) samples from patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, both IgG and IgM antibodies were measured using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R-FIND CO?VID-19 ELISA, SG medical, Seoul, Korea). RESULTS: The median value from the initial diagnosis, confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 PCR, to the sampling date was 24 days (day 1 to 88). The total positive rate of IgG was 93.9% and the positive IgM rate was 39.4%, without considering the elapsed period after diagnosis. Positive IgG and IgM rates were highest at 100.0% and 59.0%, respectively, at 3 weeks (15 - 21 days). IgG showed a high positive rate of 79.3% even within 7 days after the initial diag-nosis of the disease and maintained a positive rate of 97.8% until after 8 weeks.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in all intensive care units (ICUs) recognised for postgraduate training to determine administration, infrastructure, equipment, staffing, and training. RESULTS: There were 151 hospitals recognised for training, providing 2166 ICU beds and 1473 ventilators. Regional distribution of ICU beds per 100,000 population ranged from 1.0 in Sindh to none in Gilgit Baltistan (median 0.7). A senior clinician trained in critical care was available in 19 (12.1%) of units. One to one nurse to bed ratio during the day was available in 84 (53.5%) of units, dropping to 75 (47.8%) at night. Availability of 1:1 nursing also varied between provinces, ranging from 56.5% in Punjab compared to 0% in Azad Jamu Kashmir. Similarly there was disparity in availability of ventilators between provinces. All ICUs had basic infrastructure (electricity, running water, piped oxygen) and basic equipment (electronic monitoring and infusion pumps).

These patients are restricted in performing daily activities due to angina pectoris. Spinal cord stimulation is a last resort treatment option. A number of this patient population also has an indication for a cardiac implanted electronic device (CIED) (pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator). Manufacturers of spinal cord stimulators have stated a warning that interference can occur between the spinal cord stimulator and the CIED. Consequently, only a limited number of patients with RAP and a CIED have received a spinal cord stimulator. The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to determine whether spinal cord stimulation can be safely used in patients with RAP and a CIED. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients with RAP referred to our center were screened and included if 1) the patient received a spinal cord stimulator as treatment for RAP and if 2) the patient received a CIED either prior to or after spinal cord stimulator implantation. A transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) treadmill test was used as screening tool to determine whether the patient was eligible for implantation of a spinal cord stimulator. Interference between the spinal cord stimulator and CIED was checked 1) after TENS treadmill test, 2) during implantation of spinal cord stimulator or CIED, 3) during mode switches of the SCS, and 4) during regular out-patient follow-up. RESULTS In total, 22 patients had both a spinal cord stimulator and a CIED with an average follow-up duration of 44.5 months. No interference between the spinal cord stimulator and CIED was found. CONCLUSION Spinal cord stimulation can be safely applied in patients with a CIED provided that the CIED is checked for interference during implantation, if mode switches of the SCS occurred and once yearly after implantation according to routine follow-up.","output":"Feasibility of Spinal Cord Stimulation in Patients With Refractory Angina Pectoris and a Cardiac Implanted Electronic Device."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: For COVID-19 patients accurate prediction of disease severity and mortality risk would greatly improve care delivery and resource allocation. There are many patient-related factors, such as pre-existing comorbidities that affect disease severity. Since rapid automated profiling of peripheral blood samples is widely available, we investigated how such data from the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients might be used to predict clinical outcomes. Methods: We thus investigated such clinical datasets from COVID-19 patients with known outcomes by combining statistical comparison and correlation methods with machine learning algorithms; the latter included decision tree, random forest, variants of gradient boosting machine, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbour and deep learning methods. Results: Our work revealed several clinical parameters measurable in blood samples, which discriminated between healthy people and COVID-19 positive patients and showed predictive value for later severity of COVID-19 symptoms. We thus developed a number of analytic methods that showed accuracy and precision for disease severity and mortality outcome predictions that were above 90%. Conclusions: In sum, we developed methodologies to analyse patient routine clinical data which enables more accurate prediction of COVID-19 patient outcomes. This type of approaches could, by employing standard hospital laboratory analyses of patient blood, be utilised to identify, COVID-19 patients at high risk of mortality and so enable their treatment to be optimised.","output":"Predicting Patient COVID-19 Disease Severity by means of Statistical and Machine Learning Analysis of Blood Cell Transcriptome Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sleep duration is associated with mortality. However, prior studies exploring whether sleep duration predicts subsequent long-term mortality in patients with diabetes are limited. This study aims to examine whether metabolic factors affect the associations between baseline sleep duration and subsequent risks of all-cause, expanded, and non-expanded cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortalities among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: A total of 12,526 T2D patients aged 30 years and older, with a follow-up period  3 years, were identified from the Diabetes Case Management Program of a medical center in Taiwan. Sleep duration was measured using computerized questionnaires by case managers, and the time frame for this question was 1 month prior to the interview date. Sleep duration in relation to subsequent mortality from all causes, expanded CVD, and non-expanded CVD was examined using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Within 10 years of follow-up, 2918 deaths (1328 CVD deaths and 1590 non-CVD deaths) were recorded. A J-shaped association was observed for all-cause, expanded CVD, and non-expanded CVD mortalities, and the lowest risks were observed for patients with 5C7 h of sleep. The significant joint effects included sleep duration of more or less than 7 h with age  65 years [adjusted HRs: 4.00 (3.49C4.60)], diabetes duration  5 years [1.60 (1.40C1.84)], age at diabetes diagnosis  45 years [1.69 (1.38C2.07)], insulin use [1.76 (1.54C2.03)], systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure > 130/85 mmHg [1.24 (1.07C1.43)], triglyceride  150 mg/dL [1.38 (1.22C1.56)], HbA1c  7% [1.31 (1.13C1.52)], and body mass index < 27 kg/m(2) [1.31 (1.17C1.45)] for all-cause mortality. CONCLUSION: A J-shaped association was observed between sleep duration and all-cause and expanded CVD mortality, and a sleep duration of 5C7 h had the lowest mortality risk.

While serious vaccine damage as a scientific fact is real yet statistically highly uncommon, emerging social and technological forces have amplified perceptions of risk for \\"probable vaccine damage\\", making it a widely shared intersubjective reality. METHODS Using the Eurobarometer 91.2 survey on a statistically representative EU27-UK sample interviewed in March 2019, we documented perceptions of vaccine risks and identified three belief configurations regarding vaccine effectiveness, safety, and usefulness, through exploratory cluster analysis. RESULTS The public beliefs in significant vaccine risks are frequent. Approximatively one-tenth of the EU27-UK population consider that vaccines are not rigorously tested before authorization, one-third believe that vaccines can overload or weaken the immune system and that they can cause the disease against which they protect, and almost one-half believe that vaccines can cause serious side effects. We identified three belief configurations: hesitant, confident, and trade-off clusters. The hesitant type (approx. 11% of EU27-UK respondents) is defined by the perception that vaccines are rather ineffective, affected by risks of probable vaccine damage, not well-tested, and useless; the confident type (approx. 59%) is defined by beliefs that vaccines are effective, safe, well-tested, and useful; and the trade-off type (approx. 29%) combines beliefs that vaccines are effective, well-tested and useful, with perceptions of probable vaccine damage. The vaccine-confident and the trade-off types have similar vaccination histories, indicating the significant role of other factors besides beliefs in inducing behavior. CONCLUSIONS The high proportion of varying public beliefs in significant vaccine risks and the presence of a trade-off type of vaccination assessment indicate the social normality of beliefs in probable vaccine damage. Communication campaigns should take into account the social normality of the perceived risk of \\"probable vaccine damage\\" across various social types, and patterns of concomitant trust and mistrust in vaccination.","output":"Social amplification of risk and \\"probable vaccine damage\\": A typology of vaccination beliefs in 28 European countries."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has caused challenges for healthcare systems worldwide Recent data indicates that the psychological impact has differed with respect to occupation In many countries, medical residents have been on the front line of this pandemic However, data on the psychological impact of infectious disease outbreaks, and COVID-19 in particular, on medical residents are relatively lacking AIMS: The aim of our study was to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical residents working on the front and second line METHOD: An electronic survey was sent to all medical residents in Qatar Depression, anxiety and stress were assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 Items Professional quality of life was measured by the Professional Quality of Life measure RESULTS: Of the 640 medical residents contacted, 127 (20%) responded A considerable proportion of residents reported symptoms of depression (42 5%), anxiety (41 7%) and stress (30 7%) Multivariate analysis of variance showed significant effects of seniority in residency, with junior residents having poorer outcomes In addition, there was a statistically significant interaction effect with moderate effect sizes between gender and working on the front line, as well as gender, working on the front line and seniority, on mental health outcomes CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic may have a negative impact on junior residents' mental health Preventive measures to reduce stress levels and easy access to professional mental health services are crucial","output":"Factors associated with mental health outcomes among medical residents exposed to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common and disabling joint disorder that is mainly characterized by cartilage degeneration and narrow joint spaces.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) has been considered the main receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells, and they are known to be present not only in lungs (therefore the common viral pneumonia) but also in nasopharyngeal mucosa, salivary cells and oral epithelial cells.

Additionally, sites with active periodontal disease might contribute for virus binding and tissue infection due to elevated expression of furin and cathepsin L proteases, which play a major role in enabling the SARS-CoV-2 to bind ACE-2 receptors and facilitating endosomal fusion in the host cells.

METHODS This study was a nationwide cross-sectional survey conducted via phone interviews. A proportional quota sampling technique was used to obtain equal distributions of participants, stratified by age and gender, across the 13 regions of Saudi Arabia. Weight and height were self-reported, and obesity was determined as a BMI 30. Participants were asked to describe their current weight as ideal, underweight, overweight, or obese. Misclassification was then compared across groups according to a range of sociodemographic factors, behavioral risk factors, and health indicators. RESULTS Of the 6,239 participants contacted, 4,709 (75.5%) responded and completed the interview. Of them, 50.1% were female, and the mean age was 36.4 (SD  13.55) years.

Owing in part to a lack of earlier data, there was little evidence on whether state reopening policies influenced important pandemic outcomesCOVID-19Crelated hospitalizations and mortalityto guide future decision-making in the remainder of this and future pandemics. OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in COVID-19Crelated hospitalizations and mortality trends after reopening of US state economies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using an interrupted time series approach, this cross-sectional study examined trends in per-capita COVID-19Crelated hospitalizations and deaths before and after state reopenings between April 16 and July 31, 2020. Daily state-level data from the University of Minnesota COVID-19 Hospitalization Tracking Project on COVID-19Crelated hospitalizations and deaths across 47 states were used in the analysis. EXPOSURES: Dates that states reopened their economies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: State-day observations of COVID-19Crelated hospitalizations and COVID-19Crelated new deaths per 100 000 people. RESULTS: The study included 3686 state-day observations of hospitalizations and 3945 state-day observations of deaths. On the day of reopening, the mean number of hospitalizations per 100 000 people was 17.69 (95% CI, 12.54-22.84) and the mean number of daily new deaths per 100 000 people was 0.395 (95% CI, 0.255-0.536). Both outcomes displayed flat trends before reopening, but they started trending upward thereafter. Relative to the hospitalizations trend in the period before state reopenings, the postperiod trend was higher by 1.607 per 100 000 people (95% CI, 0.203-3.011; P = .03). This estimate implied that nationwide reopenings were associated with 5319 additional people hospitalized for COVID-19 each day. The trend in new deaths after reopening was also positive (0.0376 per 100 000 people; 95% CI, 0.0038-0.0715; P = .03), but the change in mortality trend was not significant (0.0443; 95% CI, ?0.0048 to 0.0933; P = .08). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study conducted over a 3.5-month period across 47 US states, data on the association of hospitalizations and mortality with state reopening policies may provide input to state projections of the pandemic as policy makers continue to balance public health protections with sustaining economic activity.","output":"US Trends in COVID-19CAssociated Hospitalization and Mortality Rates Before and After Reopening Economies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on nationwide survey data from China, we used a fractional logit model for analysis and propensity score matching (PSM) to evaluate the impact of family members serving as village cadres on household food waste.

In the presence of external pressure on the tissues, the local inflammatory process regulated by inflammatory cytokines can increase and prolong itself, contributing to the formation of pressure injury (PI). PI is defined as localized damage to the skin or underlying tissues. It usually occurs as a result of intense and/or prolonged pressure in combination with shear. The aim of the study is to perform a narrative review on the physiological evidence of increased risk in the development of PI in critically ill patients with COVID-19.In patients with severe COVID-19 a pattern of tissue damage consistent with complement-mediated microvascular injury was found in the lungs and skin of critically ill COVID-19 patients, suggesting sustained systemic activation of complement pathways. Theoretically, the same thrombogenic vascular changes related to COVID-19 that occur in the skin also occur in the underlying tissues, making patients less tolerant to the harmful effects of pressure and shear. Unlike the syndromes typical of acute respiratory illnesses and other pathologies that commonly lead to intensive care unit admission, COVID-19 and systemic viral spread show that local and systemic factors overlap. This fact may be justified by current epidemiological data showing that the prevalence of PI among intensive care unit patients with COVID-19 was 3 times higher than in those without COVID-19.

Therefore, we designed a 90-minute workshop \\"Corona-Debriefing\\" for students and physicians in specialist-training in family medicine (?iW) using three successive moderated interaction phases: Questionnaire survey via tele-dialogue voting (TED) with immediate presentation of results and discussion, moderated experience reports on the categories risk/assessment/support/coping and finally moderated group discussions in small groups to collect \\"best practice\\" examples of crisis management. Objective: We tested \\"Corona-Debriefing\\" as a pilot test with 48 participants (TN) in July 2020 (30 present, 14 online) in order to assess mental stress and risk perception of participants plus formative/brief summative evaluation of the workshop. Methods: The PHQ-4 with its subscales GAD-2 (anxiety) and PHQ-2 (depression) was used to assess mental stress; risk assessments were made by means of self-constructed 5-point Likert-scales for the dimensions person/society/health/economy. A formative evaluation was carried out by means of a questionnaire at the end of the event; the brief summative assessment was asked for by means of a school grading scale. Results: 37 complete TED questionnaires and 22 evaluations were obtained. TN showed a low personal risk assessment, but considerable fears about social and economic developments. Needs are seen mainly in improvements regarding organization, protective equipment and technical communication (e.g. official recommendations for action). The workshop was rated \\"good\\" or \\"very good\\" in 95% of the evaluations.

This data collection modality may be particularly well-suited for capturing emotion dysregulation, a transdiagnostic risk factor for psychopathology, across lifespan transitions. Adolescence, emerging adulthood, and perinatal transitions are particularly sensitive developmental periods, often marked by increased distress. These participant groups are typically assessed with laboratory-based methods that can be costly and burdensome. Passive monitoring presents a relatively cost-effective and unobtrusive way to gather rich and objective information about emotion dysregulation and risk behaviors. We first discuss key theoretically-driven concepts pertaining to emotion dysregulation and passive monitoring. We then identify variables that can be measured passively and hold promise for better understanding emotion dysregulation. For example, two strong markers of emotion dysregulation are sleep disturbance and problematic use of Internet/social media (i.e., use that prompts negative emotions/outcomes). Variables related to mobility are also potentially useful markers, though these variables should be tailored to fit unique features of each developmental stage. Finally, we offer our perspective on candidate digital variables that may prove useful for each developmental transition. Smartphone-based passive monitoring is a rigorous method that can elucidate psychopathology risk across human development.

To compare samples across different individuals and settings, the conventional practice has involved the normalization of raw AFB1-lysine adduct concentrations (e.g., pg/mL serum or plasma) to the total circulating HSA concentration (e.g., pg/mg HSA). It is hypothesized that this practice corrects for technical error, between-person variance in HSA synthesis or AFB1 metabolism, and other factors. However, the validity of this hypothesis has been largely unexamined by empirical analysis. The objective of this work was to test the concept that HSA normalization of AFB1-lysine adduct concentrations effectively adjusts for biological and technical variance and improves AFB1 internal dose estimates. Using data from AFB1-lysine and HSA measurements in 763 subjects, in combination with regression and Monte Carlo simulation techniques, we found that HSA accounts for essentially none of the between-person variance in HSA-normalized (R2 = 0.04) or raw AFB1-lysine measurements (R2 = 0.0001), and that HSA normalization of AFB1-lysine levels with empirical HSA values does not reduce measurement error any better than does the use of simulated data (n = 20,000). These findings were robust across diverse populations (Guatemala, China, Chile), AFB1 exposures (105 range), HSA assays (dye-binding and immunoassay), and disease states (healthy, gallstones, and gallbladder cancer). HSA normalization results in arithmetic transformation with the addition of technical error from the measurement of HSA. Combined with the added analysis time, cost, and sample consumption, these results suggest that it may be prudent to abandon the practice of normalizing adducts to HSA concentration when measuring any HSA adducts-not only AFB1-lys adducts-when using LCMS in serum/plasma.","output":"Assessing the Validity of Normalizing Aflatoxin B1-Lysine Albumin Adduct Biomarker Measurements to Total Serum Albumin Concentration across Multiple Human Population Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a rapid increase in the amount of information about the disease and SARS-CoV-2 on the internet.

Methods: From June to October 2020, we administered a survey about anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic to 1888 participants in CRIC. We examined associations of anxiety with demographics, clinical indices, health literacy, health-related behaviors and COVID-19 mitigation behaviors. Results: Four anxiety-related constructs were assessed: one composite overall global anxiety construct and three sub-constructs: general anxiety, worry, mood/feelings. Construct scores had moderate to strong correlations with each other (0.48-0.89) and high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.81). In adjusted analyses, younger age, female gender, Hispanic ethnicity, cardiovascular disease, household income <$100,000, unemployment, and marginal or inadequate health literacy predicted higher anxiety. During the pandemic, higher global anxiety scores were associated with higher odds of eating less healthy foods, reduced physical activity, and weight gain as well as reporting always wearing a mask in public in the past week. Conclusions: Several factors predict higher anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

There remains a compelling need to analyze factors that are predictive for patients at elevated risk of morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this retrospective study of patients who tested positive with COVID-19 and were treated at NYU (New York University) Langone Health was to identify clinical markers predictive of disease severity in order to assist in clinical decision triage and to provide additional biological insights into disease progression. METHODS: The clinical activity of 3740 patients at NYU Langone Hospital was obtained between January and August 2020; patient data were deidentified. Models were trained on clinical data during different parts of their hospital stay to predict three clinical outcomes: deceased, ventilated, or admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: The XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model that was trained on clinical data from the final 24 hours excelled at predicting mortality (area under the curve [AUC]=0.92; specificity=86%; and sensitivity=85%). Respiration rate was the most important feature, followed by SpO2 (peripheral oxygen saturation) and being aged 75 years and over. Performance of this model to predict the deceased outcome extended 5 days prior, with AUC=0.81, specificity=70%, and sensitivity=75%. When only using clinical data from the first 24 hours, AUCs of 0.79, 0.80, and 0.77 were obtained for deceased, ventilated, or ICU-admitted outcomes, respectively. Although respiration rate and SpO2 levels offered the highest feature importance, other canonical markers, including diabetic history, age, and temperature, offered minimal gain. When lab values were incorporated, prediction of mortality benefited the most from blood urea nitrogen and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Features that were predictive of morbidity included LDH, calcium, glucose, and C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: Together, this work summarizes efforts to systematically examine the importance of a wide range of features across different endpoint outcomes and at different hospitalization time points.","output":"Predictive Modeling of Morbidity and Mortality in Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 and its Clinical Implications: Algorithm Development and Interpretation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"All plus-strand RNA viruses replicate in association with cytoplasmic membranes of infected cells. The RNA replication complex of many virus families is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membranes, for example, picorna-, flavi-, arteri-, and bromoviruses. However, endosomes and lysosomes (togaviruses), peroxisomes and chloroplasts (tombusviruses), and mitochondria (nodaviruses) are also used as sites for RNA replication. Studies of individual nonstructural proteins, the virus-specific components of the RNA replicase, have revealed that the replication complexes are associated with the membranes and targeted to the respective organelle by the ns proteins rather than RNA. Many ns proteins have hydrophobic sequences and may transverse the membrane like polytopic integral membrane proteins, whereas others interact with membranes monotopically. Hepatitis C virus ns proteins offer examples of polytopic transmembrane proteins (NS2, NS4B), a tip-anchored protein attached to the membrane by an amphipathic -helix (NS5A) and a tail-anchored posttranslationally inserted protein (NS5B). Semliki Forest virus nsP1 is attached to the plasma membrane by a specific binding peptide in the middle of the protein, which forms an amphipathic -helix. Interaction of nsP1 with membrane lipids is essential for its capping enzyme activities. The other soluble replicase proteins are directed to the endo-lysosomal membranes only as part of the initial polyprotein. Poliovirus ns proteins utilize endoplasmic reticulum membranes from which vesicles are released in COPII coats. However, these vesicles are not directed to the normal secretory pathway, but accumulate in the cytoplasm. In many cases the replicase proteins induce membrane invaginations or vesicles, which function as protective environments for RNA replication.","output":"Viral RNA Replication in Association with Cellular Membranes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted a multicentre cross-sectional survey of COVID-19 patients to evaluate the acute psychological impact on the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during isolation treatment based on online questionnaires from 2 February to 5 March 2020. A total of 460 COVID-19 patients from 13 medical centers in Hubei province were investigated for their mental health status using online questionnaires (including Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-15, and Insomnia Severity Index scales). Among all 460 COVID-19 patients, 187 (40.65%) of them were healthcare workers (HCWs). 297 (64.57%) of them were females. The most common psychological problems were somatization symptoms (66.09%, n = 304), followed by depression (53.48%, n = 246), anxiety (46.30%, n = 213), problems of insomnia (42.01%, n = 171), and then self-mutilating or suicidal thoughts (23.26%, n = 107). Of all the patients, 15.65% (n = 72) had severe somatization symptoms, and 2.83% (n = 13) had severe (almost every day) self-mutilating or suicidal thoughts. The most common psychological problems for HCWs were somatization symptoms (67.84%, n = 125), followed by depression (51.87%, n = 97), anxiety (44.92%, n = 84), problems of insomnia (36.18%, n = 55), and then self-mutilating or suicidal thoughts (20.86%, n = 39). Patients with lower education levels were found to be associated with higher incidence of self-mutilating or suicidal thoughts (odds ratio [OR], 2.68, 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.66-4.33 [P < 0.001]). Patients with abnormal body temperature were found to be associated with higher incidence of self-mutilating or suicidal thoughts (OR, 3.97, 95% CI, 2.07-7.63 [P < 0.001]), somatic symptoms (OR, 2.06, 95% CI, 1.20-3.55 [P = 0.009]) and insomnia (OR, 1.66, 95% CI, 1.04-2.65 [P = 0.033]). Those with suspected infected family members displayed a higher prevalence of anxiety than those without infected family members (OR, 1.61, 95% CI, 1.1-2.37 [P = 0.015]). Patients at the age of 18-44 years old had fewer somatic symptoms than those aged over 45 years old (OR, 1.91, 95% CI, 1.3-2.81 [P = 0.001]). In conclusion, COVID-19 patients tended to have a high prevalence of adverse psychological events. Early identification and intervention should be conducted to avoid extreme events such as self-mutilating or suicidal impulsivity for COVID-19 patients, especially for those with low education levels and females who have undergone divorce or bereavement.","output":"Acute psychological impact on COVID-19 patients in Hubei: a multicenter observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several vaccines have been approved worldwide for the prevention of morbidity and mortality against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Modeling PPIs is useful for many biomedical applications, such as vaccine design, antibody therapeutics, and peptide drug discovery. Pre-training a protein model to learn effective representation is critical for PPIs. Most pre-training models for PPIs are sequence-based, which naively adopt the language models used in natural language processing to amino acid sequences. More advanced works utilize the structure-aware pre-training technique, taking advantage of the contact maps of known protein structures. However, neither sequences nor contact maps can fully characterize structures and functions of the proteins, which are closely related to the PPI problem. Inspired by this insight, we propose a multimodal protein pre-training model with three modalities: sequence, structure, and function (S2F). Notably, instead of using contact maps to learn the amino acid-level rigid structures, we encode the structure feature with the topology complex of point clouds of heavy atoms. It allows our model to learn structural information about not only the backbones but also the side chains. Moreover, our model incorporates the knowledge from the functional description of proteins extracted from literature or manual annotations. Our experiments show that the S2F learns protein embeddings that achieve good performances on a variety of PPIs tasks, including cross-species PPI, antibody-antigen affinity prediction, antibody neutralization prediction for SARS-CoV-2, and mutation-driven binding affinity change prediction.","output":"Multimodal Pre-Training Model for Sequence-based Prediction of Protein-Protein Interaction (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of diarrheal disease and an important contributor to overall global child mortality.

The data emphasises the need for us to look at the ways to improve the cancer referral pathway and service delivery. Materials and Methods: Retrospective electronic case note review was performed of urgent cancer referrals from general practitioners and general dental practitioners to Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Ear, Nose and Throat Head & Neck Cancer service at the Royal Derby Hospital. Results/Statistics: A total of 661 appointments were performed between 8 January 2020 and 30 June 2020 at the Head and Neck Cancer service. 98.9% of appointments pre-lockdown were seen face-to-face.

Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) may provide an accessible solution. Here, we determine the feasibility of using iCBT in the management of non-motor symptoms for individuals with AOIFCD. METHODS: Participants were randomised to receive an 8-week iCBT programme (n = 10) or not (n = 10), both alongside routine clinical care. All participants underwent assessments at baseline, 3-, and 6- months for anxiety, depression, quality of life and motor symptoms, and engagement with iCBT was recorded. Group differences over time were determined using two-way mixed ANOVA, and simple statistics evaluated change on an individual participant level. RESULTS: Over half of participants receiving iCBT (6/10) showed high engagement, with feedback indicating most participants found iCBT useful (6/8), would continue to use it (7/8), and try it again if offered (7/8). Although no between-group significant differences were observed (e.g. Becks Depression Inventory p = 0.067) anxiety and depression levels showed trends towards improvement at 3-months in those receiving iCBT. Individual level analysis also indicated higher percentage level improvements in these symptoms, with this sustained in 86% participants. CONCLUSION: iCBT represents a feasible therapeutic option in the management of co-morbid anxiety and depression in AOIFCD. Further work is needed to replicate these findings in a larger cohort, identify those most likely to benefit from this form of therapy and overcome barriers hindering those less likely to engage with this form of treatment.","output":"Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy as a feasible treatment of adult-onset, focal, isolated, idiopathic cervical dystonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the practical implications of libertarian theories of justice in the context of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

Increased mortality has been observed in older adults with multiple comorbidities. Six-minute walk distance (6MWD) at admission can help us to guide the requirement of oxygen during hospital stay that can be used to determine which patient can be managed at home. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a prospective observational study conducted on COVID-19 patients admitted at AIIMS, New Delhi, from October to December 2020. Patients aged more than 60 years were included in the study and underwent 6-min walk tests. Polypharmacy and multimorbidity were also assessed along with dyspnea which was measured on BORG scale. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical software STATA (version 14.2) was used for all the analyses. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 68.76 (7.4). Oxygen saturation prior to the 6-MWT was normal and has significantly higher than the post test (P  0.001). 6MWD was significantly correlated with pre values of oxygen saturation. 6MWD was observed more in patients who did not require oxygen during hospital stay. Self-reported dyspnea, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, and systolic blood pressure were significantly associated with the patients who had an oxygen requirement during the hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Self-reported dyspnea after 6MWT was found to be associated with oxygen requirement during hospital stay. Patients who have covered more distance in 6-min walk test have less oxygen requirement during hospital stay hence can be managed at home.

We carried out a qualitative research study to understand the resulting challenges experienced by providers of domestic violence and sexual assault support services. METHODS: Twenty-four semi-structured interviews were conducted to gather in-depth information from service providers and organizational leaders in the Canadian province of Alberta about the challenges they experienced adopting virtual and remote-based domestic violence and sexual assault interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak. Interview transcripts and field notes were analysed using a thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Our findings highlighted multiple challenges organizations, service providers and clients experienced. These included: (1) systemic (macro-level) challenges pertaining to policies, legislation and funding availability, (2) organization and provider (meso-level) challenges related to adapting services and programmes online or for remote delivery and (3) provider perceptions of client (micro-level) challenges related to accessing virtual interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Equity-focused policy and intersectional and systemic action are needed to enhance delivery and access to virtual interventions and services for domestic violence and sexual assault clients.","output":"Examining organization and provider challenges with the adoption of virtual domestic violence and sexual assault interventions in Alberta, Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human experience is punctuated by times of crisis Some crises are experienced at a personal level (e g , the diagnosis of a life-threatening disease), organizational level (e g , a business facing bankruptcy), and still others are experienced on a societal or global level (e g , COVID-19 pandemic) Although crises can be deeply troubling and anxiety provoking, they can also serve as an important catalyst for creative action and innovative outcomes This is because during times of crisis our typical forms of reasoning and action may no longer serve us It is precisely during such times that new ways of thought, action and leadership are needed A key question for researchers to consider is: Why and how times of crisis serve as an impetus for creative actions and outcomes?

A weekly online questionnaire based on the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium-WHO Case Report Form was used to collect participant reported data on symptoms, test results, National Health Service attendance, hospital admission and impact on daily life. PARTICIPANTS: 1490 immunocompromised children, defined as those requiring an annual influenza vaccination due to their underlying condition or medication. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of SARS-CoV-2-like symptoms and patient/parent anxiety score. RESULTS: Over 16 weeks during the first wave of the pandemic, no SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed in this large immunocompromised paediatric cohort (median age 11 years, 54.4% female). 110 symptomatic participants underwent a test for SARS-CoV-2; all were negative. 922 (67.4%) participants reported at least one symptom consistent with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection over the study period. 476 (34.8%) reported three or more symptoms. The most frequently reported symptoms included joint pain, fatigue, headache, nausea and muscle pain. SARS-CoV-2 testing during this period was performed on admitted patients only. 137 participants had their medication suspended or changed during the study period due to assumed COVID-19 disease risk. 62% reported high levels of anxiety (scores of 7-10 out of 10) at the start of the study, with anxiety levels remaining high throughout the study period.

Seeking to reduce patient exposure, our urologic oncology office made an immediate transition to telemedicine and this study reports our experience. METHODS: Beginning March 17, 2020 the urologic oncology department committed to see all patients via telemedicine, unless they needed a cystoscopy for high grade urothelial cell carcinoma or recent gross hematuria, or required removal of a Foley catheter or surgical drain. March 17 was assigned day 1, and for the next 14 days rates of face-to-face, audio and audiovisual encounters were recorded. A telephone survey was conducted with all patients who participated in an audiovisual encounter. RESULTS: In analyzing the numbers of face-to-face, audio and audiovisual encounters, after day 5 more patients participated in audiovisual encounters than any other modality. By day 10 no nonessential face-to-face encounter occurred. There was an 80.4% response rate to our survey. Average patient account setup time was 10.5 minutes and 35.1% required assistance from our office to set up their account, averaging 7.1 minutes. No-show rates of face-to-face encounters were significantly higher than for audiovisual encounters (face-to-face 67%, audiovisual 17%, p <0.001). Overall 82% of patients surveyed were likely to elect for a telemedicine encounter over a face-to-face encounter for a routine visit during future flu seasons.

PoIFN- cDNAs of Duroc breed (PoIFN--W) and Landrance/Duroc hybrid (PoIFN--M), which, respectively, encoded Q67 and R67, were introduced into a prokaryotic expression vector pET32 to express recombinant PoIFN--W (rPoIFN--W) and rPoIFN--M protein variants in Escherichia coli. The identity of both protein variants was further confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). We then compared bioactivities of these two recombinant proteins. Although both recombinant protein variants exhibited comparable activities in antiproliferation of PK-15 cells and in nitric oxide (NO) induction of porcine peripheral monocytes, antiviral activity of rPoIFN--W protein was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than that of rPoIFN--M protein in a plaque inhibition assay using pseudorabies virus (PRV). IC50 values of rPoIFN--W and rPoIFN--M protein in anti-PRV assay were determined as 5.3  1.3 and 9.3  4.3 nM, respectively. In conclusion, we have identified five novel SNPs in PoIFN- cDNA, including two missense polymorphisms that result in Q67R and K61R replacements. Our results further demonstrate that Q67R can markedly reduce antiviral activity of the PoIFN- protein. This is the first report that shows the functional SNP in the coding region of IFN-.

There are no effective treatments for the management of severe COVID-19 and current therapeutic trials are focused on antiviral therapy and attenuation of hyper-inflammation with anti-cytokine therapy. Severe COVID-19 pneumonia shares some pathological similarities with severe bacterial pneumonia and sepsis. In particular, it disrupts the haemostatic balance, which results in a procoagulant state locally in the lungs and systemically. This culminates in the formation of microthrombi, disseminated intravascular coagulation and multi-organ failure. The deleterious effects of exaggerated inflammatory responses and activation of coagulation have been investigated in bacterial pneumonia and sepsis and there is recognition that although these pathways are important for the host immune response to pathogens, they can lead to bystander tissue injury and are negatively associated with survival. In the past two decades, evidence from preclinical studies has led to the emergence of potential anticoagulant therapeutic strategies for the treatment of patients with pneumonia, sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and some of these anticoagulant approaches have been trialled in humans.

Despite these successes, the application of DMD to certain problems featuring highly nonlinear transient dynamics remains challenging. In such cases, DMD may not only fail to provide acceptable predictions but may indeed fail to recreate the data in which it was trained, restricting its application to diagnostic purposes. For many problems in the biological and physical sciences, the structure of the system obeys a compartmental framework, in which the transfer of mass within the system moves within states. In these cases, the behavior of the system may not be accurately recreated by applying DMD to a single quantity within the system, as proper knowledge of the system dynamics, even for a single compartment, requires that the behavior of other compartments is taken into account in the DMD process. In this work, we demonstrate, theoretically and numerically, that, when performing DMD on a fully coupled PDE system with compartmental structure, one may recover useful predictive behavior, even when DMD performs poorly when acting compartment-wise. We also establish that important physical quantities, as mass conservation, are maintained in the coupled-DMD extrapolation. The mathematical and numerical analysis suggests that DMD may be a powerful tool when applied to this common class of problems. In particular, we show interesting numerical applications to a continuous delayed-SIRD model for Covid-19, and to a problem from additive manufacturing considering a nonlinear temperature field and the resulting change of material phase from powder, liquid, and solid states.","output":"Coupled and Uncoupled Dynamic Mode Decomposition in Multi-Compartmental Systems with Applications to Epidemiological and Additive Manufacturing Problems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To determine any loss of function of a single-use bipolar vessel sealing device after repeated sterilization and use on canine carotid arteries.

METHODS: We performed an online survey among physicians involved in the treatment of mccRCC, and 41 experts responded. Questions focused on criteria relevant for treatment decision outside the pandemic and the modifications of systemic therapy during COVID-19. FINDINGS: For the majority of experts (73%), the combination of International metastatic renal cell carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) risk category and patient fitness are two important factors for decision-making. The main treatment choice in fit, favourable risk patients outside the pandemic is pembrolizumab/axitinib for 53%, avelumab/axitinib, sunitinib or pazopanib for 13% of experts each. During the pandemic, ICI-containing regimens are chosen less often in favour of a tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) monotherapy, mainly sunitinib or pazopanib (35%). In fit, intermediate/poor-risk patients outside the pandemic, over 80% of experts choose ipilimumab/nivolumab, in contrast to only 41% of physicians during COVID-19, instead more TKI monotherapies are given. In patients responding to established therapies with ICI/ICI or ICI/TKI combinations, most participants modify treatment regimen by extending cycle length, holding one ICI or even both. CONCLUSION: mccRCC treatment modifications in light of the coronavirus pandemic are variable, with a shift from ICI/ICI to ICI/TKI or TKI monotherapy.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on treatment patterns in metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has made unprecedented impact on the psychological health of university students, a population vulnerable to distress and mental health disorders. This study investigated psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress) during state-enforced quarantine among university students in China (N = 1912) through a cross-sectional survey during March and April 2020. RESULTS: Psychiatric symptoms were alarmingly prevalent: 67.05% reported traumatic stress, 46.55% had depressive symptoms, and 34.73% reported anxiety symptoms. Further, 19.56% endorsed suicidal ideation. We explored risk and protective factors of psychological health, including demographic variables, two known protective factors for mental health (mindfulness, perceived social support), four COVID-specific factors (COVID-19 related efficacy, perceived COVID-19 threat, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, COVID-19 prosocial behavior) and screen media usage. Across symptom domains, mindfulness was associated with lower symptom severity, while COVID-19 related financial stress, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, and perceived COVID-19 threat were associated with higher symptom severity. COVID-19 threat and COVID-19 stigma showed main and interactive effects in predicting all mental health outcomes, with their combination associated with highest symptom severity. Screen media device usage was positively associated with depression. Female gender and COVID-19 prosocial behavior were associated with higher anxiety, while COVID-19 self-efficacy associated with lower anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest high need for psychological health promotion among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic and inform an ecological perspective on the detrimental role of stigma during an emerging infectious disease outbreak. Interventions targeting multi-level factors, such as promoting mindfulness and social support at individual and interpersonal levels while reducing public stigma about COVID-19, may be particularly promising. Attending to the needs of disadvantaged groups including those financially impacted by COVID-19 is needed.","output":"Psychiatric symptoms, risk, and protective factors among university students in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We develop a model of pandemic risk management and firm valuation.

We conducted a cross-sectional study using the CDC database to compare the pre- vs. post-pandemic flu activity (incidence) between the US states. Our secondary objectives were to estimate the association between flu activity and flu vaccination rates and compare the national trends of flu and RSV activities since the pandemic outbreak. Methods: We estimated the difference between pre-pandemic (April 2019CMarch 2020) and post-pandemic (April 2020CMarch 2021) flu activity between individual states using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The association between flu activity and immunization rates was also measured. Finally, parallel time trend graphs for flu and RSV activities were illustrated with a time series modeler. Results: The median (IQR) pre-pandemic flu activity was 4.10 (1.38), higher than the post-pandemic activity (1.38 (0.71)) (p-value < 0.001). There was no difference between pre-pandemic (45.50% (39.10%)) and post-pandemic (45.0% (19.84%)) flu vaccine acceptance (p-value > 0.05). Flu activity and vaccination rates were not associated (p-value > 0.05). Flu activity has declined since the COVID-19 outbreak, while RSV made a strong comeback in June 2021. Conclusion: Flu activity has significantly diminished throughout the pandemic while a sudden upsurge in RSV is a public health concern indicative of possible resurgence of other viruses. Flu vaccine acceptance neither changed during the pandemic nor influenced the diminished Flu activity.","output":"The Influence of COVID-19 on Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus Activities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Psychiatric hospitals are becoming increasingly digitized because of the disruptive rise in technical possibilities. This digitization leads to new tasks and demands for health professionals, which can have an impact on technostress. It is unclear whether digital competence reduces technostress and how technostress affects health professionals mental and physical health. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the association between digital competence and technostress, considering individual characteristics and the association between technostress and long-term consequences for health professionals. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from 3 Swiss psychiatric hospitals were analyzed using multiple linear regression. The dependent variables for the models were digital competence, technostress, and long-term consequences (intention to leave the organization or the profession, burnout symptoms, job satisfaction, general health status, quality of sleep, headaches, and work ability). One model was calculated for each long-term consequence. The mean scores for technostress and digital competence could range between 0 (fully disagree) and 4 (fully agree), where a high value for technostress indicated high technostress and a high value for digital competence indicated high digital competence. RESULTS: The sample comprised 493 health professionals in psychiatric hospitals. They rated their technostress as moderate (mean 1.30, SD 0.55) and their digital competence as high (mean 2.89, SD 0.73). Digital competence was found to be significantly associated with technostress (=?.20; P<.001). Among the individual characteristics, age (=.004; P=.03) and profession were significantly associated with both digital competence and technostress. Technostress is a relevant predictor of burnout symptoms (=10.32; P<.001), job satisfaction (=?6.08; P<.001), intention to leave the profession (=4.53; P=.002), organization (=7.68; P<.001), general health status (=?4.47; P<.001), quality of sleep (=?5.87; P<.001), headaches (=6.58; P<.001), and work ability (=?1.40; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians and nurses who have more interaction with digital technologies rate their technostress higher and their digital competence lower than those in other professions. Health professionals with low interaction with digital technologies appear to overestimate their digital competence. With increasing digitization in psychiatric hospitals, an increase in the relevance of this topic is expected. Educational organizations and psychiatric hospitals should proactively promote the digital competence of health professionals to manage expected disruptive changes.","output":"Technostress and Digital Competence Among Health Professionals in Swiss Psychiatric Hospitals: Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: There is a paucity of data in scientific literature on the impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on bariatric surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Bariatric Surgery globally. METHODS: We conducted a global online survey of bariatric surgeons between 16/04/20 - 15/05/20. The survey was endorsed by five national bariatric surgery societies and circulated amongst their memberships. Authors also shared the link through their personal networks, email groups, and social media. RESULTS: 703 respondents from 77 countries completed the survey. Respondents reported a drop in elective bariatric activity from a median (IQR) of 130 (60-250) procedures in 2019 to a median of 0 (0-2) between16/03/2020 and 15/04/2020 during the pandemic. The corresponding figures for emergency activity were 5 (2-10) and 0 (0-1) respectively. 441 (63%) respondents did not perform any bariatric procedures during this time period. Surgeons reported outcomes of 61 elective bariatric surgical procedures during the pandemic with 13 (21%) needing ventilation and 2 (3.3%) deaths. Of the 13 emergency bariatric procedures reported, 5 (38%) needed ventilation and 4 (31%) died. 90 (13%) surgeons reported having had to perform a bariatric surgical or endoscopic procedure without adequate Personal Protective Equipment. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic led to a remarkable decline in global elective and emergency bariatric surgery activity at its beginning. Both elective and emergency procedures performed at this stage of the pandemic had considerable morbidity and mortality.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 pandemic on global Bariatric surgery PRActiceS - The COBRAS study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We develop and calibrate a search-theoretic model of the labor market in order to forecast the evolution of the aggregate US labor market during and after the coronavirus pandemic.

The results from a 304-participant study suggest that the spoken back warning covers may not work as intended, even when converted from text to speech. We controlled for COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy and political leanings and found that the vaccination hesitant Alexa users ignored any type of warning as long as the Tweets align with their personal beliefs. The politically independent users trusted Alexa less then their politically-laden counterparts and that helped them accurately perceiving truthful COVID-19 information.

DESIGN: Qualitative interview study, codesigned with mental health service users and carers. METHODS: We conducted semistructured, telephone or online interviews with a purposively constructed sample; a lived experience researcher conducted and analysed interviews with service users. Analysis was based on the constant comparison method. SETTING: National Health Service (NHS) secondary mental health services in England between June and August 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Of 65 participants, 20 had either accessed or needed to access English secondary mental healthcare during the pandemic; 10 were carers of people with mental health difficulties; 35 were members of staff working in NHS secondary mental health services during the pandemic. RESULTS: Experiences of remote care were mixed. Some service users valued the convenience of remote methods in the context of maintaining contact with familiar clinicians. Most participants commented that a lack of non-verbal cues and the loss of a therapeutic 'safe space' challenged therapeutic relationship building, assessments and identification of deteriorating mental well-being. Some carers felt excluded from remote meetings and concerned that assessments were incomplete without their input. Like service users, remote methods posed challenges for clinicians who reported uncertainty about technical options and a lack of training. All groups expressed concern about intersectionality exacerbating inequalities and the exclusion of some service user groups if alternatives to remote care are lost. CONCLUSIONS: Though remote mental healthcare is likely to become increasingly widespread in secondary mental health services, our findings highlight the continued importance of a tailored, personal approach to decision making in this area. Further research should focus on which types of consultations best suit face-to-face interaction, and for whom and why, and which can be provided remotely and by which medium.","output":"Remote care for mental health: qualitative study with service users, carers and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The subject of the paper is the consumer behaviour of Millennials and Generation Z as travellers in organising their travel. Through empirical research, conducted with online questionnaire in May 2021, the paper focuses on the way the above-mentioned generations in Serbia have organized travel (through a travel agency or on their own) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the choice of accommodation during the pandemic, and the respondents opinions on travel with COVID-19 passports. The aim of this paper is to discover the preferences and opinions of travellers when organizing travel under the new circumstances, as well as examining whether there are differences in the behaviour of Millennials and Generation Z as travellers before and during the pandemic, in order to provide significant information for the marketing decision making of tourism and hospitality organisations. Almost a quarter of the world's population is made up of Millennials, who, along with Generation Z, make up the current and future force that contributes the most to the income generation. Members of this population in Serbia are less and less opting for the services of travel agencies, especially during the pandemic, while the number of passengers of these generations who organize self-directed travel is on the increase.

On 20 Sep 2020, the KSA reported 334,605 cases, with 319,154 recoveries and 4,768 deaths. The KSA has taken several measures to control the spread of COVID-19, especially during the Umrah and Hajj events of 1441, including stopping Umrah and performing this year's Hajj in reduced numbers from within the Kingdom, and imposing a curfew on the cities of the Kingdom from 23 Mar to 28 May 2020. In this article, two statistical models were used to measure the impact of the curfew on the spread of COVID-19 in KSA. The two models are Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and Spatial Time-Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (STARIMA) model. We used the data obtained from 31 May to 11 October 2020 to assess the model of STARIMA for the COVID-19 confirmation cases in (Makkah, Jeddah, and Taif) in KSA. The results show that STARIMA models are more reliable in forecasting future epidemics of COVID-19 than ARIMA models.

While most randomized controlled trials have shown negative results, uncontrolled studies have suggested that the antibody content may influence patient outcomes. We conducted an open-label, randomized controlled trial of convalescent plasma for adults with COVID-19 receiving oxygen within 12 days of respiratory symptom onset. Patients were allocated 2:1 to 500 mL of convalescent plasma or standard of care. The composite primary outcome was intubation or death by 30 days. The effect of convalescent plasma antibodies on the primary outcome was assessed by logistic regression. The trial was terminated at 78% of planned enrollment after meeting stopping criteria for futility. 940 patients were randomized and 921 patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Intubation or death occurred in 199/614 (32.4%) in the convalescent plasma arm and 86/307 (28.0%) in the standard of care arm; relative risk (RR) 1.16 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-1.43; p=0.18). Patients in the convalescent plasma arm had more serious adverse events (33.4% vs. 26.4%; RR=1.27, 95% CI 1.02-1.57, p=0.034).

The Decision provides a context for the present study, which aims to identify good practices and lessons learned in preparedness and response to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (in UK, Greece, and Spain) and poliomyelitis (in Poland and Cyprus). METHODS: Based on a documentary review, followed by five week-long country visits involving a total of 61 interviews and group discussions with experts from both the health and non-health sectors, this qualitative case study has investigated six issues related to preparedness and response to MERS and poliomyelitis: national plans and overall preparedness capacity; training and exercises; risk communication; linking policy and implementation; interoperability between the health and non-health sectors; and cross-border collaboration. RESULTS: Preparedness and response plans for MERS and poliomyelitis were in place in the participating countries, with a high level of technical expertise available to implement them. Nevertheless, formal evaluation of the responses to previous public health emergencies have sometimes been limited, so lessons learned may not be reflected in updated plans, thereby risking mistakes being repeated in future. The nature and extent of inter-sectoral collaboration varied according to the sectors involved, with those sectors that have traditionally had good collaboration (e.g. animal health and food safety), as well as those that have a financial incentive for controlling infectious diseases (e.g. agriculture, tourism, and air travel) seen as most likely to have integrated public health preparedness and response plans. Although the formal protocols for inter-sectoral collaboration were not always up to date, good personal relations were reported within the relevant professional networks, which could be brought into play in the event of a public health emergency. Cross-border collaboration was greatly facilitated if the neighbouring country was a fellow EU Member State. CONCLUSIONS: Infectious disease outbreaks remain as an ongoing threat.

This study aimed to evaluate the factors affecting individuals' attitudes toward rumor-producing media in Iran. Methods: : An online survey was conducted in Iran in March 2020 on the source of trusted information and misinformation along with individuals' perception of the cause of misinformation propagation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: : The results showed that social media were considered as the primary rumor source from the perspective of a majority of the participants (59.3%). Lack of a reliable and formal news source was also introduced as the most common cause of a rumor formation by the participants (63.6%). To identify which media is the main source of rumors, the male participants who had high levels of education and were employed by the government proposed foreign media (P<0.01);however, the male participants aged 30-50 years with middle-income level believed that social media (P<0.01) were producing rumors. In this regard, the highly educated participants (P<0.001), government employees, and middle-income individuals (P<0.008) believed that national media produced rumors. Conclusion: Although these findings were obtained during the first encounter with the Corona pandemic, the authorities immediately introduced the national media as a reliable news source, which allowed the media and its journalists to reduce the gap between themselves and the public sphere.

These devices can also mitigate risks associated with going missing, by reducing time for search and returning the lost person home safely. However, there is no clear, standardized approach to assess the usability of these devices. The purpose of this study was to develop a locator device usability scale for persons living with dementia at risk of getting lost.

The second phase refined the item pool using an online survey and online focus groups with the same stakeholder groups. Five overarching categories were identified as important for the usability of locating device: features, inclusivity, simplicity, aesthetic appeal, and ethics. Participants identified the need for multiple versions of the usability scale including one specifically for persons living with dementia.

Design: Systematic review and narrative synthesis of observational studies. Data sources: We searched Medline, Embase, PsychInfo, Publons, Scopus and the Public Health England behavioural science LitRep database from inception to 17th September 2021 for relevant studies. Study selection: We included studies which collected observational data of at least one of three health protective behaviours (hand hygiene, face covering use and maintaining physical distance from others (social distancing) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies where observational data were compared to self-report data in relation to any infectious disease were also included. Data extraction and synthesis: We evaluated the quality of studies using the NIH quality assessment scale for observational studies, extracted data on sample size, setting and adherence to health protective behaviours, and synthesized results narratively. Results: Of 27,279 published papers on COVID-19 relevant health protective behaviours that included one or more terms relating to hand hygiene, face covering and social distancing, we identified 48 studies that included an objective observational measure. Of these, 35 assessed face covering use, 17 assessed hand hygiene behaviour and seven assessed physical distancing. The general quality of these studies was good. When expanding the search to all infectious diseases, we included 21 studies that compared observational versus self-report data. These almost exclusively studied hand hygiene. The difference in outcomes was striking, with self-report over-estimating observed adherence by up to a factor of five in some settings. In only four papers did self-report match observational data in any domains. Conclusions: Despite their importance in controlling the pandemic, we found remarkably few studies assessing protective behaviours by observation, rather than self-report, though these studies tended to be of reasonably good quality. Observed adherence tends to be substantially lower than estimates obtained via self-report. Accurate assessment of levels of personal protective behaviour, and evaluation of interventions to increase this, would benefit from the use of observational methods.","output":"A systematic review of observational methods used to quantify personal protective behaviours among members of the public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the concordance between observational and self-report measures in infectious disease health protection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread rapidly worldwide, some issues such as the uncertainty of the disease progress, whether intensive care will be needed, and risk classification are still important for clinicians.

In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the effects of the BCG vaccine and LTBI status on the course of the disease in patients diagnosed with coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) infection and to compare the LTBI rate with people with and without COVID-19 infection. The patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection who were hospitalized during a period of seven months between May 1st to December 1st, 2020 were investigated by the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) test in the blood samples for the presence of LTBI. For the comparison of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and people without COVID-19 infections in terms of LTBI rate retrospectively; all consecutive patients who were sent blood samples to the mycobacteriology laboratory for the QFT-Plus test between January 2016 and December 2019 were included in the study. Demographic, clinical, radiological, laboratory, and follow-up data of the patients were obtained from the electronic patient file. A total of 170 patients (n= 9 8 male [57.6%], n= 72 female [42.3%], mean age= 53.5  15.8 years) were enrolled. Twenty-five patients' (25/170 [14.7%]) QFT-plus tests were positive. When the cases with positive QFT-Plus test (n= 25) and the cases with negative QFT-Plus test (n = 145) were compared in terms of disease severity respectively; it was determined that mild/moderate patients were 18/25 (72%) and 108/145 (74.5%), severe patients were 7/25 (28%) and 37/145 (25.5%) (p= 0.988). When these two groups were compared in terms of the clinical course respectively; the need for intensive care was 6/25 (24%) and 34/145 (23.4%) (p= 1.00), oxygen therapy requirement was 13/25 (52%) and 49/145 (33.8%) (p= 0.128), and death was 5/25 (20%) and 18/145 (12.4%) (p= 0.341).

The detection of statistically significantly lower LTBI rates and T1-T2/IFN- values in the COVID-19 group supported that SARS-CoV-2 infection may suppress lymphocyte functions in patients and IFN- response.

SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain has shown a heterogeneous geographical pattern This study aimed to assess the influence of several climatic factors on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of COVID-19 among the Spanish Autonomous Communities (AA.CC.). METHODS: Data on coronavirus infectivity and severity of COVID-19 disease, as well as the climatic variables were obtained from official sources (Ministry of Health and Spanish Meteorological Agency, respectively). To assess the possible influence of climate on the development of the disease, data on ultraviolet radiation (UVR) were collected during the months before the start of the pandemic. To analyze its influence on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, data on UVR, temperature, and humidity were obtained from the months of highest contagiousness to the peak of the pandemic. RESULTS: From October 2019 to January 2020, mean UVR was significantly related not only to SARS-CoV-2 infection (cumulative incidence -previous 14 days-  105 habitants, rho = - 0.0,666; p = 0.009), but also with COVID-19 severity, assessed as hospital admissions (rho = - 0.626; p = 0.017) and ICU admissions (rho = - 0.565; p = 0.035). Besides, temperature (February: rho = - 0.832; p < 0.001 and March: rho = - 0.904; p < 0.001), was the main climatic factor responsible for the infectivity of the coronavirus and directly contributed to a different spread of SARS-CoV-2 across the Spanish regions. CONCLUSIONS: Climatic factors may partially explain the differences in COVID-19 incidence and severity across the different Spanish regions. The knowledge of these factors could help to develop preventive and public health actions against upcoming outbreaks of the disease.","output":"Can climatic factors explain the differences in COVID-19 incidence and severity across the Spanish regions?: An ecological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the perennial need to understand and manage uncertainty in international business, there is no comprehensive framework that incorporates different types of uncertainty, their antecedents and outcomes, and the different coping strategies used by managers and their outcomes. This makes it difficult for international business managers to understand the types of uncertainty in their businesses and develop appropriate strategies to deal with it effectively, especially during times such as the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. This paper uses an extensive review of the international business literature to address the above research gap by identifying the different types of uncertainty, their antecedents and outcomes, the coping strategies used to mitigate their impact, and the consequences of these actions. The authors also use examples from the current Covid-19 crisis to assess the firms' responses and their consequences.

There is a huge pressure on the hospital services and in particular, on the Intensive Care Units (ICU). Describing the need for critical care as well as the chance of being discharged from hospital according to patient characteristics, is essential for a more efficient hospital management. The objective of this study is to describe the probabilities of admission to the ICU and the probabilities of hospital discharge among positive COVID-19 patients according to demographics and comorbidities recorded at hospital admission. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of all patients with COVID-19 found in the Electronic Medical Records of Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital in Kuwait was conducted. The study included 3995 individuals (symptomatic and asymptomatic) of all ages who tested positive from February 24th to May 27th, 2020, out of which 315 were treated in the ICU and 3619 were discharged including those who were transferred to a different healthcare unit without having previously entered the ICU. A competing risk analysis considering two events, namely, ICU admission and hospital discharge using flexible hazard models was performed to describe the association between event-specific probabilities and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Results showed that being male, increasing age and comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and weakened immune system increased the risk of ICU admission within 10 days of entering the hospital. CKD and weakened immune system decreased the probabilities of discharge in both females and males however, the age-related pattern differed by gender. Diabetes, which was the most prevalent comorbid condition, had only a moderate impact on both probabilities (18% overall) in contrast to CKD which had the largest effect, but presented only in 7% of those admitted to ICU and in 1% of those who got discharged. For instance, within 5 days a 50-year-old male had 19% (95% C.I.: [15,23]) probability of entering the ICU if he had none of these comorbidities, yet this risk jumped to 31% (95% C.I.: [20,46]) if he had also CKD, and to 27% in the presence of asthma/COPD (95% C.I.: [19,36]) or of weakened immune system (95% C.I.: [16,42]). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides useful insight in describing the probabilities of ICU admission and hospital discharge according to age, gender, and comorbidities among confirmed COVID-19 cases in Kuwait. A web-tool is also provided to allow the user to estimate these probabilities for any combination of these covariates. These probabilities enable deeper understanding of the hospital demand according to patient characteristics which is essential to hospital management and useful for developing a vaccination strategy.","output":"Probabilities of ICU admission and hospital discharge according to patient characteristics in the designated COVID-19 hospital of Kuwait"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Exposure to lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg) has been reported to be associated with liver-related diseases. However, studies examining the association between heavy metal exposure and liver injury in a large population are scant and characterized by inconsistent results. This study aimed to evaluate the association between levels of heavy metal exposure and liver injury in the general population. Methods: Data for 2953 participants aged 19 years or more obtained from the Korean National Environmental Health Survey (KoNEHS) Cycle 3 (2015C2017) were used. The associations between levels of blood or urine heavy metals (Pb, Cd, and Hg) and liver function biomarkers [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)] were evaluated using multiple linear regression analysis. Results: Regarding the blood Pb (BPb), AST was higher in those of the 4th quartile, ALT was higher in those of the 2nd and 4th quartiles, and GGT was higher in those of the 3rd and 4th quartiles than in the 1st quartile. For urinary Cd (UCd), AST was higher in those of the 4th quartile; ALT was higher in those of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartiles; and GGT was higher in the 4th quartile than in the 1st quartile. For the blood Hg (BHg), AST was higher in those of the 2nd and 4th quartile, ALT was higher in those of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartiles; and GGT was higher in those of the 3rd and 4th quartiles than in the 1st quartile.

From the molecular docking study, it is noteworthy that remdesivir shows better binding affinity toward the main protease of SARS-CoV2 compared to other studied drugs. Within studied phytochemicals, carnosic acid shows better binding poses toward main protease of SARS-CoV2 among studied phytochemicals. The amino acid residues GLN110 and PHE294 were almost found in all the studied interactions of drugs and phytochemicals with main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the results show a larger contribution of the Van der Waals energies as compared to others like electrostatic energies suggesting that ligands at the binding pocket are predominantly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. The conformational change during ligand binding was predicted from Gibbs free energy landscape analysis through molecular dynamics simulation.

Design/methodology/approach A survey consisting of 24 questions including a Likert scale, multiple choice and open-ended was created to understand how members of Gen Z perceive Covid-19 impacting their education, employment, mental health and relationships. The survey was disseminated to employees of a corporate restaurant franchise, Christian college admissions and guidance non-profit, and online through social media including Instagram, Facebook, Reddit and LinkedIn. A total of 517 respondents completed the survey. Survey participants came from 29 states and 6 countries. Findings Results highlight Gen Z overwhelmingly values interpersonal connections, wants to Zoom less and work more in-person. The findings help anticipate potential professional gaps due to Covid-19 restrictions, as well as point out how Gen Z is markedly different in terms of workforce trends. Content analysis from an open-ended question reveals the extent of disruption Gen Z has experienced, adversely affecting their career plans and stalling professional development. Yet, despite these setbacks, Gen Z maintains a cautiously optimistic future outlook. Research limitations/implications Limitations to the study include the sample is largely comprising White women so the generalizability of results may be limited and the self-reporting nature of the survey may pose problems with method variance. Practical implications These findings have implications for Millennials as managers as they identify where resources should be invested including strengthening interpersonal communication skills, providing mentoring opportunities and appealing to their financial conservatism to recruit and retain Gen Z employees. The changes in telecommuting preferences and desire for more interpersonal and in-person communication opportunities highlight how Gen Z is markedly different than previous generations. Social implications Gen Z's optimistic future outlook conveys a sense of resilience and strength in the face of stress. Rather than engaging in cognitive distortions and over generalizations when stressed, results show Gen Z is able to find healthy alternatives and maintain optimism in the face of stress. Additionally, due to the extent of isolation and loneliness Gen Zers reported, the value of in-person connections cannot be overstated. As results convey a sense of being overlooked and missing out on so many rites of passage, inviting Gen Zers to share how they have been impacted, recognizing their accomplishments and listening to them may go a long way to develop rapport.

This condition has been referred as PCV2-enteric disease (PCV2-ED). The present study analysed retrospectively, from a pathological point of view, the relation between intestinal disorders and PCV2 infection in nursery and growing-finishing pigs. Among the 96 selected pigs suffering from enteric disease and submitted for necropsy between 1998 and 2011, the most prevalent enteric lesions were catarrhal enteritis/colitis (77.1%), followed by fibrinous lesions (11.5%), granulomatous inflammation (4.2%) and other lesions such as haemorrhages or ulceration (4.2%). Seventy-two pigs (75%) were positive for PCV2 by in situ hybridization (ISH). Among positive pigs for PCV2 ISH, 39 animals suffered from PCV2-SD and 33 had no lymphoid lesions but low amount of viral nucleic acid in several lymphoid tissues, therefore, these animals did not qualify for PCVD-ED. In conclusion, all animals with enteric disorders that were positive to PCV2 by ISH had evidence of viral systemic infection.

To address these increased waiting lists, we propose a rapid, simple, one-stop algorithm incorporating medication use (aromatase inhibitor, corticosteroid) and clinical risk stratification supplementing a standard FRAX assessment. Our pragmatic algorithm produces a recommendation to treat empirically, image with DXA, or observe. If applied, we model a significant reduction in DXA scan requirements with a corresponding reduction in treatment delays for those awaiting DXA. We estimate this will reduce DXA scan numbers by about 50%, whilst pragmatically ensuring those with the highest clinical need correctly receive treatment without delay. This algorithm will help many clinicians including general practitioners/family physicians prioritise DXA when they may not always have the expertise to make this judgement based on clinical information alone.

Heating properties of EMG1200, specific absorption rate (SAR), measured using an applied field of 360 kHz and 20 kA m-1, increased from 20 to 180 W per g Fe with increasing PLink-PEG5000. PEG replacing the initially hydrophobic coating decreased aggregation in water and CPA, consistent with earlier studies on heating performance. Furthermore, although the size is minimized at 0.20 mol PEG per g Fe, heating is not maximized until concentrations above 0.43 mol PEG per g Fe on EMG1200. SAR on hydrophilic EMG308 was preserved at 400 W per g Fe regardless of the amount of PLink added to the core. Herein concentrations of IONP in VS55 (common CPA) significantly above our previous capabilities, sIONP at 10 mg Fe per mL, was reached, 25 mg Fe per mL of 308-PEG5000 and 60 mg Fe per mL of 1200-PEG5000, approaching stock EMG308 in water, 60 mg Fe per mL. Furthermore, at these concentrations cryopreserved Human dermal fibroblast cells were successfully nanowarmed (at applied fields described above), with higher viability as compared to convective rewarming in a water bath and heating rate close to 200 C min-1, 2.5 times faster than our current system. Using PLink as the coating method allowed for higher concentrations of IONPs to be successfully suspended in CPA without affecting the heating ability. Additionally, the model ligand, PEG, allowed for increased stability over time in nanowarming experiments.","output":"Phosphonate coating of commercial iron oxide nanoparticles for nanowarming cryopreserved samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, immunoregulation and desensitization therapies were jointly applied in the treatment of asthma, in which chitosan (CS) nanoparticles were used. BALB/c mice were selected and mouse models of asthma were constructed. Mice were divided into 7 groups. A double-chamber plethysmograph, MTT, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and ELISA were used. The expression levels of IL-4 and IL-5 in lung tissue cells were detected. CS-BCG-PSN-OVA sustained-release vaccines significantly alleviated airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in asthmatic mice. The numbers of total lymphocytes and eosinophils in BALF were remarkably reduced. The expression levels of IL-4 and IL-5 in lung tissue cells of the treatment groups were dramatically decreased. CS-BCG-PSN-OVA was found in vitro to be able to inhibit OVA-induced T-cell proliferation and upregulate the proportion of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells. CS-BCG-PSN-OVA sustained-release vaccine could significantly attenuate AHR and airway inflammation in asthmatic mice.

As such, there has been a rapid escalation in scientific and clinical activity aimed at increasing our comprehension of this virus. This volume of work has led to early insights into risk factors associated with severity of disease, and mechanisms that underpin the virulence and dynamics involved in viral transmission. These insights ultimately may help guide potential therapeutics to reduce the human, economic and social impact of this pandemic. Importantly, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract has emerged as an important organ influencing propensity to, and potentially severity of, COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, the gut microbiome has been linked to a variety of risk factors for COVID-19 infection, and manipulation of the gut microbiome is an attractive potential therapeutic target for a number of diseases. While data profiling the gut microbiome in COVID-19 infection to date are limited, they support the possibility of several routes of interaction between COVID-19, the gut microbiome, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) expression in the small bowel and colon and gut inflammation. This article will explore the evidence that implicates the gut microbiome as a contributing factor to the pathogenesis, severity and disease course of COVID-19, and speculate about the gut microbiome's capability as a therapeutic avenue against COVID-19. Lay summary: It has been noted that certain baseline gut profiles of COVID-19 patients are associated with a more severe disease course, and the gut microbiome impacts the disease course of several contributory risk factors to the severity of COVID-19. A protein called ACE-2, which is found in the small intestine among other sites, is a key receptor for COVID-19 virus entry; there is evidence that the gut microbiome influences ACE-2 receptor expression, and hence may play a role in influencing COVID-19 infectivity and disease severity. Furthermore, the gut microbiome plays a significant role in immune regulation, and hence may be pivotal in influencing the immune response to COVID-19. In terms of understanding COVID-19 treatments, the gut microbiome is known to interact with several drug classes being used to target COVID-19 and should be factored into our understanding of how patients respond to treatment. Importantly, our understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in COVID-19 infection remains in its infancy, but future research may potentially aid our mechanistic understanding of viral infection, and new ways in which we might approach treating it.","output":"The gut microbiome: an under-recognised contributor to the COVID-19 pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dental institutions in the United States are reeling from the consequences of the novel SARS-CoV2 coronavirus, the causative agent of CODIV-19.

Currently, SARS-CoV-2 serology is performed using serum/plasma collected by venepuncture. Dried blood spot (DBS) testing offers significant advantages as it is minimally invasive, avoids venepuncture with specimens being mailed to the laboratory. METHODS: A pathway utilizing a newborn screening laboratory infrastructure was developed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in DBS specimens. Paired plasma and DBS specimens from SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive and -negative subjects and polymerase chain reaction positive subjects were tested. DBS specimen stability, effect of blood volume and punch location were also evaluated. RESULTS: DBS specimens from antibody-negative (n = 85) and -positive (n = 35) subjects and polymerase chain reaction positive subjects (n = 11) had a mean (SD; range) optical density (OD) of 0.14 (0.046; 0.03C0.27), 0.98 (0.41; 0.31C1.64) and 1.12 (0.37; 0.49C1.54), respectively. An action value OD >0.28 correctly assigned all cases. The weighted Deming regression for comparison of the DBS and the plasma assay yielded: y = 0.004041 + 1.005x, r = 0.991, Sy/x 0.171, n = 82. Extraction efficiency of antibodies from DBS specimens was >99%. DBS specimens were stable for at least 28 days at ambient room temperature and humidity. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG receptor-binding domain antibodies can be reliably detected in DBS specimens. DBS serological testing offers lower costs than either point of care or serum/plasma assays that require patient travel, phlebotomy and hospital/clinic resources; the development of a DBS assay may be particularly important for resource poor settings.","output":"Development of a high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing pathway using dried blood spot specimens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Roles of environmental factors in transmission of COVID-19 have been highlighted.

Combined, these factors lead to increased risk of acute and chronic illness and mental health issues. It is acknowledged that physical activity independently contributes to improved physical and mental health and may be a driver for mental well-being in carers. The aim of this pilot research was to understand how movement behaviour and health behaviours of carers of veterans in Australia relate to carers' physical and psychological well-being. Assessment occurred between February and July 2019 and included objective, validated measures to examine physical and psychological well-being. To assess the association between physical and psychological factors, correlational analyses were performed. Twenty-eight carers participated in the pilot study (96% female, mean age 61.6 years). Exercise capacity varied, and 84% of carers met the recommended 150 min of physical activity per week, with carers spending 8.6% of their time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity; and 37.9% of the day sedentary. Psychological health outcomes reflect a population with high distress levels and lower than average mental well-being, but with normal resilience scores. Carers with higher levels of resilience had greater exercise capacity, covering further distance in the 6-min walk test, and as resilience increased, number of sedentary bouts decreased. This research demonstrates that there is a relationship between health behaviours and psychological well-being in carers of veterans and serving personnel. Based on the findings of this pilot study, programmes to support family carers should include information about physical activity, reducing sedentary time, and increasing resilience. Interventions designed to improve physical and psychological well-being should be trialled and evaluated for effectiveness.","output":"Caring for carers: Understanding the physical and psychological well-being of carers of veterans in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To assess maternal mental health during the first weeks after birth including birth experience, postpartum adjustment to early motherhood and the perception of newborn behaviour, and how this may be influenced by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Ninety women who gave birth after the first enforcement of nation-wide disease control restrictions in Germany between 16 March and 10 May 2020 were surveyed and compared with 101 women who had given birth before the pandemic. Information on maternal mental health and maternal perception of early motherhood and neonatal behaviour were assessed at 3-8 weeks postpartum. RESULTS: Mothers who gave birth under the COVID-19-associated disease control restrictions did not show significant differences in depression, anxiety and social support scales compared to mothers before the pandemic. Birth experience was similar, while support during birth was perceived to be higher under the COVID-19 restrictions. Confidence in caretaking of the newborn and perception of neonatal behaviour were comparable between the two groups. Mothers expressed significantly higher dissatisfaction with the maternal role during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, maternal mental health and the perception of the newborn and early caretaking during the first COVID-19 wave did not substantially differ from the perceptions of mothers before the pandemic. A potential influence of the pandemic on higher dissatisfaction with the maternal role may be associated with the pandemic conditions affecting everyday life and should be addressed in postpartum care and in future qualitative and longitudinal studies.","output":"Experience of early motherhood during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Germany: a single-centre before and after comparison"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online parenting programs are an effective way to teach behavioral management skills to parents in the absence of in\\\\person resources.

Vaccination is the important prevention means against both infections. To achieve a PRV genome-based virus live vector, aiming at further TGEV/PRV bivalent vaccine development, a recombinant plasmid pUG was constructed via inserting partial PK and full-length gG genes of PRV strain Bartha K-61 amplified into pUC119 vector. In parallel, another recombinant pHS was generated by introducing a fragment designated S1 encoding the major antigen sites of S gene from TGEV strain TH-98 into a prokaryotic expression vector pP(RO)EX HTc. The SV40 polyA sequence was then inserted into the downstream of S1 fragment of pHS. The continuous region containing S1fragment, SV40 polyA and four single restriction enzyme sites digested from pHS was subcloned into the downstream of gG promoter of pUG. In addition, a LacZ reporter gene was introduced into the universal transfer vector named pUGS-LacZ. Subsequently, a PRV genome-based virus live vector was generated via homologous recombination. The functionally effective vector was purified and partially characterized.

Therefore, understanding transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases has become critical to formulating global public health policy. This systematic review assessed evidence in the medical and public health literature for the military as a disease vector. METHODS: We searched 3 electronic databases without temporal restrictions. Two researchers independently extracted study data using a standardized form. Through team discussions, studies were grouped according to their type of transmission mechanism and direct quotes were extracted to generate themes and sub-themes. A content analysis was later performed and frequency distributions for each theme were generated. RESULTS: Of 6477 studies, 210 met our inclusion criteria and provided evidence, spanning over two centuries (1810C2020), for the military as a pathogen transmitter, within itself or between it and civilians. Biological mechanisms driving transmission included person-to-person transmission, contaminated food and water, vector-borne, and airborne routes. Contaminated food and/or water were the most common biological transmission route. Social mechanisms facilitating transmission included crowded living spaces, unhygienic conditions, strenuous working, training conditions, absent or inadequate vaccination programs, pressure from military leadership, poor compliance with public health advice, contractor mismanagement, high-risk behaviours, and occupation-specific freedom of movement. Living conditions were the most common social transmission mechanism, with young, low ranking military personnel repeatedly reported as the most affected group. Selected social mechanisms, such as employment-related freedom of movement, were unique to the military as a social institution. While few studies explicitly studied civilian populations, considerably more contained information that implied that civilians were likely impacted by outbreaks described in the military. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified features of the military that pose a significant threat to global health, especially to civilian health in countries with substantial military presence or underdeveloped health systems. While biological transmission mechanisms are shared by other social groups, selected social transmission mechanisms are unique to the military. As an increasingly interconnected world faces the challenges of COVID-19 and future infectious diseases, the identified features of the military may exacerbate current and similar challenges and impair attempts to implement successful and equitable global public health policies.
