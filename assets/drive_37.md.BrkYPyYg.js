Almost half of the total number of specimens examined were from dogs less than 6 months of age and well over 50 percent of these were parvovirus positive. In addition to canine parvovirus, three cases of coronavirus, two cases of rota-like virus and one case of astro-like virus were detected. Three dual infections with canine parvovirus and rota or astro-like virus were also confirmed. An unidentified virus-like particle with cubic symmetry was found in two specimens.

Our aim in this study was to determine the impact of the pandemic on surgeries in a single institution located in Fukuoka, Japan, between 2019 and 2020. Methods We quantified the numbers of surgeries in both years according to three sites of injury (indoor, outdoor, and unknown), 14 disease categories, and 9 primary diseases using patients medical records. We also compared the hospital cost per day in each month from March to November in both 2019 and 2020 and compared the change in these costs between the two years. Results The number of admissions in 2020 was 1,187 cases vs 1,282 cases in 2019. The average patients age was higher in 2020 vs 2019 (69.7  0.5 vs 67.5  0.5 years, respectively; p = 0.004), with no gender differences (2020: 705 women and 482 men; 2019: 716 women and 566 men). We found no significant differences in the number of admissions by month between 2019 and 2020. The percentages of outdoor injuries were significantly lower in 2020 vs 2019 (29.8% vs 37.9%, respectively; p = 0.004), and we found significantly different rates when comparing 2020 and 2019 for degenerative disease (42.6% vs 37.4%; p = 0.007), trauma related to falls (34.4% vs 30.2%; p = 0.02), chronic disease (1.9% vs 3.7%; p = 0.005), and sports injuries (0.8% vs 3.7%; p < 0.0001). The rate of sports-related injury was significantly lower in 2020 (1.6%) than in 2019 (7.7%) (p < 0.0001). The daily hospital charge was $10,517.09 (US dollars) in 2020 vs $11,225.32 in 2019, and the charges in the months of April and June were significantly higher in 2020 vs 2019 (p = 0.003 and p = 0.001, for April and June, respectively). Both the number and rate of upper limb fractures were higher in 2020. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting some hospitals revenue. Although the charges per day were sufficient in our institution in 2020, compared with 2019, some hospital beds were unused during this phase of the pandemic. Hospitals may increase the revenue by mixing both short-term and long-term patients hospital stays effectively.","output":"Changes in a Single Institutions Orthopedic Hospitalization Service in Japan Owing to COVID-19 in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 and the implementation of quarantine in many European countries led to a swift change in health care delivery. Telemedicine was implemented in many otolaryngological departments to ensure the continuous care. The purpose of this study is to report our experience about telemedicine in 86 patients consulting virtually in our departments. METHODS: A total of 86 patients benefited from telemedicine consultation from April to Mai May 2020. Patients and physicians were invited to fulfill a satisfaction survey over the 3 days after the consultation. RESULTS: Patients consulted in the following fields: laryngology, voice and swallowing (N=15; 17.4%), head and neck or plastic surgery (N=34; 39.5%), rhinology (N=31; 36.1%) and otology (N=6; 7.0%). Practitioners estimated that the clinical examination would not have changed the consultation issue in 73.2% of cases. The realization of delayed clinical examination was rapidly necessary in 9.3% of cases and useless in 33.7% of cases. Five percent of patients estimated that the consultation did not bring reliable conclusion. Although the majority of patient (87.7%) would recommend telemedicine consultation to friend/family in the context of pandemic, only 44.6% would accept to replace office- consultation by telemedicine consultation outside the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine appears to be an interesting alternative approach in situation of pandemic and lock-down. Because the patient motivation to further participate to telemedicine appears to be conditioned by the context, efforts are still required to understand the patient perception, satisfaction and fears in view of future implementation outside pandemic.","output":"Patient and otolaryngologist perceptions of telemedicine during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Data on short-acting recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) biosimilar utilization from claims data in the USA are limited. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient baseline characteristics and utilization patterns for short-acting G-CSF products with particular focus on the assessment of filgrastim biosimilar usage relative to the originator product. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined filgrastim, filgrastim-sndz, and tbo-filgrastim use among adult patients between January 2012 and March 2019 across the five health-plan research partners in the BBCIC Distributed Research Network. The publicly available Sentinel System analytic toolkit was used to perform the distributed analyses. RESULTS: We evaluated over 38 million eligible health-plan members representing more than 88 million person-years of data. We identified 45,204 incident treatment episodes, including 33,118 episodes with filgrastim, 6525 episodes with filgrastim-sndz, and 5,561 episodes with tbo-filgrastim. We observed that the demographic and clinical characteristics of users were comparable across products. While total use of all filgrastim products remained consistent, the proportion of incident episodes of the originator filgrastim steadily decreased since 2014, with filgrastim-sndz and tbo-filgrastim making up the difference. Utilization for the G-CSF biosimilar, filgrastim-sndz, increased from 40 (1%) of 6823 total filgrastim product episodes in 2015, to 2486 (44%) of a total 5668 episodes of filgrastim products in 2018 (partial data for 2018).

Attenuation typically relies on de-optimisation of codon pairs and maximization of CpG dinculeotide frequencies. So as to formulate evolutionarily-informed attenuation strategies, that aim to force nucleotide usage against the estimated direction favoured by selection, here we examine available whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV2 to infer patterns of mutation and selection on synonymous sites. Analysis of mutational profiles indicates a strong mutation bias towards T with concomitant selection against T. Accounting for dinucleotide effects reinforces this conclusion, observed TT content being a quarter of that expected under neutrality. A significantly different mutational profile at CDS sites that are not 4-fold degenerate is consistent with contemporaneous selection against T mutations more widely. Although selection against CpG dinucleotides is expected to drive synonymous site G+C content below mutational equilibrium, observed G+C content is slightly above equilibrium, possibly because of selection for higher expression. Consistent with gene-specific selection against CpG dinucleotides, we observe systematic differences of CpG content between SARS-CoV2 genes. We propose an evolutionarily informed gene-bespoke approach to attenuation that, unusually, seeks to increase usage of the already most common synonymous codons. Comparable analysis of H1N1 and Ebola finds that GC3 deviated from neutral equilibrium is not a universal feature, cautioning against generalization of results.","output":"Evidence for strong mutation bias towards, and selection against, T/U content in SARS-CoV2: implications for attenuated vaccine design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The main purpose of this study is to assess the effects of COVID-19 on the restaurant businesses of Bangladesh. It examines the socio-economic impacts of the humanitarian disaster of the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of restaurant owners. The study also intends to provide recommendations to mitigate effects on the restaurant business. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A qualitative research approach was adopted to explore the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the restaurant businesses of Bangladesh. A total of 22 in-depth interviews were conducted with the top-ranked restaurant owners in the Rajshahi City Corporation area of Bangladesh. Thematic analysis technique was applied for analyzing the collected data. FINDINGS: The study found that the restaurant owners were compelled to reduce their number of employees, and forced to ensure social distancing and proper sanitization which increased the expenses. Although online orders and home delivery services have increased significantly, restaurant business operation is gradually turning critical owing to the lack of financial support. Thus, restaurant owners urge the govenrment for financial assistance. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Since this research only focused on one city in Bangladesh, the outcomes of study may have a dearth of generalizability. Hence, the investigators are encouraged to extend the study area.

Due to extremely high transmission rate, people are more susceptible to viral infection. COVID-19 patients having chronic type-2 asthma prevails a major risk as it may aggravate the disease and morbidities. OBJECTIVE: The present review mainly focuses on correlating the influence of COVID-19 in type-2 asthmatic patients. Besides, it delineates the treatment measures and drugs that can be used to manage mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of COVID-19 in asthmatic patients, thus preventing any exacerbation. METHODS: An in-depth research was carried out from different peer-reviewed articles till September 2020 from several renowned databases like PubMed, Frontier, MEDLINE, and related websites like WHO, CDC, MOHFW, and the information was analysed and written in a simplified manner. RESULTS: The progressive results were quite conflicting as severe cases of COVID-19 shows an increase in the level of several cytokines that can augment inflammation to the bronchial tracts, worsening the asthma attacks. Contradicting to this, certain findings reveal the decrease in the severity of COVID-19 due to the elevation of T-cells in type-2 asthmatic patients, as prominent reduction of T-cell is seen in most of the COVID-19 positive patients. This helps to counteract the balance of immune responses and hence ameliorate the disease progression.

To evaluate the efficacy of kTMP, we used suprathreshold TMS to elicit motor-evoked potentials (MEP) in a peripheral muscle, comparing the amplitude of the MEPs before and after kTMP stimulation. In Experiment 1, we used non-modulated kTMP with an E-field amplitude of 2 V/m over motor cortex. Ten minutes of kTMP stimulation resulted in an increase in cortical excitability in a frequency-specific manner.

Bullwhip effect has been widely recognized as one of the main issues on affecting the supply chain management. In essence, this phenomenon will lead to unnecessary consumption and waste of natural and social resources by demand variability amplification as moving up in the supply chain networks. However, traditional modelling approaches may become complicated in dealing with uncertainty and chaotic behaviour that are prevalent in real supply chains. System dynamics theory has been employed as a potentially effective strategy to cope with chaotic supply chains which are unpredictable behaviours in time. Four-dimensional differential equations which exhibit chaotic behaviours are constructed to describe a multi-echelon supply chain with bullwhip effect. Furthermore, modern control theory is applied to deal with the multi-stage supply chain optimization problems against disruptions. Specifically, the novel fractional order adaptive sliding mode control (FO-ASMC) algorithm has been implemented for ensuring efficient supply chain management. In addition, the chaos synchronization scheme is implemented in an attempt to regulate the supply chain systems under the impact of extensive uncertainties caused by tumultuous real market. It is found that the chaos synchronization is effectively realised by new FO-ASMC theory to manage advanced supply chain networks.

METHODS: This is an observational descriptive retrospective study that was conducted with patients who had confirmed COVID-19 diagnosed with severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hospitalized between April 2020 and June 2021 in a tertiary care university hospital. Patients returning to the hospital after treatment for COVID-19, with symptoms related to COVID-19 within 30 days, were included. Patients under 18 years of age and who were hospitalized in the intensive care unit were excluded. RESULTS: It was determined that of 369 discharged patients, 87 (23.5%) returned to the hospital, 9 (2.4%) were readmitted, and 1 (0.02%) was deceased within 30 days. The most frequent reasons for returning to the hospital were dyspnea and cough complaints. Existence of pneumonia at first admission, levels of aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, neutrophil counts, lymphocyte counts, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte count ratios were found to be higher in patients who returned to hospital, compared with the patients who did not return. CONCLUSIONS: Return rate of patients to hospital after discharge with COVID-19 was comparatively high, but readmissions to hospital and mortality rate were low. Comparatively, the higher rate of return to hospital within 30 days of discharge was thought to be resulting from prolonged signs and symptoms related to COVID-19.

The cytotoxic properties and antiproliferative potential of Les-3331 were determined. The effect of the tested compound on apoptosis induction and mitochondrial membrane potential was checked by flow cytometry. ELISA was used to determine caspase-8 and caspase-9, LC3A, LC3B, Beclin-1, and topoisomerase II concentration. Additionally, PAMPA, in silico or in vitro prediction of metabolism, CYP3A4/2D6 inhibition, and an Ames test were performed. Les-3331 possesses high cytotoxic and antiproliferative activity in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Its molecular mechanism of action is associated with apoptosis induction, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased caspase-9 and caspase-8 concentrations. Les-3331 decreased LC3A, LC3B, and Beclin-1 concentration in tested cell lines. Topoisomerase II concentration was also lowered. The most probable metabolic pathways and no DDIs risk of Les-3331 were confirmed in in vitro assays.

To date, the allocation of CARES Act funding is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To examine the disbursement of the High-Impact Distribution CARES Act funds and the association between financial assistance and hospital-level financial resources prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional analysis of US-based hospitals and health systems assesses the hospital characteristics associated with CARES Act funding with linear regression models using linked hospital and health systemClevel information on CARES Act funding with hospital characteristics from Hospital Cost Report data. EXPOSURES: Hospital and health system CARES Act financial assistance. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hospital and health system affiliation, status, and financial health prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data analysis took place from December 2020 through June 2021. RESULTS: The analysis included 952 hospital-level entities with an average payment of $33.6 million, most of which was received during the first payment round. Wide ranges existed in CARES Act funding, with 24% of matched hospitals receiving less than $5 million in funding and 8% receiving more than $50 million. Academic-affiliated hospitals, hospitals with higher preCCOVID-19 assets and hospitals with higher COVID-19 cases received higher levels of funding, while critical access hospitals received lower levels of financial assistance. A 10% increase in hospital assets, endowment size, and COVID-19 cases was associated with 1.4% (95% CI, 0.8% to 2.0%; P = .003), 0.2% (95% CI, 0.1% to 0.3%; P < .001), and 3.5% (95% CI, 2.8% to 4.2%; P < .001) increases in CARES Act funding, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of US hospitals and health systems, findings suggest that High-Impact Distribution CARES Act funds may have disproportionately gone to hospitals that were in a stronger financial situation prior to the pandemic compared with those that were not, but funds also went disproportionately to those that eventually had the most cases.","output":"Association Between COVID-19 Relief Funds and Hospital Characteristics in the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been estimated to confer up to 90% protection against reinfection, although this protection was lower against the Omicron variant compared with that against other SARS-CoV-2 variants (1-3).

This multi-center prospective study was conducted to determine the incidence of neurological manifestations in hospitalized cases with COVID-19 and assess these symptoms as the predictors of severity and death. METHODS: Hospitalized males and females with COVID-19 who aged over 18 years were included in the study. They were examined by two neurologists at the time of admission. All survived cases were followed for 8 weeks after discharge and 16 weeks if their symptoms had no improvements. RESULTS: We included 873 participants. Of eligible cases, 122 individuals (13.97%) died during hospitalization. The most common non-neurological manifestations were fever (81.1%), cough (76.1%), fatigue (36.1%), and shortness of breath (27.6%). Aging, male gender, co-morbidity, smoking, hemoptysis, chest tightness, and shortness of breath were associated with increased odds of severe cases and/or mortality. There were 561 (64.3%) cases with smell and taste dysfunctions (hyposmia: 58.6%; anosmia: 41.4%; dysguesia: 100%). They were more common among females (69.7%) and non-smokers (66.7%). Hyposmia/anosmia and dysgeusia were found to be associated with reduced odds of severe cases and mortality. Myalgia (24.8%), headaches (12.6%), and dizziness (11.9%) were other common neurological symptoms. Headaches had negative correlation with severity and death due to COVID-19 but myalgia and dizziness were not associated. The cerebrovascular events (n = 10) and status epilepticus (n = 1) were other neurological findings. The partial or full recovery of smell and taste dysfunctions was found in 95.2% after 8 weeks and 97.3% after 16 weeks. The parosmia (30.9%) and phantosmia (9.0%) were also reported during 8 weeks of follow-up. Five cases with mild headaches and 5 cases with myalgia were reported after 16 weeks of discharge.

This is considered waste milk (WM), and a convenient option for farmers is using it as calf food. However, adding to the risk of selecting resistant bacteria, residual antibiotics might interfere with the gut microbiome development and influence gastrointestinal health. We assessed the longitudinal effect of unpasteurized WM containing residual cefalexin on calf intestinal health and fecal microbiota in an 8-week trial. After 3 days of colostrum, six calves received WM and six calves received bulk tank milk (BM) for 2 weeks. For the following 6 weeks, all 12 calves received milk substitute and starter feed. Every week for the first 2 weeks and every 2 weeks for the remaining 6 weeks, we subjected all calves to clinical examination and collected rectal swabs for investigating the fecal microbiota composition. Most WM calves had diarrhea episodes in the first 2 weeks of the trial (5/6 WM and 1/6 BM), and their body weight was significantly lower than that of BM calves. Based on 16S rRNA gene analysis, WM calves had a lower fecal microbiota alpha diversity than that in BM calves, with the lowest p-value at Wk4 (p < 0.02), 2 weeks after exposure to WM. The fecal microbiota beta diversity of the two calf groups was also significantly different at Wk4 (p < 0.05). Numerous significant differences were present in the fecal microbiota taxonomy of WM and BM calves in terms of relative normalized operational taxonomic unit (OTU) levels, affecting five phyla, seven classes, eight orders, 19 families, and 47 genera. At the end of the trial, when 6 weeks had passed since exposure to WM, the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Saccharibacteria were lower, while Chlamydiae were higher in WM calves. Notably, WM calves showed a decrease in beneficial taxa such as Faecalibacterium, with a concomitant increase in potential pathogens such as Campylobacter, Pseudomonas, and Chlamydophila spp. In conclusion, feeding pre-weaned calves with unpasteurized WM containing antibiotics is related to a higher incidence of neonatal diarrhea and leads to significant changes in the fecal microbiota composition, further discouraging this practice in spite of its short-term economic advantages.","output":"Feeding Pre-weaned Calves With Waste Milk Containing Antibiotic Residues Is Related to a Higher Incidence of Diarrhea and Alterations in the Fecal Microbiota"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wabah penyakit yang disebabkan virus Corona terjadi mulai akhir tahun 2019, berawal dari Wuhan China, yang kemudian dikenal sebagai COVID-19.

Nearly 30,000 JE cases with 10,000 deaths are still annually reported in East Asia. Although the JEV genotype III vaccine has been licensed, it elicits a lower protection against other genotypes. Moreover, no effective treatment for a JE case is developed. This study constructed a pBR322-based and cytomegaloviruses (CMV) promoter-driven JEV replicon for the production of JEV single-round infectious particles (SRIPs) in a packaging cell line expressing viral structural proteins. Genetic instability of JEV genome cDNA in the pBR322 plasmid was associated with the prokaryotic promoter at 5 end of the JEV genome that triggers the expression of the structural proteins in E. coli. JEV structural proteins were toxic E. coli, thus the encoding region for structural proteins was replaced by a reporter gene (enhanced green fluorescent protein, EGFP) that was in-frame fused with the first eight amino acids of the C protein at N-terminus and the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 2A peptide at C-terminus in a pBR322-based JEV-EGFP replicon. JEV-EGFP SRIPs generated from JEV-EGFP replicon-transfected packaging cells displayed the infectivity with cytopathic effect induction, self-replication of viral genomes, and the expression of EGFP and viral proteins. Moreover, the combination of JEV-EGFP SRIP plus flow cytometry was used to determine the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of antiviral agents according to fluorescent intensity and positivity of SRIP-infected packaging cells post treatment. MJ-47, a quinazolinone derivative, significantly inhibited JEV-induced cytopathic effect, reducing the replication and expression of JEV-EGFP replicon in vitro. The IC50 value of 6.28 M for MJ-47 against JEV was determined by the assay of JEV-EGFP SRIP infection in packaging cells plus flow cytometry that was more sensitive, effective, and efficient compared to the traditional plaque assay.

The disease is self-limiting and usually resolve within 2 weeks. However, chronic disease can last up to several years with persistent polyarthralgia. Overlapping symptoms and common vector with dengue and malaria present many challenges for diagnosis and treatment of this disease. CHIKF was reported in India in 1963 for the first time. After a period of quiescence lasting up to 32 years, CHIKV re-emerged in India in 2005. Currently, every part of the country has become endemic for the disease with outbreaks resulting in huge economic and productivity losses. Several mutations have been identified in circulating strains of the virus resulting in better adaptations or increased fitness in the vector(s), effective transmission, and disease severity. CHIKV evolution has been a significant driver of epidemics in India, hence, the need to focus on proper surveillance, and implementation of prevention and control measure in the country.

Various extracellular and intracellular events affect the ability of the cell to efflux excess cholesterol. To explore the possible pathways and processes that promote or inhibit cholesterol efflux, we applied a combined cheminformatic and bioinformatic approach. We performed a comprehensive analysis of published data on the various substances influencing cholesterol efflux and found 153 low molecular weight substances that are included in the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database. Pathway enrichment was performed for substances identified within the Reactome database, and 45 substances were selected in 93 significant pathways. The most common pathways included the energy-dependent processes related to active cholesterol transport from the cell, lipoprotein metabolism and lipid transport, and signaling pathways. The activators and inhibitors of cholesterol efflux were non-uniformly distributed among the different pathways: the substances influencing biological oxidations activate cholesterol efflux and the substances influencing Signaling by GPCR and PTK6 inhibit efflux. This analysis may be used in the search and design of efflux effectors for therapies targeting structural and functional high-density lipoprotein deficiency.","output":"Analysis of Low Molecular Weight Substances and Related Processes Influencing Cellular Cholesterol Efflux"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computed tomography (CT) reconstruction from X-ray projections acquired within a limited angle range is challenging, especially when the angle range is extremely small. Both analytical and iterative models need more projections for effective modeling. Deep learning methods have gained prevalence due to their excellent reconstruction performances, but such success is mainly limited within the same dataset and does not generalize across datasets with different distributions. Hereby we propose ExtraPolationNetwork for limited-angle CT reconstruction via the introduction of a sinogram extrapolation module, which is theoretically justified. The module complements extra sinogram information and boots model generalizability. Extensive experimental results show that our reconstruction model achieves state-of-the-art performance on NIH-AAPM dataset, similar to existing approaches. More importantly, we show that using such a sinogram extrapolation module significantly improves the generalization capability of the model on unseen datasets (e.g., COVID-19 and LIDC datasets) when compared to existing approaches.","output":"Improving Generalizability in Limited-Angle CT Reconstruction with Sinogram Extrapolation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Phlorotannins are polyphenolic compounds produced via polymerization of phloroglucinol, and these compounds have varying molecular weights (up to 650 kDa). Brown seaweeds are rich in phlorotannins compounds possessing various biological activities, including algicidal, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and anticancer activities. Many review papers on the chemical characterization and quantification of phlorotannins and their functionality have been published to date. However, although studies on the safety and toxicity of these phlorotannins have been conducted, there have been no articles reviewing this topic. In this review, the safety and toxicity of phlorotannins in different organisms are discussed. Online databases (Science Direct, PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web of Science) were searched, yielding 106 results. Following removal of duplicates and application of the exclusion criteria, 34 articles were reviewed. Phlorotannins from brown seaweeds showed low toxicity in cell lines, invertebrates, microalgae, seaweeds, plants, animals (fish, mice, rats, and dogs), and humans. However, the safety and toxicity of phlorotannins in aquaculture fish, livestock, and companion animals are limited. Further studies in these organisms are necessary to carry out a systematic analysis of the safety and toxicity of phlorotannins and to further identify the potential of phlorotannins as functional foods, feeds, and pharmaceuticals.","output":"Effects of Phlorotannins on Organisms: Focus on the Safety, Toxicity, and Availability of Phlorotannins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to a variety of structural, political, and economic changes, the US is currently in the midst of record levels of economic inequality.

The apocalypse lends itself well to conspiratorial thinking because conceptually it is flexible enough to reflect any crisis. To this end, the global development of Covid-19 conspiracism is what the authors term 'contagious conspiracism' which is defined as viral global cultural conspiracism. The paper explores how millennialist responses to Covid-19 in various media outlets transcend academic categories of analysis and cultural boundaries between, say, religious and secular, far-right and radical left. First explored is how the crisis became embedded in established (mainly American) contemporary millennial beliefs and prophecies through selected far-right, evangelical and radical left narratives. Second, it is shown how these theories have been 'improvised' to include 5 G and also travelled to Europe and taken on geographical significance in Belfast and Berlin. Third, the authors illustrate the shared ingredients, motivations, and semiotics across apocalyptic conspiratorial Covid-19 narratives, all of which resonate with concerns about power, specifically emergent surveillance technologies, governmental abuse of power, and neoliberal capital, with divergent truths about who is blame from 5 G/vaccine theories to corporate technocapitalism. The paper concludes that these shared discourses across apocalyptic and conspiratorial Covid-19 narratives mean many of us are conspiracists and/or conspiracy theorists at some level and is therefore both revealing of the similarities and has the potential to create democratic constituencies.","output":"'Constituent Covid-19 apocalypses: contagious conspiracism, 5G, and viral vaccinations'"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Our aim was to estimate the overall, and inequalities in the, population health impact of COVID-19 in Scotland, measured by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2020. METHODS: National deaths and daily case data were input into the consensus model outlined by the European Burden of Disease Network, to estimate DALYs. Total Years of Life Lost (YLL) were estimated, and for each deprivation quintile of the Scottish population. Years Lived with Disability (2% of all DALYs) were proportionately distributed to deprivation quintiles, based on YLL estimates. Socioeconomic inequalities were measured by the Relative Index of Inequality (RII), Slope Index of Inequality (SII), and attributable DALYs were estimated by using the least deprived quintile as a reference. Results were presented as a range, using a sensitivity based on YLL estimates using: cause-specific; and COVID-19 related deaths. RESULTS: COVID-19 DALYs ranged from 96,500 to 108,200 in 2020, representing the second leading cause of disease/injury in Scotland, in 2020. Marked socioeconomic inequalities were observed across several measures. The difference between the most and least deprived areas, measured by SII, was 2,048 to 2,289 DALYs per 100,000. The RII was 1.16, meaning that the rate in the most deprived areas was around 58% higher than the mean rate of the population. DALYs attributable to differences in socioeconomic status accounted for 40% of total COVID-19 DALYs. CONCLUSIONS: The direct population health impact of COVID-19 in 2020 was substantial. Despite unprecedented mitigation efforts, in Scotland, a single case in early 2020 developed to having an impact second only to ischaemic heart disease. This impact was not shared equally, and socioeconomically deprived areas were hit hardest, a result confirmed across all measures of inequality. DALY estimation on both the ongoing direct, and indirect, pandemic harms will evidence the extent of impact on overall, and inequalities in, population health. KEY MESSAGES: The population impact of COVID-19 has been highly damaging. When measured by DALYs, the population health impact of COVID-19 in Scotland, during 2020, was second only to ischaemic heart disease. The population health impact of COVID-19 has not been shared equally, a result confirmed across all measures of socioeconomic inequality.","output":"Socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 DALYs in Scotland, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The association between physical illness and depression implies a poorer management of chronic disease and a lower response to antidepressant treatments.

The study included 380 patients 50 years of age from 18 PC teams. The participants presented depression (BDI-II > 12) and a physical comorbidity: diabetes mellitus type 2, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and/or asthma. The IG (n = 204) received the psychoeducational intervention (12 weekly sessions of 90 min), and the CG (n = 176) had standard care. The patients were evaluated at baseline, and at 4 and 12 months. The main outcome measures were clinical remission of depressive symptoms (BDI-II  13) and therapeutic response (reduction of depressive symptoms by 50%). Remission was not significant at four months. At 12 months it was 53.9% in the IG and 41.5% in the CG. (OR = 0.61, 95% CI, 0.49C0.76). At 4 months the response in the IG (OR = 0.59, 95% CI, 0.44C0.78) was significant, but not at 12 months.

Meanwhile, relative humidity (RH) showed a positive promotion on the formation of sulfate and MO-OOA during the lockdown, but had no obvious correlation with less oxidized-oxygenated organic aerosol (LO-OOA) or nitrate. Organosulfurs (OS) displayed a higher contribution (~58%) than inorganic sulfate to total sulfate enhancement in the polluted episode during the lockdown.

In Alzheimers disease (AD), the major form of dementia, -amyloid (A) levels in the blood are increased; however, the impact of elevated A levels on the progression of COVID-19 remains largely unknown. Here, our findings demonstrate that A(1-42), but not A(1-40), bound to various viral proteins with a preferentially high affinity for the spike protein S1 subunit (S1) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). These bindings were mainly through the C-terminal residues of A(1-42). Furthermore, A(1-42) strengthened the binding of the S1 of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 and increased the viral entry and production of IL-6 in a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection model. Intriguingly, data from a surrogate mouse model with intravenous inoculation of A(1-42) show that the clearance of A(1-42) in the blood was dampened in the presence of the extracellular domain of the spike protein trimers of SARS-CoV-2, whose effects can be prevented by a novel anti-A antibody. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the binding of A(1-42) to the S1 of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 may have a negative impact on the course and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and examine whether reducing the level of A(1-42) in the blood is beneficial to the fight against COVID-19 and AD.","output":"The Effects of A(1-42) Binding to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein S1 Subunit and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systemic vascular injury occurs in COVID-19 patients, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.

METHODS: This mixed-methods study used convenience sampling. Data were collected from June to September 2020 via an online survey, which consisted of both closed- and open-ended questions. Participants were recruited from national nursing organizations and unions. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis for open-ended responses. FINDINGS: A total of 526 nurses responses were included in the analysis. More than one third experienced greater incivility at work during the COVID-19 outbreak than before the pandemic (37.4%), and almost half (45.7%) said they witnessed more incivility than before the pandemic. Cyber-incivility and incivility outside of work were also issues. Qualitative results indicated that respondents felt they were on edge during this period. Other themes included leadership failure, fractured co-worker relationships, heightened incivility from patients and families, and hostility and ostracism from the general public CONCLUSION/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE: Occupational health nurses, nursing leaders, and staff nurses need to work to restore relations that were fractured by incivility during the pandemic.

Faced up with the unprecedented nature of this situation, the liberal psychotherapist is led to rethink some aspects of the framework of his practice in order to preserve the thread of the transferential relationship. The authors develop a clinical reflection on the clinical setting in a pandemic period by exploring in particular the dynamics of telephone sessions. For telephone interviews, the question of the sound envelope is central, in particular regarding the psychic function of silence. We choose to illustrate our point with short vignettes than by relying on long-term clinical cases, more likely to represent the variety of new clinical situations encountered and the questions that accompany them. This article introduces his point by recounting the plague epidemic in ancient Greece to show the impact of the environment on humans and its collective fantasy implications. Being faced up with death, contamination, the invisible enemy brings out a palpable concern. It is indeed quite remarkable that these same reactions and concerns in front of death caused by the pandemic match whith what is related by Thucydides who survived the plague, which affected Athens during the Peloponnesian War. In another context, Winnicott highlights the place and importance of the therapeutic environment. It is both a question of adjusting the framework according to the context while maintaining certain intangible aspects representing the permanence of the link and its framework. A framework cannot exist without being kept, which is equivalent to thinking of the framework above all as an internal framework, questioning the clinician about what he values and what he makes sense in his practice. In the current context, these questions arise from the perspective of a certain flexibility, depending on the human context (child, adolescent, consultations, etc.) or external context (crisis linked to a virus, etc.) showing that it is more than never question of exercising on a case-by-case basis, taking into account changes in the environment. The initial observation during this period of confinement concerns the fact that some patients contact a therapist for the first time by telephone and wish to initiate psychotherapy (during this period) when they explain that such an initiative was not possible. despite the difficulties already encountered in the past. But there is also the opposite case: patients who have no intention of continuing the work already started during this time. Thus, faced up with the injunction of confinement, they show themselves in the psychic impossibility of following the treatment by other means such as, for example, telephone sessions. In this perspective, the silence on the phone takes on a different tone; silence reveals itself to be a source of greater anxiety than in presence: the presence of bodies, of its movements perceptible as imperceptible, of a gesture that carries or accompanies the senses, breathing, the visual context of the office and of its \\"decor\\", represent as many essential elements in the usual capacity of the frame; in the absence of these basic sensory elements, silence can be experienced as a void, or even a gap in the bond, opening Pandora's box of paranoid fantasies acting unconsciously. If silence is representative of the whole framework, it promotes in this context the partialization of the clinician's body reduced to one ear and not to a whole body. Here, it is the change of framework that mobilizes the difference, established by Mr. Klein, between the partial and total object; this circumstance neo-framework could therefore call for regressive movements, undoing the silence of its symbolic function when the bodies are present.","output":"Sances par tlphone dans le contexte du Covid-19 : le cadre et ses limites./ [Phone sessions in Covid-19 environment: The frame and his limits]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main purpose of this study is to assess and analyze the business continuity (going concern) of companies before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The highest MHC variability, both in terms of the number of individual alleles and gene copies, has so far been found in passerine birds; this is probably attributable to passerine adaptation to both a wide geographic range and a diverse array of habitats. If extraordinary high MHC variation and duplication rates are adaptive features under selection during the evolution of ecologically and taxonomically diverse species, then similarly diverse MHC architectures should be found in bats. Bats are an extremely species-rich mammalian group that is globally widely distributed. Many bat species roost in multitudinous groups and have high contact rates with pathogens, conspecifics, and allospecifics. We have characterized the MHC class I diversity in 116 Panamanian Sebas short-tailed bats (Carollia perspicillata), a widely distributed, generalist, neotropical species. We have detected a remarkable individual and population-level diversity of MHC class I genes, with between seven and 22 alleles and a unique genotype in each individual. This diversity is comparable with that reported in passerine birds and, in both taxonomic groups, further variability has evolved through length polymorphisms. Our findings support the hypothesis that, for species with a geographically broader range, high MHC class I variability is particularly adaptive. Investigation of the details of the underlying adaptive processes and the role of the high MHC diversity in pathogen resistance are important next steps for a better understanding of the role of bats in viral evolution and as carriers of several deadly zoonotic viruses.

The COVID-19 pandemic has placed added demands on occupational health services for healthcare workers. Its impact on BBPE incidence is unreported. Methods: As part of quality improvement efforts, we examined BBPE case incidence at two affiliated health centers during a 24-month period, 12 months preceding and following the COVID-19 pandemic onset. We used Year 1 to Year 2 change in incidence at the larger health center as the referent value to generate predicted incidence rates at the study health center. We tested the ratio of observed to predicted values at the study health center as a Poisson variable to its expectation. We defined a BBPE consistent with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Bloodborne Pathogens Standard. Results: The BBPE case incidence at Health Center One (HC1), totaled 46 cases in Year 1, increasing 19% to 55 cases in Year 2. The cumulative incidence at Health Center Two (HC2), the referent facility, was 664 cases in Year 1, declining 24% to 503 in Year 2. The ratio of 55 events at HC1 to the expected incidence of 35, based on the experience at HC2, was 1.6 (p < .05). Discussion/Applications to Practice: The incidence of BBPE events at HC1 paradoxically increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, contrasting to the expected decrease that we observed at HC2.

Potential sources of variation were reduced by a standardized protocol, test item and skin source. Particularly, skin samples from same donors were distributed over two repeats and between labs in a non-random, stratified design. Very similar recovery was achieved in the various assay compartments between laboratories, repeats and donors, demonstrating that the assay can be robustly and reliably performed. The absorption in one laboratory was 5-fold higher than in the others.

We characterized relationships between SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and disease severity, clinical deterioration, and specific EPCs. METHODS: We used quantitative (qPCR) and digital (dPCR) PCR to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA from plasma in 191 patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with COVID-19. We recorded patient symptoms, laboratory markers, and clinical outcomes, with a focus on oxygen requirements over time. We collected longitudinal plasma samples from a subset of patients. We characterized the role of RNAemia in predicting clinical severity and EPCs using elastic net regression. RESULTS: 23.0% (44/191) of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients had viral RNA detected in plasma by dPCR, compared to 1.4% (2/147) by qPCR. Most patients with serial measurements had undetectable RNAemia within 10 days of symptom onset, reached maximum clinical severity within 16 days, and symptom resolution within 33 days. Initially RNAaemic patients were more likely to manifest severe disease (OR 6.72 [95% CI, 2.45 - 19.79]), worsening of disease severity (OR 2.43 [95% CI, 1.07 - 5.38]), and EPCs (OR 2.81 [95% CI, 1.26 - 6.36]). RNA load correlated with maximum severity (r = 0.47 [95% CI, 0.20 - 0.67]). CONCLUSIONS: dPCR is more sensitive than qPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, which is a robust predictor of eventual COVID-19 severity and oxygen requirements, as well as EPCs. Since many COVID-19 therapies are initiated on the basis of oxygen requirements, RNAemia on presentation might serve to direct early initiation of appropriate therapies for the patients most likely to deteriorate.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia predicts clinical deterioration and extrapulmonary complications from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Information on the cardiac manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is scarce. We performed a systematic and comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation of consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection underwent complete echocardiographic evaluation within 24 hours of admission and were compared with reference values. Echocardiographic studies included left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function and valve hemodynamics and right ventricular (RV) assessment, as well as lung ultrasound. A second examination was performed in case of clinical deterioration. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (32%) had a normal echocardiogram at baseline. The most common cardiac pathology was RV dilatation and dysfunction (observed in 39% of patients), followed by LV diastolic dysfunction (16%) and LV systolic dysfunction (10%). Patients with elevated troponin (20%) or worse clinical condition did not demonstrate any significant difference in LV systolic function compared with patients with normal troponin or better clinical condition, but they had worse RV function. Clinical deterioration occurred in 20% of patients. In these patients, the most common echocardiographic abnormality at follow-up was RV function deterioration (12 patients), followed by LV systolic and diastolic deterioration (in 5 patients). Femoral deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 5 of 12 patients with RV failure. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 infection, LV systolic function is preserved in the majority of patients, but LV diastolic function and RV function are impaired.

Environ Microbiol 21: 1513-1528). The current coronavirus pandemic is a stark example of why microbiology literacy is such a crucial enabler of informed policy decisions, particularly those involving preparedness of public-health systems for disease outbreaks and pandemics. However, a significant barrier to attaining widespread appreciation of microbial contributions to our well-being and that of the planet is the fact that microbes are seldom visible: most people are only peripherally aware of them, except when they fall ill with an infection. And it is disease, rather than all of the positive activities mediated by microbes, that colours public perception of 'germs' and endows them with their poor image. It is imperative to render microbes visible, to give them life and form for children (and adults), and to counter prevalent misconceptions, through exposure to imagination-capturing images of microbes and examples of their beneficial outputs, accompanied by a balanced narrative. This will engender automatic mental associations between everyday information inputs, as well as visual, olfactory and tactile experiences, on the one hand, and the responsible microbes/microbial communities, on the other hand. Such associations, in turn, will promote awareness of microbes and of the many positive and vital consequences of their actions, and facilitate and encourage incorporation of such consequences into relevant decision-making processes. While teaching microbiology topics in primary and secondary school is key to this objective, a strategic programme to expose children directly and personally to natural and managed microbial processes, and the results of their actions, through carefully planned class excursions to local venues, can be instrumental in bringing microbes to life for children and, collaterally, their families. In order to encourage the embedding of microbiology-centric class excursions in current curricula, we suggest and illustrate here some possibilities relating to the topics of food (a favourite pre-occupation of most children), agriculture (together with horticulture and aquaculture), health and medicine, the environment and biotechnology. And, although not all of the microbially relevant infrastructure will be within reach of schools, there is usually access to a market, local food store, wastewater treatment plant, farm, surface water body, etc., all of which can provide opportunities to explore microbiology in action. If children sometimes consider the present to be mundane, even boring, they are usually excited with both the past and the future so, where possible, visits to local museums (the past) and research institutions advancing knowledge frontiers (the future) are strongly recommended, as is a tapping into the natural enthusiasm of local researchers to leverage the educational value of excursions and virtual excursions. Children are also fascinated by the unknown, so, paradoxically, the invisibility of microbes makes them especially fascinating objects for visualization and exploration. In outlining some of the options for microbiology excursions, providing suggestions for discussion topics and considering their educational value, we strive to extend the vistas of current class excursions and to: (i) inspire teachers and school managers to incorporate more microbiology excursions into curricula; (ii) encourage microbiologists to support school excursions and generally get involved in bringing microbes to life for children; (iii) urge leaders of organizations (biopharma, food industries, universities, etc.) to give school outreach activities a more prominent place in their mission portfolios, and (iv) convey to policymakers the benefits of providing schools with funds, materials and flexibility for educational endeavours beyond the classroom.","output":"Visualizing the invisible: class excursions to ignite children's enthusiasm for microbes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A supportive environment with nurturing caregivers is essential for the healthy development of children.

While there is substantial evidence of the effectiveness of family skills interventions in high-income and stable contexts, evidence of interventions that have been tested in humanitarian and challenging settings, such as contexts of refugee and displacement, are far fewer. Despite the role that family skills interventions can play in protecting children from current and future challenges, there is a significant lack of such interventions being utilised in humanitarian settings.

Especially during the outbreak of COVID-19, K-12 teachers are forced to quickly adapt to online teaching and thus have more difficulties of delivering personalized instruction in a relatively resource-restraint situation. Open educational resources (OER), allowing teachers to retain, reuse, revise, remix, and redistribute high-quality educational resources at no costs, can be a viable option for teachers. However, the acceptance of OER in K-12 education still remains low. Effective strategies are needed to reinforce teacher intention to adopt OER. This research showcased a two-phase sequential explanatory mixed method inquiry to investigate whether engaging K-12 teachers in open educational practices (OEP)such as renewable assignmentsincreased their acceptance of OER. The quantitative phase, referring to the technology acceptance model (TAM), examined the change in factors influencing teachers acceptance of OER. The qualitative phase was followed up to provide supplementary perspectives of the quantitative findings. By integrating complementary findings, this research found that OEP increased teachers perceived ease of and self-efficacy towards using OER. Although teachers intention of implementing OER is not significantly improved, qualitative findings offered additional insights into the benefits of OEP in promoting OER usage and the recommended directions for future effort. Practical implications on improving teachers acceptance of OER in K-12 curriculum are discussed at the end.","output":"Improving K-12 Teachers Acceptance of Open Educational Resources by Open Educational Practices: A Mixed Methods Inquiry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has a devastating impact on the health and well-being of global population. Cough audio signals classification showed potential as a screening approach for diagnosing people, infected with COVID-19. Recent approaches need costly deep learning algorithms or sophisticated methods to extract informative features from cough audio signals. In this paper, we propose a low-cost envelope approach, called CovidEnvelope, which can classify COVID-19 positive and negative cases from raw data by avoiding above disadvantages. This automated approach can pre-process cough audio signals by filter-out background noises, generate an envelope around the audio signal, and finally provide outcomes by computing area enclosed by the envelope. It has been seen that reliable datasets are also important for achieving high performance. Our approach proves that human verbal confirmation is not a reliable source of information. Finally, the approach reaches highest sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC of 0.92, 0.87, 0.89, and 0.89 respectively. The automatic approach only takes 1.8 to 3.9 minutes to compute these performances. Overall, this approach is fast and sensitive to diagnose the people living with COVID-19, regardless of having COVID-19 related symptoms or not, and thus have vast applicability in human well-being by designing HCI devices incorporating this approach.","output":"CovidEnvelope: A Fast Automated Approach to Diagnose COVID-19 from Cough Signals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abdominal wall hernias are prevalent in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). Obturator hernias, first described by Arnaud de Ronsil in 1724, are an uncommon type of hernia where intra-abdominal contents protrude through the obturator foramen. The following case highlights a rare presentation of bilateral obturator hernias with right femoral and inguinal hernia in an 82-year-old woman post-PD. This patient presented with 5 months of bilateral thigh pain and swelling and was found to only have a right-sided obturator hernia on computer tomography (CT) scan. Intraoperatively, bilateral obturator hernias were found along with right inguinal and femoral hernias, which were all repaired laparoscopically with polypropylene mesh. Postoperatively, the patient developed a self-limiting port site hematoma and resumed PD 1 month post-surgery. Due to the high morbidity and mortality from obturator hernias, prompt diagnosis and treatment are imperative. Compared with open hernia repair, laparoscopic hernia repairs are associated with quicker return to usual activities and less persisting pain and numbness.

Aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of the aforementioned psychiatric symptoms across a sample of individuals with High Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorders (HF-ASDs) with respect to a group of neurotypical adults (NA), during the first two months of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. METHOD: 45 adults with HF-ASDs and 45NA completed a structured online questionnaire, including; the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale C 21 items (DASS-21); the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R); the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). We also explored some specific aspects of participants psychological well-being through an ad-hoc questionnaire. RESULTS: Subjects with HF-ASDs scored significantly higher than NA at the DASS-21, the IES-R Total Score and the PSS; NA reported a higher perceived change of their lifestyle during the lockdown than individuals with HF-ASDs, and subjects with HF-ASDs reported to feel more comfortable and less tired during the lockdown period, in relation to the social distancing measures adopted by Italian authorities.

Frequentist designs utilize repeated significance testing or conditional power to make early stopping decisions. The majority of frequentist designs are concerned with controlling the overall type I error rate of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis at any analysis. On the other hand, Bayesian designs utilize posterior or posterior predictive probabilities for decision-making. The prior and threshold values in a Bayesian design can be chosen to either achieve desirable frequentist operating characteristics or reflect the investigator's subjective belief. We also comment on the likelihood principle, which is commonly tied with statistical inference and decision-making in sequential clinical trials.

Our institution created a prenatal care delivery model incorporating these alternative approaches to continue safely providing prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our objective was to evaluate institutional-level adoption and patient and provider experiences with the COVID-19 prenatal care model. Study Design We conducted a single-site evaluation of a COVID-19 prenatal care model incorporating a reduced frequency visit schedule and virtual visits deployed at a suburban academic institution on March 20, 2020. We used Electronic Health Record data to evaluate institution-level model adoption, defined as changes in overall visit frequency and proportion of virtual visits in the three months before and after implementation. To evaluate the patient and provider experience with the COVID-19 model, we conducted an online survey of all pregnant patients (>20 weeks gestation) and providers in May 2020. Three domains of care experience were evaluated: 1) access, 2) quality and safety, and 3) satisfaction. Quantitative data were analyzed with basic descriptive statistics. Free-text responses coded by the three survey domains elucidated drivers of positive and negative care experiences. Results Following COVID-19 model adoption, average weekly prenatal visit volume fell by 16.1%, from 898 to 761 weekly visits, the average weekly proportion of prenatal visits conducted virtually increased from 10.8% (97/898) to 43.3% (330/761), and the average visit no-show rate remained stable (4.3% pre-implementation; 4.2%, post-implementation). Of those eligible, 74.8% (77/103) of providers and 15.0% (253/1690) of patients participated in the surveys. Patient respondents were largely white (180/253, 71.1%) and privately insured (199/253, 78.7%), reflecting the study site population. Rates of chronic conditions and pregnancy complications also differed from national prevalence. Provider respondents were predominantly white (44/66, 66.7%) and female (50/66, 75.8%). Most patients and almost all providers reported that virtual visits improved access to care (patients: 68.8%, 174/253; providers: 74/77, 96.1%). Over half of respondents (patients: 124/253, 53.3%; providers: 41/77, 62.1%) believed virtual visits were safe. Nearly all believed home blood pressure cuffs were important for virtual visits (patients: 213/231, 92.2%; providers: 63/66, 95.5%). Most reported satisfaction with the COVID-19 model (patients: 196/253, 77.5%; providers: 64/77, 83.1%). In free-text responses, drivers of positive care experiences were similar for patients and providers, and included perceived improved access to care through decreased barriers (e.g. transportation, childcare); perceived high quality of virtual visits for low-risk patients and increased safety during the pandemic; and improved satisfaction through better patient counseling. Perceived drivers of negative care experience were also similar for patients and providers, but less common. These included concerns that unequal access to virtual visits could deepen existing maternity care inequities, concerns that the lack of home devices (e.g. blood pressure cuffs) would impact care quality and safety, and dissatisfaction with poor patient-provider continuity and inadequate expectation-setting for the virtual visit experience. Conclusion Reduced visit schedules and virtual visits were rapidly integrated into real-world care, with positive experiences for many patients and providers. Future research is needed to understand the health outcomes and care experience associated with alternative approaches to prenatal care delivery across more diverse patient populations outside of the COVID-19 pandemic, to inform broader health policy decisions.","output":"Patient and Provider Perspectives of a New Prenatal Care Model Introduced in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new coronavirus disease called COVID-19 was declared by World Health Organization (WHO) The COVID-19 may complicated into many other conditions, including neurologic One among this neurologic complication is stroke This paper aimed to report a case of ischemic stroke in COVID-19 positive patient in Yogyakarta, Indonesia A male patient, 42 years old, came to emergency department with weakness in his right arm for two days as his main complain He also had face drop on the right side, cough, and shortness of breath He had a history of hyperthyroid and type II diabetes mellitus The brain CT Scan showed a lacunar infarct in the left lentiform nucleus Patient had an nasopharynx and oropharynx swab to be checked for the presence of COVID-19 and the result was positive The pathophysiology of stroke in COVID-19 include the hyperactivation of inflammatory factors that causes a fatal inflammatory storm It also cause a damage of coagulation system which causing the D-dimer and platelet abnormalities, hypercoagulability from critical illness and cardioembolism from virus-related cardiac injury Moreover, COVID-19 may cause a direct role in viral infection in central nervous system In conclusion, ischemic stroke can be present along with COVID-19","output":"Ischemic Stroke In Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) Positive Patient: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza A (H5N1) virus infects a variety of animals, birds and humans.

It has the capability to end in post-infection complications and critical outcomes due to significant pro-inflammatory conditions. The role of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with immune disorders, such as sarcoidosis, and the specific interaction between these two diseases remains unclear. Here we present a case of a 65-year-old female with sarcoidosis who got infected with SARS-CoV-2 complicated by pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old African American female with a PMH of Sarcoidosis, Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) on Riociguat, Macitentan, and Warfarin presented with cough, SOB, and fever for 1-week duration. Upon arrival to the ED, vital signs were significant for tachypnea and hypoxemia. COVID-19 PCR was positive. Initial chest CT revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) with multilobar chronic airspace disease. She was treated with Remdesivir and dexamethasone. During the hospital course, warfarin was held due to supratherapeutic INR. However, before discharge her respiratory parameters decompensated and she required HFNC to maintain her saturation. CT pulmonary angiogram revealed PE in the right distal segmental branch with significant bilateral patchy infiltrates more severe in the distribution of lower lobe suggestive of multilobar pneumonia with bilateral GGOs with crazy paving. Beta galactomannan came back positive and Voriconazole was started empirically with significant improvement in respiratory symptoms. Later fungal culture from sputum confirmed aspergillosis. DISCUSSION: SARS-CoV-2 activates the immune system which results in a release of inflammatory cytokines and leads to cytokine storms. But it remains unknown how the interaction differs in patients with an altered immune system, especially in cases of impairment of the T-cell immunity and granuloma formation, such as sarcoidosis. Some authors suggested that constitutional defects of the regulation of macroautophagy in sarcoidosis could lead to a more severe outcome from the novel SARS-CoV-2 infection. literature review showed that alveolar damage, dysfunctional mucociliary clearance, and altered immune system further facilitates fungal invasion. We, therefore, hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 in a patient with underlying sarcoidosis may lead to increased risk for pulmonary aspergillosis. CONCLUSIONS: The role of infection from the novel coronavirus in patients having sarcoidosis is still largely unknown however clinicians should be aware that it has the risk of serious complications and clinical deterioration including further destruction of lung architecture, hypervascular response, hypercoagulability, and superinfection like CAPA.

Methods: Deep Learning has proven to be a remarkable method to extract massive high-dimensional features from medical images. Specifically, in this paper, the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network called Mobile Net is employed and trained from scratch to investigate the importance of the extracted features for the classification task. A large-scale dataset of 3905 X-ray images, corresponding to 6 diseases, is utilized for training MobileNet v2, which has been proven to achieve excellent results in related tasks. Results: Training the CNNs from scratch outperforms the other transfer learning techniques, both in distinguishing the X-rays between the seven classes and between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19. A classification accuracy between the seven classes of 87.66% is achieved. Besides, this method achieves 99.18% accuracy, 97.36% Sensitivity, and 99.42% Specificity in the detection of COVID-19.

We have thus far examined the functional state transitions of cereblon and COVID Mpro in this context, and now turn to the agonist-induced activating and deactivating state transitions of class A G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and membrane potential-/dipole potential-induced activating and deactivating state transitions of voltage-gated cation channels (VGCCs). We analyzed crystal structures of the activated and deactivated forms of the human 2 adrenergic receptor (2AR) and cryo-EM structures of the activated and deactivated forms of Nav1.7 channels. We postulate that activation and deactivation of the 2AR is conveyed by switchable changes in transmembrane helix (TMH) orientations relative to extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) and curvature of TMH6 and TMH7, all of which are powered by solvation free energy and kickstarted by agonist binding. The known activation and deactivation mechanisms of Nav1.7 consist of S4 translations toward and away from the extracellular membrane surface, respectively, resulting in S4-S5 linker repositioning, followed by rearrangements of the S5 and S6 helices. The latter TMH conveys channel opening and closing by respectively curving away from and toward the central pore axis. We postulate that all of these rearrangements are likewise powered by solvation free energy and kickstarted by changes in the membrane and dipole potentials.

Parallel to climate change, developing countries face energy security and independence issues with extra pressures such as the Covid-19 pandemic and increasing inequality. Taking Mexico as a case, four ET scenarios under gradual or rapid narratives are developed with the Kaya Identity. Gradual Transition Scenarios (GTS) present a business-as-usual scenario with natural gas as the most significant fuel in the supply mix due to economic and social concerns. Rapid Transition Scenarios (RTS) propose a combination of FF and renewables or a full deployment of Renewable Energy Sources (RES). The results show that GTS reach 491 501 Mt CO2 emissions in 2050, risking a carbon lock-in, stranded assets and economic losses. RTS reach 87103 Mt CO2 in 2050 with RES prioritization, energy efficiency improvements and coal phase-out. In particular, following GTS would mean failing to join global efforts to limit warming temperature to 1.5 C. Alternatively, following RTS brings Mexico closer to achieve carbon neutrality. Several strategies are proposed, including reducing the carbon intensity of the energy supply mix, increasing energy efficiency, prioritizing environmental protection, improving actions based on science, and promoting environmental education and awareness.

Despite qualitative discussions of potential social-economic causes, it remains unclear how this pattern could be accounted for from a quantitative approach. Through the development of an urban epidemic hazard index (EpiRank), we came up with a mathematical explanation for this phenomenon. The index is constructed from epidemic simulations on a multi-layer transportation network model on top of local SEIR transmission dynamics, which characterizes intra- and inter-city compartment population flow with a detailed mathematical description. Essentially, we argue that these highlighted cities possess greater epidemic hazards due to the combined effect of large regional population and small inter-city transportation. The proposed index, dynamic and applicable to different epidemic settings, could be a useful indicator for the risk assessment and response planning of urban epidemic hazards in China; the model framework is modularized and can be adapted for other nations without much difficulty.","output":"Urban Epidemic Hazard Index for Chinese Cities: Why Did Small Cities Become Epidemic Hotspots?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses cause respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases in diverse host species.

Currently, all public and private universities relying on technology to make education continues with few interruptions. The migration of HEI into the virtual education model experienced several challenges in delivering rich education content to educators and learners. OBJECTIVE: Critical Success Factors (CSFs) enabled many universities to transform efficiently into the virtual environment. Before this transition, universities should carefully consider the key challenges and the CSFs to achieve successful migration to the virtual environment. E-learning is not a substitute anymore, it is gradually becoming a de-facto technology transformation in the current exceptional situation. This paradigm shift contributes to the success of education continuity in higher education settings. METHODOLOGY: A survey instrument was distributed to 500 students effectively using e-learning systems. Out of which only 330 were completed and used in the analysis which determined 66% as the overall response rate. RESULTS: The results of the study indicate a positive and significant relationship between the 13 CSFs and the e-learning systems usage, and that also indicates a notable impact of the CSFs on the e-learning systems usage. CONCLUSION: The outcome of this research identifies the top 13 CSFs that contribute to delivering successful e-learning systems usage. The top 13 CSFs are positively and significantly correlated with e-learning systems usage.","output":"Virtual migration of higher education institutions in times of crisis: Major challenges and critical success factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of in-hospital cardiac arrest in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and to describe the characteristics and outcomes for patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest within the ICU, compared with non-ICU patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest. Finally, we evaluated outcomes stratified by age. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review of PubMed, EMBASE, and preprint websites was conducted between January 1, 2020, and December 10, 2020. Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews identification: CRD42020203369. STUDY SELECTION: Studies reporting on consecutive in-hospital cardiac arrest with a resuscitation attempt among patients with coronavirus disease 2019. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently performed study selection and data extraction. Study quality was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were synthesized according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews guidelines. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or through an independent third reviewer. DATA SYNTHESIS: Eight studies reporting on 847 in-hospital cardiac arrest were included. In-hospital cardiac arrest incidence varied between 1.5% and 5.8% among hospitalized patients and 8.0-11.4% among patients in ICU. In-hospital cardiac arrest occurred more commonly in older male patients. Most initial rhythms were nonshockable (83.9%, [asystole = 36.4% and pulseless electrical activity = 47.6%]). Return of spontaneous circulation occurred in 33.3%, with a 91.7% in-hospital mortality. In-hospital cardiac arrest events in ICU had higher incidence of return of spontaneous circulation (36.6% vs 18.7%; p < 0.001) and relatively lower mortality (88.7% vs 98.1%; p < 0.001) compared with in-hospital cardiac arrest in non-ICU locations. Patients greater than or equal to 60 years old had significantly higher in-hospital mortality than those less than 60 years (93.1% vs 87.9%; p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately, one in 20 patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 received resuscitation for an in-hospital cardiac arrest. Hospital survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest within the ICU was higher than non-ICU locations and seems comparable with prepandemic survival for nonshockable rhythms. Although the data provide guidance surrounding prognosis after in-hospital cardiac arrest, it should be interpreted cautiously given the paucity of information surrounding treatment limitations and resource constraints during the pandemic.

Methods: This prospectively stratified randomized controlled trial was conducted on 50 children with mild and moderate ASD. Children were assigned into two balanced groups. The control group was educated through PECS, and the intervention group was exposed to VM. Oral hygiene was assessed using the Oral Hygiene Index-simplified (OHI-s) on four occasions (at baseline and at three, six, and 12 months). Quantitative data were analyzed using Fisher's exact test and a t-test at a five percent significance level and 95 percent confidence interval (95% CI), respectively. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r) was used to correlate baseline characteristics in both groups to obtain average OHI-s scores. Results: The VM group showed a statistically significant reduction in average OHI-s scores compared to the PECS group over the follow-up period (P<0.001).

The objective of this study was to identify patient populations with poor health care access and assess prescribing trends for drugs with published PGx testing guidelines. We used electronic health record data from 67,753 University of Florida Health patients, geographic access scores calculated via the 2-step floating catchment area method, and a composite measure of socioeconomic status. Comparing the poorest (Q4) and greatest (Q1) access score quartiles, poor geographic access was significantly associated with fewer prescriber encounters (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86-0.91), fewer total unique drugs (IRR 0.92, 95% CI 0.9-0.95), and fewer PGx guideline drugs (IRR 0.94, 95% CI 0.9-0.99). After correcting for number of unique drugs, patients in low-access areas were prescribed a greater proportion of PGx guideline drugs (IRR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.13). We detected significant interactions between Black race and access score. Compared to Q1, Black patients with Q4 access scores were disproportionately affected and had fewer encounters (IRR 0.76, 95% CI 0.7-0.82) and a higher proportion of PGx drugs (IRR 1.26, 95% CI 1.13-1.41), creating further disparity.

The adage that prevention is better than cure is especially true regarding antibiotic resistance because the resistance appears and spreads much faster than the production of new antibiotics. Vaccination is an important strategy to fight infectious agents; however, this strategy has not attracted sufficient attention in antibiotic resistance prevention. New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) confers resistance to many beta-lactamases, including important carbapenems like imipenem. Our goal in this study is to use an immunoinformatics approach to develop a vaccine that can elicit strong and specific immune responses against NDMs that prevent the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. RESULTS: In this study, 2194 NDM sequences were aligned to obtain a conserved sequence. One continuous B cell epitope and three T cell CD4(+) epitopes were selected from NDMs conserved sequence. Epitope conservancy for B cell and HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP epitopes was 100.00%, 99.82%, 99.41%, and 99.86%, respectively, and population coverage of MHC II epitopes for the world was 99.91%. Permutation of the four epitope fragments resulted in 24 different peptides, of which 6 peptides were selected after toxicity, allergenicity, and antigenicity assessment. After primary vaccine design, only one vaccine sequence with the highest similarity with discontinuous B cell epitope in NDMs was selected. The final vaccine can bind to various Toll-like receptors (TLRs). The prediction implied that the vaccine would be stable with a good half-life. An immune simulation performed by the C-IMMSIM server predicted that two doses of vaccine injection can induce a strong immune response to NDMs. Finally, the GC-Content of the vaccine was designed very similar to E. coli K12. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, immunoinformatics strategies were used to design a vaccine against different NDM variants that could produce an effective immune response against this antibiotic-resistant factor.

Unlike forward contact tracing, backward contact tracing identifies the source of newly detected cases. This approach is particularly valuable when there is high individual-level variation in the number of secondary transmissions (overdispersion). Methods: By using a simple branching process model, we explored the potential of combining backward contact tracing with more conventional forward contact tracing for control of COVID-19. We estimated the typical size of clusters that can be reached by backward tracing and simulated the incremental effectiveness of combining backward tracing with conventional forward tracing. Results: Across ranges of parameter values consistent with dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, backward tracing is expected to identify a primary case generating 3-10 times more infections than average, typically increasing the proportion of subsequent cases averted by a factor of 2-3. The estimated number of cases averted by backward tracing became greater with a higher degree of overdispersion.

This is likely because of increases in fragility across biological repair systems and a weakened immune system, including loss of the cardiorenal protective arm of the renin--angiotensin system (RAS), composed of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2)/angiotensin-(1--7) [Ang-(1--7)] and its actions through the Mas receptor. The purpose of this review is to explore how cardiac ACE2 changes with age, cardiac diseases, comorbid conditions and pharmaceutical regimens in order to shed light on a potential hormonal unbalance facilitating SARs-CoV-2 vulnerabilities in older adults. RECENT FINDINGS Increased ACE2 gene expression has been reported in human hearts with myocardial infarction, cardiac remodeling and heart failure. We also found ACE2 mRNA in atrial appendage tissue from cardiac surgical patients to be positively associated with age, elevated by certain comorbid conditions (e.g. COPD and previous stroke) and increased in conjunction with patients' chronic use of antithrombotic agents and thiazide diuretics but not drugs that block the renin--angiotensin system. SUMMARY Cardiac ACE2 may have bifunctional roles in COVID-19 as ACE2 not only mediates cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection but also protects the heart via the ACE2/Ang-(1--7) pathway.

To predict patient risk for critical COVID-19 based on status at admission using machine-learning models. Retrospective study based on a database of tertiary medical center with designated departments for patients with COVID-19. Patients with severe COVID-19 at admission, based on low oxygen saturation, low partial arterial oxygen pressure, were excluded. The primary outcome was risk for critical disease, defined as mechanical ventilation, multi-organ failure, admission to the ICU, and/or death. Three different machine-learning models were used to predict patient deterioration and compared to currently suggested predictors and to the APACHEII risk-prediction score. Among 6995 patients evaluated, 162 were hospitalized with non-severe COVID-19, of them, 25 (15.4%) patients deteriorated to critical COVID-19. Machine-learning models outperformed the all other parameters, including the APACHE II score (ROC AUC of 0.92 vs. 0.79, respectively), reaching 88.0% sensitivity, 92.7% specificity and 92.0% accuracy in predicting critical COVID-19.

Objective knowledge and sociodemographic factors, other than education, were not found to have any impact. The discernment of a buyer and their ability to distinguish apple varieties had the greatest impact on the importance that US consumers placed on physical and commercial product attributes.

The pandemic has multiplied the number of scientific publications and has accelerated publication rates, which has contributed to the dissemination of provisional, erroneous, or totally false information. A process of politicization has also developed, which has led to misinformation. In addition, the need to confront this health crisis has led society to demand accurate information from science, despite the fact that in many cases there is only uncertainty. The experience of this pandemic highlights the importance of providing citizens with accessible and rigorous knowledge that creates confidence in science.

Similarly, several envelope proteins of endogenous retroviruses in human and other mammalian animal genomes (such as syncytin-1 and 2 in human, syncytin-A and B in mouse) were identified and shown to be functional in induction of cellCcell fusion involved in placental development. ZFERV envelope protein (Env) gene appears to be also functional in vivo because it is expressible. After sequence alignment, we found ZFERV Env shares similar structural profiles with syncytin and other type I viral envelopes, especially in the regions of N- and C-terminal heptad repeats (NHR and CHR) which were crucial for membrane fusion. We expressed the regions of N + C protein in the ZFERV Env (residues 459C567, including predicted NHR and CHR) to characterize the fusion core structure. We found N + C protein could form a stable coiled-coil trimer that consists of three helical NHR regions forming a central trimeric core, and three helical CHR regions packing into the grooves on the surface of the central core. The structural characterization of the fusion core revealed the possible mechanism of fusion mediated by ZFERV Env.

This has prompted researchers to better understand how CBPR functions to achieve these benefits through building sustainable research partnerships. Several studies have identified \\"trust\\" as a key mechanism to achieve sustainable partnerships, which themselves constitute social networks. Although existing literature discusses trust and CBPR, or trust and social networks, preliminary searches reveal that none link all three concepts of trust, CBPR, and social networks. Thus, we present our scoping review to systematically review and synthesize the literature exploring how trust is conceptualised, operationalised, and measured in CBPR and social networks. METHODS: This review follows the guidance and framework of Peters et al. which is underpinned by the widely used framework of Levac and colleagues. Levac and colleagues provided enhancements to the methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley. We explored several electronic databases including Scopus, Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and PsychINFO. A search strategy was identified and agreed upon by the team in conjunction with a research librarian. Two independent reviewers screened articles by title and abstract, then by full-text based on pre-determined exclusion/inclusion criteria. A third reviewer arbitrated discrepancies regarding inclusions/exclusions. A thematic analysis was then conducted to identify relevant themes and sub-themes. RESULTS: Based on the 26 extracted references, several key themes and sub-themes were identified which highlighted the complexity and multidimensionality of trust as a concept. Our analysis revealed an additional emergent category that highlighted another important dimension of trust-outcomes pertaining to trust. Further, variation within how the studies conceptualised, operationalised, and measured trust was illuminated. Finally, the multidimensionality of trust provided important insight into how trust operates as a context, mechanism, and outcome.

Tropical outbreaks often peak in wet seasons. Temperate outbreaks typically peak during the winter. The prevailing causal hypotheses focus on sunlight, temperature and humidity variations. Yet no consistent factors have been identified to sufficiently explain seasonal virus emergence and decline at any latitude. Here we demonstrate close connections among global-scale atmospheric circulations, IgE antibody enhancement through seasonal pollen inhalation, and respiratory virus patterns at any populated latitude, with a focus on the US. Pollens emerge each Spring, and the renewed IgE titers in the population are argued to terminate each winter peak of respiratory illness. Globally circulated airborne viruses are postulated to subsequently deposit across the Southern US during lower zonal geostrophic winds each late Summer. This seasonally refreshed viral load is postulated to trigger a new influenza outbreak, once the existing IgE antibodies diminish to a critical value each Fall. Our study offers a new and consistent explanation for the seasonal diminishment of respiratory viral illnesses in temperate climates, the subdued seasonal signature in the tropics, the annually circulated virus phenotypes, and the northerly migration of influenza across the US every year.

The SDSS focuses on the management of public spaces as a resource to increase a vulnerable populations accessibility to essential goods and services. Using a web-based platform, the SDSS would support data-driven decisions, especially for cases such as the COVID-19 pandemic which requires special care in quarantine situations (which imply walking access instead of by other means of transport). Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes a methodology to create a web-SDSS to manage public spaces in the planning and response phase of a disaster to increase the access to essential goods and services. Using a regular polygon grid, a city is partitioned into spatial units that aggregate spatial data from open and proprietary sources. The polygon grid is then used to compute accessibility, vulnerability and population density indicators using spatial analysis. Finally, a facility location problem is formulated and solved to provide decision-makers with an adaptive selection of public spaces given their indicators of choice. Findings: The design and implementation of the methodology resulted in a granular representation of the city of Lima, Peru, in terms of population density, accessibility and vulnerability. Using these indicators, the SDSS was deployed as a web application that allowed decision-makers to explore different solutions to a facility location model within their districts, as well as visualizing the indicators computed for the hexagons that covered the districts area. By performing tests with different local authorities, improvements were suggested to support a more general set of decisions and the key indicators to use in the SDSS were determined. Originality/value: This paper, following the literature gap, is the first of its kind that presents an SDSS focused on increasing access to essential goods and services using public spaces and has had a successful response from local authorities with different backgrounds regarding the integration into their decision-making process. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"A methodology for managing public spaces to increase access to essential goods and services by vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus (CoV), throughout the globe poses a daunting public health emergency.

We show that cancer-promoting exosomes were detected from both sites, suggesting that the previous tumour has altered the whole bladder tissue into a cancer-supporting milieu. The exosomes may originate from remaining pathologically undetectable cancer cells or transformed epithelial cells, and the study supports the notion of exosomes as mediators of metastatic spread and as potential biomarkers. It also supports early and radical removal of the bladder in urinary bladder cancer patients. ABSTRACT: Invasive urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) has high recurrence rates even after radical cystectomy (RC). Exosomes are membrane-bound nanovesicles, which have been shown to contribute to carcinogenesis and metastasis. We previously showed that urinary exosomes display a malignant profile in UBC patients despite the absence of detectable tumour. Here, we investigated exosomes from sampling sites close to or distant from the former tumour, aiming to understand the effect of the tumour on the local milieu. Ten patients scheduled for cystectomy after transurethral bladder resection (TUR-B), without remaining detectable tumour, were included. Exosomes were isolated from tissue explants of both the previous tumour site and distant bladder tissue. Proteins were quantified by mass spectrometry in seven patients. Exosomes from the previous tumour site were enriched in inflammatory but not cancer-related pathways compared to distant tissue. However, the 69 most abundant proteins in tissue-derived exosomes regardless of site, 20 of which were also found in urinary exosomes from our previous study, were enriched for cancer-related metabolic pathways and associated with poor prognosis in an external mRNA dataset. The enrichment of cancer-related pathways in the most abundant proteins, regardless of sampling site, confirms our hypothesis that despite the absence of detectable tumour, the entire bladder releases exosomes that contribute to metastasis and highlights the need for early RC.","output":"Proteomic Profiling of Tissue Exosomes Indicates Continuous Release of Malignant Exosomes in Urinary Bladder Cancer Patients, Even with Pathologically Undetectable Tumour"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A new coronavirus disease named COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is rapidly spreading worldwide. However, there is currently no effective drug to fight COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, we developed a Virus-Drug Association (VDA) identification framework (VDA-RWLRLS) combining unbalanced bi-Random Walk, Laplacian Regularized Least Squares, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation to find clues for the treatment of COVID-19. First, virus similarity and drug similarity are computed based on genomic sequences, chemical structures, and Gaussian association profiles. Second, an unbalanced bi-random walk is implemented on the virus network and the drug network, respectively. Third, the results of the random walks are taken as the input of Laplacian regularized least squares to compute the association score for each virus-drug pair. Fourth, the final associations are characterized by integrating the predictions from the virus network and the drug network. Finally, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation are implemented to measure the potential of screened anti-COVID-19 drugs and further validate the predicted results. RESULTS: In comparison with six state-of-the-art association prediction models (NGRHMDA, SMiR-NBI, LRLSHMDA, VDA-KATZ, VDA-RWR, and VDA-BiRW), VDA-RWLRLS demonstrates superior VDA prediction performance.

Recently, its incidence has been increasing worldwide because more pregnant women have risk factors. The provision of early, high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) plays a major role in the increased likelihood of survival; therefore, it is important for clinicians to know how to manage it. Due to the aortocaval compression caused by the gravid uterus, clinical guidelines often emphasise the importance of maternal positioning during CPR, but there has been little evidence regarding which position is most effective. METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, and OpenGrey (updated on April 3, 2021). We included clinical trials and observational studies with reported outcomes related to successful resuscitations. RESULTS We included eight studies from the 1,490 screened. The eight studies were simulation-based, crossover trials that examine the quality of chest compressions. No data were available about the survival rates of mothers or foetuses/neonates. The meta-analyses showed that resuscitation of pregnant women in the 27-30 left-lateral tilt position resulted in lower quality chest compressions. The difference is an 19% and 9% reduction in correct compression depth rate and correct hand position rate, respectively, compared with resuscitations in the supine position. Inexperienced clinicians find it difficult to perform chest compressions in the left-lateral tilt position. CONCLUSIONS Given that manual left uterine displacement allows the patient to remain supine, the resuscitation of women in the supine position using manual left uterine displacement should continue to be supported.

Quality of studies was evaluated by using a specific tool for assessment of case reports and/or case series. RESULTS: Twenty-six observational studies (18 case reports and 8 case series) with 44 newborns with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the final analysis. Studies were mainly from China and Italy. Half of neonates had a documented contact with the infected mother and one out of three infected neonates was admitted from home. Median age at diagnosis was 5 days. One out of four neonates was asymptomatic, and the remaining showed mild symptoms typical of acute respiratory infections and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. The majority of neonates were left in spontaneous breathing (room air) and had good prognosis after a median duration of hospitalisation of 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: Most neonates with SARS-CoV-2 infection were asymptomatic or presented mild symptoms, generally were left in spontaneous breathing and had a good prognosis after median 10 days of hospitalisation.

AD progresses along a continuum from preclinical disease characterized by normal cognition and abnormal brain biomarkers to mild cognitive impairment and then clinically apparent dementia. Diagnosis early in the AD continuum has benefits for patients and caregivers and appears cost-effective, but often, the clinical diagnosis of AD may be delayed. Currently available biomarkers include -amyloid positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid tests. Collectively, they are expensive, may lead to adverse effects, are not widely available, and are not suited for primary care. Currently available treatment options, cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, do not alter disease progression, but can help with some symptoms. Benefits of currently available treatments on cognition are difficult to quantify and are offset by a burden of adverse effects that often go unrecognized. More accurate diagnostic biomarkers and disease-modifying drug therapies are critical unmet needs of patients with AD despite decades of clinical research. Because many phase 3 clinical trials that enrolled patients with symptomatic AD have failed, researchers believe that disease-modifying treatment is more likely to demonstrate benefit when utilized early in the disease continuum. Within the past few years, significant achievements that will advance clinical trials in early AD include the Research Framework to define and stage the AD continuum, FDA guidance on study design in early AD, and development of scales to measure cognition that are suitable for early AD.

An assessment of mortality relative to mortality in the general population is presented. Design: Retrospective population-based study. Setting: Individual information on symptomatic confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients and subsequent deaths from any cause were compared to the all-cause mortality in the Swiss population of 2018. Starting February 23, 2020, mortality in covid-19 patients was monitored for 80 days and compared to the population mortality observed in the same time-of-year starting February 23, 2018. Participants: 5 160 595 inhabitants of Switzerland aged 35 to 95 without covid-19 (general population in spring 2018) and 20 769 persons tested positively for covid-19 (spring 2020). Measurements: Sex- and age-specific mortality rates were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Absolute probabilities of death were predicted and risk was assessed in terms of relative mortality by taking the ratio between the sex- and age-specific absolute mortality in covid19 patients and the corresponding mortality in the 2018 general population. Results: A confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially increased the probability of death across all patient groups, ranging from nine (6 to 15) times the population mortality in 35-year old infected females to a 53-fold increase (46 to 59) for 95 year old infected males. The highest relative risks were observed among males and older patients. The magnitude of these effects was smaller compared to increases observed in absolute mortality risk. Male covid-19 patients exceeded the population hazard for males (hazard ratio 1.20, 1.00 to 1.44). Each additional year of age increased the population hazard in covid-19 patients (hazard ratio 1.04, 1.03 to 1.05). Limitations: Information about the distribution of relevant comorbidities was not available on population level and the associated risk was not quantified. Conclusions: Health care professionals, decision makers, and societies are provided with an additional population-adjusted assessment of covid-19 mortality risk. In combination with absolute measures of risk, the relative risks presented here help to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the actual impact of covid-19.","output":"Relative Coronavirus Disease 2019 Mortality: A Swiss Population-based Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study is to assess the similarity of the situation in the EU labour markets and their evolution using selected indicators in the period before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, there are scholars who challenge this view and argue that redundancy is an essential element in facilitating reliable and safe operations in health care delivery processes. The ambiguity on redundancy has led to limited insights in health care settings. PURPOSE This article seeks to provide clarity by investigating the conceptualization of redundancy within and across disparate contexts within hospital operations. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH An exploratory study using different hospital departments was conducted in two large hospitals as case studies to allow for in-depth understanding of the conceptualization of redundancy across hospital departments. Data sources included 42 semistructured interviews, surveys, field notes from site observations, and document analysis. RESULTS/FINDINGS The findings revealed alternative conceptualizations of redundancy, these being safety, care, heterogeneity, sustenance, and waste, and highlight their dominance in distinct hospital departments. The first four categories are positive in connotation, whereas the last, waste, has a negative connotation. Further, the analysis revealed that the conceptualization of redundancy is context dependent. CONCLUSION Contrary to the general cognition of redundancy in the social science and management literature, our research found that redundancy might have a valuable role to play in core health care management concerns such as patient-centeredness, patient safety, and quality of care. This work is one of the first comprehensive studies on redundancy in the health care settings and is expected to steer scholarly conversations on redundancy in a more positive light.

Trainer system) by physical therapists in implementing a gamified physical-cognitive dual-task training (DTT) paradigm for individuals with Parkinson disease (IWPD) was examined. Additionally, the efficacy of this gamified DTT was compared to physical single-task training (STT), both of which were optimized using physio-motivational factors, on changes in motor and cognitive outcomes, and self-assessed disability in activities of daily living. Methods: Using a cross-over study design, eight participants with mild-to-moderate idiopathic PD (including one with mild cognitive impairment) completed both training conditions (i.e., gamified DTT and STT). For each training condition, the participants attended 2C3 sessions per week over 8.8 weeks on average, with the total amount of training being equivalent to 24 1 h sessions. A washout period averaging 11.5 weeks was inserted between training conditions. STT consisted of task-oriented training involving the practice of functional tasks, whereas for gamified DTT, the same task-oriented training was implemented simultaneously with varied cognitive games using an interactive training system (SMARTfit(?)). Both training conditions were optimized through continual adaptation to ensure the use of challenging tasks and to provide autonomy support. Training hours, heart rate, and adverse events were measured to assess the feasibility and safety of the gamified DTT protocol. Motor and cognitive function as well as perceived disability were assessed before and after each training condition. Results: Gamified DTT was feasible and safe for this cohort. Across participants, significant improvements were achieved in more outcome measures after gamified DTT than they were after STT. Individually, participants with specific demographic and clinical characteristics responded differently to the two training conditions. Conclusion: Physical therapists utilization of technology with versatile hardware configurations and customizable software application selections was feasible and safe for implementing a tailor-made intervention and for adapting it in real-time to meet the individualized, evolving training needs of IWPD.

The aim of this study is to examine the changes in their sex lives due to the Turkish COVID-19 outbreak. Method This online survey was conducted between April and June 2020 with 468 patients admitted to the hospital. After the approval was given, an online questionnaire was sent from the hospital database and from the social media accounts of health institutions (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.) and e-mail addresses. The first part of the four-part questionnaire included demographic data, the second and third parts of attitudes before and after COVID-19, and the last part to assess sexual functions, sleep, anxiety and depression. Results The study was completed with a total of 390 participants. The response rate of the study is 83.33%. Sexual desires of healthcare workers (3.78  1.03 vs. 3.07  1.11;p <0.001), weekly sexual intercourse / masturbation number (2.58  1.01 vs. 1.18  1.01;p <0.001), duration of foreplay (19.27  11.28 vs.10.12  11.04;p <0.001), duration of sexual intercourse (24.65  15.67 vs. 14.25  15, 63;p <0.001) decreased compared to before the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, participants preferred less foreplay (p <0.001), less oral sex (p <0.001) and anal sex (p: 0.007), and more non-face-to-face positions during COVID-19 (p <0.001) . When the factors affecting sexual dysfunction were examined as univariate and multivariate, it was shown that sexual dysfunction was significantly more common in male gender (OR: 2.048) and alcohol users (OR: 3.836). The shortcoming of the study is that the pre-COVID-19 sexual and mental states of the participants were not assessed with the validated questionnaire. Conclusion During the COVID-19 pandemic, the public's sexual desire decreased, the number of sexual intercourse decreased, the duration of foreplay was reduced, and the preference to be face-to-face in sexual intercourse positions decreased.

This is the first time that resource utilization of MF has been combined with the development of a high-performance gas sensor. The MF/ZnS sensor showed high sensitivity and recoverability to target vapors at room temperature. Compared with ZnS powder loaded on a ceramic substrate, the MF/ZnS composite responses to four analytes have been improved by 8.4~35.2 times. In addition, the time for the MF/ZnS sensor to complete one responseCrecovery cycle for all four analytes was less than 30 s. This should be attributed to the high gas permeability of the MF substrate, which made the ZnS particles loaded on the MF more fully exposed to contact with the target vapors. This work not only provides a simple and low-cost method to optimize the sensing performance of gas sensors but also provides a new way for the resource utilization of MF.

The purpose of this scoping review was to examine the literature available on youth-friendly mental health and substance use services in order to identify the characteristics, outline the expected impacts, and establish a definition. METHODS A scoping review of seven databases and grey literature sources was conducted. Twenty-eight documents were retained as relevant to the research questions. Relevant data from these documents was extracted, analyzed and presented to stakeholders, including youth, caregivers and service providers to validate and refine the results. RESULTS Youth-friendly mental health and substance use services include integrated, inclusive, confidential and safe organization and policy characteristics; bright, comfortable, environment with informational materials; welcoming and genuine service providers with appropriate communication and counselling skills; an accessible location; minimal wait times; and individualized and innovative approaches. All areas in which youth friendliness should be implemented in a mental health and substance use service organization had a core value of youth voice. CONCLUSION Improving the youth friendliness of mental health and substance use services includes incorporating youth voice in organization, policy, environment, service providers, and treatment services, and has implications for treatment uptake, engagement and satisfaction.

We point out that, in the Chinese narrative, the country emerges from a century of humiliation, becoming a major world power that will no longer be subject to the bullying of the West. In the US narrative, even though Trump initially highlights the countrys very good relationship with China, as the storyline unfolds, China is blamed for the global pandemic, assuming again the role of a dangerous actor on the world stage.

To date, dexamethasone has shown a decrease in mortality in patients who require oxygen, especially those with invasive mechanical ventilation. However, it is unknown if another corticosteroid can be used, the optimal dose and its duration, to achieve a better clinical outcome. The objective of the study was to compare the differences in clinical outcome and laboratory results in hospitalized patients with severe SARS-CoV2 Pneumonia treated with dexamethasone at 6 mg doses versus patients treated with high-dose methylprednisolone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ambispective cohort study with survival analysis of 216 patients diagnosed with severe Covid-19 pneumonia confirmed by polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV2 by Berlin protocol, who were hospitalized in a high-complexity clinic in Medelln, Colombia. The patients should also have supplementary oxygen and radiological confirmation of Pneumonia by chest tomography. Sample size was not calculated since the total population that met the inclusion criteria was evaluated. 111 patients were treated with the institutional protocol with intravenous dexamethasone 6 mg QD for seven to 10 days if they required oxygen. Since September 15, 2020, the hospitalization protocol of the clinic was modified by the Infectious Diseases and Pulmonology service, recommending a high dose of methylprednisolone of 250 to 500 mg every day for three days with a subsequent change to oral prednisone 50 mg every day for 14 days. The protocol was not applied in the intensive care unit, where dexamethasone continued to be administered. The clinical outcome and differences in laboratory results of the patients who received dexamethasone vs. the prospective cohort that received methylprednisolone from September 15 to October 31, 2020, were evaluated. Follow-up was carried out by outpatient consultation one month after discharge or by telephone, inquiring about readmission or living-dead status. RESULTS: 216 patients had Covid-19 pneumonia documented by ground-glass imaging and alveolar pressure / inspired oxygen fraction (PaFi) less than 300. 111 patients received dexamethasone (DXM) and 105 received methylprednisolone (MTP). Patients in the DXM group evolved to severe ARDS in a higher proportion (26.1% vs 17.1% than the MTP group). Upon completion 4 days of treatment with parenteral corticosteroid, laboratory markers of severity decreased significantly in the group that received MTP, CRP 2.85 (2.3-3.8) vs 7.2 (5.4-9.8), (p-value < 0.0001), D-dimer 691 (612-847) vs 1083 (740-1565) (p-value = 0.04) and DHL 273 (244-289) vs 355 (270.6-422) (p-value = 0.01). After starting the corticosteroid, transfer to the intensive care unit (4.8% vs. 14.4%) and mortality (9,5% vs. 17.1%) was lower in the group that received MTP. Recovery time was shorter in patients treated with MTP, three days (3-4) vs. DXM 6 days (5-8) (p-value < 0.0001). At 30-day follow-up, 88 (92.6%) were alive in MTP vs 58 (63.1%) of those who received dexamethasone. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the treatment of severe Covid-19 Pneumonia with high-dose methylprednisolone for three days followed by oral prednisone for 14 days, compared with 6 mg dexamethasone for 7 to 10 days, statistically significantly decreased the recovery time, the need for transfer to intensive care and the severity markers C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer and LDH.

Since the discovery of the low-pathogenic genotype 1b (G1b) in 2014, it has been responsible for sporadic outbreaks in South Korea. In this study, we identified novel G1b variants arising from the natural recombination of a major pandemic-like G2b virus and a minor G1b virus currently circulating in the domestic field. The whole-genome sequences of two 2018-19 G1b recombinants, KNU-1808 and KNU-1909, were determined. A genomic comparison showed that these two viruses share the highest nucleotide sequence similarity with the 2017 G1b strain but share less similarity with the 2014 G1b emergent strain KNU-1406. However, the putative recombination breakpoints spanning the first 1,170 nucleotides of the spike (S) gene were almost identical among the emergent and contemporary G1b strains. Recombination detection indicated that the inter-subgroup G1b recombinant first emerged in 2017 by introducing the N-terminal domain of S from KNU-1406 into the backbone of KNU-1703, possibly leading to antigenic shift. It then evolved into KNU-1808 and KNU-1909 through genetic drift, moving toward a more G2b-like genotype. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 2018-2019 G1b recombinants belong to a cluster containing other G1b strains but form a new branch.

The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an array of social and economic events, influencing how the pandemic affected people of all genders. In particular, job losses surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among women. We analyzed how the pandemic and rising job losses affected the mental health of unmarried women with and without children in order to identify possible health disparities, potential causal factors and opportunities for interventions. Methods. Data were collected from Wave 3 (January 6-February 15, 2021) of the US Census COVID-19 Household Pulse online survey designed to measure the impact of COVID-19. Microdata files were downloaded from the Census website and included N=13,940 never-married female respondents aged 25-54 years old. Data were analyzed using 2 tests, with z-tests for more granular between-group comparisons. Results. When asked if they had felt anxiety in the past week, 31% of respondents without children in the household and 28% of those with children reported feeling anxiety nearly every day (p< .05). Among those who did not lose work during the pandemic, 24% of those without children felt anxiety nearly every day vs. 20% of those with children (p< .05). Among those who did experience pandemic-related job loss, 33% of those with children and 42% of those without children reported daily anxiety (p< .05). Conclusion. Overall, COVID-19 job loss was associated with higher levels of anxiety for never-married adult women. Notably, respondents without children expressed significantly higher levels of anxiety than respondents with children, and this difference was even greater when comparing those who had lost jobs during the pandemic. Reasons are being further researched but may be related to mothers' greater opportunities for social and community support, particularly when encountering difficult circumstances.

Previous research has not been able to measure the broad range of potential stressors, nor examine whether recent changes in those stressors have positively or negatively impacted on common mental disorders. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the stressful impact of the lockdown on mental health has accumulated over time or whether people have adapted to the new conditions of lockdown. This study examines whether there was an increase in the prevalence and incidence of Common Mental Disorders (CMD) in the UK adult population during the first few months of lockdown related to the coronavirus pandemic and whether changes in CMD were associated with an increase in stressors related to lockdown and the pandemic. Methods: Longitudinal data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (wave 9: 2017-2019 and waves 1 and 2 of the Coronavirus survey in April and May 2020 respectively), a representative sample of UK population, were analysed. Common mental disorders (CMD) were measured using the GHQ-12 (cut off >2) at all waves. The difference in the GHQ-12 (using Likert scores) between waves measured changes in psychological well-being. The incidence of CMD and changes in psychological well-being were analysed in relation to pandemic specific stressors and changes in economic, financial, household and psychosocial stressors. Findings: Around 30% of UKHLS adults without CMD in 2017/9 had a CMD in April 2020. However from April to May 2020, the incidence reduced considerably to below 13%. Much of the increase in incident CMD between April and May was associated with an increase in feelings of loneliness, but some of this increase was also associated with increasing domestic work demands (arising out of childcare and home-schooling), working from home, and the receipt of care from outside the home. The reduction in the incidence of many of these stressors in May (compared to April) coincided with a reduction in the incidence of CMD in May. Conclusion: The pandemic and resultant lockdown were associated with an increase in the incidence of CMD in the UK adult population initially in April 2020. These changes were associated with increases in feelings of loneliness and stressors related to work and domestic life and receipt of care.

The authors performed an observational study at 2 locations in Honolulu and evaluated outdoor face mask use compliance in 200 people. Simultaneous observations were performed in a downtown Honolulu business area and in Waikiki, an area focusing on tourism. Overall, 77% of all subjects used face masks in an appropriate fashion, covering their nose and mouth, while 23% were either incorrectly masked or not masked. The rate of compliance with correct public mask use in downtown Honolulu (88%) was significantly higher than in Waikiki (66%) (P=.0003, Odds Ratio [95% Confidence Interval]=3.78 [1.82, 7.85]) These findings suggest that there are opportunities for improvement in rates of public face mask use and a potential decrease in the spread of COVID-19 in our population.

An important issue is the psychological impact of the pandemic on already vulnerable populations, such as oncology staff, as reported by oncology associations. This study assessed the anxiety level among oncology staff during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and related it to its risk factors and the effectiveness of departmental interventions that seek to provide coping methods. Methods A cross-sectional survey was administered to the oncology staff at our oncology center. Generalized anxiety disorder scale yes-or-no questions were used to determine secondary objectives regarding the concern of infection and the impact of a departmental intervention on overcoming distress. Results Overall, 199 participants were included in the analysis; more than 60% were women, with a median age of 34 years. More than 50% had anxiety and the most significant risk factors were parenthood and contraction of infection (P-value 0.03 and 0.02, respectively). Most responders reported an increase in the workload during the pandemic, but coping methods applied by the administration had improved anxiety levels as reported by a majority of the responders. Conclusion Oncology staff members have been negatively affected by the pandemic, although coping methods helped to improve anxiety.

The application of these metagenomics approaches to studying the gut microbiome in COVID-19 patients could be one of the promising areas of research in the fight against the SARS-CoV-2 infection and disparity. Therefore, understanding how the gut microbiome is affected by or could affect the SARS-CoV-2 is very important. Herein, we present an overview of approaches and methods used in the current published studies on COVID-19 patients and the gut microbiome. The accuracy of these researches depends on the appropriate choice and the optimal use of the metagenomics bioinformatics platforms and tools. Interestingly, most studies reported that COVID-19 patients' microbiota are enriched with opportunistic microorganisms. The choice and use of appropriate computational tools and techniques to accurately investigate the gut microbiota is therefore critical in determining the appropriate microbiome profile for diagnosis and the most reliable antiviral or preventive microbial composition.","output":"Metagenomics Approaches to Investigate the Gut Microbiome of COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract In the aftermath of Russia's military incursion in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea in 2014, a flurry of articles predicted the next territorial conquest of President Vladimir Putin's Russian revanchism.

Receptors expressed in the brain endothelial cells have been explored to ferry therapeutic antibodies across the BBB in bifunctional antibody formats. In this study, we generated and characterized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) binding to the basigin receptor, which recently has been proposed as a target for RMT across the BBB. Antibody binding properties such as affinity have been demonstrated to be important factors for transcytosis capability and efficiency. Nevertheless, studies of basigin mAb properties' effect on RMT are limited. Here we characterize different basigin mAbs for their ability to associate with and subsequently internalize human brain endothelial cells. The mAbs were profiled to determine whether receptor binding epitope and affinity affected receptor-mediated uptake efficiency.

N/OFQ and its cognate receptor, NOP, are highly enriched in dopaminergic pathways, and intra-ventricular agonist delivery decreases dopamine levels in the dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens (NAc), and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We used whole cell electrophysiology in acute rat brain slices to investigate synaptic actions of N/OFQ in VTA neurons. Consistent with previous reports, we found that N/OFQ is primarily inhibitory, causing outward currents in both immunocytochemically identified dopaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase positive (TH(+)) and non-dopaminergic (TH(?)) VTA neurons (effect at 1 M: 20  4 pA). A smaller population of VTA neurons responded to low dose N/OFQ with small inward currents (effect at 10 nM: ?11  2 pA). Application of 100 nM N/OFQ resulted in a markedly diminished response to a second N/OFQ application, consistent with receptor desensitization (14  10% of first response). N/OFQ generated outward currents in VTA neurons that project to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), but inward currents in a subset of VTA neurons that project to posterior anterior cingulate cortex. Interestingly, while N/OFQ inhibited VTA cell bodies that project to the NAc, it had little effect on electrically or optogenetically evoked dopamine released from terminals in the NAc measured ex vivo with fast scan cyclic voltammetry.

The anti-parasitic effects of ursolic acid against T. gondii-infected cells and T. gondii were evaluated through different specific assays, including immunofluorescence staining and animal testing. Ursolic acid effectively inhibited the proliferation of T. gondii when compared with sulfadiazine, and consistently induced anti-T. gondii activity/effect. In particular, the formation of parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) in host cells was markedly decreased after treating ursolic acid, which was effectively suppressed. Moreover, the survival rate of T. gondii was strongly inhibited in T. gondii group treated with ursolic acid, and then 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) against T. gondii was measured as 94.62 g/mL. The T. gondii-infected mice treated with ursolic acid indicated the same survival rates and activity as the normal group. These results demonstrate that ursolic acid causes anti-T. gondii action and effect by strongly blocking the proliferation of T. gondii through the direct and the selective T. gondii-inhibitory ability as well as increases the survival of T. gondii-infected mice.

RECENT FINDINGS Extended-spectrum and carbapenemase producing Enterobacterales and multidrug and extensive drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii have increased worldwide. Sequence type (ST)131 Escherichia coli, ST258, ST11, ST10, ST147 and ST307 Klebsiella pneumoniae, ST111, ST175, ST235 and ST244 P. aeruginosa HiRCs are responsible for this increase in the ICUs, and some of them are implicated in the emergence of resistance mechanisms affecting new antimicrobials.

To counter this issue, two new techniques are proposed -- a One-To-Many variant of TBTR and multilevel partitioning. Our One-To-Many algorithm can rapidly solve profile queries, which not only reduces the preprocessing time for HypTBTR, but can also aid other popular approaches such as HypRAPTOR. Next, we integrate a multilevel graph partitioning paradigm in HypTBTR and HypRAPTOR to reduce the fill-in computations. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms is extensively tested on real-world large-scale datasets.

Literature has previously shown that for native joint septic arthritis, operative treatment is not superior to medical treatment. During the COVID-19 lock-down period (March 2020 to June 2020), we prospectively followed the presentation, diagnosis, management and outcome of a total of six patients who presented with confirmed native joint septic arthritis. All six patients underwent initial medical management of their septic arthritis following their diagnostic aspiration, which involved serial closed-needle aspirations and antibiotic therapy as advised by our microbiology team. Four patients went on to have an arthroscopic washout at an average of eight days following admission (mean 2.5), prior to a consultant-led decision to proceed to arthroscopic washout. The decision for operative management was the patients clinical deterioration based on physiological (fever, tachycardia) and biochemical (C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC)) parameters. All of the four patients that proceeded to operative treatment failed to provide culture yield at the time of arthroscopic washout. The mean time to discharge was 15.6 days, whilst the mean time to discharge following operative intervention was 12 days.

Until now, abstract models for describing the structural logic of studies in environmental sciences are lacking and tools for data management are insufficient.

Particularly, it implies maintenance of coherent data along workflows. Design data concern elements from elementary domains of operations being transformation, measurement and transaction. Operation design elements and method information are specified for each consecutive workflow segment from field to laboratory campaigns. The strict linkage of operation design element values, operation values and objects is essential. For enabling coherence of corresponding objects along consecutive workflow segments, the assignment of unique identifiers and the specification of their relations are mandatory. The abstract model presented here addresses these aspects, and the software DiversityDescriptions (DWB-) facilitates the management of thusly connected digital data objects and structures. DWB- allows for an individual specification of operation design elements and their linking to objects. Two workflow design use cases, one for DNA barcoding and another for cultivation of fungal isolates, are given. To publish those structured data, standard schema mapping and XML-provision of digital objects are essential.

Four equilibrium points are given, namely the disease-free equilibrium, the endemic equilibrium with respect to strain 1, the endemic equilibrium with respect to strain 2, and the last endemic equilibrium with respect to both strains. By constructing suitable Lyapunov functional, the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium is proved depending on the basic reproduction number R 0 . Furthermore, using other appropriate Lyapunov functionals, the global stability results of the endemic equilibria are established depending on the strain 1 reproduction number R 0 1 and the strain 2 reproduction number R 0 2 . Numerical simulations are performed in order to confirm the different theoretical results. It was observed that the model with a generalized incidence functions encompasses a large number of models with classical incidence functions and it gives a significant wide view about the equilibria stability. Numerical comparison between the model results and COVID-19 clinical data was conducted. Good fit of the model to the real clinical data was remarked.

Patients often develop a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To date there is no specific treatment available-the main goal of supportive therapy is to ascertain adequate oxygenation. Early intubation and repeated prone positioning are key elements in treating hypoxemic COVID-19 patients. Strict adherence to basic infection control measures (including hand hygiene) and use of personal protection equipment (PPE) are essential in the care of patients. Procedures that lead to formation of aerosols should be avoided where possible and carried out with utmost precaution.","output":"Empfehlungen zur intensivmedizinischen Therapie von Patienten mit COVID-19./ German recommendations for critically ill patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Media has the power to influence the public's views on certain issues, ideologies, and innovations. The media affects whether people accept or adopt a practice or innovation. How certain issues are portrayed in the media affects social reality through the kind of language used and how it is presented. Therefore, it is important to assess the discourse of contact-tracing applications, given how the public must adopt them to contain the spread of the coronavirus. This paper investigates the media discourse of contact-tracing applications in South Africa. We used Critical Discourse Analysis to analyse several media articles using Habermas's Theory of Communicative Action. This involved assessing four validity claims (truth, sincerity, comprehensibility, and legitimacy) to uncover systematic distortions which could affect how the public perceived the Information and Communications Technology artefacts. The analysis showed distortions that could create false impressions on the efficacy of the artefacts;these pushed the notion that would result in South Africans using them more. However, the distortions were overshadowed by the overall evidence from the claims which made a consensus that the media discourse on the application is credible. ? 2021 ACM.","output":"Critical Discourse Analysis on Media Coverage of COVID-19 Contract Tracing Applications: Case of South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 isa novel coronavirus with an outbreak of unusual viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, and then pandemic Based on its phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures the COVID-19 belongs to genera Betacoronavirus Human Betacoronaviruses (SARS-CoV2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) have many similarities, but also have differences in their genomic and phenotypic structure that can influence their pathogenesis COVID-19 is containing singlestranded (positive-sense) RNA associated with a nucleoprotein within a capsid comprised of matrix protein A typical CoV contains at least six ORFs in its genome All the structural and accessory proteins are translated from the sgRNAs of CoVs Four main structural proteins are encoded by ORFs 10, 11 on the one-third of the genome near the 30-terminus The genetic and phenotypic structure of COVID-19 in pathogenesis is important This article highlights the most important of these features compared to other Betacoronaviruses Copyright ? 2020, Taiwan Society of Microbiology Published by Elsevier Taiwan LLC This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons org/licenses/by","output":"Review Article Genotype and phenotype of COVID-19: Their roles in pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Schools around the world were closed during the spring 2020 lockdown to reduce the spread of COVID-19.

The HPV vaccine prevents cancer and is highly effective, yet vaccination coverage remains low. Pharmacies can play a meaningful role in increasing HPV vaccination access due to their availability and convenience. However, little is known about pharmacists perceived barriers to HPV vaccination. The objective of this systematic review was to summarize existing literature on perceived barriers to administering HPV vaccination reported by pharmacists. Barriers identified from selected studies were synthesized and further grouped into patient, parental, (pharmacists) personal, and system/organization barrier groups. Six studies were included in this review. The cost of the HPV vaccine, insurance coverage and reimbursement were commonly reported perceived barriers. Adolescent HPV vaccination barriers related to parental concerns, beliefs, and inadequate knowledge about the HPV vaccine. Perceived (pharmacists) personal barriers were related to lack of information and knowledge about HPV vaccine and recommendations. At the system/organization level, barriers reported included lack of time/staff/space; difficulty in series completion; tracking and recall of patient; perceived competition with providers; and other responsibilities/vaccines taking precedence.

All of them took two dosages of either BBV-152 or AZD1222 vaccine. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins were measured in two CLIA-based platforms Cobas e411 and ARCHITECT i1000SR. Results: From prior COVID-19 recovered HCWs, 96% were found to be seropositive and developed a median concentration of 588.0 U/mL (interquartile range [IQR], 250.0-2500.0 AU/mL) IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 S- protein after a single dose of vaccine whereas only 61.3% of previously non-infected HCWs developed antibody against SARS-CoV-2 S- protein after single dose with a median concentration of 7.27 U/mL (IQR, 0.4-116.5 AU/mL).

Hence, understanding the role of the inter-residues contacts for the protein structure has been the target of many studies. Contacts comprise non-covalent interactions, which are essential to stabilize macromolecular structures such as proteins. Here we show VTR, a new method for the detection of analogous contacts in protein pairs. VTR performs structural alignment between proteins and detects interactions that occur in similar regions. To evaluate our tool, we proposed three case studies: (i) we compared a vertebrate myoglobin and a truncated invertebrate hemoglobin;(ii) analyzed interactions between the spike protein RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and the cell receptor ACE2;and (iii) compared a glucose-tolerant and a non-tolerant -glucosidase enzyme used for biofuel production. The case studies demonstrate the potential of VTR for the understanding of functional similarities between distantly sequence-related proteins, as well as the exploration of important drug targets and rational design of enzymes for industrial applications. We envision VTR as a promising tool for understanding differences and similarities between homologous proteins with similar 3D structures but different sequences.

However, PCR is criticized due its low sensitivity ratios, also, it is time-consuming and manual complicated process. The proposed framework includes different steps; it starts to prepare the region of interest by segmenting the lung organ, which then undergoes edge enhancing diffusion filtering (EED) to improve the infection areas contrast and intensity homogeneity. The proposed FCN is implemented using U-net architecture with modified residual block to include concatenation skip connection. The block improves the learning of gradient values by forwarding the infection area features through the network. The proposed system is evaluated using different measures and achieved dice overlapping score of 0.961 and 0.780 for lung and infection areas segmentation, respectively. The proposed system is trained and tested using many 2D CT slices extracted from diverse datasets from different sources, which demonstrate the system generalization and effectiveness.

Policy discussions surrounding future support for telemedicine require an understanding of factors associated with successful video visits. OBJECTIVE: To assess patient and clinician factors associated with successful and with failed video visits. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a quality improvement study of 137 846 scheduled video visits at a single academic health system in southeastern Wisconsin between March 1 and December 31, 2020, supplemented with patient experience survey data. Patient information was gathered using demographic information abstracted from the electronic health record and linked with block-level socioeconomic data from the US Census Bureau. Data on perceived clinician experience with technology was obtained using the survey. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome of interest was the successful completion of a scheduled video visit or the conversion of the video visit to a telephone-based service. Visit types and administrative data were used to categorize visits. Mixed-effects modeling with pseudo R(2) values was performed to compare the relative associations of patient and clinician factors with video visit failures. RESULTS: In total, 75 947 patients and 1155 clinicians participated in 137 846 scheduled video encounters, 17 190 patients (23%) were 65 years or older, and 61 223 (81%) patients were of White race and ethnicity. Of the scheduled video encounters, 123 473 (90%) were successful, and 14 373 (10%) were converted to telephone services. A total of 16 776 patients (22%) completed a patient experience survey. Lower clinician comfort with technology (odds ratio [OR], 0.15; 95% CI, 0.08-0.28), advanced patient age (66-80 years: OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.26-0.30), lower patient socioeconomic status (including low high-speed internet availability) (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.77-0.92), and patient racial and ethnic minority group status (Black or African American: OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.69-0.81) were associated with conversion to telephone visits. Patient characteristics accounted for systematic components for success; marginal pseudo R(2) values decreased from 23% (95% CI, 21.1%-26.1%) to 7.8% (95% CI, 6.3%-9.4%) with exclusion of patient factors.

The aim of this study was to investigate the stress perception of German outpatient nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim was to determine associations between their pandemic-related stress and variables such as sleep quality, work engagement, pandemic-related worries and concerns. For this purpose, a questionnaire was developed based on well-established measurement instruments such as the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire to conduct a cross-sectional online survey among outpatient nurses from Germany. Participants (n = 166) showed rather moderate overall pandemic-related stress levels, good sleep quality, high work engagement, and moderate pandemic-related worries and concerns. Pandemic-related stress proved to be a predictor of decreased sleep quality and work engagement of outpatient nurses with weak effect sizes. Despite the surprisingly moderate stress levels, the effects of pandemic-related stress on selected aspects of participants mental health could be demonstrated. Therefore, behavioural and organisational health promotion measures are recommended to support outpatient nurses during the pandemic.

Till November 2018, 339 SARSr-CoV genomes have been sequenced, including 274 from human, 18 from civets and 47 from bats [mostly from Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus), n = 30; and greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), n = 9]. The human SARS-CoVs and civet SARSr-CoVs were collected in 2003/2004, while bat SARSr-CoVs were continuously isolated in the past 13 years even after the cessation of the SARS epidemic. SARSr-CoVs belong to the subgenus Sarbecovirus (previously lineage B) of genus Betacoronavirus and occupy a unique phylogenetic position. Overall, it is observed that the SARSr-CoV genomes from bats in Yunnan province of China possess the highest nucleotide identity to those from civets. It is evident from both multiple alignment and phylogenetic analyses that some genes of a particular SARSr-CoV from bats may possess higher while other genes possess much lower nucleotide identity to the corresponding genes of SARSr-CoV from human/civets, resulting in the shift of phylogenetic position in different phylogenetic trees. Our current model on the origin of SARS is that the human SARS-CoV that caused the epidemic in 2002/2003 was probably a result of multiple recombination events from a number of SARSr-CoV ancestors in different horseshoe bat species.","output":"Molecular epidemiology, evolution and phylogeny of SARS coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 crisis is an unusual and seemingly all-encompassing economic shock.

Internet interventions offer the potential to extend preventative and supportive services as they address key barriers, particularly for those navigating the complex and vulnerable early postpartum period. However, there is limited evidence on the feasibility of such interventions for preventing perinatal mental health disorders and improving human milk feeding outcomes in Black mothers. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aimed to assess the feasibility and preliminary findings of a web-based cognitive behavioral therapyCbased internet intervention, with and without human milk feeding education and support, to prevent perinatal depression and promote human milk feeding in Black mothers. METHODS: Participants were Black-identifying individuals between 20 and 28 weeks of pregnancy with human milk feeding intention and mild to moderate depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire scores 5-14). Participants were randomized to either Sunnyside, a 6-week cognitive behavioral therapyCbased web-based intervention, or Sunnyside Plus, which included additional education and support to promote human milk feeding. Assessments occurred at baseline, third trimester (end of antenatal treatment), 6 weeks postpartum (end of postpartum treatment), and 12 weeks postpartum. The primary focus of this randomized pilot trial was the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of mental health and human milk feeding. RESULTS: A total of 22 tertiary-educated participants were randomized. The mean number of log-ins was 7.3 (SD 5.3) for Sunnyside and 13.8 (SD 10.5) for Sunnyside Plus. Scores of depression and anxiety measures remained below the clinical threshold for referral to treatment in both groups. All the participants initiated human milk feeding (18/18, 100%). Most participants reported at least some human milk feeding at both 6 and 12 weeks postpartum (6/7, 86%; 11/11, 100%, or 10/10, 100%, for Sunnyside and Sunnyside Plus, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that tertiary-educated Black mothers at risk for perinatal depression and who intended to human milk feed were receptive to and satisfied with a web-based cognitive behavioral therapyCbased internet intervention, with and without human milk feeding education and support.

This study aimed to assess whether the implementation of a bladder scan-based voiding protocol reduces the time until discharge after ambulatory inguinal herniorraphy without increasing the rate of POUR. METHODS As part of a perioperative care pathway, a protocol was implemented to standardize decision making after elective inguinal hernia repair (February 2012). Patients were assessed with a bladder scan, and those with <600 mL of urine were discharged home, whereas those with more than 600 mL of urine had an in-and-out catheterization before discharge. The patients received written information about urinary symptoms and instructions to present to the emergency department if they were unable to void at home. An audit of scheduled outpatient inguinal hernia repairs between October 2011 and July 2012 was performed. Comparisons were made using the t test, Fisher's exact test, and Wilcoxon rank sum test where appropriate. Statistical significance was defined a priori as a p value lower than 0.05. RESULTS During the study period, 124 patients underwent hernia repair: 60 before and 64 after implementation of the protocol. The findings showed no significant differences in patient characteristics, laparoscopic approach (35 vs. 33%; p = 0.80), proportion receiving general anesthesia (70 vs. 73%; p = 0.67), or amount of intravenous fluids given (793 vs. 663 mL; p = 0.07). The proportion of patients voiding before discharge was higher after protocol implementation (73 vs. 89%; p = 0.02). The protocol had no impact on median time to discharge (190 vs. 205 min; p = 0.60). Only one patient in each group presented to the emergency department with POUR (2%).

METHODS: The mesh terms of \\"COVID-19 drug treatment\\" (Supplementary Concept) and \\"COVID-19 drug treatment\\" were sequentially utilized as search strategies in Medline and Science direct on October 18, 2020. Searches were confined to systematic reviews/meta-analyses. The Cochrane database was searched on November 1, 2020 with \\"COVID.\\" With adding up four articles from other resources, 84 systematic reviews were considered for initial screening. Finally, 22 articles fulfilled the criteria and were assessed using PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Increasing number of clinical trials from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are not only profitable but also deleterious. Lopinavir/ritonavir failed to maintain their initial efficacy in improving clinical symptoms and mortality rate. Steroids and tocilizumab were suggested in patients with intensely severe symptoms. Steroids reduced mechanical ventilation and death in severely ill patients. Plasma or immunoglobulins effects are absolutely controversial. Favorable impressions of remdesivir have been relied on for the early onset of this drug. Hypotension and abnormal liver function tests were realized as its side effects.

METHODS: All individuals enrolled in the Registry of Critical Illness at Brigham and Womens Hospital between June 2008 and August 2018 who had a CXR within 24 h of admission were included. Each patients CXR was assigned an opacification score of 0C4 in each of four quadrants with the total score being the sum of all four quadrants. Multivariable negative binomial, logistic, and Cox regression, adjusted for age, sex, race, immunosuppression, a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a history of congestive heart failure, and APACHE II scores, were used to assess the total scores association with ICU length of stay (LOS), duration of mechanical ventilation, in-hospital mortality, 60-day mortality, and overall mortality, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 560 patients were included. Higher CXR scores were associated with increased mortality; for every one-point increase in score, in-hospital mortality increased 10% (OR 1.10, CI 1.05C1.16, p < 0.001) and 60-day mortality increased by 12% (OR 1.12, CI 1.07C1.17, p < 0.001). CXR scores were also independently associated with both ICU length of stay (rate ratio 1.06, CI 1.04C1.07, p < 0.001) and duration of mechanical ventilation (rate ratio 1.05, CI 1.02C1.07, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Higher values on a simple visual score of a patients CXR on admission to the medical ICU are associated with increased in-hospital mortality, 60-day mortality, overall mortality, length of ICU stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation.","output":"Semi-quantitative visual assessment of chest radiography is associated with clinical outcomes in critically ill patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health care is a human process that generates data from human lives, as well as the care they receive.

The influence of pyrolysis temperature (400-600 C) and catalyst (zeolite, spent FCC, and MgO catalyst) on the pyrolysis liquid composition and yield was studied. The studied petroleum-based plastics had similar decomposition temperature ranges but produced their highest pyrolysis yields at different temperatures. Pyrolysis liquids from thermal degradation of HDPE and LDPE consisted high yield of waxes but those of PP and PLA consisted of both waxes and liquid oil. Catalysts affected not only the pyrolysis yield, but also the proportions of liquid oil and wax in pyrolysis liquids. Alkenes, alkanes, and aromatics were the main compounds in the pyrolysis liquids. Spent FCC catalyst reduced the production of waxes and increased the production of gasoline-range hydrocarbons and aromatics. MgO catalyst led to high coke formation from polyolefins and PLA. Lactic acid, lactide and propanoic acid were examples of valuable chemicals recovered from the pyrolysis of PLA. Lactide was the main product (up to 79%) of catalytic pyrolysis with zeolite at 400 C. Spent FCC catalyst produced mostly propanoic acid at 400 C but at 600 C, L-lactic acid became the most abundant compound.","output":"Catalytic pyrolysis of petroleum-based and biodegradable plastic waste to obtain high-value chemicals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"VEGF plays a crucial role in cancer development, angiogenesis and progression, principally liver and breast cancer. It is vital to uncover novel chemical candidates of VEGFR inhibitors to develop more potent anti-breast and anti-liver cancer agents than the currently available candidates, sorafenib and regorafenib, that face resistance obstacles and severe side effects. Herein, nine pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives were designed, synthesized as sorafenib and regorafenib analogues and screened for their in vitro cytotoxic and growth inhibition activities against four human cancer cell lines, namely breast cancer (Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) type (HepG2), lung carcinoma (A-549) and human colorectal carcinoma-116 (HCT-116)). Among the tested compounds, compounds 1, 2a, 4b and 7 showed the uppermost cytotoxic activities against all aforementioned cell lines with IC(50) estimates varying from 6 to 50 M, among which compound 7 showed the best inhibitory activity on all tested compounds. Stunningly, compound 7 showed the best significant inhibition of the VEGFR-2 protein expression level (72.3%) as compared to the control and even higher than that produced with sorafenib and regorafenib (70.4% and 55.6%, respectively). Modeling studies provided evidence for the possible interactions of the synthesized compounds with the key residues of the ATP binding sites on the hinge region and the DFG out motif of VEGFR-2 kinase. Collectively, our present study suggests that pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives are a novel class of anti-cancer drug candidates to inhibit VEGF-VEGFR function. Aspiring to promote constrained aqueous solubility, hence poor oral bioavailability of the developed lead molecule, 7 and 2a-charged D--tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) surface-coated niosomes were successfully constructed, adopting a thin film hydration technique striving to overcome these pitfalls.

F2 and S2 were picked as the optimum formula for compounds 2a and 7 with desirability values of 0.907 and 0.903, respectively. In addition, a distinguished improvement was observed in the compounds oral bioavailability and cytotoxic activity after being included in the nano-TPGS-coated niosomal system relative to the unformulated compound.

In this work, we used a coarse-grained model to calculate the binding free energy of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV to their human receptor ACE2. The investigation of the free energy contribution of the interacting residues indicates that the residues located outside the receptor binding domain are the source of the stronger binding of the novel virus. Thus, the current results suggest that the essential evolution of SARS-CoV-2 happens remotely from the binding domain at the spike protein trimeric body. Such evolution may facilitate the conformational change and the infection process that occurs after the virus is bound to ACE2. By studying the binding pattern between SARS-CoV antibody m396 and SARS-CoV-2, it is found that the remote energetic contribution is missing, which might explain the absence of cross-reactivity of such antibodies.","output":"Critical Differences between the Binding Features of the Spike Proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Present guidelines on reducing aerosol generation during neurosurgical procedures are futile. The aim of this article was to describe a novel device to contain aerosol within a small localized environment around the operative field-the negative pressure assisted microenvironment surgical hood (NEPA-MESH). METHODS: This device can be assembled using easily available materials-steel wires, image intensifier cover, surgical drape, and three-dimensional-printed self-locking copolyester double hoops. Large-bore pipes in continuity with a high-volume suction apparatus create a constant negative pressure microenvironment around the operative field. The CEM DT-9880 particle counter was used to estimate particle concentration inside the NEPA-MESH during various stages of a neurosurgical procedure as well as outside. The NEPA-MESH was tested in different craniotomies and endoscopic procedures. RESULTS: Mean particle concentration inside the NEPA-MESH and outside during drilling in various procedures was calculated and compared using unpaired t test. Significant reduction in particle concentrations was recorded for particles sized 0.3 m (t = 17.55, P < 0.0001), 0.5 m (t = 11.39, P < 0.0001), 1 m (t = 6.36, P = 0.0002), 2.5 m (t = 2.04, P = 0.074), 5.0 m (t = 7.026, P = 0.0008), and 10 m (t = 4.39, P = 0.0023).

METHODS: This analysis utilizes information on the availability of oxygen sources and delivery apparatuses to determine if a health facility is ready to deliver oxygen therapy to patients in need, and estimates how many patients can be treated with continuous oxygen flow for a 7-day period based on the available oxygen equipment at health facilities. Using GIS mapping software, the study team modeled varying travel times to oxygen-ready facilities to estimate the proportion of the population with access to care. RESULTS: 0.4% of all health facilities in Mozambique are prepared to deliver oxygen therapy to patients, for a cumulative total of 283.9 to 406.0 patients-weeks given the existing national capacity, under varying assumptions including ability to divert oxygen from a single source to multiple patients. 35% of the population in Mozambique has adequate access within one-hour driving time of an oxygen-ready health facility.

PP is a highly utilized treatment adjunct in patients admitted with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. One of the most common complications when in prone position is pressure sores and skin breakdown. We present a unique case of COVID-19 associated Steven Johnson Syndrome (SJS) that mimics skin blistering associated with patients placed in PP. CASE PRESENTATION: 61-year-old female with history of metabolic syndrome who was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by ARDS requiring mechanical intubation was transferred to our institution for advanced circulatory support evaluation. Upon arrival, a lung protective strategy including low tidal volume as well as early PP was initiated. On day four of admission, exam revealed blistering of the oral mucosa, which was initially thought to be due to prolonged PP. Despite conservative management, the blisters progressed to mucosal erosions, a new morbilliform eruption on the trunk and extremities with intact bullae on the thighs. Punch biopsy revealed full thickness epidermal necrosis and subepidermal vesiculation consistent epidermal necrolysis, compatible with SJS. Pulse dose steroids were initiated with subsequent recovery of her skin blisters. DISCUSSION: PP in mechanically ventilated patients has been shown to decrease mortality in severe ARDS. Prone position pressure sores (PPPS) are a common complication associated with prolonged duration of PP. PPPS often manifest as stage II pressure injuries located over bony prominences of the face and are managed conservatively. SJS/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a fatal medical emergency. It is a systemic disease that is thought to be immunologically mediated with primarily mucocutaneous manifestations, often triggered by medications or certain viral infections. Oral ulcers and blisters seen in SJS can sometimes be confused for PPPS. Given its rapid progression and associated fatality, conservatively managing SJS if confused for PPPS can lead to increased morbidity and mortality.A comprehensive medication reconciliation in our patient did not identify a trigger. which led us to suspect COVID-19? as the potential culprit. We hypothesize that the cytokine storm and multi-system organ dysfunction in severe COVID-19 infection is the underlying mechanism leading to SJS. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of COVID-19 associated SJS. CONCLUSIONS: PPPS are commonly seen in PP ventilated patients. Skin blisters which do not resolve with a trial of conservative management warrant further investigation with close and thorough physical examination as they may be masking a serious underlying diagnosis.

However, surgeons often encounter cases with suspicious false-positive and false-negative results from intraoperative evoked potential (EP) monitoring, but the incidence and possible causes for these results are not well established. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and reliability of EP monitoring in the microsurgical treatment of intracranial aneurysms by evaluating false-positive and false-negative cases.METHODSFrom January 2012 to April 2016, 1514 patients underwent surgery for unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) with EP monitoring at the authors' institution. An EP amplitude decrease of 50% or greater compared with the baseline amplitude was defined as a significant EP change. Correlations between immediate postoperative motor weakness and EP monitoring results were retrospectively reviewed. The authors calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of intraoperative MEP monitoring, as well as the incidence of false-positive and false-negative results.RESULTSEighteen (1.19%) of the 1514 patients had a symptomatic infarction, and 4 (0.26%) had a symptomatic hemorrhage. A total of 15 patients showed motor weakness, with the weakness detected on the immediate postoperative motor function test in 10 of these cases. Fifteen false-positive cases (0.99%) and 8 false-negative cases (0.53%) were reported. Therefore, MEP during UIA surgery resulted in a sensitivity of 0.10, specificity of 0.94, positive predictive value of 0.01, and negative predictive value of 0.99.CONCLUSIONSIntraoperative EP monitoring has high specificity and negative predictive value.

METHODS: We performed a multicenter, retrospective study of infants 56 days or younger presenting with fever to emergency departments of 6 community hospitals. We compared the incidence of SBIs, viral meningitis, and viral bronchiolitis during March 2020 to February 2021 (pandemic year) with the same calendar months in the 2 preceding years (prepandemic years). RESULTS: From March 2018 to February 2021, 543 febrile infants presented to the emergency departments, 95 during the pandemic year (March 2020 to February 2021) compared with 231 and 217 in the prepandemic years (March 2018 to February 2019 and March 2019 to February 2020, respectively).

Demographic information collected for each patient included age, race, language, distance from the cancer center, insurance type, marital status, education, performance status and medical history. Demographic factors were compared between patients who enrolled in trials and those who were deemed eligible for clinical trials but did not enroll. Patients who did not enroll in a clinical trial were stratified by the reason for not enrolling as physician factor, patient factor, trial factor, and screening failure. Data was collected in a secure REDCap database. Data was analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and Fisher's exact test. 960 records were reviewed and 165 patients were found to be eligible for a clinical trial at the time of their visit. 35 of these 165 patients (21.2%) enrolled in a clinical trial. Among patients who did not enroll in a clinical trial, the reasons for not doing so were due to a physician factor (71/130 or 55%), patient factor (42/130 or 32%), screening failure (13/130 or 10%), or a trial factor (4/130 or 3%). There were no significant differences in demographics between patients who enrolled in trials and those who did not. Patients who did not enroll secondary to a physician factor differed significantly from those enrolled or attempted to enroll in age and insurance type. Patients who did not enroll secondary to a physician factor were older when compared to those who enrolled or attempted to enroll in a clinical trial but failed the screening process (median of 70 vs 61.5 years old, p=0.014). They were also more likely to have Medicare and less likely to have private insurance (p=0.044). Patients who did not enroll secondary to a patient factor did not appear to differ significantly from patients who did enroll or who failed screening. Although patients who did not enroll secondary to a patient factor lived a mean distance almost twice as far away as those who enrolled or attempted to enroll (mean of 184 vs 91 miles), this was not statistically significant (p=0.107). Based on a one year time span of retrospective review, including the COVID 19 pandemic time, physician factor and concern for a patient's age appears to be the biggest barrier to clinical trial enrollment.

Currently, whether wearing facemasks in public should be a measure to prevent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains contraversial.1 This is largely because there have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for coronavirus to directly support this. However, lessons may be taken from published RCTs examining influenza-like illness (ILI).2,3 Recent studies suggested that SARS-CoV-2 shares similar transmission route with influenza virus,4 and the incidence of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with ILI is high.5 Therefore, we undertook this meta-analysis of RCTs examining the efficacy of wearing facemasks to prevent ILI in community settings, irrespective of confirmatory testing for the causative virus. We undertook a systematic literature search for RCTs related to facemasks and ILI between 1966 and April 2020 using PUBMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane library. RCTs undertaken in community (not hospital) settings comparing wearing and not wearing facemasks for ILI were included. Incidence of ILI (e.g., fever, cough, headache, sore throat, aches or pains in muscles or joints) was estimated per group. Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. We screened 899 related abstracts and eventually included 8 RCTs (Figure S1). Basic characteristics and quality of included RCTs are listed in Supplement. Participants wearing facemasks had a significantly lower risk of developing ILI than those not wearing facemasks (pooled RR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.70-0.95) and there was no heterogeneity (Figure 1). The decreased risk of ILI was more pronounced if everyone wore facemask irrespective of whether they were infected or not (RR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.65-0.91), compared to those wearing facemasks when infected (RR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.58-1.56) or uninfected (RR=1.26, 95% CI: 0.69-2.31). This study shows that wearing facemasks, irrespective of infection status, is effective in preventing ILI spread in the community. This situation mirrors what is happening now in public settings where we do not know who has been infected and who has not. Although there are no RCTs of facemasks for SARS-CoV-2, as with other simple measures such as social distancing and handwashing, these data support the recommendation to wear facemasks in public to further reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and flatten the curve of this pandemic, especially when social distancing is impractical, such as shopping, or travelling with public transport for work that cannot be done from home.","output":"Facemasks prevent influenza-like illness: implications for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: As of March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Articles published after the SARS-CoV-1 (2002) epidemic suggest that the use of an herbal-drug integrative medical approach could have contributed to a lower fatality rate and a more rapid response in controlling the outbreak. METHODS: Pubmed was searched for articles that investigated the antiviral properties and mechanisms of action of herbs or natural compounds against the SARS-coronavirus (CoV). RESULTS: Forty-three (43) relevant papers were located. A general count rendered 450+ herbs and natural compounds with antiviral properties against the SARS-CoV and related viruses. From the 43 articles, thirty-one (31) uncovered the mechanisms of action of the natural substances able to oppose the coronavirus. DISCUSSION: A series of herbs and natural compounds demonstrated moderate to strong antiviral activity. Research on many herbs-natural compounds also showed potent and significant inhibition of CoV-host protein pathways responsible for different phases of viral replication specifically targeting 3CL(PRO), PL(PRO), RdRp, helicase protein, S protein, N protein, 3a protein, Cathepsin L, Nsp1, Nsp3c, and ORF7a, and the S protein-ACE-2 interaction. CONCLUSION: The herbs-natural compounds with antiviral activity and that caused inhibition/blockade of the CoV-host protein pathways are potential therapeutic candidates. The homology between the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 is around 80%. Thus, effective herbs-compounds for the former would likely be beneficial for the latter also depending on target protein similarities between the viruses.

Clinical sensitivity for nasopharyngeal, throat, midturbinate, and saliva was 95%, 88%, 72%, and 44%-56%, respectively, if taken &#8804;7 days from onset of illness, and 70%, 67%, 47%, 28%-44% if >7 days of illness. Comparing patients with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) vs pneumonia, clinical sensitivity for nasopharyngeal, throat, midturbinate, and saliva was 92% vs 70%, 88% vs 61%, 70% vs 44%, 43%-54% vs 26%-45%, respectively. A combination of nasopharyngeal plus throat or midturbinate plus throat specimen afforded overall clinical sensitivities of 89%-92%; this rose to 96% for persons with URTI and 98% for persons &#8804;7 days from illness onset. Conclusions: Nasopharyngeal specimens, followed by throat specimens, offer the highest clinical sensitivity for COVID-19 diagnosis in early illness. Clinical sensitivity improves and is similar when either midturbinate or nasopharyngeal specimens are combined with throat specimens. Upper respiratory specimens perform poorly if taken after the first week of illness or if there is pneumonia.","output":"The Effect of Sample Site, Illness Duration, and the Presence of Pneumonia on the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Real-time Reverse Transcription PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been growing interest in exploring ways to facilitate positive psychological dispositions, including resilience. The goal of the present study was to explore the possibility that trait mindfulness facilitates attachment security and thus enhances resilience. METHODS: We conducted two studies based on cross-sectional surveys. In Study 1, data of 207 students studying in Japan was collected. In Study 2, we used a different sample of 203 participants and different measurements to replicate the findings of Study 1. RESULTS: The results of Study 1 revealed that mindfulness positively predicted resilience, while attachment anxiety and avoidance were mediators between mindfulness and resilience. The results of Study 2 showed that mindfulness positively predicted resilience, and the mediating effect of attachment avoidance was significant, but the mediating effect of attachment anxiety was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to facilitate attachment security through cultivating trait mindfulness, and in this way, resilience could be enhanced.

Research productivity is relevant to prestige and career progression of academic staff. However, this study aimed to explore significant challenges associated with researchers productivity and the impact of non-funding of research in Nigerian research and tertiary institutions. Methods: This study adopted a qualitative exploratory design involving academics at various research and tertiary institutions across the six geographical regions in Nigeria. A semi-structured questionnaire was distributed electronically to all participants who consented to take part in this study. Exactly 4,159 questionnaires were administered and 2,350 were completely filled and returned. Pearson correlation matrices with logistic regression were used for data analysis and are presented in frequencies and percentages. Results: On challenges faced by respondents, 42.98% reported a lack of research funding, 17.11% mentioned brain drain challenge while 8.85% indicated a lack of motivation. Of the 23,927 publications reported, the number of those in sciences, engineering, and medical sciences averaged 9.6, 11.5, and 9.5 respectively. The average number of publications by women (10.8) was more than by men (9.7). Lecturers had the highest average research publication number (11.8) followed by researchers (10.2) and others (3.9). Men had the highest (11.9) average number of conferences compared to women (9.2). Participants in engineering had an average number of 13.8 conferences per respondents followed by those in education (11.2), sciences (11.1), and 10.9 for those in agricultural sciences. The result revealed a negative significant correlation between research publication and academic qualification at p < 0.01. Positive significant correlation was observed between research productivity and discipline at p < 0.05. Findings show that the combined influence of the independent variables on research productivity was significant using linear regression analysis.

OBJECTIVES: This retrospective study compared the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with HRV/EV to patients hospitalized with influenza virus. STUDY DESIGN: Respiratory specimens from hospitalized children submitted between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009 to Children's Hospital Colorado Virology Laboratory in Aurora, CO were tested by a commercial multiplex PCR for 16 respiratory viruses and subtypes. Patients with specimens positive for HRV/EV or influenza virus without bacterial or viral co-infection were selected for retrospective chart review. RESULTS: Of the 2299 patients with specimens tested during the study period, 427 (18.6%) were singly positive for HRV/EV and 202 (8.8%) for influenza virus (p < 0.01). Children with HRV/EV were more likely to present with increased work of breathing (67.9% vs. 52.5%, p < 0.01) with crackles (36.3% vs. 23.3%, p < 0.01) and wheezing (41.7% vs. 22.8%, p < 0.01) noted on exam. Children hospitalized with HRV/EV had a shorter median length of stay (2 days vs. 3 days, p < 0.01), duration of fever (1 days vs. 3 days, p < 0.01), and duration of hypoxemia (2 days vs. 3 days, p < 0.01) than children with influenza virus. Similar percentages of children with HRV/EV and influenza virus were admitted to the PICU and required positive pressure ventilation.

Digital divide and socio-demographic disparity create an information hiatus and therefore unhealthy practices with regard to dealing with COVID-19, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Aims: We assessed knowledge, attitudes, practices and their determinants regarding COVID-19 in Pakistan during March-April 2020. Methods: 905 adults &#8805;18 years (males and females) participated: 403 from a web-based survey; 365 from an urban survey; and 137 from a rural survey. Frequency of adequate knowledge, attitudes and practices for the three populations was determined based on available global guidelines. Multivariable logistic regression analysis determined factors of adequacy of knowledge, attitudes, practices, and association of knowledge with attitudes and practices. Results: Mean age of the participants was 33.5 (+ SD 11.1) years, 51% were females. More females and young adults (18-30 years) participated in the web-based survey. The urban survey and web-based survey participants had significantly higher adequate knowledge (2-7 times) and practices (4-5 times) towards COVID-19. Adequate knowledge had a significant influence on healthy attitudes and practices for COVID-19, after adjustment for covariates. Overall, two-thirds of the population had high levels of fear about COVID-19, which was highest among the rural survey population. Conclusion: Substantial gaps exist in adequate knowledge, attitudes and practices, particularly among rural populations, and underscores the variation in access to information according to level of education and access to the internet.

Digital adherence technologies (DATs) offer a person-centered approach to support and monitor treatment. We explored adherence over time while using DATs. We conducted a meta-analysis on anonymized longitudinal adherence data for drug-susceptible (DS) TB (n = 4515) and drug-resistant (DR) TB (n = 473) populations from 11 DAT projects. Using Tobit regression, we assessed adherence for six months of treatment across sex, age, project enrolment phase, DAT-type, health care facility (HCF), and project. We found that DATs recorded high levels of adherence throughout treatment: 80% to 71% of DS-TB patients had 90% adherence in month 1 and 6, respectively, and 73% to 75% for DR-TB patients. Adherence increased between month 1 and 2 (DS-TB and DR-TB populations), then decreased (DS-TB). Males displayed lower adherence and steeper decreases than females (DS-TB). DS-TB patients aged 15C34 years compared to those >50 years displayed steeper decreases. Adherence was correlated within HCFs and differed between projects.

Several studies established the consequences of pandemic lockdown on air quality using satellite remote sensing. However, such studies have limitations, including low spatial resolution or incomplete spatial coverage. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a machine learning-based scheme to solve the pre-mentioned limitations by training an optimized space-time extra trees model for each year of the study period. The results have shown that our trained models reach a prediction accuracy up to 95% when predicting the missing values in the MODIS MCD19A2 Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) product. The outcome of the mentioned scheme was a geo-harmonized atmospheric dataset for aerosol optical depth at 550 nm with 1 km spatial resolution and full coverage over Europe. As an application, we used the proposed machine learning based prediction approach in AOD levels analysis. We compared the mean AOD levels between the lockdown period from March to June in 2020 and the mean AOD values of the same period for the past 5 years. We found that AOD levels dropped over most European countries in 2020 but increased in several eastern and western countries. The Netherlands had the most significant average decrease in AOD levels (19%), while Spain had the highest average increase (10%). Moreover, we analyzed the relationship between the relative percentage difference of AOD and four meteorological variables. We found a positive correlation between AOD and relative humidity and a negative correlation between AOD and wind speed. The value of the proposed prediction scheme is further emphasized by taking into consideration that the reconstructed dataset can be used for future air quality studies concerning Europe.","output":"Space-Time Machine Learning Models to Analyze COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown Effects on Aerosol Optical Depth over Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human brain activity generates electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations that characterize specific behavioral and vigilance states. The frequency of these oscillations is typically sufficient to distinguish a given state, however theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) have instead been found in near-opposite conditions of drowsiness during sleep deprivation and alert cognitive control. While the latter has been extensively studied and is often referred to as frontal midline theta, the former has been investigated far less but is considered to be a marker for local sleep during wake. In this study we investigated to what extent theta oscillations differed during cognitive tasks and sleep deprivation. We measured high-density EEG in 18 young healthy adults performing 6 tasks under 3 levels of sleep deprivation. We found both cognitive load and sleep deprivation increased theta power in medial prefrontal cortical areas, however sleep deprivation caused additional increases in theta in many other, predominantly frontal, areas. The sources of sleep deprivation theta were task-dependent, with a visual-spatial task and short-term memory task showing the most widespread effects. Notably, theta was highest in supplementary motor areas during passive music listening, and highest in the inferior temporal cortex during a spatial game. This suggests that theta caused by sleep deprivation may preferentially occur in cortical areas not involved in ongoing behavior. While our results find differences in topography from frontal midline theta, they raise the possibility that a common mechanism may underly both theta oscillations during cognition and during sleep deprivation.","output":"The theta paradox: 4-8 Hz EEG oscillations reflect both local sleep and cognitive control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In symptomatic patients with acute Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19), lymphocytopenia is one of the most prominent laboratory findings.

It has been shown that school closures could cause absenteeism among healthcare workers with dependent children, but there remains a need for spatially granular analyses of the relationship between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism to inform local community preparedness. METHODS: We provide national- and county-level simulations of school closures and unmet child care needs across the USA. We develop individual simulations using county-level demographic and occupational data, and model school closure effectiveness with age-structured compartmental models. We perform multivariate quasi-Poisson ecological regressions to find associations between unmet child care needs and COVID-19 vulnerability factors. RESULTS: At the national level, we estimate the projected rate of unmet child care needs for healthcare worker households to range from 7.4 to 8.7%, and the effectiveness of school closures as a 7.6% and 8.4% reduction in fewer hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds, respectively, at peak demand when varying across initial reproduction number estimates by state. At the county level, we find substantial variations of projected unmet child care needs and school closure effects, 9.5% (interquartile range (IQR) 8.2C10.9%) of healthcare worker households and 5.2% (IQR 4.1C6.5%) and 6.8% (IQR 4.8C8.8%) reduction in fewer hospital and ICU beds, respectively, at peak demand. We find significant positive associations between estimated levels of unmet child care needs and diabetes prevalence, county rurality, and race (p<0.05). We estimate costs of absenteeism and child care and observe from our models that an estimated 76.3 to 96.8% of counties would find it less expensive to provide child care to all healthcare workers with children than to bear the costs of healthcare worker absenteeism during school closures. CONCLUSIONS: School closures are projected to reduce peak ICU and hospital demand, but could disrupt healthcare systems through absenteeism, especially in counties that are already particularly vulnerable to COVID-19.

METHODS: For development cohort, 433 symptomatic patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between April 15th 2020 and June 30th, 2020 presented to Tawam Public Hospital, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates were included in this study. Our cohort included both severe and non-severe patients as all cases were admitted for purpose of isolation as per hospital policy. We examined 19 potential predictors of severe disease and critical illness that were recorded at the time of initial assessment. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to construct predictive models. Discrimination was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Calibration and goodness of fit of the models were assessed. A cohort of 213 patients assessed at another public hospital in the country during the same period was used to validate the models. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-six patients were classified as severe while the remaining 247 were categorized as non-severe. For prediction of progression to severe disease, the three independent predictive factors were age, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and serum albumin (ALA model). For progression to critical illness, the four independent predictive factors were age, serum LDH, kidney function (eGFR), and serum albumin (ALKA model). The AUC for the ALA and ALKA models were 0.88 (95% CI, 0.86C0.89) and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.83C0.86), respectively.

The quarantine and traffic blockage can alleviate the risk of the epidemic and the infections, henceforth evaluating the efficacy of such actions is essential to inform policy makers and raise the public awareness of the importance of self-isolation and quarantine. Method: We collected confirmed case data and the migration data, and introduced the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor to the Flow-SEIR model. By varying the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor, we simulated the change of the peak number and arrival time of infections, then the efficacy of these two intervation measures can be analyzed in our simulation. In our study, the self-protection at home is also included in quarantine. Results: In the simulated results, the quarantine and traffic blockage are effective for epidemic control. For Hubei province, the current quarantine factor is estimaed to be 0.405, which means around 40.5% of suceptibles who are close contacting with are in quarantine, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimaed to be 0.66, which indicates around 34% of suceptibles who had flowed out from Hubei. For the other provinces outside Hubei, the current quarantine factor is estimated to be 0.285, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimated to be 0.26. With the quarantine and traffic blockage factor increasing, the number of infections decrease dramatically. We also simulated the start dates of quarantine and traffic blockage at four time points, the simulated results show that the early of warning is also effective for epidemic containing. However, provincial level traffic blockage can only alleviate 21.06% - 22.38% of the peak number of infections. In general, the quarantine is much more effective than the traffic blockage control. Conclusion: Both of quarantine and traffic blockage are effective ways to control the spread of COVID-19. However, the eff icacy of quarantine is found to be much stronger than that of traffic blockage. Considering traffic blockage may also cause huge losses of economy, we propose to gradually deregulate the traffic blockage, and improve quarantine instead.

Uganda hosts 1.3 million refugees, of which 60% are aged under 18. There are knowledge gaps regarding HIV testing facilitators and barriers, including HIV and intersecting stigmas, among urban refugee youth. In response, we explored experiences and perspectives towards HIV testing strategies, including HIV self\\\\testing, with urban refugee youth in Kampala, Uganda. METHODS: We implemented a qualitative study with refugee cisgender youth aged 16 to 24 living in Kampala's informal settlements from February\\\\April 2019. We conducted five focus groups with refugee youth, including two with adolescent boys and young men, two with adolescent girls and young women and one with female sex workers. We also conducted five key informant (KI) interviews with government, non\\\\government and community refugee agencies and HIV service providers. We conducted thematic analyses to understand HIV testing experiences, perspectives and recommendations. RESULTS: Participants (n = 49) included young men (n = 17) and young women (n = 27) originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo [DRC] (n = 29), Rwanda (n = 11), Burundi (n = 3) and Sudan (n = 1), in addition to five KI (gender: n = 3 women, n = 2 men; country of origin: n = 2 Rwanda, n = 2 Uganda, n = 1 DRC). Participant narratives revealed stigma drivers included fear of HIV infection; misinformation that HIV is a Ugandan disease; and blame and shame for sexual activity. Stigma facilitators included legal precarity regarding sex work, same\\\\sex practices and immigration status, alongside healthcare mistreatment and confidentiality concerns. Stigma experiences were attributed to the social devaluation of intersecting identities (sex work, youth, refugees, sexual minorities, people living with HIV, women). Participants expressed high interest in HIV self\\\\testing. They recommended HIV self\\\\testing implementation strategies to be peer supported and expressed concerns regarding sexual\\\\ and gender\\\\based violence with partner testing. CONCLUSIONS: Intersecting stigma rooted in fear, misinformation, blame and shame, legal precarity and healthcare mistreatment constrain current HIV testing strategies with urban refugee youth. Findings align with the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework that conceptualizes stigma drivers and facilitators that devalue intersecting health conditions and social identities. Findings can inform multi\\\\level strategies to foster enabling HIV testing environments with urban refugee youth, including tackling intersecting stigma and leveraging refugee youth peer support.","output":"Intersecting stigma and HIV testing practices among urban refugee adolescents and youth in Kampala, Uganda: qualitative findings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has created obstacles for medical student education, as clinical rotations were temporarily halted. Recent literature shows online electives may provide an alternative learning platform. We developed a tele-ophthalmology student elective for rising third-year (MS3) and fourth-year (MS4) medical students to continue teaching and exposure to the field. Methods A 4-week remote elective was approved by Emory University School of Medicine and offered between April 18, 2020 to May 15, 2020 for rising MS3 and MS4 students. The curriculum consisted of online self-study materials, student presentations, chart review assignments, case-based discussions with faculty, and telehealth experiences. All students were surveyed and tested with questions from USMLE World (UWorld) test bank at the end of the course. Results A total of 18 students enrolled, with 66.7% MS3 and 33.3% MS4 participance. The mean rating of fulfillment of course learning objectives was 8.1/10 (range, 6.7-8.8), with mean ratings of 8.2 for MS3s and 7.7 for MS4s. There was a significant increase in self-reported knowledge in ophthalmology, with an increase from 4.6 to 8.1 for MS3s (p=0.002) and 6.7 to 8.0 for MS4s (p=0.04). Students also reported higher interest in the field, with an increase from 4.9 to 7.8 for MS3s (p=0.01) and 7.5 to 8.7 for MS4s (p=0.1). The students performed significantly higher on the post-course test (94.8%) than UWorld question bank users (74.1%) (p<0.001). Conclusion Our novel ophthalmology elective significantly enhanced self-reported medical student knowledge and interest in the field during a crisis that required transition to remote learning. Further study of student telehealth experience and objective assessment is needed to improve online learning in ophthalmology.","output":"Ophthalmology Education in COVID-19: A Remote Elective for Medical Students."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is a vulnerable period of growth and enrichment along with many physiological and psychological challenges. These changes can lead to complications if compounded by external stress and anxiety. COVID-19 has emerged as a chief stressor among the general population and is a serious threat among vulnerable populations. Therefore, there is a need for stress management tools, such as Yoga and physical exercises, both at home and at work. These can be adopted during the pandemic with proper maintenance of social distancing. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compile literature that has reported the health outcomes of Yoga intervention on pregnancy at the workplace and analyzes both the restrictions as well as advantages of its beneficial effects in comparison to physical exercises. METHODOLOGY: A comprehensive literature review was conducted utilizing PubMed and Google Scholar. The keywords used for the search include \\"Yoga\\", \\"work\\", \\"complications\\", \\"physical exercise\\", \\"drugs\\" and \\"COVID\\" indifferent permutations and combinations with \\"pregnancy\\". We compiled the literature with respect to pregnancy complications and the effects of drugs, physical activity and Yoga for preventing these complications. RESULTS: We noted that pregnancy-related complications are becoming more prevalent because of a sedentary lifestyle, restricted physical activity and growing stress. In such situations, a home or workplace Yoga protocol can combine both exercise and mindfulness-based alleviation of anxiety for both working and non-working women. CONCLUSION: Yoga can be effective for combating stress and anxiety besides boosting immunity in pregnant working women confronted with the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Potential benefits of Yoga in pregnancy-related complications during the COVID-19 pandemic and implications for working women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To reduce the overall exposure to dexamethasone (DEX) in patients receiving cisplatin\\\\based chemotherapy, we evaluated the noninferiority of DEX on day 1, with or without low\\\\dose DEX on days 2 and 3, combined with an oral fixed\\\\dose combination of netupitant and palonosetron (NEPA), compared with the guideline\\\\consistent use of 4\\\\day DEX. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open\\\\label, multicenter study, chemotherapy\\\\na?ve patients undergoing high\\\\dose cisplatin (70 mg/m(2)), were given NEPA and DEX (12 mg) on day 1 and randomized (1:1:1 ratio) to receive either (a) no further DEX (DEX1), (b) oral DEX (4 mg daily) on days 2C3 (DEX3), or (c) DEX (4 mg twice daily) on days 2C4 (DEX4). The primary efficacy endpoint was complete response (CR: no emesis and no rescue medication) during the 5\\\\day overall phase. The noninferiority margin was set at ?15% difference (DEX1 or DEX3 minus DEX4). Secondary efficacy endpoints included complete protection (CP: CR and none or mild nausea). RESULTS: Two\\\\hundred twenty\\\\eight patients, 76 in each arm, were assessable. Noninferiority was met for both DEX\\\\sparing regimens and the reference arm, with overall phase CR rates of 76.3% in each of the DEX1 and DEX3 arms and 75.0% in the DEX4 arm (95% confidence interval, ?12.3% to 15% for each comparison). During the overall phase, CP rates were similar between groups. CONCLUSION: A simplified regimen of NEPA plus single\\\\dose DEX offers comparable chemotherapy\\\\induced nausea and vomiting prevention throughout 5 days post\\\\chemotherapy with the advantage of sparing patients additional doses of DEX in the highCemetic\\\\risk setting of cisplatin\\\\based chemotherapy. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Dexamethasone (DEX) has traditionally played an integral role in the management of chemotherapy\\\\induced emesis. Although generally considered safe, even short\\\\term DEX use is associated with various side effects, and some evidence suggests that concurrent steroids may reduce the efficacy of immunotherapies. This study demonstrates comparable antiemetic control during the 5 days post\\\\chemotherapy with a simplified regimen of netupitant/palonosetron plus single\\\\dose DEX versus the standard 4\\\\day DEX reference treatment in high\\\\dose cisplatin. This represents a clinically relevant achievement as it not only simplifies antiemetic prophylaxis but also offers an opportunity to appropriately use in patients where caution with corticosteroid use is advised.","output":"Dexamethasone\\\\Sparing Regimens with Oral Netupitant and Palonosetron for the Prevention of Emesis Caused by High\\\\Dose Cisplatin: A Randomized Noninferiority Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In &lt;20 years, we have witnessed three different epidemics with coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 in human populations, causing widespread mortality SARS-CoV-2, through its rapid global spread, has led to the pandemic that we call COVID-19 As of February 1, 2021, the global infections linked to SARS-CoV-2 stand at 103,503,340, with 2,236,960 deaths, and 75,108,099 recoveries This review attempts to highlight host-pathogen interaction with particular emphasis on the role of epigenetic machinery in regulating the disease Although researchers, since the start of the pandemic, have been intensely engaged in diverse areas to understand the mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection to find answers that can bring about innovative ways to swiftly treat and prevent disease progression, this review provides an overview on how the host epigenetics is modulated and subverted by SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells and drive immunopathogenesis Epigenetics is the study that combines genetic and non-genetic factors controlling phenotypic variation, which are primarily a consequence of external and environmental stimuli These stimuli alter the activity of a gene without impinging on the DNA code In viral-host interactions, DNA/RNA methylation, non-coding RNAs, chromatin remodeling, and histone modifications are known to regulate and modulate host gene expression patterns Viruses such as Coronaviruses (an RNA virus) show intrinsic association with these processes They have evolved the ability to tamper with host epigenetic machinery to interfere with immune sensing pathways to evade host immune response, thereby enhancing its replication and pathogenesis post-entry These epigenetic alterations allow the virus to weaken the host's immune response to successfully spread infection How this occurs, and what epigenetic mechanisms are altered is poorly understood both for coronaviruses and other respiratory RNA viruses The review highlights several cutting-edge aspects of epigenetic work primarily pertinent to SARS-CoV-2, which has been published between 2019 and 2020 to showcase the current knowledge both in terms of success and failures and take lessons that will assist us in understanding the disease to develop better treatments suited to kill SARS-CoV-2","output":"Epigenetic Lens to Visualize the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection in COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to more than 159 million confirmed cases with over 3.3 million deaths worldwide, but it remains mystery why most infected individuals (a??98%) were asymptomatic or only experienced mild illness.

The present study intends to clarify the effect of these restrictions on emergency medical service (EMS) operations. Materials and methods: Retrospective chart review of EMS operation protocols over the first 6 months of 2020 (na?= 6668 rescue missions) in four rescue stations in eastern Lower Saxony (Germany). Description and statistical comparison of operations 6 weeks before the restrictions with an equally long period after the order of the restrictions (\\"lockdown\\"). Results: During the 6 weeks after the lockdown the frequency of rescue operations decreased by 17.7%. In particular, there was a 40.6% (na?= 91) decrease of emergency cases with respiratory diseases, mainly due to a decline of pneumonia and exacerbated chronic-obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). At the same time, patients' mean age increased with fewer patients under 65 years. There were no changes in the frequency of psychiatric disorders, deceased or injured patients, or refusal of treatment and transport. A total of 67 patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (1.0%) were observed during this period. Discussion: EMS experienced a reduction of operations as a result of contact restrictions, although not as pronounced as was recently described for emergency rooms. This supports the hypothesis that the reduction is particularly evident in less severe cases and in younger patients. The reduction in pneumonia and COPD cases is striking. On the one hand, this could indicate that contact restrictions reduce the incidence of other respiratory infections and their impact on chronic respiratory disorders, but it could also mean that patients try to avoid hospital treatment.","output":"[Impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on emergency medical service operations]./ Auswirkung des COVID-19-Lockdowns auf Rettungseins?tze"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is accompanied by a dysfunctional immune-inflammatory response following lung injury, including during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Limited causal biomarkers exist for ARDS development. We sought to identify novel genetic susceptibility targets for ARDS to focus further investigation on their biological mechanism and therapeutic potential. METHODS: Meta-analyses of ARDS genome-wide association studies were performed with 1250 cases and 1583 controls in Europeans, and 387 cases and 387 controls in African Americans. The functionality of novel loci was determined in silico using multiple omics approaches. The causality of 114 factors potentially involved in ARDS development was assessed using Mendelian Randomization analysis. RESULTS: There was distinct genetic heterogeneity in ARDS between Europeans and African Americans. rs7967111 at 12p13.2 was functionally associated with ARDS susceptibility in Europeans (odds ratio = 1.38; P = 2.15  10-8). Expression of two genes annotated at this locus, BORCS5 and DUSP16, was dynamic but ultimately decreased during ARDS development, as well as downregulated in immune cells alongside COVID-19 severity. Causal inference implied that comorbidity of inflammatory bowel disease and elevated levels of C-reactive protein and interleukin-10 causally increased ARDS risk, while vitamin D supplementation and vasodilator use ameliorated risk. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a novel susceptibility locus in ARDS pathophysiology that implicates BORCS5 and DUSP16 as potentially acting in immune-inflammatory processes. This locus warrants further investigation to inform the development of therapeutic targets and clinical care strategies for ARDS, including those induced by COVID-19.","output":"Integrative omics provide biological and clinical insights into acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Given the possible coexistence of infection by the SARS-CoV-2 with other seasonal infections, the aim is to identify differential symptoms I know has studied the role of children in intrafamily contagion and the sensitivity of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in an area with low community transmission MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study Patients between 0-15 years studied by RT-PCR technique due to clinical suspicion of infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus in the months of March-May 2020 Survey on symptoms and contacts Determination of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at least 21 days after the RT-PCR test RESULTS: 126 patients were included, 33 with confirmed infection and age mean 8 4 years (95% CI 6 8-10,5) higher than not infected Fever was the most common and with greater sensitivity The differences found were a greater frequency of anosmia (P=0 029) and headache (P= 009) among children infected with a specificity of 96 7% and 81 5% respectively There were no differences in the duration of the symptoms 81 8% of those infected were probably infected in the nucleus 85 2% by a parent who worked outside the home The sensitivity of RT-PCR was 70 9% and its negative predictive value 91 1% CONCLUSIONS: The clinical picture is nonspecific and the symptoms more specific difficult to detect in younger children Children had a reduced role in the intrafamily transmission The sensitivity of RT-PCR could be related to a less contagiousness in children after one week of infection","output":"[Differential clinic in children infected by SARS-CoV-2, traceability of contacts and cost-effectiveness of diagnostic tests: Cross-sectional observational study]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To investigate the feasibility and value of three-dimensional ultrasound/contrast-enhanced ultrasound (3D US-CEUS) fusion imaging for the immediate evaluation of technical success and the guidance of supplementary ablation during the liver cancer thermal ablation procedure.

As outcome indicators, the number of COVID-19 patients,% of patients admitted to hospital,% patients admitted to intensive care units, as well as the number of deaths from COVID-19, were evaluated in seven health areas in the period March 19 to April 20, 2020. Results: The qualitative evaluation identified 2 areas for improvement (communication and risk assessment) of the 10 recommended measures. The Health Area has the lowest relative (2.6%) and absolute (16) rate of deceased patients, as well as the lowest relative (7.9%) and absolute (24) rate of patients admitted to intensive services for COVID-19. The infection rate in professionals has been 4.4%. Conclusions: The simplicity and identification of areas for improvement added to the low consumption of resources are strengths of this proposal. This self-assessment can be helpful in identifying areas for improvement.","output":"Evaluacin de los planes de contingencia en la atencin a pacientes en unidades de cuidados intensivos en la pandemia COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has spread globally, and proven treatments are limited.

We are conducting a prospective, propensity score-matched study assessing the efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion versus standard of care as treatment for severe and/or critical COVID-19. We present herein the results of an interim analysis of 316 patients enrolled at Houston Methodist hospitals from March 28 to July 6, 2020.

AIM: This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess if there were any changes in the number of patients hospitalized for respiratory diseases in Greece during the first CO-VID-19 wave. METHODS: In the present study, we evaluated respiratory disease hospitalization rates across 9 tertiary hospitals in Greece during the study period (March-April 2020) and the corresponding period of the 2 previous years (2018-2019) that served as the control periods. Demographic data and discharge diagnosis were documented for every patient. RESULTS: Of the 1,307 patients who were hospitalized during the study period, 444 (35.5%) were males with a mean (SD) age of 66.1  16.6 years. There was a 47 and 46% reduction in all-cause respiratory morbidity compared to the corresponding periods of 2018 and 2019, respectively. The mean incidence rate for respiratory diseases during the study period was 21.4 admissions per day, and this rate was significantly lower than the rate during the same period in 2018 (40.8 admissions per day; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.525; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.491-0.562; p < 0.001) or the rate during 2019 (39.9 admissions per day; IRR, 0.537; 95% CI, 0.502-0.574; p < 0.001). The greatest reductions (%) in the number of daily admissions in 2020 were observed for sleep apnoea (87% vs. 2018 and 84% vs. 2019) followed by admissions for asthma (76% vs. 2018 and 79% vs. 2019) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (60% vs. 2018 and 51% vs. 2019), while the lowest reductions were detected in hospitalizations for pulmonary embolism (6% vs. 2018 and 23% vs. 2019) followed by tuberculosis (25% vs. both 2018 and 2019). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The significant reduction in respiratory admissions in 2020 raises the reasonable question of whether some patients may have avoided seeking medical attention during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggests an urgent need for transformation of healthcare systems during the pandemic to offer appropriate management of respiratory diseases other than COVID-19.","output":"Reduction in Hospitalizations for Respiratory Diseases during the First COVID-19 Wave in Greece"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented demands on local public health units in Ontario, Canada, one of which was the need for in-house epidemiological-modelling capabilities. To address this need, Ontario Tech University and the Durham Region Health Department developed a native Windows desktop app that performs epidemiological modelling of infectious diseases. The app is an implementation of a multi-stratified compartmental epidemiological model that can accommodate multiple virus variants and levels of vaccination, as well as public health measures such as physical distancing, contact tracing followed by quarantine, and testing followed by isolation. This article presents the epidemiological model and epidemiological-simulation results obtained using the developed app. The simulations investigate the effects of different factors on COVID-19 transmission in Durham Region, including vaccination coverage, vaccine effectiveness, waning of vaccine-induced immunity, advent of the Omicron variant and effect of COVID-19 booster vaccines in reducing the number of infections and severe cases. Results indicate that, for the Delta variant, natural immunity, in addition to vaccination-induced immunity, is necessary to achieve herd immunity and that waning of vaccine-induced immunity lengthens the time necessary to reach herd immunity. In the absence of additional public health measures, a wave driven by the Omicron variant is predicted to pose significant public health challenges with infections predicted to peak in approximately two to three months, depending on the rate of administration of booster doses.","output":"Modeling COVID-19 Transmission using IDSIM, an Epidemiological-Modelling Desktop App with Multi-Level Immunization Capabilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tuberculosis (TB) has long been known as an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) defining illness in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients, causing reciprocal advantage for both pathogens throughout the course of the disease, not just constituting a burden for the patient, but also impacting public health globally.

Virtual visiting is one tool to help deal with this challenge. When introducing virtual visiting into our ICU, we identified 5 criteria for a sustainable system that aligned with patient-family-centered care: virtual visiting needed to (1) simulate open and flexible visiting; (2) be able to accommodate differences in family size, dynamics, and cultural practices; (3) utilize a video conferencing platform that is private and secure; (4) be easy to use and not require special teams to facilitate meetings; and (5) not increase the workload of ICU staff. There is a growing body of literature demonstrating a global movement toward virtual visiting in ICU, however there are no publications that describe a system which meet all 5 of our criteria. Importantly, there are no papers describing systems of virtual visiting which mimic open and flexible family presence at the bedside. We were unable to find any off-the-shelf video conferencing platforms that met all our criteria. To come up with a solution, a multidisciplinary team of ICU staff partnered with healthcare technology adoption consultants and two technology companies to develop an innovative system called HowRU. HowRU uses the video conferencing platform Webex with the integration of some newly designed software that automates many of the laborious and complex processes. HowRU is a cloud based, supported, and simplified system that closely simulates open and flexible visiting while ensuring patient and family privacy, dignity, and security. We have demonstrated the transferability of HowRU by implanting it into a second ICU. HowRU is now commercially available internationally.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective national-level data collection of patients treated with MT, ranging 45 days across epidemic containment measures instatement, and of patients treated during the same calendar period in 2019. The primary end point was the variation of patients receiving MT during the epidemic period. Secondary end points included care delays between onset, imaging, and groin puncture. To analyze the primary end point, we used a Poisson regression model. We then analyzed the correlation between the number of MTs and the number of COVID-19 cases hospitalizations, using the Pearson correlation coefficient (compared with the null value). RESULTS: A total of 1513 patients were included at 32 centers, in all French administrative regions. There was a 21% significant decrease (0.79; [95%CI, 0.76-0.82]; P<0.001) in MT case volumes during the epidemic period, and a significant increase in delays between imaging and groin puncture, overall (mean 144.9SD 86.8 minutes versus 126.270.9; P<0.001 in 2019) and in transferred patients (mean 182.6SD 82.0 minutes versus 153.2567; P<0.001). After the instatement of strict epidemic mitigation measures, there was a significant negative correlation between the number of hospitalizations for COVID and the number of MT cases (R2 -0.51; P=0.04). Patients treated during the COVID outbreak were less likely to receive intravenous thrombolysis and to have unwitnessed strokes (both P<0.05).

METHODS: A retrospective review of patients at our center was conducted to identify injuries caused by PCA in the month following the statewide closure of childcare facilities in Maryland. The proportion of PCA patients treated during the Covid-19 era were compared to the corresponding period in the preceding two years by Fishers exact test. Demographics, injury profiles, and outcomes were described for each period. RESULTS: Eight patients with PCA injuries were treated during the Covid-19 period (13 % of total trauma patients), compared to four in 2019 (4 %, p < 0.05) and three in 2018 (3 %, p < 0.05). The median age of patients in the Covid-19 period was 11.5 months (IQR 6.8C24.5). Most patients were black (75 %) with public health insurance (75 %).

The first crucial step for the physician in these procedures is the precise needle insertion into the trachea. The primary aim of this technical note was to test the new filament and share our experiences in the implementation of the new device. The secondary aim was to show how a physician with basic training in computer-aided design and three-dimensional (3D) printing could independently create useful devices for clinical practice. METHODS To simplify this referred clinical procedure and increase its safety, 3D printing and a new medical filament were used to develop a new translaryngeal Tracheostomy Needle Introducer (tTNI) for use in conjunction with the Fantoni's method of percutaneous tracheostomy. The tTNI is composed of three parts: a support to fit on the rigid endotracheal tube of the Fantoni kit, an external particular shaped arm, and an introducer for the needle. The latest version of the device used a new filament based on a polyester matrix certified for skin contact that was sterilizable in a standard autoclave. Post-printing, minor technical interventions were required to correct small material deformities. CONCLUSIONS Our experiences with the thread and the technical features of the material were reported herein in conjunction with some suggestions on how to solve the most frequently encountered problems. The 3D printing technique allows physicians to directly manage the prototyping process of new medical devices, making this process completely independent. The speed of the prototyping process and the testing of each piece allow faster creation of a prototype than with traditional industrial methods.

Our performance evaluation on a variety of graphs shows that our algorithms outperform the existing state-of-the-art heuristics using contact tracing data from the SARS-CoV 2003 and COVID-19 pandemics by correctly identifying the superspreaders on some of the largest superspreading infection clusters in Singapore and Taiwan.","output":"Epidemic Source Detection in Contact Tracing Networks: Epidemic Centrality in Graphs and Message-Passing Algorithms (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose of the Review Experiences of patients, families, healthcare workers and health systems during the COVID-19 pandemic and recent national focus on racial justice have forced a reconsideration of policies and processes of providing care in crisis situations when resources are scarce.

Recent findings Several recent papers have raised concerns that objective scarce resource allocation protocols will serve to exacerbate underlying social inequities. Older adults and their formal and informal caregivers suffered from intersecting planning failures including lack of adequate stockpiling of personal protective equipment, failure to protect essential workers, neglect of long-term care facilities and homecare in disaster planning and de-prioiritization in triage algorithms.

The requirement for monitoring airborne pathogens has gradually increased to defend against bioterrorism or prevent pandemics, especially via simple and low-cost platforms which can be applied in resource-limited settings. Here, we developed a paper-based airborne bacteria collection and DNA extraction kit suitable for simple application with minimal instruments. Airborne sample collection and DNA extraction for PCR analysis were integrated in the paper kit. We created an easy-to-use paper-based air monitoring system using 3D printing technology combined with an air pump. The operation time of the entire process, comprising air sampling, bacterial cell lysis, purification and concentration of DNA, and elution of the DNA analyte, was within 20 min. All the investigations and optimum settings were tested in a custom-designed closed cabinet system. In the fabricated cabinet system, the paper kit operated effectively at a temperature of 25C35 C and 30C70% relative humidity for air containing 10C10(6) CFU Staphylococcus aureus.

However, RCTs are costly and time-consuming to perform and long-term follow-up of participants may be hampered by lost contacts and financial constraints. Advances in computing and population-based registries have created new possibilities for increasing the value of RCTs by post-trial extension using linkage to routinely collected administrative/registry data in order to determine long-term interventional effects. There have been recent important examples, including 20+ years follow-up studies of trials of pravastatin and mammography. Despite the potential value of post-trial extension, there has been no systematic study of this literature. This scoping review aims to characterise published post-trial extension studies, assess their value, and identify any potential challenges associated with this approach. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This review will use the recommended methods for scoping reviews. We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. A draft search strategy is included in this protocol. Review of titles and abstracts, full texts of potentially eligible studies and data/information extraction will be conducted independently by pairs of investigators. Eligible studies will be RCTs that investigated healthcare interventions that were extended by individual linkage to administrative/registry/electronic medical records data after the completion of the planned follow-up period. Information concerning the original trial, characteristics of the extension study, any clinical, policy or ethical implications and methodological or practical challenges will be collected using standardised forms. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION As this study uses secondary data, and does not include person-level data, ethics approval is not required. We aim to disseminate these findings through journals and conferences targeting triallists and researchers involved in health data linkage. We aim to produce guidance for investigators on the conduct of post-trial extensions using routinely collected data.","output":"Protocol for a scoping review of post-trial extensions of randomised controlled trials using individually linked administrative and registry data."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evidence in humans suggests a correlation between nicotine smoking and severe respiratory symptoms with COVID-19 infection. In lung tissue, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) appears to mechanistically underlie viral entry. Here, we investigated whether e-cigarette vapor inhalation alters ACE2 and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) expression in male and female mice. In male lung, nicotine vapor inhalation induced a significant increase in ACE2 mRNA and protein, but surprisingly, these differences were not found in females. Further, both vehicle and nicotine vapor inhalation downregulated 5 nAChR subunits in both sexes, while differences were not found in 7 nAChR subunit expression. Finally, blood ACE2 levels did not differ with exposure, indicating that blood sampling is not a sufficient indicator of lung ACE2 changes. Together, these data indicate a direct link between e-cigarette vaping and increased ACE2 expression in male lung tissue, which thereby reveals an underlying mechanism of increased vulnerability to coronavirus infection in individuals vaping nicotine.","output":"E-cigarette vape and lung ACE2 expression: Implications for coronavirus vulnerability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qom, Iran, almost 19 months ago, the transmission dynamics across the country and the health burden of COVID-19 has remained largely unknown due to the scarcity of epidemiological analyses and lack of provincial data on the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. For the first time, we reconstruct the epidemic trajectory across the country and assess the level of under-reporting in infections and deaths using province-level age-stratified weekly all-cause mortality data. Our estimates suggest that as of 2021-09-17, only 48% (95% confidence interval 43-55%) of COVID-19 deaths in Iran have been reported. We find that in the most affected provinces such as Qazvin, Qom, and East Azerbaijan approximately 0.4% of the population have died of COVID-19 so far. We also find significant heterogeneity in the estimated attack rates across the country with 11 provinces reaching close to or higher than 100% attack rates. Despite a relatively young age structure in Iran, our analysis reveals that the infection fatality rate gradually increased over time in several provinces and reached levels that are comparable some of the high-income countries with a larger percentage of older adults, suggesting that limited access to medical services, coupled with undercounting of COVID-19-related deaths, can have a significant impact on COVID-19 fatalities.

From healthcare decision-making to social media censoring, these agents face problems, and make decisions with ethical and societal implications. Ethical behaviour is a critical characteristic that we would like in a human-centric AI. A common observation in human-centric industries, like the service industry and healthcare, is that their professionals tend to break rules, if necessary, for pro-social reasons. This behaviour among humans is defined as pro-social rule breaking. To make AI agents more human-centric, we argue that there is a need for a mechanism that helps AI agents identify when to break rules set by their designers. To understand when AI agents need to break rules, we examine the conditions under which humans break rules for pro-social reasons. In this paper, we present a study that introduces a vaccination strategy dilemma to human participants and analyzes their response. In this dilemma, one needs to decide whether they would distribute COVID-19 vaccines only to members of a high-risk group (follow the enforced rule) or, in selected cases, administer the vaccine to a few social influencers (break the rule), which might yield an overall greater benefit to society. The results of the empirical study suggest a relationship between stakeholder utilities and pro-social rule breaking (PSRB), which neither deontological nor utilitarian ethics completely explain. Finally, the paper discusses the design characteristics of an ethical agent capable of PSRB and the future research directions on PSRB in the AI realm. We hope that this will inform the design of future AI agents, and their decision-making behaviour.","output":"Immune moral models?

A questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data on participant demographics, lifestyle, health status, and depression, and sleep activity monitors were used to objectively measure sleep status and sleep efficacy. Of the 167 respondents, the 59 being treated for hypertension were divided into two groups based on their participation in volunteering. Comparison between the groups showed significant differences in nocturnal awakening, sleep efficiency, and nap frequency. Volunteers had less nocturnal awakening, increased sleep efficiency, fewer naps, and decreased depression. Covariance structure analysis of the survey data and sleep measurements for hypertensive older adults in the volunteer group was performed by modeling the relationships between variables with a path diagram.

RESULTS: We identified 11 122 SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction-positive cases of whom 80% were community-managed and 20% were hospitalized. Thirty-day all-cause mortality was 5.2%. Age was strongly associated with fatal disease {odds ratio [OR] 15 [95% confidence interval (CI): 9-26] for 70-79 years, increasing to OR 90 (95% CI: 50-162) for &#8805;90 years, when compared with cases aged 50-59 years and adjusted for sex and number of co-morbidities}. Similarly, the number of co-morbidities was associated with fatal disease [OR 5.2 (95% CI: 3.4-8.0), for cases with at least four co-morbidities vs no co-morbidities] and 79% of fatal cases had at least two co-morbidities.

Mass testing of unvaccinated individuals followed by isolation of positive cases can substantially mitigate risks and be tailored to local epidemiological conditions to ensure cost effectiveness. METHODS: Using a multi-scale model that incorporates population-level SARS-CoV-2 transmission and individual-level viral load kinetics, we identify the optimal frequency of proactive SARS-CoV-2 testing, depending on the local transmission rate and proportion immunized. FINDINGS: Assuming a willingness-to-pay of US$100,000 per averted year of life lost (YLL) and a price of $10 per test, the optimal strategy under a rapid transmission scenario (R(e)  2.5) is daily testing until one third of the population is immunized and then weekly testing until half the population is immunized, combined with a 10-day isolation period of positive cases and their households. Under a low transmission scenario (R(e)  1.2), the optimal sequence is weekly testing until the population reaches 10% partial immunity, followed by monthly testing until 20% partial immunity, and no testing thereafter.

Computational approaches for modeling toxicological data in conjunction with machine learning algorithms have gained popularity over the last few years. Machine learning approaches have been used to predict toxicity-related biological activities using chemical structure descriptors. However, toxicity-related proteomic features have not been fully investigated. In this study, we construct a computational pipeline using machine learning models for predicting the most important protein features responsible for the toxicity of compounds taken from the Tox21 dataset that is implemented within the multiscale Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities (CANDO) therapeutic discovery platform. Tox21 is a highly imbalanced dataset consisting of twelve in vitro assays, seven from the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway and five from the stress response (SR) pathway, for more than 10,000 compounds. For the machine learning model, we employed a random forest with the combination of Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Edited Nearest Neighbor (ENN) method (SMOTE+ENN), which is a resampling method to balance the activity class distribution. Within the NR and SR pathways, the activity of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (NR-AhR), and mitochondrial membrane potential (SR-MMP) were two of the top-performing twelve toxicity endpoints with AUCROCs of 0.90 and 0.92, respectively. The top extracted features for evaluating compound toxicity were analyzed for enrichment to highlight the implicated biological pathways and proteins. We validated our enrichment results for the activity of the AhR using a thorough literature search. Our case study showed that the selected enriched pathways and proteins from our computational pipeline are not only correlated with AhR toxicity but also form a cascading upstream/downstream arrangement. Our work elucidate significant relationships between protein and compound interactions computed using CANDO and the associated biological pathways to which the proteins belong for twelve toxicity endpoints. This novel study uses machine learning not only to predict and understand toxicity but also elucidates therapeutic mechanisms at a proteomic level for a variety of toxicity endpoints.","output":"Identifying protein features and pathways responsible for toxicity using machine learning and Tox21: Implications for predictive toxicology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scientific collaboration has been a critical aspect of the development of all fields of science, particularly clinical medicine.

Clinician-identified factors in follow-up of abnormal FIT results are understudied and could lead to more effective interventions to address this issue. OBJECTIVE: To describe clinician-identified barriers and facilitators to colonoscopy completion among patients with abnormal FIT results in a safety net health care system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study was conducted using semistructured key informant interviews with primary care physicians (PCPs) and staff members in a large safety net health care system in Washington state. Eligible clinicians were recruited through all-staff meetings and clinic medical directors. Interviews were conducted from February to December 2020 through face-to-face interactions or digital meeting platforms. Interview transcripts were analyzed deductively and inductively using a content analysis approach. Data were analyzed from September through December 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Barriers and facilitators to colonoscopy completion after an abnormal FIT result were identified by PCPs and staff members. RESULTS: Among 21 participants, there were 10 PCPs and 11 staff members; 20 participants provided demographic information. The median (interquartile range) age was 38.5 (33.0-51.5) years, 17 (85.0%) were women, and 9 participants (45.0%) spent more than 75% of their working time engaging in patient care. All participants identified social determinants of health, organizational factors, and patient cognitive factors as barriers to colonoscopy completion. Participants suggested that existing resources that addressed these factors facilitated colonoscopy completion but were insufficient to meet national follow-up colonoscopy goals. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this qualitative study, responses of interviewed PCPs and staff members suggested that the barriers to colonoscopy completion in a safety net health system may be modifiable.

However, in sub-Saharan Africa, a low prevalence and mortality have been observed so far. METHODS: We collected data on individuals' social contacts in the South West Shewa Zone (SWSZ) of Ethiopia across geographical contexts characterized by heterogeneous population density, work and travel opportunities, and access to primary care. We assessed how socio-demographic factors and observed mixing patterns can influence the COVID-19 disease burden, by simulating SARS-CoV-2 transmission in remote settlements, rural villages, and urban neighborhoods, under school closure mandate. RESULTS: From national surveillance data, we estimated a net reproduction number of 1.62 (95% CI 1.55-1.70). We found that, at the end of an epidemic mitigated by school closure alone, 10-15% of the population residing in the SWSZ would have been symptomatic and 0.3-0.4% of the population would require mechanical ventilation and/or possibly result in a fatal outcome. Higher infection attack rates are expected in more urbanized areas, but the highest incidence of critical disease is expected in remote subsistence farming settlements. School closure contributed to reduce the reproduction number by 49% and the attack rate of infections by 28-34%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the relatively low burden of COVID-19 in Ethiopia observed so far may depend on social mixing patterns, underlying demography, and the enacted school closures. Our findings highlight that socio-demographic factors can also determine marked heterogeneities across different geographical contexts within the same region, and they contribute to understand why sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing a relatively lower attack rate of severe cases compared to high-income countries.","output":"Modeling the interplay between demography, social contact patterns, and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the South West Shewa Zone of Oromia Region, Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It was back in 2005 that the first IEEE Spectrum Awards were presented to Nesscap Co., a South Korean maker of ultracapacitors, and to Microsoft TV, for Internet Protocol television.

The epidemic of central China was under the spotlight and attracted much more attentions. However, there are few reports describing COVID-19 patients in the regions outside of Wuhan, which are undergoing the change from sporadic imported cases to community-acquired transmission. Methods: : The electronic medical records of 74 laboratory-confirmed patients of COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Their epidemiological, demographic, clinical and radiological characteristics were systematically summarized. The difference between severe patients and non-severe patients were also analyzed statistically. Results: : The 74 COVID-19 patients were composed of 4 (5.4%) mild patients, 56 (75.7%) common patients, 13 (17.6%) severe patients and 1 (1.4%) critical patient. 43 were male, and 31 were female, with the average age 48.117.5. No significant difference of susceptibility was observed between genders, and almost people with all age were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Before Jan 26, only imported sporadic cases were observed. However, from that day onward, family cluster infection cases increased dramatically, up to 70.3% (52/74), which were mainly from 15 family. The incubation period spanned from 0 to 19 days, with the median 5, and 81.4% had symptom onset within 7 days. At admission, 31.1% of patients had underlying diseases and the most common underlying diseases were hypertension (13.5%) and diabetes (5.4%). The most common symptoms were fever (90.5%), cough (75.7%), fatigue (36.5%) and chest distress (32.4%). 36.5% and 16.2% of patients had leukopenia and lymphocytopenia. 43.2% of patients had increased C reactive protein (CRP), and 40.5% had higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and 21.6% had higher calcitonin. 74.3% of patients had obvious lesions in both lung lobes and 56.8% of lesions manifested as ground glass opacity. Compared with non-severe group, the severe/critical group were significantly older and had more underlying diseases. After treatment, all patients improved and were discharged.

In this study, we show that linguistic and acoustic features can be combined synergistically to identify MCI in semi-structured conversations. Using conversational data from an on-going clinical trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02871921), we find that the combination of linguistic and acoustic features on semi-structured conversations achieves a mean AUC of 82.7, significantly (p < 0.01) out-performing linguistic-only (74.9 mean AUC) or acoustic-only (65.0 mean AUC) detections on hold-out data.

The heavily glycosylated S protein includes both complex and high-mannose type N-glycans that are well exposed at the surface of the spikes. A detailed analysis of the carbohydrate-binding specificity of mannose-binding lectins from plants, algae, fungi, and bacteria, revealed that, depending on their origin, they preferentially recognize either complex type N-glycans, or high-mannose type N-glycans. Since both complex and high-mannose glycans substantially decorate the S proteins, mannose-specific lectins are potentially useful glycan probes for targeting the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 virions. Mannose-binding legume lectins, like pea lectin, and monocot mannose-binding lectins, like snowdrop lectin or the algal lectin griffithsin, which specifically recognize complex N-glycans and high-mannose glycans, respectively, are particularly adapted for targeting coronaviruses.

Nigeria and much of the rest of the world blindly adopted treatments like chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine and various prevention strategies, often without monitoring the efficacy of these treatment and social control strategies. COVID-19 provided Nigeria a critical opportunity to create or strengthen its national laboratory system by building up its Level 3 laboratories in all parts of the country with the capability to perform PCR tests and viral isolation. There was also an opportunity to establish hospitals in every region of a sufficient standard to reduce the numbers of Nigerians travelling abroad to seek medical treatment; to invest in building capacity to develop antiviral medications and vaccines in Nigeria, and to ensure better international health policies. Rather, Nigerian leaders, government, and health managers decided (like most other nations of the world) to shut down society using isolationist policies that were not necessarily tailored to local needs.

In this work we develop a simple yet powerful framework, whose key idea is to select a subset of training examples from the unlabeled data when performing existing SSL methods so that only the unlabeled examples with pseudo labels related to the labeled data will be used to train models. The selection is performed at each updating iteration by only keeping the examples whose losses are smaller than a given threshold that is dynamically adjusted through the iteration.

Methods: The differences between NET and e-NET are elaborated and depicted in detail. Results: Difficulties encountered in e-NET delivery, e.g. confidentiality, dealing with interruptions, comorbid symptoms among others, are similar to those that occur during face to face interventions but the solutions have to be adapted. Dissociation is often regarded as a challenge in face-to-face treatment, and requires particular attention within the online setting. Therefore, tools for addressing dissociation in this particular setting are presented.

METHODS: In this study, patients with a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) result were considered eligible for enrollment. Histopathological examinations were done on 13 people who were hospitalized in Afzalipour hospital, Kerman, Iran. Clinical and laboratory data were reviewed. Tissue examination was done by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. RESULTS: The most frequent co-morbidity in the patients was cardiovascular disease. The common initial symptoms of COVID-19 infection were dyspnea and cough. In all cases, the number of white blood cells was higher than the normal range. Common histopathological findings were variable degrees of vasculitis as degenerative to necrotic changes of endothelium and trafficking of inflammatory cells in the vessel wall with fibrinoid necrosis. Tissue damage included interstitial acute inflammatory cells reaction with degenerative to necrotic changes of the parenchymal cells. CD34 and Factor VIII immunohistochemistry staining showed endothelial cell degeneration to necrosis at the vessel wall and infiltration by inflammatory cells. Electron microscopic features confirmed the degenerative damages in the endothelial cells. CONCLUSION: Our histopathological studies suggest that the main focus of the viral damage is the endothelial cells (endotheliopathica) in involved organs.

METHODS: A 56-question survey regarding the oncological surgical activity in Italy during the COVID-19 emergency was sent to referral centers for hepato-bilio-pancreatic, colorectal, esophago-gastric, and sarcoma/soft-tissue tumors. The survey portrays the situation 5 weeks after the first case of secondary transmission in Italy. RESULTS: In total, 54 surgical Units in 36 Hospitals completed the survey (95%). After COVID-19 emergency, 70% of Units had reduction of hospital beds (median -50%) and 76% of surgical activity (median -50%). The number of surgical procedures decreased: 3.8 (interquartile range 2.7-5.4) per week before the emergency versus 2.6 (22-4.4) after (P = 0.036). In Lombardy, the most involved district, the number decreased from 3.9 to 2 procedures per week. The time interval between multidisciplinary discussion and surgery more than doubled: 7 (6-10) versus 3 (3-4) weeks (P &lt; 0.001). Two-third (n = 34) of departments had repeat multidisciplinary discussion of patients. The commonest criteria to prioritize surgery were tumor biology (80%), time interval from neoadjuvant therapy (61%), risk of becoming unresectable (57%), and tumor-related symptoms (52%). Oncological hub-and-spoke program was planned in 29 departments, but was active only in 10 (19%).

Unhealthy behaviour in young people is generally more common in low socioeconomic groups. Nevertheless, all adolescents should have a fair opportunity to attain their full health potential. Health literacy is positioned as a potential mediating factor to improve health, but research regarding health literacy in adolescents and socially disadvantaged populations is limited. As part of Phase one of the Ophelia (OPtimising HEalth LIterAcy) framework, The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions of socially disadvantaged Irish adolescents in relation to health literacy and related behaviours, and utilise this data to develop relevant vignettes. METHODS: A convergent mixed method design was used to co-create the vignettes. Questionnaires were completed by 962 adolescents (males n = 553, females n = 409, Mean age = 13.97  0.96 years) from five participating disadvantaged schools in Leinster, Ireland. Focus groups were also conducted in each school (n = 31). Results were synthesised using cluster and thematic analysis, to develop nine vignettes that represented typical male and female subgroups across the schools with varying health literacy profiles. These vignettes were then validated through triangular consensus with students, teachers, and researchers. DISCUSSION: The co-creation process was a participatory methodology which promoted the engagement and autonomy of the young people involved in the project. The vignettes themselves provide an authentic and tangible description of the health issues and health literacy profiles of adolescents in this context. Application of these vignettes in workshops involving students and teachers, will enable meaningful engagement in the discussion of health literacy and health-related behaviours in Irish young people, and the potential co-designing of strategies to address health literacy in youth. CONCLUSION: As guided by the Ophelia framework, the use of authentic, interactive and participatory research methods, such as the co-creation of vignettes, is particularly important in groups that are underserved by traditional research methods. The approach used in this study could be adapted to other contexts to represent and understand stakeholders perceptions of health, with a view to explore, and ultimately improve, health literacy.

It is crucial to understand building airtightness during construction and retrofitting to achieve a suitable envelope airtightness which is essential for obtaining a desirable building energy efficiency, durability and indoor environment. As a convenient means of measurement, the current steady pressurisation method has long been accepted as a standard testing method for measuring building airtightness. It offers an intuitive and robust approach for measuring building airtightness and performing building diagnostics. However, it also has some shortcomings that are mainly related to its high pressure measurement, requirement for skilful operation, long test duration and change to the building envelope. Efforts have been made by manufacturers and researchers to further improve its accuracy and practicality with much progress achieved. Work has also been done to develop alternative methods that can overcome some of the issues. This paper provides a practical review on the incumbent methodology and efforts that have been made over the past decades in research and development of other methods to achieve a similar purpose. It compares them in relation to aspects that are considered important in achieving an accurate, quick and practical measurement of building airtightness and the finding shows other methods such as acoustic and unsteady technique have their own advantages over the steady pressurisation method but also add some of their own restrictions, which therefore makes them suited for different applications.","output":"A practical review of alternatives to the steady pressurisation method for determining building airtightness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To compare presenteeism levels among three samples of nurses and to identify the relationship between presenteeism and sociodemographic and professional characteristics. BACKGROUND: Presenteeism (going to work ill) is a phenomenon studied from different perspectives, and it has become especially important during the current COVID-19 outbreak; its connection to high healthcare costs, patient safety breaches and negative nurse well-being has been proved. INTRODUCTION: The nursing profession is particularly associated with caring for the culture of teamwork, loyalty to colleagues and professional identity. This condition enhances the 'super nurse phenomenon', even though nurses do not feel physically and psychologically able to work. METHODS: A multicentre, cross-sectional study was conducted in three different country contexts: Oviedo (Spain), Porto (Portugal) and S?o Paulo (Brazil). Nurses performing functions in hospitals and primary health care were enrolled. Informed consent and data collection questionnaires were hand delivered. The Stanford Presenteeism Scale-6 was applied. RESULTS: A total of 659 nurses participated. Portuguese nurses showed greater prevalence of presenteeism, followed by Brazilian and Spanish nurses. Younger nurses with less professional experience presented lower levels of presenteeism but greater psychological commitment. Male participants showed lower capacity to complete work when ill than female participants. CONCLUSIONS: Age and length of professional experience proved to be significant predictors of total presenteeism, although only professional experience revealed statistical significance in the adjusted model. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: The knowledge of this phenomenon among nurses highlights the need for the development of strategies in the curriculum of nursing students and organizations. Resilience and ergonomic training should be applied in the training programmes of the students and reinforced by the health centre managers. It is essential that healthcare systems design worksite wellness programmes that pursue greater physical and mental well-being for healthcare professionals.","output":"Presenteeism in nurses: comparative study of Spanish, Portuguese and Brazilian nurses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This corrects the article on p. e65 in vol. 31, PMID: 32342678.","output":"Erratum: Author Correction.

The primary site of infection is in the respiratory tract but the virus has been associated with a variety of complications involving the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems. Since the virus affects a variety of tissue types, there has been interest in understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection in early development and the placenta. ACE2 and TMPRSS2, two genes that are critical for SARS-CoV-2 virus entry are expressed in placenta-specific cell types including extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) and especially, syncytiotrophoblasts (STs). The potential of SARS-CoV-2 to infect these placental cells and its effect on placental development and function is still unclear. Furthermore, it is crucial to understand the possible mechanism of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the placenta. Here, we developed an in vitro model of SARS-CoV-2 infection of placental cell types using induced trophoblast stem cells (iTSCs). This model allowed us to show that STs but not EVTs are infected. Importantly, infected STs lack the expression of key differentiation genes, lack typically observed differentiated morphology and produce significantly lower human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) compared to non-infected controls. We also show that an anti-ACE2 antibody prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection and restores normal ST differentiation and function. We highlight the establishment of a platform to study SARS-CoV-2 infection in early placental cell types, which will facilitate investigation of antiviral therapy to protect the placenta during early pregnancy and development.","output":"An iTSC-derived placental model of SARS-CoV-2 infection unveils ACE2-dependent susceptibility in syncytiotrophoblasts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new president will put his stamp on the Affordable Care Act as the Supreme Court seems unlikely to invalidate the entire law.","output":"The Election; The ACA At The Supreme Court"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibacterial prescribing in patients presenting with COVID-19 remains discordant to rates of bacterial co-infection. Implementing diagnostic tests to exclude bacterial infection may aid reduction in antibacterial prescribing. (1) Method: A retrospective observational analysis was undertaken of all hospitalised patients with COVID-19 across a single-site NHS acute Trust (London, UK) from 1 December 2020 to 28 February 2021. Electronic patient records were used to identify patients, clinical data, and outcomes. Procalcitonin (PCT) serum assays, where available on admission, were analysed against electronic prescribing records for antibacterial prescribing to determine relationships with a negative PCT result (<25 mg/L) and antibacterial course length. (2) Results: Antibacterial agents were initiated on admission in 310/624 (49.7%) of patients presenting with COVID-19. A total of 33/74 (44.5%) patients with a negative PCT on admission had their treatment stopped within 24 h. A total of 6/49 (12.2%) patients were started on antibacterials, but a positive PCT saw their treatment stopped. Microbiologically confirmed bacterial infection was low (19/594; 3.2%) and no correlation was seen between PCT and culture positivity (p = 1). Lower mortality (15.6% vs. 31.4%; p = 0.049), length of hospital stay (7.9 days vs. 10.1 days; p = 0.044), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (13.9% vs. 40.8%; p = 0.001) was noted among patients with low PCT.

METHODS: Ten thousand eight hundred fifty-six adult patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in 13 hospitals in New York (1 March to 27 April 2020) were analyzed retrospectively. Abnormalities of liver chemistries [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin] were defined as absent, mild-moderate (at least one value up to four times elevated), or severe. RESULTS: LCA were mild-moderate in 63.9% and severe in 7.6% at admission. Risk factors for severe LCA were male sex and chronic liver disease. Conversely, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were less likely associated with severe LCA. AST elevation correlated weakly to modestly with inflammatory markers. On adjusted analysis, in-hospital mortality was 1.56 times and 1.87 times increased in patients with mild-to-moderate and severe LCA, respectively. Diabetes, hypertension, male sex, and age greater than 60 years was associated with incremental risk of mortality with increase severity of LCA, especially in the first week of hospitalization. HTN was not associated with increased in-hospital mortality unless LCA was present. CONCLUSION: Increasing severity of LCA on hospital admission predicts early in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients.

This requires the pervasive and ubiquitous connectivity encompassed by the Industrial Internet of Things, typically achieved via wireless systems. As an example, wireless communications are today fundamental to open up to new categories of autonomous devices that can actively collaborate with human personnel in the production process.

Pilot studies found HPV self-sampling was acceptable and effective, with high follow-up rates when a digital registry was used, and recently the Malaysian Government announced plans for a national HPV-based screening program. We therefore evaluated the impact of primary HPV screening with self-collection in Malaysia in the context of Malaysia's existing vaccination program. We used the \\"Policy1-Cervix\\" modelling platform to assess health outcomes, cost-effectiveness, resource use and cervical cancer elimination timing (the year when cervical cancer rates reach 4 cases per 100 000 women) of self-collected HPV testing. Based on available data, we assumed a digital registry could increase compliance with follow-up from 50-75% to 90%. We found that the current vaccination program would prevent 27 000-32 200 cervical cancer cases and 11 700-14 000 deaths by 2070. HPV testing with a digital registry was cost-effective (CER = $US6,953-7549 < $US11,373[<1xGDP per-capita]) and could prevent an additional 15 900-17 800 cases and 9700-10 600 deaths by 2070, expediting national elimination by 11-20 years, to 2055-2059.

Method A questionnaire was designed to find out whether patients and healthcare workers had COVID-19, confirmed either by a test or only compatible symptoms, after functional studies were performed from January until March 2020. Results 263 (92.9%) patients answered the survey. In the two weeks after functional test, four (1.52%) patients had confirmed COVID-19 (adjusted rate 8.34 cases per 1,000 (95% CI -0.06-16.74), OR 0.84 (95% CI: 0.83-0.85), p<0.001), no one after anorectal manometry.

It was hypothesized that the exposure to the COVID-19 increased distress directly and through the mediation of worry, health-related information seeking, and perception of the utility of the lockdown. It was also expected that higher levels of ambiguity intolerance corresponded to higher distress directly and through the mediation of worry, health information seeking behaviors, and perceived utility of the lockdown. Finally, it was expected that risk aversion positively influenced distress directly and through the increasing of worry, health-related information seeking behavior, and more positive perception of the utility of the lockdown The study was conducted in Italy during the mandatory lockdown for COVID-19 pandemic on 240 individuals (age range 18C76). Data recruitment was conducted via snowball sampling. COVID-19 exposure was positively associated with worry and health-related information seeking. Risk-aversion was positively associated with health-related information seeking and perceived utility of the lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. Worry and health-related information seeking were positively associated with distress, whereas the perceived utility of the lockdown was negatively associated with distress. Intolerance for the ambiguity was directly linked to distress with a positive sign.

Since then, a new quality movement has emerged, with the development of numerous interventions aimed at improving quality, with a focus on accessibility, safety and effectiveness of care. Further gains in equity and timeliness have proven even more challenging. The challenge: With the emergence of service-oriented systems, complexity science, the challenges of climate change, the growth of social media and the internet and the new reality of COVID-19, the original domains proposed by the IOM invite reflection on their relevance and possibility for improvement. The possible solution: In this paper we propose a revised model of quality that is built on never-ending learning and includes new domains, such as Ecology and Transparency, which reflect the changing worldview of healthcare. We also introduce the concept of person- or kin-centred care to emphasise the shared humanity of people involved in the interdependent work. This is a more expansive view of what person-centredness began. The delivery of health and healthcare requires people working in differing roles, with explicit attention to the lived realities of the people in the roles of professional and patient.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the hypothetic efficacy of combining liquid embolic agents with different properties and viscosities for use in endovascular embolization of cerebral AVMs. MATERIALS AND METHODS From March 2018 to March 2019, sixteen patients with cerebral AVMs (12 women, 4 men; age range, 33-61 years) underwent endovascular embolization with combined liquid embolic agents delivered serially via a single microcatheter. The procedure consists of initial embolization with PHIL 30%, followed by Menox 18 through the same microcatheter. According to the Spetzler-Martin scale, 11 (68.75%) AVMs were grades I-II, 4 (25%) were grade III, and 1 (6.25%) was grade IV. Angiographic, technical, and clinical outcomes were analyzed independently. RESULTS Combined PHIL and Menox embolization through the same microcatheter via 21 pedicles was performed in these 16 patients. Once the length of the reflux reached approximately 2 cm, PHIL 30% was switched to Menox 18. Antegrade flow and distal penetration of the serially applied liquid embolic agents were observed in all 16 cases. The ability to completely control the flow of the materials and avoid any dangerous proximal reflux was noted in all performed embolizations. The estimated average size reduction of the treated AVMs was 85%, ranging from 50% to 100%. Complete embolization was achieved in 10/16 or 62.5% of the cases. There was no procedure-related complication during or after the embolization. No mortality or postprocedural clinical worsening was seen. Clinical success and complete obliteration were confirmed with at least 1 follow-up angiography in 10/16 patients. CONCLUSIONS Serial delivery of nonadhesive liquid embolic agents via the same microcatheter was safe and effective in our study and may be a potential technique for routine AVM treatment.

Various methods for detecting HMPV have been developed and applied in clinical laboratories. When reviewing the literature, we found that polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays have been most frequently and consistently used to detect HMPV. The most commonly used method was multiplex reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR; 57.4%), followed by real-time RT-PCR (38.3%). Multiplex RT-PCR became the more popular method in 2011-2019 (69.7%), in contrast to 2001-2009 (28.6%). The advent of multiplex PCR in detecting broader viral pathogens in one run and coinfected viruses influenced the change in user preference. Further, newly developed microarray technologies and ionization mass spectrometry were introduced in 2011-2019. Viral culture (including shell vial assays) and fluorescent immunoassays (with or without culture) were once the mainstays. However, the percentage of studies employing culture and fluorescent immunoassays decreased from 21.4% in 2001-2010 to 15.2% in 2011-2019. Meanwhile, the use of PCR-based methods of HMPV detection increased from 78.6% in 2001-2010 to 84.8% in 2011-2019. The increase in PCR-based methods might have occurred because PCR methods demonstrated better diagnostic performance, shorter hands-on and run times, less hazards to laboratory personnel, and more reliable results than traditional methods. When using these assays, it is important to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the principles, advantages, disadvantages, and precautions for data interpretation.

Here we generated an interactome profile of protein-protein interactions based on host and viral protein structural similarities information. Further computational biological study combined with Gene enrichment analysis predicted key enriched pathways associated with viral pathogenesis. The results show that axon guidance, membrane trafficking, vesicle-mediated transport, apoptosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, Vpu mediated degradation of CD4 T cell, and interferon-gamma signaling are key events associated in SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Further, degree centrality analysis reveals that IRF1/9/7, TP53, and CASP3, UBA52, and UBC are vital proteins for IFN--mediated signaling, apoptosis, and proteasomal degradation of CD4, respectively. We crafted chronological events of the virus life cycle. The SARS-CoV-2 enters through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and the genome is trafficked to the early endosomes in a RAB5-dependent manner. It is predicted to replicate in a double-membrane vesicle (DMV) composed of the endoplasmic reticulum, autophagosome, and ERAD machinery. The SARS-CoV-2 down-regulates host translational machinery by interacting with protein kinase R, PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, and heme-regulated inhibitor and can phosphorylate eIF2a.

Here, we studied the structure of the 2H family member LigT from Escherichia coli both in the apo form and complexed with different active-site ligands, including ATP, 2-AMP, 3-AMP, phosphate, and NADP(+). Comparisons to the well-characterized vertebrate myelin enzyme 2,3-cyclic nucleotide 3-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) highlight specific features of the catalytic cycle and substrate recognition in both enzymes.

METHODS: We performed a scoping review, adding five additional questions concerning possible contaminating routes. A systematic search was performed on the PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase databases, adding results from gray literature as well. The search not only included COVID-19 but was extended to virus contamination in general. We excluded society and professional association statements about COVID-19 if they did not add new insights to the available literature. RESULTS: The initial search provided 2007 records, after which 267 full-text papers were considered. Finally, we used 84 papers, of which 14 discussed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Eight papers discussed the added value of performing intubation in a low-pressure operating room, mainly based on the SARS outbreak experience in 2003. Thirteen papers elaborated on the risks of intubation for health care providers and SARS-CoV-2, and 19 papers discussed this situation with other viruses. They conclude that there is significant evidence that intubation and extubation is a high-risk aerosol-producing procedure. No papers were found on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 and surgical smoke, although 25 papers did provide conflicting evidence on the infection risk of human papillomavirus, hepatitis B, polio, and rabies. No papers were found discussing tissue extraction or the deflation risk of the pneumoperitoneum after laparoscopic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: There seems to be consensus in the literature that intubation and extubation are high-risk procedures for health care providers and that maximum protective equipment is needed. On the other hand, minimal evidence is available of the actual risk of contamination of health care providers during laparoscopy itself, nor of operating room pressure, surgical smoke, tissue extraction, or CO(2) deflation. However, new studies are being published daily from current experiences, and society statements are continuously updated. There seems to be no reason to abandon laparoscopic surgery in favor of open surgery. However, the risks should not be underestimated, surgery should be performed on patients with COVID-19 only when necessary, and health care providers should use logic and common sense to protect themselves and others by performing surgery in a safe and protected environment.","output":"COVID-19 and Laparoscopic Surgery: Scoping Review of Current Literature and Local Expertise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family of Coronaviridae, the order Nidovirales, and the genus Coronavirus They are the largest group of viruses causing respiratory and gastrointestinal infections Morphologically, CoVs are enveloped viruses containing a non-segmented positive-sense, single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses CoVs are categorized into four important genera that include Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus A novel member of human CoV that has recently emerged in Wuhan, China, is now formally named as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) This is a unique strain of RNA viruses that have not been previously observed in humans The virus has wide host adaptability and is capable of causing severe diseases in humans, masked palm civets, mice, dogs, cats, camels, pigs, chickens, and bats The SARS-CoV-2 typically causes respiratory and gastrointestinal sickness in both humans and animals It can be transmitted through aerosols and direct/indirect contact, as well as during medical cases and laboratory sample handling Specific structural proteins, which might be found on the surface of the virus, play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of the complications The disease is characterized by distinct medical signs and symptoms that include high fever, chills, cough, and shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing The infected people may also present with other symptoms such as diarrhea, myalgia, fatigue, expectoration, and hemoptysis It is important from the public health and economic point of view as it affects the growth of the country, which is majorly attributed to the restriction in the movement of the people and the cost associated with the control and prevention of the disease Since there is no specific therapeutic intervention nor a vaccine available against the virus, supportive management and treatment with non-specific therapeutic agents (repurposed drugs) may provide relief to the patients Some preventive strategies of the disease include blocking the routes of transmission of the infections, disinfection of instruments used during medical case handling, using personal protective equipment, proper and early diagnosis of the disease, avoiding contact with the sick patients, and quarantine of the infected/exposed people","output":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2): An Update"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The need for rapid access to regularly updated patient data for hypothesis testing, surge planning, and epidemiologic investigations underscore the value of updated registries that clinicians, researchers, and policy makers can easily access for local and regional planning. We sought to create an adaptive, living registry containing detailed clinical and epidemiologic and outcome data from SARS-CoV-2-PCR-positive patients in our healthcare system. Methods: From 03/13/202 onward, demographics, comorbidities, outpatient medications, along with 75 laboratory, 2 imaging, 19 therapeutic, and 4 outcome-related parameters were manually extracted from the electronic medical record of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. These parameters were entered on a registry featuring calculation, graphing tools, pivot tables, and a macro programming language. Initially, two internal medicine residents populated the database, then professional data abstractors populated the registry. When the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases released their COVID-19 case report form for public access, we adapted it and used it on a browser-based, metadata-driven electronic data capture software platform. Statistics were performed in R and Minitab. Results: At the time of this submission, 200,807 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were performed on 107,604 distinct patients. 3699 (3.4%) of those have had positive results. Of those, 399 (11%) have had the more than 75 parameters full entered in the registry. The average follow-up period was 25 days (range 21-34 days). Age, male gender, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and cancer were associated with hospital admission (all p values < 0.01), but not ICU admission. Statin, ACEI-ARB, and acid suppressant use were associated with admission (all p values < 0.03). Obesity and history of autoimmune disease were not associated with need for admission. Supplemental oxygen, vasopressor requirement, and outpatient statin use were associated with increased mortality (all p values < 0.03). Conclusion: A living COVID-19 registry represents a mechanism to facilitate optimal sharing of data between providers, consumers, health information networks, and health plans through technology-enabled, secure-access electronic health information. Our approach also involves a diversity of new roles in the field, such as using residents, staff, and the quality department, in addition to professional data extractors and the health informatics team. However, due to the overwhelming number of infections that continues to accelerate, and the labor/time intense nature of the project, only 11% of all patients with COVID-19 had all parameters entered in the registry. Therefore, this report also offers lessons learned and discusses sustainability issues, should others wish to establish a registry. It also highlights the local and broader public health significance of the registry.","output":"The Value of a Regional Living COVID-19 Registry and the Challenges of Keeping It Alive"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza is one of the most common infections threatening public health worldwide and is caused by the influenza virus.

The UBiquitous Integrated CARE (UBICARE) technology is a novel health digital platform at the validation stage in hospital setting. UBICARE might support the urgent need for digitalisation and early intervention, as well as minimise the face-to-face delivery of care in both hospital and community-based care settings. This research protocol aims to design an early-stage assessment of the multidimensional impact induced by UBICARE within the IT-NHS alongside technology validation in a hospital ward. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The targeted patients will be medium/high-risk hypertensive individuals as an illustrative first example of how UBICARE might bring benefits to susceptible patients. A mixed-method study will be applied to incorporate to the validation study a multistakeholder perspective, including perceived patient experiences and preferences, and facilitate technology adoption. First, semistructured interviews will be undertaken with a variety of stakeholders including clinicians, health managers and policy-makers to capture views on the likely technology utility, economic sustainability, impact of adoption in hospital practice and alternative adoption scenarios. Second, a monocentric, non-randomised and non-comparative clinical study, supplemented by the administration of standardised usability questionnaires to patients and health professionals, will validate the use of UBICARE in hospital practice. Finally, the results of the previous stages will be discussed in a multidisciplinary-facilitated workshop with IT-NHS relevant stakeholders to reconcile stakeholders' perspectives. Limitations include a non-random recruitment strategy in the clinical study, small sample size of the key stakeholders and potential stakeholder recruitment bias introduced by the research technique.

Although COVID-19 has been studied as a lung pathogen, endocrine system involvement has rarely been studied. In this case report, we present a case of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and acute pancreatitis in the setting of COVID-19. Case Description: A 52-year-old female with a PMH of type 1 diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism, presented to the ED with nausea, vomiting, fatigue and diffuse abdominal pain. She reports cosmetic surgery a few weeks prior and she started feeling these symptoms at the beginning of admission day of admission. On admission, WBC was 34.9, blood glucose was 496, lactic acid of 3.1. Arterial blood gas revealed pH of 6.96, PCO2 of 17 mEq/L, PO2 of 143, HCO3 of 5 and anion gap of 23. DKA protocol was initiated and was upgraded to ICU. She was found to be RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. She denied other symptoms, including melena, jaundice, hematochezia, hematemesis, cough, SOB or diarrhea. She also denied use of alcohol, tobacco or illicit drugs, prior hospitalizations, or family history of pancreatitis. The physical exam was significant for tenderness to palpation in epigastric region without guarding or rebound. Laboratory studies revealed lipase: > 4000U/L, AST: 64 U/L, ALT: 57 U/L, ALKPHOS: 152 U/L, and total bilirubin: 1.1 mg/dL. Serum triglycerides and calcium levels were within normal limits. CT abdomen showed a severe peripancreatic inflammation and edema, moderate non-organized fluid surrounds pancreas. An abdominal ultrasound showed no calcified gallstone or gallbladder wall thickening. The common bile duct was 3 mm, normal size. Over the course of 24 hours, anion gap was 7, pH was 7.28, blood glucose was 158. For sepsis, lactic acid was 0.7 after initiation of azithromycin. For acute pancreatitis, she was treated conservatively with intravenous fluids, bowel rest and analgesia. Patient denied any upper respiratory symptoms and did not require oxygen so steroids were not started for COVID PNA. Her symptoms improved and she was discharged home. Discussion: Here we report a case of a patient who presented with DKA, found to have severe acute pancreatitis as well as SARS-CoV2 PCR positive. Few case reports have reported an association of DKA and acute pancreatitis. Although the exact mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 is evolving, it is thought to be mediated by the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 which is present in intestine, and on islet cells of the pancreas. This injury may be due to cytopathic effect of viral replication or indirectly caused by the inflammatory response induced by the virus.

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2007. OBJECTIVES To investigate the effects of automated electromechanical- and robotic-assisted gait-training devices for improving walking after stroke. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 9 August 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 8), MEDLINE in Ovid (1950 to 15 August 2016), Embase (1980 to 15 August 2016), CINAHL (1982 to 15 August 2016), AMED (1985 to 15 August 2016), Web of Science (1899 to 16 August 2016), SPORTDiscus (1949 to 15 September 2012), the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) (searched 16 August 2016), and the engineering databases COMPENDEX (1972 to 16 November 2012) and Inspec (1969 to 26 August 2016). We handsearched relevant conference proceedings, searched trials and research registers, checked reference lists, and contacted authors in an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA We included all randomised controlled trials and randomised controlled cross-over trials in people over the age of 18 years diagnosed with stroke of any severity, at any stage, in any setting, evaluating electromechanical- and robotic-assisted gait training versus normal care. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed methodological quality and risk of bias, and extracted the data. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants walking independently at follow-up. MAIN RESULTS We included 36 trials involving 1472 participants in this review update. Electromechanical-assisted gait training in combination with physiotherapy increased the odds of participants becoming independent in walking (odds ratio (random effects) 1.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39 to 2.71; P < 0.001; I2 = 8%; moderate-quality evidence) but did not significantly increase walking velocity (mean difference (MD) 0.04 m/s, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.09; P = 0.08; I2 = 65%; low-quality evidence) or walking capacity (MD 5.84 metres walked in 6 minutes, 95% CI -16.73 to 28.40; P = 0.61; I2 = 53%; very low-quality evidence). The results must be interpreted with caution because 1) some trials investigated people who were independent in walking at the start of the study, 2) we found variations between the trials with respect to devices used and duration and frequency of treatment, and 3) some trials included devices with functional electrical stimulation. Our planned subgroup analysis suggested that people in the acute phase may benefit, but people in the chronic phase may not benefit from electromechanical-assisted gait training. Post hoc analysis showed that people who are non-ambulatory at intervention onset may benefit, but ambulatory people may not benefit from this type of training. Post hoc analysis showed no differences between the types of devices used in studies regarding ability to walk, but significant differences were found between devices in terms of walking velocity. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS People who receive electromechanical-assisted gait training in combination with physiotherapy after stroke are more likely to achieve independent walking than people who receive gait training without these devices. We concluded that seven patients need to be treated to prevent one dependency in walking. Specifically, people in the first three months after stroke and those who are not able to walk seem to benefit most from this type of intervention. The role of the type of device is still not clear. Further research should consist of large definitive pragmatic phase III trials undertaken to address specific questions about the most effective frequency and duration of electromechanical-assisted gait training as well as how long any benefit may last.","output":"Electromechanical-assisted training for walking after stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Managing multiple sclerosis (MS) during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a challenge due to the lack of evidence from clinical studies Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) may affect the immune response and subsequently alter the risk of COVID-19 infections METHODS: A literature search was conducted on the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases A focused Google search was also performed Recommendations regarding the use of DMTs during the COVID-19 outbreak from national and international MS/neurology societies were identified and reviewed RESULTS: The review included 16 recommendations from international and national MS organizations All recommendations are based on expert opinions The recommendations regarding DMT initiation and management during this outbreak are summarized Moreover, the experts' views about the risk of COVID-19 infection with each DMT are discussed CONCLUSIONS: There is significant agreement among most experts' recommendations from a variety of sources based on collective clinical experience However, the recommendations will likely evolve because sufficient clinical data are limited Several ongoing registries will help provide information for future recommendations","output":"Disease-Modifying Therapies During the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Narrative Review of International and National Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 prompted the need to gather information on clinical outcomes and risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infections. Objective: To examine outcomes and risk factors associated with COVID-19 clinical severity in a large, diverse cohort of North American patients with MS. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analysis used deidentified, cross-sectional data on patients with MS and SARS-CoV-2 infection reported by health care professionals in North American academic and community practices between April 1, 2020, and December 12, 2020, in the COVID-19 Infections in MS Registry. Health care professionals were asked to report patients after a minimum of 7 days from initial symptom onset and after sufficient time had passed to observe the COVID-19 disease course through resolution of acute illness or death. Data collection began April 1, 2020, and is ongoing. Exposures: Laboratory-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection or highly suspected COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical outcome with 4 levels of increasing severity: not hospitalized, hospitalization only, admission to the intensive care unit and/or required ventilator support, and death. Results: Of 1626 patients, most had laboratory-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection (1345 [82.7%]), were female (1202 [74.0%]), and had relapsing-remitting MS (1255 [80.4%]). A total of 996 patients (61.5%) were non-Hispanic White, 337 (20.8%) were Black, and 190 (11.7%) were Hispanic/Latinx. The mean (SD) age was 47.7 (13.2) years, and 797 (49.5%) had 1 or more comorbidity. The overall mortality rate was 3.3% (95% CI, 2.5%-4.3%). Ambulatory disability and older age were each independently associated with increased odds of all clinical severity levels compared with those not hospitalized after adjusting for other risk factors (nonambulatory: hospitalization only, odds ratio [OR], 2.8 [95% CI, 1.6-4.8]; intensive care unit/required ventilator support, OR, 3.5 [95% CI, 1.6-7.8]; death, OR, 25.4 [95% CI, 9.3-69.1]; age [every 10 years]: hospitalization only, OR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.1-1.6]; intensive care unit/required ventilator support, OR, 1.3 [95% CI, 0.99-1.7]; death, OR, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.2-2.6]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this registry-based cross-sectional study, increased disability was independently associated with worse clinical severity including death from COVID-19. Other risk factors for worse outcomes included older age, Black race, cardiovascular comorbidities, and recent treatment with corticosteroids. Knowledge of these risk factors may improve the treatment of patients with MS and COVID-19 by helping clinicians identify patients requiring more intense monitoring or COVID-19 treatment.","output":"Outcomes and Risk Factors Associated With SARS-CoV-2 Infection in a North American Registry of Patients With Multiple Sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to the ongoing 2019-2020 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA coronavirus. Effective countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2 infection require the design and development of specific and effective vaccine candidates. OBJECTIVE: To address the urgent need for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, in the present study, we designed and validated one cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and one helper T lymphocyte (HTL) multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) against SARS-CoV-2 using various in silico methods. METHODS: Both designed MEVs are composed of CTL and HTL epitopes screened from 11 Open Reading Frame (ORF), structural and nonstructural proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Both MEVs also carry potential B-cell linear and discontinuous epitopes as well as interferon gammaCinducing epitopes. To enhance the immune response of our vaccine design, truncated (residues 10-153) Onchocerca volvulus activation-associated secreted protein-1 was used as an adjuvant at the N termini of both MEVs. The tertiary models for both the designed MEVs were generated, refined, and further analyzed for stable molecular interaction with toll-like receptor 3. Codon-biased complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated for both MEVs and analyzed in silico for high level expression in a mammalian (human) host cell line. RESULTS: In the present study, we screened and shortlisted 38 CTL, 33 HTL, and 12 B cell epitopes from the 11 ORF protein sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Moreover, the molecular interactions of the screened epitopes with their respective human leukocyte antigen allele binders and the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) complex were positively validated. The shortlisted screened epitopes were utilized to design two novel MEVs against SARS-CoV-2. Further molecular models of both MEVs were prepared, and their stable molecular interactions with toll-like receptor 3 were positively validated. The codon-optimized cDNAs of both MEVs were also positively analyzed for high levels of overexpression in a human cell line. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is highly significant in terms of the molecular design of prospective CTL and HTL vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection with potential to elicit cellular and humoral immune responses. The epitopes of the designed MEVs are predicted to cover the large human population worldwide (96.10%). Hence, both designed MEVs could be tried in vivo as potential vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Structural Basis for Designing Multiepitope Vaccines Against COVID-19 Infection: In Silico Vaccine Design and Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably changed the workplace and social relationships of nurses.

Although the elicitation of humoral responses against different viral proteins is rapid and occurs in most infected individuals, its magnitude is highly variable among them and positively correlates with COVID-19 disease severity. This rapid response is characterized by the almost concomitant appearance of virus-specific IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies that contain neutralizing antibodies directed against different epitopes of the Spike glycoprotein. Of particularly interest, the antibodies against domain of the Spike that interacts with the cellular receptor ACE2, known as the receptor binding domain (RBD), are present in most infected individuals and are block viral entry and infectivity. Such neutralizing antibodies protect different animal species when administered before virus exposure; therefore, its elicitation is the main target of current vaccine approaches and their clinical use as recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is being explored. Yet, little information exists on the duration of humoral responses during natural infection. This is a key issue that will impact the management of the pandemic and determine the utility of seroconversion studies and the level of herd immunity. Certainly, several cases of reinfection have been reported, suggesting that immunity could be transient, as reported for other coronaviruses. In summary, although the kinetics of the generation of antibodies against SASR-CoV-2 and their protective activity have been clearly defined, their role in COVID-19 pathogenesis and the length of these responses are still open questions.","output":"Humoral immune responses and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2; implications in pathogenesis and protective immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens to overwhelm the healthcare resources of the country, but also poses a personal hazard to healthcare workers, including physicians. To address the potential impact of excluding physicians with a high risk of adverse outcomes based on age, we evaluated the current patterns of age of licensed physicians across the United States. Methods: We compiled information from the 2018 database of actively licensed physicians in the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) across the US. Both at a national- and the state-level, we assessed the number and proportion of physicians who would be at an elevated risk due to age over 60 years. Results: Of the 985,026 licensed physicians in the US, 235857 or 23.9% were aged 25-40 years, 447052 or 45.4% are 40-60 years, 191794 or 19.5% were 60-70 years, and 106121 or 10.8% were 70 years or older. Age was not reported in 4202 or 0.4% of physicians. Overall, 297915 or 30.2% of physicians were 60 years of age or older, 246167 (25.0%) 65 years and older, and 106121 (10.8%) 70 years or older. States in the US reported that a median 5470 licensed physicians (interquartile range [IQR], 2394 to 10108) were 60 years of age or older. Notably, states of North Dakota (n=1180) and Vermont (n = 1215) had the lowest and California (n=50786) and New York (n=31582) the highest number of physicians over the age of 60 years (Figure 1). Across states, the median proportion of physicians aged 60 years and older was 28.9% (IQR, 27.2%, 31.4%), and ranged between 25.9% for Nebraska to 32.6% for New Mexico (Figure 2). Discussion: Older physicians represent a large proportion of the US physician workforce, particularly in states with the worst COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, their exclusion from patient care will be impractical. Optimizing care practices by limiting direct patient contact of physicians vulnerable to adverse outcomes from COVID-19, potentially by expanding their participation in telehealth may be a strategy to protect them.","output":"An Evaluation of the Vulnerable Physician Workforce in the United States During the Coronavirus Disease-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Three transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) defective interfering RNAs of 21, 10.6 and 9.7 kb (DI-A, DI-B and DI-C, respectively) were isolated.

The challenge of the pandemic forced educational organisations in Russia to resort to massive transition to distance learning and accelerated digital transformation of schools. It has become more obvious than ever that the digital transformation of a school is not limited to a simple technical update of its information resources but implies a fundamental rethinking of the school activities based on the capabilities of digital technologies. The aim of the study was to investigate the experience of digital transformation and the Russian school principals' notions about it as a systemic process. The subject of the study is the notion about the systemic impact of digital transformation processes on schools;the experience of complexity in the introduction of information technologies in the educational process and school management, the assessment of the progress of digitalisation;the notions about the factors of successful digital transformation, which require a critical understanding of the experience of implementing information technologies in the school, highlighting key success factors. Methodology and research methods. The authors analysed 7189 questionnaires using computer methods for processing the natural language. The questionnaires were completed in general education organisations of 66 regions from all federal districts of Russia. The respondents' answers were categorised in accordance with the European Framework for Technologically Competent Educational Organisations (DigCompOrg). Results. The research findings demonstrated the significant imbalance in the frequency of responses: the most frequent answers belong to the Infrastructure category, while the least frequent ones belong to the categories of pedagogical aspects of digital transformation affecting changes in the educational content and methods for assessing educational outcomes. It is concluded that the respondents' replies reflect the institutional position of school principals in the current educational system: a head of a government-funded school positions herself/himself as an administrative executor and a representative of the founder, rather than a leader of the teaching team. Consequently, the provision of educational achievements and students' personal development are largely not perceived by principles of Russian schools as a priority management task. Scientific novelty of the present research lies in the attempt to answer the question of how systematically the digital transformation of the principle is perceived, to apply DigCompOrg to the assessment of these categories by the European Framework of technologically competent educational organisations, as well as to use natural language processing methods to process text answers to open-ended questions of the questionnaire, which made it possible to obtain results on a large sample with wide geographical coverage. Practical significance. The research findings can be used in the development and implementation of advanced training programmes for school and college administrations in accordance with the ongoing digitalisation of Russian educational system. ? 2021 Russian State Vocational Pedagogical University.

Traditional in vivo studies used to characterize clinical candidates volume of distribution are error-prone, time- and cost-intensive and lack reproducibility in clinical settings. The paper demonstrates how a computational platform integrating machine learning optimization with mechanistic modeling can be used to simulate compound plasma concentration profile and predict tissue-plasma partition coefficients with high accuracy by varying the lipophilicity descriptor logP. The approach applied to chemically diverse small molecules resulted in comparable geometric mean fold-errors of 1.50 and 1.63 in pharmacokinetic outputs for direct tissue:plasma partition and hybrid logP optimization, with the latter enabling prediction of tissue permeation that can be used to guide toxicity and efficacy dosing in human subjects. The optimization simulations required to achieve these results were parallelized on the AWS cloud and generated outputs in under 5 h. Accuracy, speed, and scalability of the framework indicate that it can be used to assess the relevance of other mechanistic relationships implicated in pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic phenomena with a lower risk of overfitting datasets and generate large database of physiologically-relevant drug disposition for further integration with machine learning models.","output":"A hybrid modeling approach for assessing mechanistic models of small molecule partitioning in vivo using a machine learning-integrated modeling platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Here, we report the dominant SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, ACE2, conjugates with small ubiquitin-like modifier 3 (SUMO3) through a proteome-wide protein interaction analysis. We further demonstrate that E3 SUMO ligase PIAS4 prompts the SUMOylation and stabilization of ACE2, whereas deSUMOylation enzyme SENP3 reverses this process. Conjugation of SUMO3 with ACE2 at lysine (K) 187 hampers the K48-linked ubiquitination of ACE2, thus suppressing its subsequent cargo receptor TOLLIP-dependent autophagic degradation. Pharmacological intervention of ACE2 SUMOylation blocks the entry of SARS-CoV-2 and viral infection-triggered immune responses.

The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the temporary closure of our DTU, so we therefore also offered patients the opportunity to use the headsets in their own homes.AimThis study explores the impact of using VR on reported pain, anxiety and mood in palliative patients and the feasibility of using it in the home.MethodPatients are instructed how to use VR headsets on the inpatient unit or in their own home. Participants complete questionnaires on its influence on pain and anxiety scores and their experience of use. Volunteers were trained to teach patients how to use the headsets.Results30 sets of data have been collected from the inpatient unit and 10 from patients homes, results for both groups are similar. All patients reported ease of use, a positive experience, and no adverse effects. 98% of those who reported pain before using VR reported a reduction and 93% of those who reported anxiety before using VR reported a reduction. For the majority of participants in this study using VR induced emotion with positive valence C happiness, excitement. The ability of VR to induce emotions with positive valence is deemed to influence its analgesic effect (Triberti, Repetto, Riva, 2014).ConclusionThe majority of palliative patients are managed in the community setting, and enabling the use of VR in their own homes means more patients can experience the benefits.

METHODS: Gastric cancer cell lines MGC803 and BGC823 were treated by 0, 0.3%, 1%, 3% and 10% KAI for 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. The cell proliferation was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The apoptosis and cell cycle were evaluated by flow cytometry. Interleukin (IL)-6 mRNA and protein expression levels were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. The protein expression levels of cyclin A, cyclin E, cyclin B1, cyclin D1, p21, retinoblastoma (RB), protein kinase B (AKT), extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK), signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT3 were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: KAI inhibited the proliferation of MGC803 and BGC823 gastric cancer cells in dose- and time-dependent manner. After treated with KAI for 48 h, the proportion of G1 phase was increased, expression level of cyclin D1 and phosphorylation-RB were down-regulated, whereas the expression of p21 was up-regulated (all P<0.01).

Methods We searched databases from inception up to August 28, 2019, for studies examining the effect of replacing sitting with standing on fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, and lipid levels; blood pressure; body fat mass; weight; and waist circumference in healthy adults. Differences in mean  SD values were used for pooling the data and calculating the mean differences and CIs. Results The search found 3507 abstracts. Nine clinical trials (8 randomized and 1 nonrandomized) with 877 (64.4% [n=565] women) participants met all inclusion criteria. The mean  SD age was 45.345.41 years; mean follow-up was 3.81 months, and mean difference in standing time between the intervention and control groups was 1.33 hours per day. The follow-up fasting blood glucose and body fat mass values were slightly but significantly lower than baseline records in the intervention groups compared with control groups (-2.53; 95% CI, -4.27 to -0.79 mg/dL; and -0.75; 95% CI, -0.91 to -0.59 kg).

Of the currently available vaccines, none have been systematically studied for efficacy or toxicity in patients with immunodeficiency or with immunosuppressed states, such as B cell malignancy. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the immune response to currently available vaccines against COVID-19 in patients with hematologic and solid organ malignancies. Methods This prospective study enrolled 53 patients; 12 with CLL, 10 with multiple myeloma (MM), 11 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 21 with a solid organ malignancy. Using a quantitative assay, IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein by enzyme immunoassay were measured at baseline prior to vaccination and at 2 weeks after completion of vaccination. A fourfold increase in IgG was considered a positive response to vaccination. Through a predesigned survey, patients also self-reported side effects from each dose of vaccination. Results Seroconversion with vaccination was seen in 9/10 (90%) patients with MM, 5/12 (41.7%) patients with CLL, 6/11 (54.1%) patients with NHL, and 17/21 (80.9%) patients with solid organ malignancy. Per univariate analysis, CLL (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.05-0.88; p= 0.033) was associated with lower odds of seroconversion while NHL (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.12-1.8; p =0.291), MM (OR 5.33, 95% CI 0.61-46.08; p= 0.128) and solid organ malignancy (OR 2.90, 95% CI 0.79-10.64; p= 0.107) were not. Among patients with hematological malignancies, 5/13 (38.3%) patients treated with rituximab and 2/7 (28.5%) patients on immunoglobulin replacement (IgR) therapy responded to vaccination. This corresponded to reduced odds of seroconversion, 0.18 (95% CI 0.047-0.69; p = 0.013) in patients treated with rituximab and 0.14 (95% CI 0.024-0.826; p=0.030) in patients on IgR. Among patients with solid organ malignancies, treatment with chemotherapy (OR 2.05, 95% CI 0.48-8.61; p=0.320), immunotherapy (OR 4.57, 95% CI 0.52-39.9; p=0.169) or endocrine therapy (OR 1.0) did not lower odds of seroconversion with vaccination. Multivariate analysis revealed patients who received rituximab were less likely to respond to vaccination as compared to patients not previously treated with rituximab (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05-0.955; p=0.044). Injection site soreness was the most commonly reported side effect. The only severe side effect occurred in a patient with solid organ malignancy who developed Parsonage Turner syndrome. Conclusion Our study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first study comparing pre and post vaccination IgG titers against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Majority of patients with MM and solid organ malignancies, including those receiving active treatment, responded adequately to immunization. Patients with CLL appear less likely to respond to vaccination against COVID-19 as compared to patients with NHL, MM or solid organ malignancies. Previous treatment with rituximab was the most significant risk factor for suboptimal response to vaccination, regardless of underlying hematologic malignancy. These data highlight the importance of continuing risk mitigation strategies against COVID-19 in individuals with hematologic malignancy, particularly those with CLL or on treatment with rituximab. Future research is needed to investigate approaches to provide protective IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in this at-risk population.

Fourth, the professional and objective judgments of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency were not respected by other Government officers. Fifth, the fairness of the quarantine policy was greatly undermined. Sixth, the vulnerable and those caring for them were marginalized. Seventh, the purpose of the vaccination damage compensation system of the Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act was not well reflected. Eighth, the quarantine policy was ignored in allocation of the national budget. To properly respond to future infectious diseases, ROK must address issues that emerged during the COVID-19 quarantine process. ?

As the spread of the disease accelerated both in Wuhan and elsewhere globally, the WHO declared it a pandemic. There is sound evidence to argue that otolaryngologists run high risks of occupational SARS-COV2 among health care workers due to high viral load in upper respiratory examinations. This review article was conducted to determine the effect of the COVID 19 pandemic on the otolaryngology department and residency program in Saudi Arabia. Since the pandemic outbreak, the government of Saudi Arabia has taken severe measures and issued several decisions to limit the spread of the virus. These decisions included operations, procedures, outpatient clinics by prioritizing emergency and time-sensitive cases while rescheduling all electives and routines once. As a result, the residency program was also affected by the substantial reduction of daily surgical activity and preventing endoscopic tests in the clinics, which led to a notable decrease in residents' involvement and risk of procedural skills deterioration which became a concern to many doctors of residency programs. It is difficult to deny that the epidemic will negatively impact. However, adhering to well-prepared guidelines and giving residents an excellent opportunity to overcome the defects will deliver training and patients' care while also protecting safety and health.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on otolaryngology head & neck speciality and residency program in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To examine contraceptive practices and conception rates after bariatric surgery. METHODS The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 is a multicenter, prospective cohort study of adults undergoing first-time bariatric surgery as part of routine clinical care at 10 U.S. hospitals. Recruitment occurred between 2005 and 2009. Participants completed preoperative and annual postsurgical assessments for up to 7 years until January 2015. This report was restricted to women 18-44 years old with no history of menopause, hysterectomy, or estrogen and progesterone therapy. Primary outcomes were self-reported contraceptive practices, overall conception rate, and early (less than 18 months) postsurgical conception. Contraceptive practice (no intercourse, protected intercourse, unprotected intercourse, or tried to conceive) was classified based on the preceding year. Conception rates were determined from self-reported pregnancies. RESULTS Of 740 eligible women, 710 (95.9%) completed follow-up assessment(s). Median (interquartile range) preoperative age was 34 (30-39) years. In the first postsurgical year, 12.7% (95% CI 9.4-16.0) of women had no intercourse, 40.5% (95% CI 35.6-45.4) had protected intercourse only, 41.5% (95% CI 36.4-46.6) had unprotected intercourse while not trying to conceive, and 4.3% (95% CI 2.4-6.3) tried to conceive. The prevalence of the first three groups did not significantly differ across the 7 years of follow-up (P for all >.05); however, more women tried to conceive in the second year (13.1%, 95% CI 9.3-17.0; P<.001). The conception rate was 53.8 (95% CI 40.0-71.1) per 1,000 woman-years across follow-up (median [interquartile range] 6.5 [5.9-7.0] years); 42.3 (95% CI 30.2-57.6) per 1,000 woman-years in the 18 months after surgery. Age (adjusted relative risk 0.41 [95% CI 0.19-0.89] per 10 years, P=.03), being married or living as married (adjusted relative risk 4.76 [95% CI 2.02-11.21], P<.001), and rating future pregnancy as important preoperatively (adjusted relative risk 8.50 [95% CI 2.92-24.75], P<.001) were associated with early conception.

The unavailability of virus-specific drugs has created an opportunity to identify potential therapeutic agents that can control the rapid transmission of this pandemic. Here, the mechanisms of the inhibition of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), responsible for the replication of the virus in host cells, are examined by different ligands, such as Remdesivir (RDV), Remdesivir monophosphate (RMP), and several artificially expanded genetic information systems (AEGISs) including their different sequences by employing molecular docking, MD simulations, and MM/GBSA techniques. It is found that the binding of RDV to RdRp may block the RNA binding site. However, RMP would acquire a partially flipped conformation and may allow the viral RNA to enter into the binding site. The internal dynamics of RNA and RdRp may help RMP to regain its original position, where it may inhibit the RNA-chain elongation reaction. Remarkably, AEGISs are found to obstruct the binding site of RNA. It is shown that dPdZ, a two-nucleotide sequence containing P and Z would bind to RdRp very strongly and may occupy the positions of two nucleotides in the RNA strand, thereby denying access of the substrate-binding site to the viral RNA. Thus, it is proposed that the AEGISs may act as novel therapeutic candidates against the SARS-CoV-2. However, in vivo evaluations of their potencies and toxicities are needed before using them against COVID-19.","output":"Artificially expanded genetic information systems (AEGISs) as potent inhibitors of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Before the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, cruise travel had experienced exponential growth in the preceding decade.

We evaluated whether outpatient intravenous (IV) diuretic clinic is a safe and effective strategy to reduce HF hospitalizations. METHODS: We reviewed 34 clinic encounters with 27 unique patients (median age 72) who had volume overload refractory to oral diuretics that were treated with IV furosemide in the outpatient clinic. One patient (2.9%) was admitted to the hospital directly, and the rest were discharged home. RESULTS: More than 80% of the patients had continued weight loss for 7 days (median weight loss 5.4 lb). During the median follow-up period of 15 months, 15 patients (56%) had subsequent HF hospitalizations. HF admission was delayed by a median of 22 days from the clinic visit and 138 days from the previous HF admission prior to clinic visit. Estimated cost saving per admission avoided was $10,395. One patient developed severe hypokalemia (< 3.0 mmol/L), and the remaining had no adverse events. CONCLUSION: Outpatient IV diuresis is effective and well tolerated. It leads to significant weight loss, persisting in the majority of patients for 7 days.

Previous reports have demonstrated an average of 50 BA cases every year across the three UK centres, however observations from clinicians across these three centers have suggested a reduction in the number of presenting cases during the COVID-19 lockdown.ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to assess whether there has been a change in presentations of Biliary Atresia (BA) in England and Wales during the first COVID-19 lockdown (January C July 2020).MethodsThis population study assessed all confirmed cases of BA, from January 2020 to July 2020, across the 3 UK paediatric liver centers originating from England and Wales. Data was then compared to the incidence of confirmed BA cases from January - July 2017, 2018 and 2019, as documented within the Biliary Atresia National Registry.ResultsFrom January C July 2020, there were only 8 presenting cases of BA in England and Wales, compared to 24, 17 and 20 for the same time periods in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. This difference was significant in a two-sided t-test (p = 0.0150). While the mean days to Kasai procedure was longer in 2020 compared to 2016C2019 (64.6 vs. 56.6), this difference was not observed to be significant (p=0.551).ConclusionsThere was a significant reduction in the presenting cases of BA during the first COVID-19 lockdown. This could either be due to a reduction in referrals or from a reduction in incidence of the condition, potentially due to an infectious cause being less prevalent during the national lockdown. If the former is correct there is potential for a significant number of BA babies with cholestatic jaundice remaining within the community.

Moreover, the risk factors for the underlying changes of PBICs and their predicting role in severe COVID-19 patients remain uncertain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study including two cohorts: the main cohort enrolling 45 patients of severe type serving as study group, and the secondary cohort enrolling 12 patients of no-severe type serving as control group. The PBICs analysis was based on blood routine and lymphocyte subsets. The inflammatory cell levels were compared among patients according to clinical classifications, disease-associated phases, as well as one-month outcomes. RESULTS: Compared with patients of non-severe type, the patients of severe type suffered from significantly decreased counts of lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, but increased counts of neutrophils. These PBICs alterations got improved in recovery phase, but persisted or got worse in aggravated phase. Compared with patients in discharged group, the patients in un-discharged/died group suffered from decreased counts of total T lymphocytes, CD4+T lymphocytes, CD8+T lymphocytes, as well as NK cells at 2 weeks after treatment. Clinical classification-critically severe was the independently risk factor for lymphopenia (OR=7.701, 95%CI:1.265-46.893, P=0.027), eosinopenia (OR=5.595, 95%CI:1.008-31.054, P=0.049) and worse one-month outcome (OR=8.984; 95%CI:1.021-79.061, P=0.048).

The blue fluorescence of B-CQDs at 445 nm is then reduced by the AuNCs through the inner filter effect (IFE) under a single excitation wavelength of 370 nm. By the catalysis of xanthine oxidase (XOD), xanthine is oxidized by oxygen dissolved in the solution to produce H2O2. The horseradish peroxidase (HRP) catalyzes H2O2 to generate hydroxyl radicals, which can quench the fluorescence of AuNCs, leading to the recovery of the fluorescence of B-CQDs. Based on the relationship between the fluorescence intensity ratio (F445/F665) and the concentration of xanthine, the designed method exhibits a good linearity range of 1.2-500.0 mol L -1 and a limit of detection of 0.37 mol L -1.

Higher rates of mutation bring higher genomic variability which may lead to viral evolution and enabling viruses to evade the pre-existing immunity of host and quickly acquire drug resistance properties. The objective of our study was to compare the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp sequences of Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates with those of Wuhan type virus. A total of 384 point mutations were detected from 488 sequence of the RdRp protein of Indian SARS-CoV-2 genome, out of which seven were used for subsequent study.

The Kinked Exponential (deterministic) trend, and Zivot and Andrew?s trend equations are applied for the growth analysis of FDI inflows. Regarding the estimation of channels of FDI inflows in terms of horizontal, vertical, and hybrid motivations, dynamic panel data analysis using GMM for BRICS economies together and ARDL-PMG for individual countries is made. The findings show significantly positive growth in FDI inflows in all BRICS countries except India during the first decade of the present century. After that, these countries have experienced either significantly or insignificantly declining trends, except India, where the trend has significantly increased during this later period. From the overall analysis, we see that both horizontal and vertical motivations play a dominant role in determining FDI inflows for the BRICS countries. However, from country-wise estimations, it is observed that both horizontal and vertical motives are dominant factors for FDI inflows to India and Russia. In contrast, the horizontal motive of it is significant for China. For Brazil and South Africa, no motive behind FDI inflows appears significant. The pandemic situation significantly impacts attracting FDI in Brazil, while it remains insensitive in the rest of the BRICS countries. The findings reveal that FDI determinants are country-specific.

RESULTS: Of 5,296 COVID-19 patients, 4,808 (90.8%) were diagnosed in the first pandemic wave (142 cases), second wave (896 cases), and third wave (3,770 cases) in Hong Kong. With the exception of 1 patient who died before admission, all COVID-19 patients were admitted to the public healthcare system for a total of 78,834 COVID-19 patient days. The median length of stay was 13 days (range, 1-128). Of 81,955 HCWs, 38 HCWs (0.05%; 2 doctors and 11 nurses and 25 nonprofessional staff) acquired COVID-19. With the exception of 5 of 38 HCWs (13.2%) infected by HCW-to-HCW transmission in the nonclinical settings, no HCW had documented transmission from COVID-19 patients in the hospitals. The incidence of COVID-19 among HCWs was significantly lower than that of our general population (0.46 per 1,000 HCWs vs 0.71 per 1,000 population; P = .008).

METHODS: Multicenter retrospective cohort study conducted in adult patients transferred by ambulance to an emergency department (ED) with suspected COVID-19 infection subsequently confirmed by a SARS-CoV-2 test (polymerase chain reaction). We collected epidemiological data, clinical covariates (respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, level of consciousness and use of supplemental oxygen) and hospital variables. The primary outcome was cumulative all-cause mortality during a 90-day follow-up, with mortality assessment monitoring time points at 1, 2, 7, 14, 30 and 90 days from ED attendance. Comparison of performances for 90-day mortality between both scores was carried out by univariate analysis. RESULTS: From March to November 2020, we included 2,961 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (median age 79 years, IQR 66C88), with 49.2% females. The qCSI score provided an AUC ranging from 0.769 (1-day mortality) to 0.749 (90-day mortality), whereas AUCs for NEWS ranging from 0.825 for 1-day mortality to 0.777 for 90-day mortality. At all-time points studied, differences between both scores were statistically significant (p < .001). CONCLUSION: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 can rapidly develop bilateral pneumonias with multiorgan disease; in these cases, in which an evacuation by the EMS is required, reliable scores for an early identification of patients with risk of clinical deterioration are critical. The NEWS score provides not only better prognostic results than those offered by qCSI at all the analyzed time points, but it is also better suited for COVID-19 patients. KEY MESSAGES: This work aims to determine whether NEWS is the best score for mortality risk assessment in patients with COVID-19. AUCs for NEWS ranged from 0.825 for 1-day mortality to 0.777 for 90-day mortality and were significantly higher than those for qCSI in these same outcomes. NEWS provides a better prognostic capacity than the qCSI score and allows for long-term (90 days) mortality risk assessment of COVID-19 patients.","output":"One-on-one comparison between qCSI and NEWS scores for mortality risk assessment in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is recently emerged virus, which caused millions of deaths, all over the world. To tackle COVID-19 pandemic, there is an utmost need for in-depth analysis of viral replication. We aimed to examine viral load in SARS-CoV-2 patients during first two waves of COVID-19 in Pakistan. 225,615 suspected subjects from 75 different regions of Pakistan were selected in the study. SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were detected via real time PCR. During first wave (period of June-July, 2020) of COVID-19 the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 20.38%. However during second wave (period of November-December, 2020) of COVID-19, the rate of prevalence was 9.41%. During first wave of COVID-19 96.31% of participants remained PCR positive for 14 to 21 days, 3.39% of subjects showed positive results for 22 to 35 days, while delayed Ct values were observed among 0.26% of participants for 36 to 49 days. However, during second wave of COVID-19 89.31% of the subjects exhibited symptoms and showed real-time PCR positive results for 14 to 21 days, 9.42% showed positive results for 22 to 35 days, while significantly delayed Ct value results were observed among 1.026% of participants for 36 to 63 days (3.95 times higher than first wave). In contrast to first wave of COVID-19, the factors that were different in second wave were neither viral (different strains) nor host (same population). But treatment factors changed significantly. As during second wave besides azithromycin, corticosteroid dexamethasone consumption was increased consequently causing delayed Ct value negativity. This suggests that corticosteroid treatment might be linked with delayed Ct value or viral clearance.

Sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium were the main components of PM(2.5) during both the pre-lockdown and COVID-lockdown periods. Compared with the pre-lockdown period, even though the concentration and proportion of nitrate decreased, nitrate was the dominant component in PM(2.5) during the COVID-lockdown period. Moreover, nitrate production was enhanced by the elevated O(3) concentration, which was favorable for the homogeneous and hydrolysis nitrate formation despite the drastic decrease of NO(2). The proportion of sulfate during the COVID-lockdown period was higher than that before. Aqueous-phase reactions of H(2)O(2) and transition metal (TMI) catalyzed oxidations were the major pathways for sulfate formation. During the COVID-lockdown period, TMI-catalyzed oxidation became the dominant pathway for aqueous-phase sulfate formation because the elevated acidity favored the dissolution of TMI. Therefore, the enhanced TMI-catalyzed oxidation affected by the elevated particle acidity dominated the sulfate formation, resulting in the slight increase of sulfate concentration during the COVID-lockdown period in Zhengzhou.","output":"Elevated particle acidity enhanced the sulfate formation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Zhengzhou, China()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Corona virus disease (covid-19) is an emerging highly infectious disease caused by novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2).

The use of these devices has the theoretical risk of increased exposure risk because of possible particulate generation. This study aimed to quantify the particulate generation associated with different oxygen devices. METHODS: This was a prospective single center study conducted during September 2020 using ten healthy adult volunteers. Testing was conducted in a negative pressure hospital room using a light scattering particle counter. The oxygen devices used were a nasal cannula, an OxyMask?, a non-rebreathing mask, and a high flow system. Particle measurements were obtained at baseline in the room and then with each oxygen delivery device and pre-specified oxygen flow rates. These measurements were obtained different distances from the volunteer with their mouth open. A Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test was performed on each separate oxygen modality with all flow rates as one model. RESULTS: The particle concentrations were slightly non-significantly increased with the OxyMask? and non-rebreathing mask at the closest distance measured. As the distance increased, these counts decreased closer to ambient levels. The nasal cannula and high flow nasal cannula particle counts were not significantly different from ambient measurements at either distance.

Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment and clinical outcome data were collected, and predictors of the duration of viral shedding were explored through multivariable linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The medical staff with COVID\\\\19 presented mild clinical symptoms and showed a low frequency of abnormal laboratory indicators. All the medical staff were cured and discharged, of whom 96 (68.6%) were female, 39 (27.9%) had underlying diseases, the median age was 36.0 years, and 104 (74.3%) were infected whilst working in hospital. The median duration of viral shedding was 25.0 days (IQR:20.0C30.0). Multivariable linear regression analysis showed reducing viral shedding duration was associated with receiving recombinant human interferon alpha (rIFN\\\\) treatment, whilst the prolonged duration of viral shedding correlated with the use of glucocorticoid treatment, the durations from the first symptom to hospital admission and the improvement in chest computed tomography (CT) evidence. Moreover, infected healthcare workers with lymphocytes less than 1.1  10(9)/L on admission had prolonged viral shedding. CONCLUSION: Medical staff with timely medical interventions shows milder clinical features. Glucocorticoid treatment and lymphocytes less than 1.1  109/L are associated with prolonged viral shedding.

One example of the latter kind of measures is social distancing, which can be either policy-driven or can arise endogenously in the population as a consequence of the fear of infection. However, if NPIs are lifted before the population reaches herd immunity, further re-introductions of the pathogen would lead to secondary infections. Here we study the effects of different social distancing schemes on the large scale spreading of diseases. Specifically, we generalize metapopulation models to include social distancing mechanisms at the subpopulation level and model short- and long-term strategies that are fed with local or global information about the epidemics. We show that different model ingredients might lead to very diverse outcomes in different subpopulations. Our results suggest that there is not a unique answer to the question of whether contention measures are more efficient if implemented and managed locally or globally and that model outcomes depends on how the full complexity of human interactions is taken into account.","output":"Modeling the effects of social distancing on the large-scale spreading of diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, an artificial intelligence network-based smart camera system prototype, which tracks social distance using a birds-eye perspective, has been developed.

Therefore, expanding information on the anti-HSV-1 activity of triterpenes and improving the efficiency of their exploration are urgently required. To improve the efficiency of the development of anti-HSV-1 active compounds, we constructed a predictive model for the anti-HSV-1 activity of triterpenes by using the information obtained from previous studies using machine learning methods. In this study, we constructed a binary classification model (i.e., active or inactive) using a logistic regression algorithm. As a result of the evaluation of predictive model, the accuracy for the test data is 0.79, and the area under the curve (AUC) is 0.86. Additionally, to enrich the information on the anti-HSV-1 activity of triterpenes, a plaque reduction assay was performed on 20 triterpenes.

Rural Cambodian households may face an increased likelihood of exposure to zoonotic diseases as people there live in close association with livestock. The objectives of the study was to identify practices known to influence zoonosis transmission in rural Cambodian households and relate the practices to agro-ecological region, socio-economic position, demographics, livestock management and zoonosis awareness. METHODS: The study was conducted in three different agro-ecological regions of Cambodia; 10 villages each in the central lowlands, north-west wetlands and on the south coast, where information was obtained in questionnaires administered to 300 households, and 30 village heads and animal health workers. RESULTS: Descriptive analysis revealed a gender difference in responsibility for livestock and that the main purpose of raising livestock was for sale. Few respondents (6%) perceived a likelihood of disease transmission in their village between livestock, humans and wildlife, despite household practices related to zoonosis transmission being common. More than one-forth of households practised behaviours such as culling sick animals for consumption, eating animals found dead and allowing animals to enter sleeping and food preparation areas. Associations between household practices and possible explanatory factors were analysed with multivariable models using generalised estimation equations to account for clustering of practices within villages. Factors found to influence household practices were agro-ecological region, socio-economic position, number of people in the household, livestock species reared and awareness of zoonoses. CONCLUSIONS: Cambodia has experienced numerous fatal human cases of zoonotic influenza and extensive influenza information campaigns have been run, yet only a few of the households surveyed here reported the threat of zoonosis to be a concern in their village. Zoonosis awareness was positively related to hand washing behaviour, but other practices associated with an increased or decreased likelihood of exposure to zoonotic pathogens were unaffected by awareness.

COVID-19 has been associated with a number of cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias. The mechanism of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with COVID-19 is uncertain. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ventricular repolarization by using the Tp-e interval, QT dispersion, Tp-e/QT ratio, and Tp-e/QTc ratio as candidate markers of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19. In addition, the relationship between the repolarization parameters and the CRP (C-reactive protein) was investigated. METHODS: 75 newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients, 75 age and sex matched healthy subjects were included in the study between 20th March 2020 and 10th April 2020. The risk of ventricular arrhythmias was evaluated by calculating the electrocardiographic Tp-e and QT interval, Tp-e dispersion, corrected QT(QTc), QT dispersion (QTd), corrected QTd, Tp-e/QT and Tp-e/QTc ratios. CRP values were also measured in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19. RESULTS: Tp-e interval (80.7a?a?4.6 vs. 70.9a?a?4.8; pa?<a?.001), Tp-e / QT ratio (0.21a?a?0.01 vs. 0.19a?a?0.01; pa?<a?.001) and Tp-e/QTc ratio (0.19a?a?0.01 vs.0.17a?a?0.01; pa?<a?.001) were significantly higher in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 than the control group. There was a significant positive correlation between Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QTc ratio and CRP in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 (rsa?=a?0.332, pa?=a?.005, rsa?=a?0.397, pa?<a?.001 consecutively). During their treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin and favipiravir, ventricular tachycardia episodes were observed in in two COVID-19 patients during their hospitalization in the intensive care unit. CONCLUSION: Our study showed for the first time in literature that the Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QT ratio, and Tp-e/QTc ratio, which are evaluated electrocardiographically in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19, were prolonged compared with normal healthy individuals. A positive correlation was determined between repolarization parameters and CRP. We believe that pre-treatment evaluation of repolarization parameters in newly diagnosed COVID-19 would be beneficial for predicting ventricular arrhythmia risk.","output":"Evaluation of electrocardiographic ventricular repolarization variables in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mental health issues are on the rise which may impede university students abilities to perform daily functions and interact with other community members. The objectives of the current study are to explore (1) the characteristics of university students mental health and engagement in activities, (2) how students use their smartphones to support their mental health and engagement in activities, (3) student preferences for important features and functions of a smartphone application (app) that promote engagement in activities and (4) student perspectives about what data an app should collect as indicators of change in their mental health and engagement in activities. METHODS: We designed a pilot study and an online questionnaire with open and closed-ended questions to collect data exploring the association between student mental health and engagement in activities.

We aimed to identify the attitudes and perceptions of Gastroenterology Fellowship Program Directors (PDs) and applicants regarding the virtual interview experience and the role of virtual interviews (VI) in the future. METHODS: We designed separate surveys targeting PDs and applicants using the Qualtrics software. At the end of the interview season, we e-mailed both survey links to all PDs and requested that they forward the applicant survey to their interviewed candidates. Surveys were voluntary and anonymous. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data with results presented as percentages. RESULTS: A total of 29.7% of PDs completed the survey. Compared to traditional interviews, VI were viewed by 46.5% of PDs to be very suboptimal or suboptimal. Yet, 69.1% envisioned a role for VI in the future. A total of 14.2% of applicants completed the survey. Compared to traditional interviews, VI were viewed by 42.3% of applicants to be very suboptimal or suboptimal. However, 61.8% saw a future role for VI. While both applicants and PDs reported that establishing an interpersonal connection was a disadvantage with VI, applicants placed more emphasis on this need for connection (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Overall, PDs and applicants report mixed views with regard to VI but anticipate that it may continue to have a future role.

Therefore, we investigated the role of anxiety, depressive, and other mental disorders for levels and longitudinal changes of COVID-19-related fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. In a longitudinal observational design with four assessment waves from March, 27th until June, 15th 2020, a total of 6,551 adults from Germany was assessed. 4,175 individuals participated in one, 1,070 in two, 803 in three, and 503 in all four waves of data collection. Multilevel analyses revealed that across all assessment waves, COVID-19-related fear, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were significantly higher in individuals with vs. without anxiety, depressive, and other mental disorders. All symptoms decreased on average over time, and this decrease was significantly stronger in individuals with vs. without anxiety disorders, and particularly driven by individuals with generalized anxiety disorder.

Obesity causes dysregulation throughout the immune system, affecting the balance and levels of cytokines, adipokines, and innate and adaptive immune cells. The present review focuses on the impact of obesity on immune function in children: altering the baseline activation state of immune cells and affecting the ability of the host to combat pathogens and malignancy and respond appropriately to vaccination. RECENT FINDINGS Obesity causes dysregulation of the immune system. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of adipose tissue and resident immune cells is quantifying the impact of obesity on the frequency of immune cell subsets and their states. The system-wide alterations in immune function in obesity are most evident upon perturbation, including the response to infection (e.g. increased risk of severe COVID-19 in the ongoing pandemic), vaccination, and malignancy. However, mechanistic research in pediatric obesity is limited and this impacts our ability to care for these children.

In light of Israel's lack of a mandatory salt fortification policy, heavy reliance on desalination and low iodine intake from dairy products and seafood, there is concern in Israel that the population is iodine deficient. Indeed, the first Israeli National Iodine Survey in 2016 found a median urinary iodine concentration (UIC) of 83 g/L among school age children, falling below the WHOs adequacy range of 100C299 g/L for children. METHODS: In the framework of the National Human Biomonitoring Program in Israel, spot urine samples and questionnaire data were collected from 166 healthy children aged 4C12 years in 2020C2021. Urinary iodine concentrations were measured at the Ministry of Health National Biomonitoring Laboratory, using mass spectrometry. An international comparison of median urinary iodine concentrations (UIC) was performed taking into consideration the levels of desalinated water per capita, and fortification policies. RESULTS: The overall median (interquartile range [IQR]) UIC was 80.1 g/L (44.7C130.8 g/L) indicating that the populations iodine status has not improved in the five years that have passed since inadequacy was first identified. When comparing 13 countries with population size above 150,000, whose desalinated water per capita was at least 1 m(3), Israel and Lebanon were the only countries with median UIC below the WHO adequacy range. CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need for mandatory salt fortification in Israel. Based on our international comparison, we conclude that the potential impact of desalination on iodine intake can be compensated for using the implementation of salt fortification policy. This study highlights the critical need for public health surveillance of nutritional and environmental exposures using human biomonitoring, with emphasis on vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and children.

However, GDMT remains underused, with <25% of patients receiving target doses in clinical practice. A randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre in Toronto to compare a remote GDMT titration intervention with standard in-office titration. This randomized controlled trial found that remote titration increased the proportion of patients who achieved optimal GDMT doses, decreased the time to dose optimization, and reduced the number of essential clinic visits. This paper presents findings from the qualitative component of the mixed methods study, which evaluated the implementation of the remote titration intervention. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the qualitative component is to assess the perceptions and experiences of clinicians and patients with heart failure who participated in the remote titration intervention to identify factors that affected the implementation of the intervention. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with clinicians (n=5) and patients (n=11) who participated in the remote titration intervention. Questions probed the experiences of the participants to identify factors that can serve as barriers and facilitators to its implementation. Conventional content analysis was first used to analyze the interviews and gain direct information based on the participants unique perspectives. Subsequently, the generated themes were delineated and mapped following a multilevel framework. RESULTS: Patients and clinicians indicated that the intervention was easy to use, integrated well into their routines, and removed practical barriers to titration. Key implementation facilitators from the patients perspective included the reduction in clinic visits and daily monitoring of their condition, whereas clinicians emphasized the benefits of rapid drug titration and efficient patient management. Key implementation barriers included the resources necessary to support the intervention and lack of physician remuneration. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents results from a real-world implementation assessment of remote titration facilitated by telemonitoring. It is among the first to provide insight into the perception of the remote titration process by clinicians and patients. Our findings indicate that the relative advantages that remote titration presents over standard care strongly appeal to both clinicians and patients. However, to ensure uptake and adherence, it is important to ensure that suitable patients are enrolled and the impact on the physicians workload is minimized. The implementation of remote titration is now more critical than ever, as it can help provide access to care for patients during times when physical distancing is required.

The clinical characteristics and hospital mortality rate were analyzed and compared between the patients with or without myocardial injury, which was defined with 3 times higher serum cardiac troponin value. Results: The age of the 54 patients was 68.0(59.8, 74.3) years.

METHODS We performed a 10-year retrospective review of catheterizations performed in patients after ASO in our institution with a focus on adverse events. RESULTS Diagnostic and interventional catheterizations were performed in 47 patients. In 29 patients, 37 interventional procedures performed, which included pulmonary artery angioplasty and/or stenting. In this group, there were five major adverse events (14%), including three aorto-pulmonary fistulae and one coronary artery compression among patients having stent implantation or stent redilation. In addition, there were 6/37 (16%) intended stent procedures, which were aborted because there appeared to be high-risk of significant adverse events. CONCLUSIONS This review suggests that percutaneous intervention on pulmonary artery stenosis after ASO has high-risk and should be undertaken advisedly. Prior thorough evaluation of coronary arteries is mandatory as coronary reimplantation sites may be adjacent to sites of pulmonary artery stenosis.

However, the impacts of COVID-19-associated financial stress on maternal depression in pregnancy has not been investigated. METHODS: Here, we evaluated whether COVID-19-associated financial stress was associated with increased likelihood of a clinically significant depression score (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score &#8805; 15) among pregnant women living in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data come from an online survey administered to a convenience sample in April 2020 (N = 2099). RESULTS: Forty-three percent of participants reported experiencing financial stress as a result of the pandemic, while 24% of participants had a clinically significant depression score. COVID-19-related financial stress was significantly associated with increased likelihood of a clinically significant depression score, even after adjustment for covariates including participant education and income (adjusted Odds Ratio: 2.23, 95% CI = 1.80, 2.77, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Financial stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with more than two times the likelihood of depression during pregnancy, which could impact birth outcomes and long-term offspring health.","output":"COVID-19-related financial stress associated with higher likelihood of depression among pregnant women living in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causes much more severe disease in adults than in children.

Allocation is usually done on the basis of a workload estimation, which is performed by human experts. Experts have to dedicate a significant amount of time to the workload estimation, and the usefulness of estimations depends on the experts ability to understand very different conditions and situations. Machine learning-based predictors can help in reduce the burden on human experts, and can provide some guarantees at least in terms of repeatability of the delivered performance. However, it is unclear how good their estimations would be, compared to those of experts.

Neuroimaging studies of reward-modulated inhibitory control can identify potential objective markers of impairment and may deepen our understanding of why probands engage in costly behaviors leading to adverse outcomes. The study aimed to identify reward-modulated inhibitory control neural circuitries, their association with ADHD symptoms, and real-world implications of a decreased capacity to engage in reward-modulated inhibitory control. METHODS: A total of 106 adults (90% male) with rigorous childhood diagnoses of ADHD were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging during the Monetary Incentive Go/NoGo task. Adulthood symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity based on self- and informant report were assessed. The number of lifetime attempts taken to quit smoking were also assessed as an exemplar real-world outcome. RESULTS: Hyperactivity/impulsivity was negatively associated with activation in the pallidum and primary motor cortex when inhibiting a previously rewarded Go stimulus that yielded a small immediate reward in order to obtain a larger reward later on. Reduced recruitment of the pallidal-thalamic-motor circuit mediated the negative association between hyperactivity/impulsivity and reward-modulated inhibitory control accuracy. Reduced pallidum activation, in response to reward-modulated inhibitory control, was also associated with more attempts made to successfully quit smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Probands with persistent hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms have alterations in brain regions that calculate the value of inhibiting an action that yields an immediate reward in order to obtain delayed larger rewards. This deficit results in poor inhibitory control on basic tasks and during real-world behaviors that rely on similar processes.","output":"Reduced Activation in the Pallidal-Thalamic-Motor Pathway Is Associated With Deficits in Reward-Modulated Inhibitory Control in Adults With a History of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital technologies became especially important for the efficient progress of the learning process in the time of COVID-19 pandemic. The canonical model of study made way for off-campus e-learning, built on information systems and media resources. This rapid transition highlighted some challenges and barriers that obstruct the successful implementation of e-learning. In this regard, this research aims at an overview of international students perception and readiness for e-learning in the time of COVID-19 pandemic. The study was based on secondary empirical data obtained from surveys of students from the USA, Germany, Poland, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Indonesia, and the Philippines. We attempted to structure the data by essential determinants, including the COVID-19 morbidity rate, income per capita, and Internet penetration rate. At the beginning of the research, we stated the hypotheses that capture our common vision of current trends. The results show that the countries with relatively high gross national income per capita show a higher Internet penetration rate. High-income countries have a higher level of students satisfaction with e-learning than low-income countries with low Internet penetration rates. In terms of various perceptions and readiness of students for e-learning, we observed similar problems in its implementation and development. We found almost non-available mass media intended for learning and information educational resources in the countries we explored. There are also problems with Internet access, slow adjustment of students to e-learning, and e-learning teaching skills among professors. ?

METHODS: We examine CSCs in 35 states and code how they approach disability, comparing states that have revised their plans to those that have not. We offer ethical and legal analyses evaluating to what extent changes to state policy aligned with disability rights law and ethics during the early pandemic and subsequently, as stakeholder engagement grew. FINDINGS: While disability rights views were not well represented in CSCs that were not updated or updated early in the pandemic, states that revised their plans later in the pandemic were more aligned with advocate priorities. However, many CSCs continue to include concerning provisions, especially the reliance on long-term survival, which implicates considerations of both disability rights and racial justice. CONCLUSIONS: The disability rights movement's successes in influencing state triage policy should inform future CSCs and set the stage for further work on how stakeholders influence bioethics policy debates.

In contrast to the many published papers on the topic, we take a top-down approach to 6G. We present a holistic discussion of 6G systems beginning with the lifestyle and societal changes driving the need for next generation networks, to the technical requirements needed to enable 6G applications, through to the challenges, as well as possibilities for practically realizable system solutions across all layers of the Open Systems Interconnection stack. Since many of the 6G applications will need access to an order-of-magnitude more spectrum, utilization of frequencies between 100 GHz and 1 THz becomes of paramount importance. We comprehensively characterize the limitations that must be overcome to realize working systems in these bands; and provide a unique perspective on the physical, as well as higher layer challenges relating to the design of next generation core networks, new modulation and coding methods, novel multiple access techniques, antenna arrays, wave propagation, radio-frequency transceiver design, as well as real-time signal processing. We rigorously discuss the fundamental changes required in the core networks of the future, such as the redesign or significant reduction of the transport architecture that serves as a major source of latency.

This method has been demonstrated on LIGO-Virgo observations to provide stringent constraints on post-Newtonian predictions of the inspiral and to assess systematic biases that may arise in such parameterized tests. Here, we detail the anatomy of our framework for aligned-spin waveform models. We explore the effects of higher modes in the underlying signal on tests of GR through analyses of two unequal-mass, simulated binary signals similar to GW190412 and GW190814. We show that the inclusion of higher modes improves both the precision and the accuracy of the measurement of the deviation parameters. Our testing framework also allows us to vary the underlying baseline GR waveform model and the frequency at which the non-GR inspiral corrections are tapered off. We find that to optimize the GR test of high-mass binaries, comprehensive studies would need to be done to determine the best choice of the tapering frequency as a function of the binary's properties.

This study aimed to evaluate surveillance of HCWs and estimate the serial interval and incubation period of COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 149 HCWs and 36 certain infector-infectee pairs between 19th March 2020 and 1st November 2020 in a university hospital were included in the study. Epidemiological characteristics were recorded. Serial interval and incubation period were estimated using parametric accelerated failure time models. RESULTS: Forty HCWs (26.8%) were detected via contact-based surveillance. Of 100 HCWs epidemiologically linked with a confirmed COVID-19 case, 36 (36%) had contact with a colleague. The median serial interval was 3.93 days (95% CI: 3.17-4.83). Of symptomatic HCWs, 97.5% had developed symptoms 13.71 (95% CI: 9.39-18.73) days after symptom onset of the primary case.

We synthesized results from 14 meta-analyses representing 145 randomized controlled trials and 47,940 participants. We identified 34 effect sizes representing unique pairings of participants, intervention, comparisons, and outcome (PICO) and graded the strength of the evidence as using umbrella review methodology. We failed to find convincing evidence of efficacy (i.e., n > 1000, p < 10(?6), I(2) < 50%, absence of publication bias); publication bias was rarely assessed for the representative effect sizes. Eight effect sizes provided highly suggestive evidence (i.e., n > 1000, p < 10(?6)), including smartphone interventions outperforming inactive controls on measures of psychological symptoms and quality of life (ds = 0.32 to 0.47) and text message-based interventions outperforming non-specific controls and active controls for smoking cessation (ds = 0.31 and 0.19, respectively). The magnitude of effects and strength of evidence tended to diminish as comparison conditions became more rigorous (i.e., inactive to active, non-specific to specific). Four effect sizes provided suggestive evidence, 14 effect sizes provided weak evidence, and eight effect sizes were non-significant. Despite substantial heterogeneity, no moderators were identified. Adverse effects were not reported.

HFRS is characterized by strong systemic inflammation and NK cells are highly activated in HFRS, suggesting that also other ILCs might be responding to infection. Methods. Here we phenotypically analyzed peripheral ILCs in acute and convalescent PUUV-infected HFRS patients. Additionally, plasma levels of soluble factors and viral load were analyzed. Findings. Overall, the frequencies of NK cells and naive ILCs were reduced while the frequency of ILC2, in particular the ILC2-lineage committed c-Kitlo ILC2 subset, was increased during acute HFRS. Interestingly, we observed a negative correlation between viral load and frequencies of both NK and non-NK ILCs in acute HFRS. Phenotypically, ILCs displayed an activated profile with increased proliferation, and showed altered expression of several homing markers during acute HFRS. In line with the observation of activated ILCs, plasma levels of inflammatory proteins, including the ILC-associated cytokines interleukin (IL)-13, IL-23, IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), were elevated during acute HFRS. Interpretation. These findings indicate a general involvement of ILCs in response to human hantavirus infection. Further, this constitutes the first comprehensive study of ILCs in a hantavirus-caused disease, aiding in further understanding the role of these cells in disease pathogenesis and in human viral infections in general.

Using fractionation-seq, we unexpectedly identified several hundred APA genes in human cells whose distal polyA isoforms are retained in chromatin/nuclear matrix and whose proximal polyA isoforms are released into the cytoplasm. Global metabolic PAS-seq and Nanopore long-read RNA-sequencing provide further evidence that the strong distal polyA sites are processed first and the resulting transcripts are subsequently anchored in chromatin/nuclear matrix to serve as precursors for further processing at proximal polyA sites. Inserting an autocleavable ribozyme between the proximal and distal polyA sites, coupled with a Cleave-seq approach that we describe here, confirms that the distal polyA isoform is indeed the precursor to the proximal polyA isoform. Therefore, unlike alternative splicing, APA sites are recognized independently, and in many cases, in a sequential manner. This provides a versatile strategy to regulate gene expression in mammalian cells.","output":"Alternative polyadenylation by sequential activation of distal and proximal PolyA sites."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The book was published at a time when, amidst the Covid crisis, the expansion of tourism and short-term rentals ground to a halt, and when Airbnb landlords had to look for alternative sources of income The proliferation of short-term rentals in the last decade, of which the overwhelming majority are being offered through the online platform Airbnb, has been an important policy issue Airbnb, short-term rentals and the future of housing: by Lily M Hoffman and Barbara Schmitter-Heisler, Abingdon, Routledge, 2021, 150 pp , 25 (paperback) [Extracted from the article] Copyright of Planning Perspectives is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Airbnb, short-term rentals and the future of housing: by Lily M.

Design | Systematic review. Data Sources | Electronic search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, ProQuest Coronavirus Research Database, LitCOVID, and Google Scholar between January and April 2021, and manual search for relevant citations from review articles. Eligibility Criteria | Cross-sectional studies, cohort studies, randomised control trials, and case-control studies with participant data concerning long COVID symptomatology or abnormal functioning. Data Extraction | Studies were screened and assessed for risk of bias by two independent reviewers, with conflicts resolved with a third reviewer. The AXIS tool was utilised to appraise the quality of the evidence. Data were extracted and collated using a data extraction tool in Microsoft Excel. Results | Of the 1,145 studies screened, 39 were included, all describing adult cohorts with long COVID and sample sizes ranging from 32 to 1,733. Studies included data pertaining to symptomatology, pulmonary functioning, chest imaging, cognitive functioning, psychological disorder, and/or quality of life. Fatigue presented as the most prevalent symptom during both OSC and PCS at 43% and 44%, respectively. Sleep disorder (36%; 33%), dyspnoea (31%; 40%), and cough (26%; 22%) followed in prevalence. Abnormal spirometry (FEV1 <80% predicted) was observed in 15% and 11%, and abnormal chest imaging observed in 34% and 28%, respectively. Cognitive impairments were also evident (20%; 15%), as well as anxiety (28%; 34%) and depression (25%; 32%). Decreased quality of life was reported by 40% of patients with OSC and 57% by those with PCS. Conclusions | The prevalences of OSC and PCS were highly variable. Reported symptoms covered a wide range of body systems, with general overlap in frequencies between the two phases. However, abnormalities in lung function and imaging seemed to be more common in OSC, whilst anxiety, depression, and poor quality of life seemed more frequent in PCS.

We will evaluate some of the proposed arguments both in favour and against the prioritisation of HCW and also consider which clinical circumstances might warrant prioritising HCW and why could it be ethically appropriate to do so. We conclude that prioritising HCW's access to protective equipment, diagnostic tests or even prophylactic or therapeutic drug regimes and vaccines might be ethically defensible. However, prioritising HCWs to receive intensive care unit (ICU) beds or ventilators is a much more nuanced decision, in which arguments such as instrumental value or reciprocity might not be enough, and economic and systemic values will need to be considered.","output":"Should healthcare workers be prioritised during the COVID-19 pandemic?

METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study on consecutive NHS patients attending three private hospitals between 4 May 2020 and 16 June 2020. Patients attended preoperative assessment, including coronavirus disease (COVID-19) symptom screening, were instructed to self-isolate for 14 days and had a negative COVID-19 swab within 72 hours of surgery. Patient age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, body mass index, surgery performed, type of anaesthetic and length of stay were collected. Our primary outcome was a positive COVID-19 swab, secondary outcomes were COVID-19 symptoms, readmission, surgical complications and mortality. RESULTS: Between 4 May 2020 and 16 June 2020, 191 patients were admitted to three private hospitals for elective surgery; 121 (67%) patients underwent general or regional anaesthetic, 179 patients were ASA grades 1 or 2 (94%) and 12 (6%) were ASA 3.

Although periodontal bacteria have been shown to influence respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia, the synergistic effect of S. pneumoniae and Porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontopathic bacterium, on pneumococcal infections is unclear. To investigate whether P. gingivalis accelerates pneumococcal infections, we tested the effects of inoculating P. gingivalis culture supernatant (PgSup) into S. pneumoniae-infected mice. Mice were intratracheally injected with S. pneumoniae and PgSup to induce pneumonia, and lung histopathological sections and the absolute number and frequency of neutrophils and macrophages in the lung were analyzed. Proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression was examined by qPCR and ELISA. Inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in S. pneumoniae-infected mice and S. pnemoniae and PgSup mixed-infected mice, and mixed-infected mice showed more pronounced inflammation in lung. The ratios of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils were not significantly different between the lungs of S. pneumoniae-infected mice and those of mixed-infected mice. PgSup synergistically increased TNF- expression/production and IL-17 production compared with S. pneumoniae infection alone. We demonstrated that PgSup enhanced inflammation in pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae, suggesting that virulence factors produced by P. gingivalis are involved in the exacerbation of respiratory tract infections such as aspiration pneumonia.","output":"Porphyromonas gingivalis Components/Secretions Synergistically Enhance Pneumonia Caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This book investigates and scrutinizes the lessons learned in the Republic of Korea during a five-decade swath of disasters C from 1948 to 2015 C and results in the disaster response policy change model in the wake of major disasters for resilience building.

Since no specific treatment is available, this study aims to explore the anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents including favipiravir and remdesivir for treating HCoV-NL63 infection. We first successfully modelled the 3D structure of HCoV-NL63 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) based on the experimentally solved SARS-CoV-2 RdRp structure. Molecular docking indicated that favipiravir has similar binding affinities to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 RdRp with LibDock scores of 75 and 74, respectively. The LibDock scores of remdesivir to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 were 135 and 151, suggesting that remdesivir may have a higher affinity to HCoV-NL63 compared to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. In cell culture models infected with HCoV-NL63, both favipiravir and remdesivir significantly inhibited viral replication and production of infectious viruses. Overall, remdesivir compared to favipiravir is more potent in inhibiting HCoV-NL63 in cell culture. Importantly, there is no evidence of resistance development upon long-term exposure to remdesivir. Furthermore, combining favipiravir or remdesivir with the clinically used antiviral cytokine interferon-alpha resulted in synergistic effects. These findings provided a proof-of-concept that anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, in particular remdesivir, have the potential to be repurposed for treating HCoV-NL63 infection.","output":"Comparative assessment of favipiravir and remdesivir against human coronavirus NL63 in molecular docking and cell culture models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"G9 group A rotaviruses (RVAs) are considered important pathogens in pigs and humans, and pigs are hypothesized to be a potential host reservoir for human. However, intestinal and extra-intestinal pathogenicity and viremia of porcine G9 RVAs has remained largely unreported. In this study, colostrum-deprived piglets were orally infected with a porcine G9P[23] or G9P[7] strain. Histopathologically, both strains induced characteristic small intestinal lesions. Degeneration and necrosis of parenchymal cells were observed in the extra-intestinal tissues, but most predominantly in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). RVA antigen was continuously detected in the small intestinal mucosa and MLNs, but only transiently in cells of the liver, lung, and choroid plexus. Viral RNA levels were much higher in the feces and the MLNs compared to other tissues. The onset of viremia occurred at day post infection (DPI) 1 with the amount of viral RNA reaching its peak at DPI 3 or 5, before decreasing significantly at DPI 7 and remaining detectable until DPI 14. Our data suggest that porcine G9 RVAs have a strong small intestinal tropism, are highly virulent for piglets, have the ability to escape the small intestine, spread systemically via viremia, and replicate in extra-intestinal tissues. In addition, MLNs might act as a secondary site for viral amplification and the portal of systemic entry.

According to previous studies, the circumstances of coronavirus disease-related deaths may lead to dysfunctional grief. The purpose of this study was to introduce the Polish adaptation of the Pandemic Grief Scale (PGS) as well as to assess the relationship between dysfunctional grief due to a COVID-19 death, resilience and perceived social support. The adaptation was carried out on a general population sample of 286 individuals aged 18-54 years, with the evaluation being performed on a group comprising 214 people aged 18-78 years, who lost a loved one during the pandemic. The Polish version of PGS revealed a single-factor structure with strong internal consistency (&#945; = 0.89). The PGS scores were associated with measures of complicated grief (Inventory of Complicated Grief), depression (Kutcher Adolescent Depression Scale) and lower resilience (Resilience Scale 14), which confirmed the scale's convergent validity. No relation between PGS scores and health behaviors (Inventory of Health Behaviors) was observed, which confirmed the scale's discriminant validity. The results of the bootstrapping technique revealed that resilience mediates the relationship between perceived social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support) and dysfunctional grief (total mediation). The results of this study suggest the need for practitioners to focus on resilience-enhancing interventions and perceived social support in order to improve mental health in people who lost their loved ones during the new coronavirus pandemic.","output":"Pandemic grief in Poland: adaptation of a measure and its relationship with social support and resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Paradoxical intravascular bullet embolism involving the aortic arch (AA) is a rare and highly lethal condition.

During the third pandemic phase there has been an improvement in the management and treatment of COVID-19, so mortality and predictors may have changed. A prospective study was planned to identify predictors of mortality during the third pandemic phase. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 15 December 2020 to 15 May 2021, 208 patients were hospitalized (median age: 64 years; males: 58.6%); 83% had a median of 2 (IQR,1-4) comorbidities; pneumonia was present in 89.8%. Patients were monitored remotely for respiratory function and ECG trace for 24 hours/day. Management and treatment were done following the timing and dosage recommended by international guidelines. RESULTS: 79.2% of patients necessitated O2-therapy. ARDS was present in 46.1% of patients and 45.4% received non-invasive ventilation and 11.1% required ICU treatment. 38% developed arrhythmias which were identified early by telemetry and promptly treated. The in-hospital mortality rate was 10%. At multivariate analysis independent predictors of mortality were: older age (R-R for70 years: 5.44), number of comorbidities 3 (R-R 2.72), eGFR 60 ml/min (RR 2.91), high d-Dimer (R-R for1,000 ng/ml:7.53), and low PaO2/FiO2 (R-R for <200: 3.21). CONCLUSIONS: Management and treatment adherence to recommendations, use of telemetry, and no overcrowding appear to reduce mortality. Advanced age, number of comorbidities, severe renal failure, high d-Dimer and low P/F remain predictors of poor outcome. The data help to identify current high-risk COVID-19 patients in whom management has yet to be optimized, who require the greatest therapeutic effort, and subjects in whom vaccination is mandatory.","output":"Predictors of in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients and the role of telemetry in an internal medicine ward during the third phase of the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Comprehensive fetal care centers address congenital anomalies by developing pre- and post-natal care plans in a multidisciplinary format. To reduce exposure during the Coronavirus Infectious Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) broadened access to telehealth services. We assessed provider satisfaction with the rapid transition from in-person prenatal visits to multidisciplinary consultations via telehealth as an adaptive response to the pandemic. METHODS: Patients referred to an urban academic fetal care center during the first 6 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic underwent advanced imaging including fetal MRI, focused ultrasound, and fetal echocardiography. Subsequently, multidisciplinary telehealth consultations occurred with all providers attending virtually. Patients were given the option of attending the multidisciplinary telehealth consultation in a conference room in the hospital or from home. During these meetings, relevant images were reviewed with all participants via screen sharing through a secure video platform. Provider satisfaction with the telehealth paradigm was assessed using an electronic survey. RESULTS: Twenty-two surveys were administered with a response rate of 82%. 89% of providers were highly satisfied with the telehealth format. 72% of providers would prefer the multidisciplinary telehealth format to an in-person visit for future visits after COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. 22% of providers would leave the choice to the patient's family. One provider preferred in-person visits. Some providers noted that virtual conferences limited the ability to draw pictures, show educational materials, and provide emotional support. CONCLUSION: Providers were overwhelmingly supportive of continuing multidisciplinary telehealth conferences for complex prenatal consultations, even after restrictions are lifted, which has led to the continuation of this model for the duration of the pandemic. Providers highlighted the convenience and improved care coordination across specialties. Further studies to examine the patient experience with virtual consultations are warranted.","output":"Telehealth multidisciplinary prenatal consultation during the COVID-19 pandemic: enhancing patient care coordination while maintaining high provider satisfaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is currently experiencing an ongoing pandemic of an infectious disease named coronavirus disease 2019 (i.e., COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Computed Tomography (CT) plays an important role in assessing the severity of the infection and can also be used to identify those symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers. With a surge of the cumulative number of COVID-19 patients, radiologists are increasingly stressed to examine the CT scans manually. Therefore, an automated 3D CT scan recognition tool is highly in demand since the manual analysis is time-consuming for radiologists and their fatigue can cause possible misjudgment. However, due to various technical specifications of CT scanners located in different hospitals, the appearance of CT images can be significantly different leading to the failure of many automated image recognition approaches. The multi-domain shift problem for the multi-center and multi-scanner studies is therefore nontrivial that is also crucial for a dependable recognition and critical for reproducible and objective diagnosis and prognosis. In this paper, we proposed a COVID-19 CT scan recognition model namely coronavirus information fusion and diagnosis network (CIFD-Net) that can efficiently handle the multi-domain shift problem via a new robust weakly supervised learning paradigm. Our model can resolve the problem of different appearance in CT scan images reliably and efficiently while attaining higher accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods.","output":"Robust Weakly Supervised Learning for COVID-19 Recognition Using Multi-Center CT Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Housing and feeding are integral to calf rearing, and must meet calf needs while remaining functional for the farmer. This study compared health, behavior, growth, and labor requirements of calves housed in groups indoors and fed via an automatic or manual milk feeding system compared to calves manually fed in individual or group hutches outdoors. Seventy-six (49 Holstein Friesian [HF] and 27 HF  Jersey) dairy heifer calves were balanced for birth weight (35.2  4.95 kg), birth date (1 February  7.2 d) and breed. The experiment was a randomized block design with four treatments; 1) indoor group housing with automated feeding (IN_AUTO; 12 calves per pen), 2) indoor group housing with manual feeding (IN_MAN; 12 calves per pen), 3) outdoor group hutch with manual feeding (OUT_G_MAN; 8 calves per pen), and 4) outdoor individual hutch with manual feeding (OUT_I_MAN; 6 calves: 1 per pen). Calves in OUT_treatments moved outdoors at 18 d ( 5.9 d). Each treatment was replicated once. Milk allowance increased gradually from 6 to 8 L/day (15% reconstitution rate) with ad libitum fresh water, concentrates, and hay offered from 3 d old. Gradual weaning occurred at 8 wk old. Measurements were divided into period 1; before movement outdoors, and period 2; after movement outdoors. Health was similar among treatments, regardless of period, with the most frequent score being zero (i.e., healthy). Summarized, standing and lying were observed 24.3% and 29.8%, respectively, in OUT_I_MAN calves, compared to 8.0% and 49.1%, for the other systems, which were similar. No difference in bodyweight (BW) existed between treatments, except at weaning where BW was lower for OUT_I_MAN (67.4  2.84 kg) compared to IN_MAN (74.2  2.01 kg), and day 102 where OUT_I_MAN (94.1  2.85 kg) were lighter than IN_AUTO (101.1  2.10 kg) (P = 0.047). Total labor input was greatest for OUT_I_MAN (00:02:02 per calf per day; hh:mm:ss) and least for IN_AUTO (00:00:21 per calf per day) (P < 0.001). The labor for feeding (00:00:29 per calf per day), feeding inspection (00:00:10 per calf per day), and cleaning equipment (00:00:30 per calf per day) was greatest for OUT_I_MAN. All calves showed good health and growth patterns. Differences in behavior expressed by calves in the OUT_I_MAN, compared to other treatments may indicate compromised welfare. Thus, although outdoor group hutches do not negatively impact calves, indoor housing, particularly using automated feeders, can improve labor efficiency.","output":"A comparison of indoor and outdoor calf housing systems using automated and manual feeding methods and their effect on calf health, behavior, growth, and labor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rotator cuff tears are common musculoskeletal injuries often requiring surgical intervention with high failure rates. Currently, pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) are used for treatment of long-bone fracture and lumbar and cervical spine fusion surgery. Clinical studies examining the effects of PEMF on soft tissue healing show promising results. Therefore, we investigated the role of PEMF on rotator cuff healing using a rat rotator cuff repair model. We hypothesized that PEMF exposure following rotator cuff repair would improve tendon mechanical properties, tissue morphology, and alter in vivo joint function. Seventy adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to three groups: bilateral repair with PEMF (n = 30), bilateral repair followed by cage activity (n = 30), and uninjured control with cage activity (n = 10). Rats in the surgical groups were sacrificed at 4, 8, and 16 weeks. Control group was sacrificed at 8 weeks. Passive joint mechanics and gait analysis were assessed over time. Biomechanical analysis and CT was performed on left shoulders; histological analysis on right shoulders. Results indicate no differences in passive joint mechanics and ambulation. At 4 weeks the PEMF group had decreased cross-sectional area and increased modulus and maximum stress. At 8 weeks the PEMF group had increased modulus and more rounded cells in the midsubstance. At 16 weeks the PEMF group had improved bone quality. Therefore, results indicate that PEMF improves early tendon healing and does not alter joint function in a rat rotator cuff repair model. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

We report a case of acute parotitis and submandibular sialadenitis from COVID-19 infection in an older adult that contributed to persistent dysphagia. Methods Retrospective chart review. Results An 81-year-old male resident of long-term care with a past medical history of dementia, ischemic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, diabetes, and depression was hospitalized for acute hypoxic respiratory failure from COVID-19. He was treated with remdesivir and dexamethasone. On day 21 of admission, he developed a new right-sided preauricular swelling. Laboratory showed leukocytosis of 12.7. CT head and neck revealed right parotitis with multifocal rim-enhancing collections, numerous small microabscesses, and sialadenitis involving the right subjacent submandibular gland. A subtle enhancement of the left parotid gland was suggestive of additional involvement as well. Parotid drainage was cultured and grew multiple organisms - Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Corynebacterium striatum. The patient was managed conservatively with antibiotics, parotid gland massage, and oral care. Two weeks later, follow-up imaging showed resolving parotitis with a resolution of intraparotid collections.

Conclusions Acute parotitis and sialadenitis are uncommon and underreported manifestations of COVID-19. The onset of symptoms ranges from 3 to 31 days. Interestingly, acute parotitis can also be the initial presenting symptom of COVID-19. The high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors in the salivary glands make these sites vulnerable to the virus.

However, the requirement for serum/plasma limits serological testing to clinical settings where it is feasible to collect and process venous blood. To address this problem we developed a serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies that requires only a single drop of capillary whole blood, collected from a simple finger prick and dried on filter paper (dried blood spot, DBS). Methods Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was optimized to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. DBS samples were eluted overnight and transferred to a 96-well plate coated with antigen, and anti-human IgG-HRP was used to generate signal in proportion to bound antibody. DBS samples spiked with anti-SARS IgG antibody, and samples from known positive and negative cases, were compared to evaluate assay performance. Results Analysis of samples with known concentrations of anti-SARS IgG produced the expected pattern of dose-response.

Here, we collected measures on perceived stress, resilience, and behavioral coping strategies, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in a cross-sectional sample of 141 community dwelling older adults (mean age = 74.4  8.4, 59% females) who were part of two longitudinal observational studies in Massachusetts, U.S. Our results indicate that participants demonstrated moderate levels of stress related to COVID-19 and showed relatively high levels of resilience. Higher resilience was associated with greater use of adaptive coping behaviors and less use of maladaptive coping behaviors. The use of maladaptive coping strategies was associated with more stress. Moreover, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that resilience was the strongest unique predictor of stress, thus, largely accounting for the observed coping-outcome associations. Individual differences in resilience levels moderated the effects of two coping strategies (planning and self-blame) on stress. Specifically, planning was associated with increased levels of stress for people with low resilience. In contrast, high personal resilience attenuated the negative effect of self-blame on their stress levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that resilience is critical for coping with stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future approaches for augmenting resilience could prove to be important potential interventions to help support older adults navigating stressful situations as well as lessen adverse effects on neurocognitive and mental health in the future.","output":"Stress, resilience, and coping strategies in a sample of community-dwelling older adults during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused dramatic and unprecedented impacts on both global health and economies Many governments are now proposing recovery packages to get back to normal, but the 2019 Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Global Assessment indicated that business as usual has created widespread ecosystem degradation Therefore, a post-COVID world needs to tackle the economic drivers that create ecological disruptions In this perspective, we discuss a number of tools across a range of actors for both short-term stimulus measures and longer-term revamping of global, national, and local economies that take biodiversity into account These include measures to shift away from activities that damage biodiversity and toward those supporting ecosystem resilience, including through incentives, regulations, fiscal policy, and employment programs By treating the crisis as an opportunity to reset the global economy, we have a chance to reverse decades of biodiversity and ecosystem losses","output":"Ensuring a Post-COVID Economic Agenda Tackles Global Biodiversity Loss"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Health care systems in most European countries were temporarily restructured to provide as much capacity as possible for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Subsequently, all elective surgeries had to be cancelled and postponed for months. The aim of the present study was to assess the pretreatment health status before and after COVID-19-related cancellation and the psychosocial distress caused by the cancellation. METHODS: For this study, a questionnaire was developed collecting sociodemographic data and information on health status before and after the cancellation. To assess psychosocial distress, the validated depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), was implemented. PHQ-9-Scores of 10 and above were considered to indicate moderate or severe depressive symptoms. In total, 119 patients whose elective orthopaedic surgery was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic were surveyed once at least 8 weeks after the cancellation. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients (65%; 34 female, 43 male) completed the questionnaire and were included. The predominant procedures were total knee arthroplasty (TKA), hip arthroscopy and foot and ankle surgery. The mean pain level significantly increased from 5.5  2.2 at the time of the initially scheduled surgery to 6.2  2.5 at the time of the survey (p < 0.0001). The pain level before cancellation of the surgery was significantly higher in female patients (p = 0.029). An increased analgetic consumption was identified in 46% of all patients. A mean PHQ-9 score of 6.1  4.9 was found after cancellation. PHQ-9 scores of 10 or above were found in 14% of patients, and 8% exhibited scores of 15 points or above. Significantly higher PHQ-9 scores were seen in female patients (p = 0.046). No significant differences in PHQ-9 scores were found among age groups, procedures or reasons for cancellation. CONCLUSION: Cancellation of elective orthopaedic surgery resulted in pain levels that were significantly higher than when the surgery was scheduled, leading to increased analgesic use. Additionally, significant psychosocial distress due to the cancellation was identified in some patients, particularly middle-aged women. Despite these results, confidence in the national health care system and in the treating orthopaedic surgeons was not affected.

In animal experiments, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs) are reported to suppress the downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and they may inhibit the worsening of pathological conditions. We aimed to examine whether preceding use of ACEIs and ARBs affected the clinical manifestations and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. One hundred fifty-one consecutive patients (mean age 60  19 years) with polymerase-chain-reaction proven severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who were admitted to six hospitals in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, were analyzed in this multicenter retrospective observational study. Among all COVID-19 patients, in the multiple regression analysis, older age (age &#8805; 65 years) was significantly associated with the primary composite outcome (odds ratio (OR) 6.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.28-22.78, P < 0.001), which consisted of (i) in-hospital death, (ii) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, (iii) mechanical ventilation, including invasive and noninvasive methods, and (iv) admission to the intensive care unit. In COVID-19 patients with hypertension, preceding ACEI/ARB use was significantly associated with a lower occurrence of new-onset or worsening mental confusion (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.002-0.69, P = 0.02), which was defined by the confusion criterion, which included mild disorientation or hallucination with an estimation of medical history of mental status, after adjustment for age, sex, and diabetes. In conclusion, older age was a significant contributor to a worse prognosis in COVID-19 patients, and ACEIs/ARBs could be beneficial for the prevention of confusion in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.","output":"Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 in Kanagawa, Japan: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: We sought to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia in Xiamen, which is a city in Fujian Province, China.

The present study was undertaken to analyse the efficiency of the waste management service in Spain, using data from 283 municipalities for the period 2005-2015. The analysis consists of two phases: first, the application of panel data order-m frontiers, that allows to obtain a homogeneous estimation of efficiency based on the input-output relationship at the production process (Surroca et al., 2016), and second, the use of bootstrapped truncated regression, considering different municipal sizes. The results obtained show that cost efficiency is increased with selective collection and by certain political and socio-economic factors of the local governments, concretely with the government by a progressive party, coalition governments, a greater financial independence, a greater tourist and industrial activity and a greater proportion of women and of foreign-born residents in the municipality. We also show that municipal direct provision is the least efficient management form for this service. The main contribution made by this study is to examine the influence of different elements of service output (i.e., selection by type of waste vs. non-selection) on cost efficiency.","output":"The selective collection of municipal solid waste and other factors determining cost efficiency.

According to self-determination theory (SDT), when parents' basic needs are met, they are optimally motivated to support their children's learning and create environments that support their children's needs. Using a variable- and person-centered approach, we explored associations between parents' burnout, academic concern, motivational styles and profiles, and need-supportive behavior. Considering the pandemic, we expected parents with increased burnout and academic concern to report higher levels of controlled motivation or belong to a low-quality motivation profile and report less support for their children's needs. Parents with 5- to 8-year-olds were recruited, targeting states in the U.S. with the longest shelter-in-place restrictions (CA, NY), to complete an online survey, resulting in a sample (N = 218) of parents from 38 states in the U.S. Results showed parents exhibiting more autonomous motivation and two latent profiles denoting only motivation quantity but not quality. Higher burnout was related to nonoptimal motivation styles and profiles, while academic concern was related to increased motivation. Parents of older children had increased motivation. Findings highlight that even during a global pandemic, parents showed some levels of optimal motivation to support their children's remote learning.

The shortcomings associated with the traditional surgical approaches create a potential of injury to nearby structures. We present a case of a 43-year-old woman with a superior sulcus neurogenic tumor impinging on the left subclavian vein, who underwent a successful resection without injury to nearby structures. We found that a robotic approach improved visualization of the tumor and nearby structures and increased instrument maneuverability relative to a thoracoscopic approach, along with less pain and recovery time compared with a thoracotomy.

When the amount of accessible cholesterol in the PM exceeds a threshold level, the excess cholesterol moves to the ER where it regulates the SREBP2 pathway and undergoes esterification. We reported previously that the Aster/Gramd1 family of sterol transporters mediates nonvesicular movement of cholesterol from the PM to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in multiple mammalian cell types. Here, we investigated the PM pool of accessible cholesterol in cholesterol-loaded fibroblasts with a knockdown of Aster-A and in mouse macrophages from Aster-B and Aster-A/B-deficient mice. Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) analyses revealed an expansion of the accessible cholesterol pool in cells lacking Aster expression. The increased accessible cholesterol pool in the PM was accompanied by reduced cholesterol to the ER, evident by increased expression of SREBP2-regulated genes. Co-sedimentation experiments with liposomes revealed that the Aster-B GRAM domain binds to membranes in a cholesterol concentration-dependent manner and that the binding is facilitated by the presence of phosphatidylserine.

The pandemic has required pain clinics to transition in-person visits to telemedicine, postpone procedures and cancel face-to-face educational sessions. There are no data on how fellowship programs have adapted. METHODS: A 17-question survey was developed covering topics including changes in education, clinical care, and psychological stress due to the COVID pandemic. The survey was hosted by Qualtrics Inc. and disseminated by the Association of Pain Program Directors on April 10, 2020 to program directors at ACGME-accredited fellowships. Results are reported descriptively and stratified by COVID infection rate, which was calculated from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data on state infections, and census data. RESULTS: Among 107 surveys distributed, 70 (65%) programs responded. Twenty-nine programs were located in states in the upper tertile for per capita infection rates, 17 in the middle third, and 23 in the lowest tertile. Nearly all programs (93%) reported a decreased workload, with 11 (16%) reporting a dramatic decrease (only urgent or emergent cases). Just over half of programs had either already deployed (14%) or credentialed (39%) fellows to provide non-pain care. Higher state infection rates were significantly associated with reduced clinical demand (Rs = 0.31, 95% CI [0.08, 0.51], P = .011) and redeployment of fellows to non-pain areas (Rs = 0.30, 95% CI [0.07, 0.50], P = .013). Larger program size but not infection rate was associated with increased perceived anxiety level of trainees. CONCLUSIONS: We found a shift to online alternatives for clinical care and education, with correlations between per capita infection rates, and clinical care demands and redeployment, but not with overall trainee anxiety levels. It is likely that medicine in general, and pain medicine in particular, will change after COVID-19, with greater emphasis on telemedicine, virtual education, and greater national and international cooperation.

In Cuba, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 11. Elderly with multiple comorbidities have been the most risky population. Although most patients present a mild to moderate disease, some have developed severe symptoms. One of the possible mechanisms underlying rapid disease progression is a cytokine storm, in which interleukin (IL) -6 seems to be a major mediator. Itolizumab is a humanized recombinant anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody (MAb), with the ability of reducing serum interferon gamma (INF-), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and IL-6. Based on these previous results in patients with psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, an expanded access clinical trial was approved by the Cuban regulatory agency for COVID-19 critically, severely and moderately ill patients. RESULTS: We show here a short kinetic of IL-6 serum concentration in the first 24 COVID-19 patients treated with itolizumab. Most of patients were elderly with multiple comorbidities. We found that with one itolizumab dose, the circulating IL-6 decreased in critically and severely ill patients, whereas in moderately ill patients the values didnt rise as compared to their low baseline levels.

By comparing their liver functions tested on the dates of admission and discharge, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, does not directly activate the Hepatitis B virus, so that the risk of liver cell damage for HBV carriers infected with COVID-19 does not increase. Both PA and SAA seem to work as sensitive indicators and can be used to evaluate the prognosis and outcome of these patients.","output":"Clinical characteristics and outcomes of hepatitis B virus carriers infected with COVID-19 at the Jinyintan hospital in WuHan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is the first part of a scientific statement from the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology focused upon the pathophysiology of Takotsubo syndrome and is complimentary to the previous HFA Position Statement on Takotsubo syndrome which focused upon clinical management.

We analyzed a cohort of patients with cancer and coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) reported to the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) to identify prognostic clinical factors, including laboratory measurements and anticancer therapies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with active or historical cancer and a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis recorded between 17 March and 18 November 2020 were included. The primary outcome was COVID-19 severity measured on an ordinal scale (uncomplicated, hospitalized, admitted to intensive care unit, mechanically ventilated, died within 30 days). Multivariable regression models included demographics, cancer status, anticancer therapy and timing, COVID-19-directed therapies, and laboratory measurements (among hospitalized patients). RESULTS: A total of 4966 patients were included (median age 66 years, 51% female, 50% non-Hispanic white); 2872 (58%) were hospitalized and 695 (14%) died; 61% had cancer that was present, diagnosed, or treated within the year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Older age, male sex, obesity, cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, non-Hispanic black race, Hispanic ethnicity, worse Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, recent cytotoxic chemotherapy, and hematologic malignancy were associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Among hospitalized patients, low or high absolute lymphocyte count; high absolute neutrophil count; low platelet count; abnormal creatinine; troponin; lactate dehydrogenase; and C-reactive protein were associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Patients diagnosed early in the COVID-19 pandemic (January-April 2020) had worse outcomes than those diagnosed later. Specific anticancer therapies (e.g. R-CHOP, platinum combined with etoposide, and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors) were associated with high 30-day all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical factors (e.g. older age, hematological malignancy, recent chemotherapy) and laboratory measurements were associated with poor outcomes among patients with cancer and COVID-19. Although further studies are needed, caution may be required in utilizing particular anticancer therapies.

The objective of this study is to analyse the influence of the latter changes in labour market status on psychological well-being. For this purpose, an ad-hoc questionnaire featuring socio-demographic and mental health criteria was created. Granted that the pandemic can be viewed as an exogenous shock, the bias caused by the bidirectional problems between the work situation and mental well-being can be tackled. Results indicate that the lockdown exerted a greater negative effect on the self-perceived well-being of unemployed and furloughed persons than on those in employment. Moreover, among those in continuous employment, teleworkers experienced a lesser degree of self-perceived well-being post lockdown as compared to those people remaining in the same work location throughout the COVID-19 crisis. Finally, the lockdown provoked worse effects on the self-perceived well-being of women as compared to men, a result that appears to be related to gender differences in household production. In conclusion, these results could be especially relevant given that the evolution of the pandemic is having ongoing effects on employment and, therefore, on the mental health of workers.","output":"Furloughs, Teleworking and Other Work Situations during the COVID-19 Lockdown: Impact on Mental Well-Being"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Video consultations are currently not commonly used in dentistry; therefore, most clinicians lack experience in using this technology and seeing patients in this way. When implementing video clinics, it is important to assess clinician satisfaction as well as patient satisfaction to allow for developments and improvements, and to ensure that the highest levels of care are provided. Aim To assess patient and clinician satisfaction with the Attend Anywhere video consultations used by the orthodontic team at Croydon University Hospital. Method Two separate satisfaction questionnaires were piloted and developed: one for patients and one for clinicians. For all patients scheduled for a video consultation between 15 May 2020 and 15 June 2020 in the orthodontic department, all clinicians were invited to complete a clinician satisfaction questionnaire at the end of the consultation to assess satisfaction with the encounter. Results In total, 114 patients attended video consultations, for which there were 128 clinician completed questionnaires, as some patients were seen by multiple clinicians on multidisciplinary clinics. Over 89% of clinicians strongly agreed or agreed with all of the satisfaction statements, with the highest levels of satisfaction being for ease of use and convenience. Over 95% of clinicians strongly agreed or agreed that they would recommend using video consultations and over 89% preferred using a video consultation, if appropriate, to a face-to-face appointment. Overall, the highest levels of satisfaction were for retainer reviews. Conclusion High levels of clinician satisfaction were found with the telemedicine clinics in orthodontics across a range of different appointment types and encounters.

However, such variable is not accessible to direct measurement and its estimation requires the solution of a difficult inverse problem.

This makes questionable the use of parametric models which could be unable to capture their full complexity. In this paper we exploit compartmental models which include important COVID-19 peculiarities (like the presence of asymptomatic individuals) and allow the infection rate to assume any continuous-time profile. We show that these models are universal, i.e. capable to reproduce exactly any epidemic evolution, and extract from them closed-form expressions of the infection rate time-course. Building upon such expressions, we then design a regularized estimator able to reconstruct COVID-19 transmission dynamics in continuous-time.

METHODS: A retrospective comparative study was conducted in a 26-bed intensive care unit over a 5-year period. The consecutive patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure who underwent TBLB or TBLC were included to determine the potential etiology. Patients characteristics, procedure related complications, pathological and multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) diagnostic yields, treatment modification and 28-day survival were analyzed. Prognostic factors were identified by Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Forty-five and 25 consecutive patients underwent TBLB and TBLC, respectively. The patients underwent TBLC were more critical. There was no significant difference in overall procedure related complications of patients underwent TBLB and TBLC [15.6% (7/45) vs 28.0% (7/25), p = 0.212]. The rate of pathological diagnostic yield [72.0% (18/25) vs 37.8% (17/45), p = 0.006], MDD diagnostic yield [84.0% (21/25) vs 55.6% (25/45), p = 0.016] and subsequent treatment modification [84.0% (21/25) vs 57.8% (26/45), p = 0.025] in patients underwent TBLC were significantly higher than those in patients underwent TBLB.

However, systemic administration of higher dosages of doxorubicin is hampered by its toxic side effects. In this study, we aim to increase doxorubicin deposition in the primary breast tumour without changing systemic doxorubicin concentration and thus without interfering with systemic efficacy and toxicity. This is to be achieved by combining Lyso-Thermosensitive Liposomal Doxorubicin (LTLD, ThermoDox, Celsion Corporation, Lawrenceville, NJ, USA) with mild local hyperthermia, induced by Magnetic Resonance guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU). When heated above 39.5C, LTLD releases a high concentration of doxorubicin intravascularly within seconds. In the absence of hyperthermia, LTLD leads to a similar biodistribution and antitumour efficacy compared with conventional doxorubicin. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a single-arm phase I study in 12 chemotherapy-na?ve patients with de novo stage IV HER2-negative breast cancer. Previous endocrine treatment is allowed. Study treatment consists of up to six cycles of LTLD at 21-day intervals, administered during MR-HIFU-induced hyperthermia to the primary tumour. We will aim for 60 min of hyperthermia at 40CC42C using a dedicated MR-HIFU breast system (Profound Medical, Mississauga, Canada). Afterwards, intravenous cyclophosphamide will be administered. Primary endpoints are safety, tolerability and feasibility. The secondary endpoint is efficacy, assessed by radiological response. This approach could lead to optimal loco-regional control with less extensive or even no surgery, in de novo stage IV patients and in stage II/III patients allocated to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has obtained ethical approval by the Medical Research Ethics Committee Utrecht (Protocol NL67422.041.18, METC number 18-702). Informed consent will be obtained from all patients before study participation. Results will be published in an academic peer-reviewed journal.

A better understanding of the pathophysiology associated with COVID-19 is crucial to improve treatment modalities and to develop effective prevention strategies. Transcriptomic and proteomic data on the host response against SARS-CoV-2 still have anecdotic character; currently available data from other coronavirus infections are therefore a key source of information. METHODS: We investigated selected molecular aspects of three human coronavirus (HCoV) infections, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, through a network based-approach. A functional analysis of HCoV-host interactome was carried out in order to provide a theoretic host-pathogen interaction model for HCoV infections and in order to translate the results in prediction for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. The 3D model of S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the structure of the corresponding SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV S-glycoprotein. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E and the host interactome were inferred through published protein-protein interactions (PPI) as well as gene co-expression, triggered by HCoV S-glycoprotein in host cells. RESULTS: Although the amino acid sequences of the S-glycoprotein were found to be different between the various HCoV, the structures showed high similarity, but the best 3D structural overlap shared by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, consistent with the shared ACE2 predicted receptor. The host interactome, linked to the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mainly highlighted innate immunity pathway components, such as Toll Like receptors, cytokines and chemokines. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we developed a network-based model with the aim to define molecular aspects of pathogenic phenotypes in HCoV infections. The resulting pattern may facilitate the process of structure-guided pharmaceutical and diagnostic research with the prospect to identify potential new biological targets.","output":"COVID-19: viral-host interactome analyzed by network based-approach model to study pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 pandemic is a novel disease with gradual emergence of its signs and symptoms.

Methods: Our model examines the size of the effect of spacing of the second dose with 6, 12, and 24 week deferred spacing regimens relative to 3 week spacing. Results: Deferring the second dose from 3 weeks to 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks shows progressive benefit to population immunity for any given time period, even with significant one dose efficacy decay. The benefits are influenced by vaccine supply per capita. Conclusion: The longer the second dose is deferred the larger the benefit in initial population immunity, provided one dose efficacy does not significantly wane. Monitoring one dose efficacy duration from the UK or Quebec minimizes this risk, as the gathered data will help ensure the second dose is given at an optimal time. How this information is implemented should vary depending on the population and whether the goal is to optimally protect high risk groups or to increase total population immunity as quickly as possible. Benefits to deferring the second dose are influenced by the length of deferral, one dose efficacy, and vaccine supply per capita. The time to herd immunity could be shortened by 4 weeks with the implementation of a 12 week spacing regimen or 10 weeks with a 24 week spacing regimen.","output":"Modelled Optimization of SARS-Cov-2 Vaccine Distribution: an Evaluation of Second Dose Deferral Spacing of 6, 12, and 24 weeks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Canine rabies transmission was interrupted in NDjamna, Chad, following two mass vaccination campaigns. However, after nine months cases resurged with re-establishment of endemic rabies transmission to pre-intervention levels. Previous analyses investigated district level spatial heterogeneity of vaccination coverage, and dog density; and importation, identifying the latter as the primary factor for rabies resurgence. Here we assess the impact of individual level heterogeneity on outbreak probability, effectiveness of vaccination campaigns and likely time to resurgence after a campaign. Geo-located contact sensors recorded the location and contacts of 237 domestic dogs in NDjamna over a period of 3.5 days. The contact network data showed that urban dogs are socially related to larger communities and constrained by the urban architecture. We developed a network generation algorithm that extrapolates this empirical contact network to networks of large dog populations and applied it to simulate rabies transmission in NDjamna. The model predictions aligned well with the rabies incidence data. Using the model we demonstrated, that major outbreaks are prevented when at least 70% of dogs are vaccinated. The probability of a minor outbreak also decreased with increasing vaccination coverage, but reached zero only when coverage was near total. Our results suggest that endemic rabies in NDjamna may be explained by a series of importations with subsequent minor outbreaks. We show that highly connected dogs hold a critical role in transmission and that targeted vaccination of such dogs would lead to more efficient vaccination campaigns.","output":"The importance of dog population contact network structures in rabies transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"External debt levels will be unprecedented in 2021in this last decade of action to secure the sustainable development goals (SDGs)and mostly in distress for low-income-developing countries (LIDC) and least developed countries (LDCs).

The identification of novel drugs and efficient therapies against these infectious viruses is need of the hour. The eruption of COVID-19 is caused by a novel acute respiratory syndrome virus SARS-CoV-2 which has taken the whole world by storm as it has transformed into a global pandemic. This lethal syndrome is a global health threat to general public which has already affected millions of people. Despite the development of some potential vaccines and repurposed drugs by some Pharma companies, this health emergency needs more attention due to the less efficacy of these vaccines coupled with the emergence of novel and resistant strains of SARS-CoV-2. Due to enormous structural diversity and biological applications, natural products are considered as a wonderful source of drugs for such diseases. Natural product based drugs constitute a substantial proportion of the pharmaceutical market particularly in the therapeutic areas of infectious diseases and oncology. The naturally occurring bioactive antiviral phytochemicals including alkaloids, flavonoids and peptides have been subjected to virtual screening against COVID-19. Since there is no specific medicine available for the treatment of Covid-19, designing new drugs using in silico methods plays an all important role to find that magic bullet which can target this lethal virus. The in silico method is not only quick but economical also when compared to the other conventional methods which are hit and trial methods. Based on this in silico approach, various natural products have been recently identified which might have a potential to inhibit COVID-19 outbreak. These natural products have been shown by these docking studies to interact with the spike protein of the novel coronavirus. This spike protein has been shown to bind to a transmembrane protein called Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), this protein acts as a receptor for the viral spike protein. This comprehensive review article anticipates providing a summary of the authentic and peer reviewed published literature about the potential of natural metabolites that can be developed into possible lead compounds against this new threat of Covid-19. Main focus of the article will be to highlight natural sources of potential anti-coronavirus molecules, mechanism of action, docking studies and the target proteins as well as their toxicity profiles. This review article intends to provide a starting point for the research endeavors that are needed for the design and development of drugs based on pure natural products, their synthetic or semi-synthetic derivatives and standardized plant extracts.

Empirical models were developed using the relations of nutrients (total phosphorus, TP, and total nitrogen, TN) with chlorophyll-a (CHL-a) for efficient lake managements. The empirical models indicated that TP was the key regulating factor for algal growth in agricultural (R2 = 0.69) and power generation (R2 = 0.50) reservoirs. The CHL-a:TP and TN:TP ratios, indicators of phosphorus limitation, were used to validate the phosphorus reduction approach. The mean CHL-a:TP ratio of agricultural reservoirs was 0.60, indicating that algal chlorophyll is potentially limited by TP than any other factors. Agricultural, multipurpose, and power generation reservoirs, based on the N:P ratios, were more P- limited systems than natural lakes and estuarine reservoirs. The trophic state index (TSI) of Korean reservoirs varied between mesotrophy to hypereutrophy based on values of TSI (TP), TSI (CHL-a), and TSI (SD). Agricultural reservoirs were hypereutrophic using the criteria of TSI (CHL-a) and blue-green algae dominated the algal community. Analysis of trophic state index deviation (TSID) indicated that agricultural reservoirs were primarily P limited and other factors had minor effect. In contrast, the trophic status of estuarine and power generation reservoirs and natural lakes was largely modified by non-algal turbidity.

METHODS: A patient survey was conducted in 16 European countries, using a new COVID\\\\19\\\\related questionnaire, developed by ENGAGe and the Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale questionnaire (HADS). The survey was promoted by national patient advocacy groups and charitable organisations. FINDINGS: We collected 1388 forms; 592 online and 796 hard\\\\copy (May, 2020). We excluded 137 due to missing data. Median patients age was 55 years (range: 18C89), 54.7% had ovarian cancer and 15.5% were preoperative. Even though 73.2% of patients named cancer as a risk factor for COVID\\\\19, only 17.5% were more afraid of COVID\\\\19 than their cancer condition, with advanced age (>70 years) as the only significant risk factor for that. Overall, 71% were concerned about cancer progression if their treatment/follow\\\\up was cancelled/postponed. Most patients (64%) had their care continued as planned, but 72.3% (n = 892) said that they received no information around overall COVID\\\\19 infection rates of patients and staff, testing or measures taken in their treating hospital.

METHODS We reviewed our prospectively maintained minimally invasive surgery database. Patients who underwent RAN from April 2009 to December 2011 were matched by pathologic tumor stage and age ( 10 years) to those who underwent LN. RESULTS Twenty-two matched pairs were evaluated. Mean operative time (298 vs 251 minutes) and estimated blood loss (EBL, 380 vs 233 mL) were significantly higher for RAN, with a greater need for transfusion in this group. Complication rates were similar. The RAN group trended toward more frequent lymph node dissection and greater median node count when lymph node dissection was performed (59% vs 27% [P = .07] and 5.5 vs 1.0 [P = .13]). After a median follow-up of 10 months for RAN and 15 months for LN, no significant difference was seen in the rate of bladder (36% vs 37%) or distant (32% vs 23%) recurrence, with similar median time to any recurrence (9 months vs 4 months, P = .32). CONCLUSION RAN was associated with higher operative time and blood loss likely because of more frequent use of node dissection, robot repositioning, and technical inexperience. Lymph node dissection was more frequently performed with RAN, which reflects surgeon practice patterns. When a lymph node dissection was performed, the median node count was greater with RAN.

The host macrophages are identified as the major cellular reservoirs of CHIKV during infection and this virus triggers robust TNF production in the host macrophages, which might be a key mediator of virus induced inflammation. However, the molecular mechanism underneath TNF induction is not understood yet. Accordingly, the Raw264.7 cells, a mouse macrophage cell line, were infected with CHIKV to address the above-mentioned question. It was observed that CHIKV induces both p38 and JNK phosphorylation in macrophages in a time-dependent manner and p-p38 inhibitor, SB203580 is effective in reducing infection even at lower concentration as compared to the p-JNK inhibitor, SP600125. However, inhibition of p-p38 and p-JNK decreased CHIKV induced TNF production in the host macrophages. Moreover, CHIKV induced macrophage derived TNF was found to facilitate TCR driven T cell activation. Additionally, it was noticed that the expressions of key transcription factors involved mainly in antiviral responses (p-IRF3) and TNF production (p-c-jun) were induced significantly in the CHIKV infected macrophages as compared to the corresponding mock cells. Further, it was demonstrated that CHIKV mediated TNF production in the macrophages is dependent on p38 and JNK MAPK pathways linking p-c-jun transcription factor. Interestingly, it was found that CHIKV nsP2 interacts with both p-p38 and p-JNK MAPKs in the macrophages. This observation was supported by the in silico protein-protein docking analysis which illustrates the specific amino acids responsible for the nsP2-MAPKs interactions. A strong polar interaction was predicted between Thr-180 (within the phosphorylation lip) of p38 and Gln-273 of nsP2, whereas, no such polar interaction was predicted for the phosphorylation lip of JNK which indicates the differential roles of p-p38 and p-JNK during CHIKV infection in the host macrophages. In summary, for the first time it has been shown that CHIKV triggers robust TNF production in the host macrophages via both p-p38 and p-JNK/p-c-jun pathways and the interaction of viral protein, nsP2 with these MAPKs during infection. Hence, this information might shed light in rationale-based drug designing strategies toward a possible control measure of CHIKV infection in future.","output":"P38 and JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases Interact With Chikungunya Virus Non-structural Protein-2 and Regulate TNF Induction During Viral Infection in Macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The preparation of Co-doped magnetite ferrofluids from natural sand was developed using a double-layer technique.

Adult hookworms survive for many years in the host intestine, where they suck blood, causing iron deficiency anemia and malnutrition. Numerous molecules, named excretory/secretory (ES) products, are secreted by hookworm adults and/or larvae to aid in parasite survival and pathobiology. Although the molecular cloning and characterization of hookworm ES products began 25 years ago, the biological role and molecular nature of many of them are still unclear. Hookworm ES products, with distinct structures and functions, have been linked to many essential events in the disease pathogenesis. These events include host invasion and tissue migration, parasite nourishment and reproduction, and immune modulation. Several of these products represent promising vaccine targets for controlling hookworm disease and therapeutic targets for many inflammatory diseases. This review aims to summarize our present knowledge about hookworm ES products, including their role in parasite biology, host-parasite interactions, and as vaccine and pharmaceutical targets and to identify research gaps and future research directions in this field.

The first phase coincided with an early summer epidemic wave in 2020. Methods rRT-PCR-based screening for SARS-CoV-2 was performed by pooling of samples. The infrastructure allowed the testing of the entire resident and cross-border worker populations. The strategy relied on social connectivity within different activity sectors. Invitation frequencies were tactically increased in sectors and regions with higher prevalence. The results were analysed alongside contact tracing data. Findings The voluntary programme covered 49% of the resident and 22% of the cross-border worker populations. It identified 850 index cases with an additional 249 cases from contact tracing. Over-representation was observed in the services, hospitality and construction sectors alongside regional differences. Asymptomatic cases had a significant but lower secondary attack rate when compared to symptomatic individuals. Based on simulations using an agent-based SEIR model, the total number of expected cases would have been 429% (90% CI [-03, 967]) higher without MS. Mandatory participation would have resulted in a further difference of 397% [196, 592]. Interpretation Strategic and tactical MS allows the suppression of epidemic dynamics. Asymptomatic carriers represent a significant risk for transmission. Containment of future outbreaks will depend on early testing in sectors and regions.

This paper explores the digital divide in a case study of the seventh largest city, by population, in the United States; San Antonio is a majority-minority city where over half of the people are Hispanic. This paper focuses on the five key affordability factors that drive broadband adoption. Researchers test social exclusion theory, the structural facets of poverty and social marginality to ascertain its potential impact on broadband access. The authors conducted a survey in both English and Spanish to learn more about the affordability factors that influence the broadband digital divide. Through our analysis, we found evidence that four of the factors (geographical disparities, profit-based discrimination, technology deployment cost, and socio-economic factors) played a role in the digital divide in this case study. The results of this study demonstrate that the digital divide is not exclusively a rural/urban digital divide, but can also occur in an intra-city context. This is especially evident in low-income areas within the city because they have substantially lower broadband adoption rates.

This study investigates how plastic surgery programs responded to this crisis, as well as how successful these changes were, through a survey of program directors and of residents at academic training programs in the United States. METHODS: Two separate anonymous online surveys were conducted via REDCap between April 16 and June 4, 2020. The first survey was distributed to program directors, and the second was distributed to plastic surgery residents. Resident responses were then subdivided for an analysis between geographic regions. RESULTS: Of the 59 program director responses (43.7%), the majority of programs implemented a platoon approach for resident coverage. A minority did the same for attending coverage. In total, 92% transitioned to virtual didactics only. Plastic surgery residents covered alternative services at 25% of responding institutions, and an additional 68% had a plan in place for responding to personnel shortages.

A number of STEM faculty professional development programs aim to provide such pedagogical support, and it is necessary to understand the activity and learning process for faculty in these settings. In this paper, a taxonomy for describing the learning opportunities in faculty (online) learning community meetings is presented. Faculty learning communities, meeting either in-person or (increasingly) online, are a common form of professional development. They aim to develop the pedagogical and reflective skills of participants through regular meetings centered on conversations about teaching and learning. RESULTS: The tool presented in this paper, the Taxonomy of Opportunities to Learn (TxOTL), provides a structured approach to making sense of the dynamic interactions that occur during faculty learning community meetings. The origins and development of the TxOTL are described, followed by a detailed presentation of the constructs that make up the TxOTL: communicative approach used in a conversation, the concepts developed, and the meeting segment category. The TxOTL characterizes the learning opportunities presented by a faculty learning community conversation through describing the content of the conversation as well as how participants engage in the conversation. Examples of the tool in use are provided through an application to a faculty online learning community serving instructors of a physical science curriculum. A visual representation used to compactly display the results of applying the taxonomy to a meeting is detailed as well. These examples serve to illustrate the types of claims the TxOTL facilitates. CONCLUSIONS: The TxOTL allows one to examine learning opportunities available to a faculty learning community group, analyze concept development present in their conversations, track change over time in a given group, and identify patterns between meeting segment categories and communicative approaches. It is useful for researchers as well as facilitators of these STEM faculty professional development groups. The taxonomy is most applicable to faculty (online) learning communities, with limited use for workshops and K-12 professional development contexts.

This article provides practical guidance to front-line physicians forced to make critical rationing decisions. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Medline search for scientific literature, reviews, and guidance documents related to epidemic ICU triage including from professional bodies. STUDY SELECTION: Clinical studies, reviews, and guidelines were selected and reviewed by all authors and discussed by internet conference and email. DATA EXTRACTION: References and data were based on relevance and author consensus. DATA SYNTHESIS: We review key challenges of resource-driven triage and data from affected ICUs. We recommend that once available resources are maximally extended, triage is justified utilizing a strategy that provides the greatest good for the greatest number of patients. A triage algorithm based on clinical estimations of the incremental survival benefit (saving the most life-years) provided by ICU care is proposed. First come, first served is used to choose between individuals with equal priorities and benefits. The algorithm provides practical guidance, is easy to follow, rapidly implementable and flexible. It has four prioritization categories: performance score, ASA score, number of organ failures, and predicted survival. Individual units can readily adapt the algorithm to meet local requirements for the evolving pandemic. Although the algorithm improves consistency and provides practical and psychologic support to those performing triage, the final decision remains a clinical one. Depending on country and operational circumstances, triage decisions may be made by a triage team or individual doctors. However, an experienced critical care specialist physician should be ultimately responsible for the triage decision. Cautious discharge criteria are proposed acknowledging the difficulties to facilitate the admission of queuing patients. CONCLUSIONS: Individual institutions may use this guidance to develop prospective protocols that assist the implementation of triage decisions to ensure fairness, enhance consistency, and decrease provider moral distress.","output":"Adult ICU Triage During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: Who Will Live and Who Will Die?

Observational studies to assess clinical outcome and related complications have been published. Clear evidence is required to better understand the safety profile of the WEB device. The authors here present a multicenter series that provides a detailed safety analysis focused on patient selection, procedural events, and technical issues of treated patients throughout the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS A nationwide password-protected database was set up to collect anonymous information across the UK (14 centers). Complications and clinical outcome were analyzed for the initial 109 patients (112 procedures). An independent root cause analysis classified the complications into groups (procedural, disease, device, ancillary device, and other). The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was used as a marker of clinical outcome. RESULTS Each of the 109 patients had 1 aneurysm suitable for WEB treatment (109 aneurysms). Three patients had 2 procedures, making a total of 112 procedures performed. Eight procedures were abandoned because of access issues; 2 patients went on to have a successful procedure. All 109 patients had a preprocedure and discharge mRS scores recorded. One hundred patients had a recorded mRS score from a > 3-month follow-up. Deployment of the WEB device was successful in 103 (94.5%) of 109 patients and 104 (92.9%) of 112 procedures. One patient had 2 successful WEB procedures on separate occasions. Patients without a successfully implanted WEB device were included in the analysis. Selection analysis showed that the average patient age was 56.5 years among 34 men and 75 women. The percentage of incidental aneurysms was 58.7%, acute 16.5%, symptomatic 18.3%, and recurrent 6.4%. Further results analysis showed that 40 (36.7%) of 109 patients had recorded adverse events, including those unrelated to the WEB device. Events that could be related to the WEB device numbered 17 (15.6%) among the 109 patients. Two patients with device-related complications were symptomatic. Overall, 11 patients (10.1%) had persistent clinical sequelae. Thromboembolism was the most prevalent event, affecting 15.6% of the patients (17 of 109), and 6.4% of the patients (7 of 109) with a thromboembolism were symptomatic. Overall mortality before discharge was 0% and at the > 3-month follow-up was 5% (5 of 100 patients). Morbidity was defined as an mRS score increase to > 2. Overall morbidity at discharge was 1.8% (2 of 109) and at the > 3-month follow-up was 6% (6 of 100). No device-related morbidity or mortality was associated with this group. CONCLUSIONS The UK data show that the WEB device is safe for clinical use. Thromboembolic complication adds a risk that should be minimized with appropriate anticoagulation and correct sizing of the device.

However, there is increasing evidence showing that COPD patients with COVID-19 have a higher risk of presenting a serious infection, a greater likelihood of requiring ICU support, and a higher mortality than other groups.Areas covered: In this article, we address some critical questions on COVID-19 as they pertain to COPD. In particular, we discuss whether the usual algorithms of pharmacological and non-pharmacological management in COPD still apply.Expert opinion: Patients with COPD must continue their regular therapy, regardless of whether they are affected by COVID-19. Corticosteroids reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients in need of supportive oxygen therapy or invasive mechanical ventilation. It is essential that a COPD patient who has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 is closely followed over time because any delay in diagnosis and initiation of appropriate therapy could negatively affect his/her prognosis. However, we still do not know if COVID-19 infection occurs and evolves differently in each of the recognized COPD phenotypes and, therefore, whether it needs a different management.

The SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) uses its C-terminal domain to block the mRNA entry channel of the 40S ribosome to inhibit host protein synthesis. However, how SARS-CoV-2 circumvents Nsp1-mediated suppression for viral protein synthesis and if the mechanism can be targeted therapeutically remain unclear. Here we show that N- and C-terminal domains of Nsp1 coordinate to drive a tuned ratio of viral to host translation, likely to maintain a certain level of host fitness while maximizing replication. We reveal that the SL1 region of the SARS-CoV-2 5 UTR is necessary and sufficient to evade Nsp1-mediated translational suppression. Targeting SL1 with locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) inhibits viral translation and makes SARS-CoV-2 5 UTR vulnerable to Nsp1 suppression, hindering viral replication in vitro at a nanomolar concentration. Thus, SL1 allows Nsp1 to switch infected cells from host to SARS-CoV-2 translation, presenting a therapeutic target against COVID-19 that is conserved among immune-evasive variants. This unique strategy of unleashing a virus own virulence mechanism against itself could force a critical trade off between drug resistance and pathogenicity.","output":"Targeting Stem-loop 1 of the SARS-CoV-2 5UTR to suppress viral translation and Nsp1 evasion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, the medical staff fighting against COVID-19 frequently reported the device-related pressure injury (DRPI) caused by personal protective equipment (PPE).

(SARSTEDT, Numbrecht, Germany) as a homogeneous saliva collection system to diagnose COVID-19 by RT-qPCR, notably for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. However, for convalescent patients, the corroboration of molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in paired nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva samples was unsatisfactory. Objectives: The aim of the present work was to assess the concordance level of SARS-CoV-2 detection between paired sampling of NPSs and saliva collected with Salivette(?) at two time points, with ten days of interval. Results: A total of 319 paired samples from 145 outpatients (OP) and 51 healthcare workers (HW) were collected. Unfortunately, at day ten, 73 individuals were lost to follow-up, explaining some kinetic missing data. Due to significant waiting rates at hospitals, most of the patients ate and/or drank while waiting for their turn. Consequently, mouth washing was systematically proposed prior to saliva collection. None of the HW were diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 positive using NPS or saliva specimens at both time points (n = 95) by RT-qPCR. The virus was detected in 56.3% (n = 126/224) of the NPS samples from OP, but solely 26.8% (n = 60/224) of the paired saliva specimens. The detection of the internal cellular control, the human RNase P, in more than 98% of the saliva samples, underlined that the low sensitivity of saliva specimens (45.2%) for SARS-CoV-2 detection was not attributed to an improper saliva sample storing or RNA extraction. Conclusions: This work revealed that mouth washing decreased viral load of buccal cavity conducting to impairment of SARS-CoV-2 detection. Viral loads in saliva neo-produced appeared insufficient for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2.

Infection with SFTSV is associated with case-fatality rates of up to 30%, and neither antivirals nor vaccines are available at present. Development of antiviral strategies requires the elucidation of virus-host cell interactions. Here, we analyzed host cell entry of SFTSV. Employing lentiviral and rhabdoviral vectors, we found that the Gn/Gc glycoproteins (Gn/Gc) of SFTSV mediate entry into a broad range of human and animal cell lines, as well as human macrophages and dendritic cells. The Gn/Gc proteins of La Crosse virus (LACV) and Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV), other members of the bunyavirus family, facilitated entry into an overlapping but not identical range of cell lines, suggesting that SFTSV, LACV, and RVFV might differ in their receptor requirements. Entry driven by SFTSV Gn/Gc was dependent on low pH but did not require the activity of the pH-dependent endosomal/lysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsins B and L. Instead, the activity of a cellular serine protease was required for infection driven by SFTSV and LACV Gn/Gc. Sera from convalescent SFTS patients inhibited SFTSV Gn/Gc-driven host cell entry in a dose-dependent fashion, demonstrating that the vector system employed is suitable to detect neutralizing antibodies. Finally, the C-type lectin DC-SIGN was found to serve as a receptor for SFTSV Gn/Gc-driven entry into cell lines and dendritic cells.

Agents, pertaining to either a 'rioter' or a 'bystander' sub-population, move on an underlying lattice and can either be recruited or defect from their respective subpopulation. In particular, we allow these individual-level recruitment and defection processes to vary with local population density. This agent-based modelling framework provides the unifying link between multi-population stochastic models and density-dependent reaction processes. Furthermore, the continuum description of this ABM framework is shown to be a system of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations and faithfully agrees with the average ABM behaviour from individual simulations.

Each procedure was repeated 10 times. A complementary clinical study measured the spread of contaminated particles within the dental operatory and quantified airborne protein dispersion following 10 min of ultrasonic supragingival scaling of 19 participants during routine periodontal treatment. RESULTS: The simulation study data showed that air flow produced the highest amount of splatters and the ultrasonic scaler generated the most aerosol and droplet particles at 1.2 m away from the source. The use of HVS effectively reduced 37.5C96% of splatter generation for all three dental AGPs, as well as 82C93% of aerosol and droplet particles at 1.2 m for the ultrasonic scaler and air polisher. In the clinical study, higher protein levels above background levels following ultrasonic supragingival scaling were detected in fewer than 20% of patients, indicating minimal particle spread. CONCLUSIONS: While three common periodontal AGPs produce aerosols and droplet particles up to at least 1.2 m from the source, the use of HVS is of significant benefit. Routine ultrasonic supragingival scaling produced few detectable traces of salivary protein at various sites throughout the 10-min dental operatory. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The likelihood of aerosol spread to distant sites during common periodontal AGPs is greatly reduced by high-volume suction. Clinically, limited evidence of protein contaminants was found following routine ultrasonic scaling, suggesting that the the majority of the contamination consisits of the irrigant rather than organic matter from the oral cavity.

METHODS: 324 MS patients participated in this online cross-sectional survey during the COVID-19 lockdown period. A mixed methods design was used, with quantitative information collected on MS-related factors as well as COVID-19 impact and an open-ended, qualitative response looking for reasons behind the self-reported COVID-19 impact. RESULTS: We found that 48% of the participants reported that COVID-19 had a neutral impact on their lives and 16% reported a positive impact. However, 36% reported a negative impact, and had greater levels of MS- and non-MS-related worries, and higher levels of bother related to psychological and cognitive symptoms and fatigue than the groups reporting a neutral or positive impact. Significant predictors of this adversely affected group were age, type of MS and presence of psychological symptoms. Antidepressant medication use, time since diagnosis, gender, location, living arrangements or employment status did not predict impact. Open-ended responses explaining personal COVID-19 impact indicate that coping strategies may contribute to these findings. In particular, active, problem-focused approaches were reported by the majority of people who reported a positive impact, as well as a third of those who reported a neutral impact.

The present study was aimed to evaluate physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviors (SB) (screen time (ST) and homework time (HT)) among Yazd OW/OB adolescents. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed among 510 students aged 12-16 in Yazd, Iran. The general information, PA, and SB (ST and HT) were collected by interview based on the WHO standard questionnaire. Anthropometric data were assessed by precise instruments. Daily energy intake (Energy) was obtained from a 7-day food record. Nutritionist 4 software (version I) was run to estimate the energy. RESULTS: There was a high prevalence of SB > 2h/day (97.6), ST > 2h/day (70.3%), overweight or obesity (40%), abdominal obesity (36.9%), physical inactivity (29.8%) among the students. The younger age (p = 0.014), energy (p < 0.001), no access to the yard (p < 0.001), family size  2 (p = 0.023), passive transportation, (p = 0.001), the highest school days HT (p = 0.033) and SB (p = 0.021), and the highest weekends HT among the students were the risk factors for OW/OB. The highest PA level was associated with a lower risk of OW/OB (p < 0.001). The findings were not the same in both sexes. Compared to the normal weight students, OW / OB spent more time on school days and weekdays for ST (P <0.001), HT (P <0.001, P = 0.005) and SB (P <0.001), respectively. OW/OB students showed a higher weekends ST (p < 0.001) and lower HT (p = 0.048) than normal-weight students. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SB, ST, OW/OB, and physical inactivity were common. The school days and weekends HT, the school days SB and HT, age, energy, PA, and access to the yard, family size, and passive transportation were related to the greater chances of OW/OB students.

Musculoskeletal shoulder pain is challenging to manage and while research evidence suggests that exercise should be a cornerstone of shoulder pain rehabilitation, the exact type and dosage of exercise is unclear. Adherence is a barrier to successful outcomes with exercise-based management of musculoskeletal pain, especially for those with co-morbidities, high pain levels and reported boredom associated with competing prescribed exercise. Virtual reality (VR) may offer an effective platform for rehabilitation of musculoskeletal shoulder pain. VR has been shown to be effective for management of acute and chronic pain conditions, for delivering education around various health conditions, and for supporting rehabilitation of neurological conditions. Therefore, it is possible that VR may have a role in the delivery of exercise and education for individuals with musculoskeletal shoulder pain. VR intervention design should involve several steps and begin with establishing early acceptability from users as to the suitability of the technology in clinical practice as well as potential barriers and facilitators to using the technology successfully. This study will therefore aim to explore physiotherapists beliefs and perspectives of immersive VR as a platform for assessment and rehabilitation in patients with musculoskeletal shoulder pain. Further, this study will inform the development of a VR intervention for use in the rehabilitation of musculoskeletal shoulder pain. A series of online focus groups will be conducted with physiotherapists in Ireland using a qualitative descriptive approach to data analysis. A six-phase process of data analysis will be carried out to identify important patterns and themes within the data.

METHODS: This was an observational caseCcontrol study of pregnant women who were vaccinated with a two\\\\dose regimen of the BNT162b2 vaccine during gestation between January and February 2021 (study group) and age\\\\matched non\\\\pregnant women who received the vaccine during the same time period (control group). Participants received a digital questionnaire 1C4 weeks after the second dose and were asked to provide information regarding demographics, medication, medical history, history of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) infection, timing of COVID\\\\19 vaccine doses and side effects after each vaccine dose. A second digital questionnaire, regarding current pregnancy and delivery outcomes, was sent to patients in the study group after the calculated due date. All recruited women were offered a serology blood test for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) following the second vaccination dose and SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 IgG levels were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Of 539 pregnant women who were recruited after completion of the two\\\\dose regimen of the vaccine, 390 returned the digital questionnaire and were included in the study group and compared to 260 age\\\\matched non\\\\pregnant vaccinated women. The rates of rash, fever and severe fatigue following vaccination among pregnant women were comparable to those in non\\\\pregnant women. Myalgia, arthralgia and headache were significantly less common among pregnant women after each dose, local pain or swelling and axillary lymphadenopathy were significantly less common among pregnant women after the first and second doses, respectively, while paresthesia was significantly more common among the pregnant population after the second dose. Among pregnant women, there were no significant differences in the rates of side effects according to whether the vaccine was administered during the first, second or third trimester of pregnancy, except for local pain/swelling, which was significantly less common after the first dose when administered during the third trimester, and uterine contractions, which were significantly more common after the second dose when administered during the third trimester. The rates of obstetric complications, including uterine contractions (1.3% after the first dose and 6.4% after the second dose), vaginal bleeding (0.3% after the first dose and 1.5% after the second dose) and prelabor rupture of membranes (0% after the first dose and 0.8% after the second dose), were very low following vaccination. All serum samples in both groups were positive for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 IgG. However, pregnant women had significantly lower serum SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 IgG levels compared to non\\\\pregnant women (signal\\\\to\\\\cut\\\\off ratio, 27.03 vs 34.35, respectively; P < 0.001). Among the 57 pregnant women who delivered during the study period and who completed the second questionnaire, median gestational age at delivery was 39.5 (interquartile range, 38.7C40.0) weeks, with no cases of preterm birth < 37 weeks, no cases of fetal or neonatal death and two (3.5%) cases of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory support.

Complete blood counts (CBCs) were analysed looking for predictors of test positivity. Eight significant predictors were identified and used to build a 'complete' CBC score with a discriminatory power for COVID-19 diagnosis of AUC 92% (p<0.0001). When looking at the weight of individual variables, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), age, platelets and eosinophils (MAPE: MCV 90 fL, 65 points; age 45 years, 100 points; platelets 180103/L, 73 points; eosinophils <0.01/L, 94 points) gave the highest contribution and were used to build a 'simplified' MAPE score with a discriminatory power of AUC 88%. By setting the cut-off MAPE score at 173 points, sensitivity and specificity for COVID-19 diagnosis were 83% and 82%, respectively, and the actual test positivity rate was 60% as compared to 6% of patients with MAPE score <173 points (odds ratio 23.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 9.1-58.3, p-value <0.0001).

Five old and new word embeddings were used to vectorize over 5 million progress notes from Stanford EHR and logistic regression was used to predict eight ICD-10 codes of common cardiovascular diseases. The models were interpreted by the important words in predictions and analyses of false positive cases. Trained on Stanford notes, the model transferability was tested in the prediction of corresponding ICD-9 codes of the MIMIC-III discharge summaries. The word embeddings and logistic regression showed good performance in the diagnostic code extraction with TF-IDF as the best word embedding model showing AUROC ranging from 0.9499 to 0.9915 and AUPRC ranging from 0.2956 to 0.8072.

METHODS: Genetic analysis of ACE2 gene was conducted in French-Canadian and British populations. RESULTS: In French-Canadian individuals, the T allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2074192 of ACE2 gene was a risk factor for hypertension in adult obese males [odds ratio (OR)=1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-1.83)] and even more so in obese males who smoked (OR=1.67, CI: 1.24-2.55), but not in lean males, non-smoker males or females. The T allele was significantly associated with severity of hypertension and with earlier penetrance of hypertension in obese smoking males. Significant interaction between the T allele and obesity was present in both sexes.

However, in a recent meta-analysis, the overall HCV reinfection rate was 5.9/100 person-years (PY) among PWID. Accordingly, this study was undertaken to investigate the reinfection rate in former and active PWID who achieved the end of treatment response after direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment in Belgium. METHODS This observational cross-sectional study recruited individuals with a history of injecting drug use who had achieved the end of treatment response to any DAA treatment between 2015 and 2020. Participants were offered a post-treatment HCV RNA test. RESULTS Eighty-five potential participants were eligible to participate and contacted, of whom 60 participants were enrolled in the study with a median age of 51.0 (IQR 44.3-56.0) years; it was reported that 23.3% continued to inject drugs intravenously after DAA treatment. Liver cirrhosis was present in 12.9%. The majority had genotype 1a (51.7%) or genotype 3 (15.0%) infection. We detected no reinfections in this study population. The total time patients were followed up for reinfection in the study was 78.5 PY (median 1.0 years IQR 0.4-2.0).

RESULTS Sixty-nine residents responded to the survey representing a variety of subspecialties. Most residents applied for 2-5 programs (45%) and completed 2-5 interviews (45%). The primary methods of finding fellowships were via word of mouth (68%) and faculty mentors (67%), followed by websites and reaching out to fellowship directors (54%) and online database searching (46%). Although many residents applied for fellowships in postgraduate year 5 of training (39%), there was significant variability in times for interviews and offer letters.

We evaluated depression, stress, and anxiety levels using the DASS-21 questionnaire. Participants were selected by using census sampling. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.5.1. RESULTS The study population included 217 HCWs (111 male, 116 female) and the mean age of the study group was 39.6 years old. Approximately two-thirds of the HCWs stayed in the hospital for 2-3 weeks. The mean scores of depression and stress were at a \\"severe\\" level, while anxiety scores were at an \\"extremely severe\\" level.

ZIKV requires the neural RNA-binding protein Musashi-1 to replicate. TH represses MSI1. Being a suspected TH disruptor, we hypothesized that co-exposure to the main metabolite of PPF, 4-OH-PPF, would exacerbate ZIKV effects through increased MSI1 expression. This was tested using in vitro mouse neurospheres and an in vivo TH signaling reporter model, Xenopus laevis. TH signaling was decreased by 4-OH-PPF in both models. In mouse-derived neurospheres the metabolite reduced neuroprogenitor proliferation as well as markers of neuronal differentiation. The results demonstrated that 4-OH-PPF significantly induced MSI1 at both the mRNA and protein level, as well as Fasn mRNA. Other TH target genes were also significantly modified. Importantly, several key genes implicated in neuroprogenitor fate and commitment were not dysregulated by 4-OH-PPF alone, but were in combination with ZIKV infection. These included the neuroprogenitor markers Nestin, Egfr, Gfap, Dlx2 and Dcx. Unexpectedly, 4-OH-PPF decreased ZIKV replication, although only at the fourth and last day of incubation, and RNA copy numbers stayed within the same order of magnitude. However, intracellular RNA content of neuroprogenitors was significantly decreased in the combined presence of the PPF metabolite and ZIKV. We conclude that 4-OH-PPF interferes with TH action in vivo and in vitro, inhibiting neuroprogenitor proliferation. In the presence of ZIKV, TH signaling pathways crucial for cortical development are significantly impacted. This provides another example of viral effects that are exacerbated by drug or pesticide use. Significance statement In 2015, an increase in children born with unusually small heads (microcephaly) in North-Eastern Brazil was linked to infection with the ZIKA virus. An insecticide with thyroid hormone disruptive properties was used in the same areas. We investigated whether simultaneous exposure to the insecticide could increase viral susceptibility. The main metabolite 4-OH-PPF dysregulated thyroid hormone signaling pathways crucial for brain development in both models used. Neural stem cells proliferated less and contained more Musashi-1, a protein the virus needs to replicate. Infecting stem cells pre-exposed to the endocrine disruptor did not amplify viral replication, but aggravated expression of genes implicated in brain development. Our results suggest the insecticide is particularly deleterious to brain development in areas with ZIKA virus prevalence.","output":"ZIKA virus effects on neuroprogenitors are exacerbated by the main pyriproxyfen metabolite via thyroid hormone signaling disruption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Despite the worldwide spread of the SARS-CoV-2, an effective specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 is yet to be identified. Here we report the preliminary results of the phase II open-label clinical trial of the safety and efficacy of Sofosbuvir as antiviral therapy among hospitalized adult patients with SARS-CoV-2.Methods: The study was randomized, controlled, open-label phase II clinical trial in hospitalized adult patients with SARS-CoV-2. Patients were randomized into intervention arm receiving Sofosbuvir or comparison arm receiving usual antiviral agents in addition to standard of care. The primary end point of the study was clinical recovery as defined by normal body temperature and normal oxygen saturation, sustained for at least 72 hours within 14 days since the initiation of antiviral therapy. The main secondary outcome was all-cause mortality during the admission in hospital or within 14 days after discharge if applicable. Reports of Severe adverse events were observed in the intervention arm.Findings: From April to Sep 2020, ninety patients were recruited in the study. Thirty-three patients were excluded before enrollment. Fifty-seven patients enrolled into either the clinical trial arm (n = 27) or the comparison arm (n = 30). Primary outcome was achieved by 24 (88.9%) in the intervention arm and 10 (33.3%) in the comparison arm. The intervention arm had a significantly shorter median hospital length of stay [10days (IQR 5-12)] than the comparison group [11.5 days (IQR 8.5-17.75)] (P = 0.016).All-cause mortality was two and thirteen in intervention and comparison groups respectively. No serious adverse events were reported by the patients receiving Sofosbuvir during the study.Interpretation: Among adult patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2, those who received Sofosbuvir had more clinical recovery rate and had a shorter hospital length of stay than those who received usual antiviral agents in the study and these differences were statistically significant.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized crossover clinical trial, thirty-five children with moderate to severe anxiety requiring bilateral pulp therapy of mandibular primary molars were enrolled. Based on random lists, 18 children received the BE + IANB and 17 children received a routine IANB at the first session. This trend became reverse at the second visit for each child. Anxiety was measured using Facial Image Scale (FIS), blood pressure, and pulse rate. Face Leg Activity Cry Consolability (FLACC) scale and WongCBaker Facial Pain Scale (WBFPS) were used for pain measurement. The Paired Samples Test, Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, and Interclass Correlation Coefficient were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The means of FLACC, WBFPS, FIS, blood pressure, and pulse rate were higher at the control visit. However, these differences were statistically significant only for FLACC scale and WBFPS (P value <0.05). In subgroup analysis, only girls and children without any previous dental treatment showed significant differences in FLACC scale and WBFPS between the control and bubble blower side (P value <0.05). CONCLUSION: Breathing exercise using a bubble blower may be an efficient distraction and relaxation method to decrease pain of 7- to 10-year-old children with moderate to severe anxiety during inferior alveolar nerve block.

Contentious findings of either positive, negative, or no association with climatic conditions have been reported in many studies based on some early data on COVID-19 cases over a shorter time span. We integrate COVID-19 datasets with long meteorological time series of 29 countries to explore cross-country variation in COVID-19 cases and death rates with respect to temperature and relative humidity. Our empirical study reveals that temperature and relative humidity jointly influence the growth of COVID-19 cases and death rates. We generate predictive scenarios for changes in daily cases and death rates under different combinations of temperature and relative humidity. Low temperature with low humidity in a temperate climate and high temperature with high humidity in a hot and humid climate are found to surge the growth of COVID-19 cases and death rates.

We hypothesized that progression of disease could be prevented by the administration of an activated T cell immunotherapy (ACT) at time points when immunosuppressive populations increased in peripheral blood. In an N-of-1 study, a patient with multiple primary bladder high grade urothelial carcinomas, previously treated with standard local resection and chemotherapy but with evidence of progression, received ACT consisting of dendritic cells mixed with cytokine induced killer cells (DC/CIK), intravenously 18 times over a 6 year period at indicated time of observed increases in peripheral blood immunosuppressive CD8+/CD28- cells. Peripheral blood was analyzed for T cell phenotype by flow cytometry, T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) by next generation sequencing (NGS) at the time of each infusion. Cystoscopy and pelvic CT scans were performed at routine intervals to assess clinical status of disease. There has been no recurrence or metastasis of urothelial carcinoma. Peripheral blood cytotoxic T cells and unique TCR clones increased and suppressive T cell populations decreased after DC/CIK infusions evidenced by the two more proof-of concept cases. ctDNA analysis detected mutations in six genes (ARID1B, MYCN, CDH23, SETD2, NOTCH4 and FAT1) which appeared at different times, but all of them disappeared after the DC-CIK infusions.

These drugs can inhibit the viral protease, called chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease, also known as Main protease (3CLpro); hence, we studied the binding efficiencies of 4-aminoquinoline and 8-aminoquinoline analogs of chloroquine. Six compounds furnished better binding energies than chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The interactions with the active site residues especially with Cys145 and His41, which are involved in catalytic diad for proteolysis, make these compounds potent main protease inhibitors.

In this paper, we propose a framework to study fact checking efforts using Google Trends, a signal that captures search interest over topics on the world's largest search engine. Our framework consists of extracting claims from fact checking efforts, linking such claims with knowledge graph entities, and estimating the online attention they receive. We use this framework to study a dataset of 879 COVID-19-related fact checks done in 2020 by 81 international organizations. Our findings suggest that there is often a disconnect between online attention and fact checking efforts. For example, in around 40% of countries where 10 or more claims were fact checked, half or more than half of the top 10 most popular claims were not fact checked. Our analysis also shows that claims are first fact checked after receiving, on average, 35% of the total online attention they would eventually receive in 2020. Yet, there is a big variation among claims: some were fact checked before receiving a surge of misinformation-induced online attention, others are fact checked much later. Overall, our work suggests that the incorporation of online attention signals may help organizations better assess and prioritize their fact checking efforts.

The questionnaire included self-reported information on lifestyle behaviors, including physical activity, eating habits, smoking, watching television, social media use and sleep before and during the pandemic. Logistic regression was performed to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle behaviors. RESULTS: A total of 5896 participants were included in the final analysis and 62.8% were females. The BMI of the participants was 25.4  5.8 kg/m2. Around 38.4% of the participants stopped practicing any physical activities during the confinement (P < 0.001), and 57.1% reported spending more than 2 h on social media (P < 0.001). There were no significant changes in smoking habits. Also, 30.9% reported an improvement in their eating habits compared with 24.8% reported worsening of their eating habits. Fast-food consumption decreased significantly in 48.8% of the study population.

There were no language limitations. COVID-19 surveillance studies that were published after December 2020 but did not specify whether they tested a vaccinated population were also considered for inclusion. For the international guidance review, a grey literature search was conducted, including a thorough search of Google, websites of international government organizations (e.g., Center for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], World Health Organization [WHO]), and McMaster Health Forum (CoVID-END). This search was primarily examining surveillance guidance published since December 2020 (to capture guidance specific to vaccinations) and any relevant pre-December 2020 guidance. ResultsThirty-three studies were included for data synthesis of scientific evidence on surveillance of COVID-19. All the studies were published between April and June 2021. Twenty-one studies were from peer-reviewed journals. Five approaches to monitoring post-vaccination COVID-19 cases and emerging variants of concern were identified, including screening with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or a rapid antigen test, genomic surveillance, wastewater surveillance, metagenomics, and testing of air filters on public buses. For population surveillance, the following considerations and limitations were observed: variability in person-to-person testing frequency; lower sensitivity of antigen tests; timing of infections relative to PCR testing can result in missed infections; large studies may fail to identify local variations; and loss of interest in testing by participants in long follow-up studies. Through comprehensive grey literature searching, 68 international guidance documents were captured for full-text review. A total of 26 documents met the inclusion criteria and were included in our synthesis. Seven overarching surveillance methods emerged in the literature. PCR-testing was the most recommended surveillance method, followed by genomic screening, serosurveillance, wastewater surveillance, antigen testing, health record screening, and syndromic surveillance. ConclusionEvidence for post-vaccination COVID-19 surveillance was derived from studies in partially or fully vaccinated populations. Population PCR screening, supplemented by rapid antigen tests, was the most frequently used surveillance method and also the most commonly recommended across jurisdictions. Most recent guidance on COVID-19 surveillance is not specific to vaccinated individuals, or it is in effect but has not yet been updated to reflect that. Therefore, more evidence-informed guidance on testing and surveillance approaches in a vaccinated population that incorporates all testing modalities is required.

For population surveillance, the following considerations and limitations were observed: studies with discretionary access to testing have highly variable person-to-person testing frequency; antigen tests have lower sensitivity, therefore some positive cases may be missed; timing of infections relative to PCR testing as well as the sensitivity of the tests can result in missed infections; large sample sizes from multicentre studies increase generalizability, but fail to identify local variations from individual centres; with electronic database surveillance, it is difficult to confirm whether patients with a breakthrough infection and a previous positive SARS-CoV-2 test result had a true reinfection or had prolonged shedding from the previous infection; and participants lose interest in studies with long follow-up, with decrease in testing rates over time. Six wastewater surveillance and three genomic surveillance studies were identified in this review. A number of benefits such as, good correlation with clinical data, ability to predict major outbreaks, and rapid turnaround time were observed with wastewater surveillance. However, challenges such as, inconsistencies in variant representation depending on where the samples were taken within the community, differences in the capacity of wastewater to predict case numbers based on the size of the wastewater treatment plants, and cost, were noted. Emerging technologies like viral detection in public transport filters, novel sampling, and assay platforms were also identified. Through comprehensive grey literature searching, 68 international guidance documents were captured for full-text review. A total of 26 documents met the inclusion criteria and were included in our synthesis. Most were not specific to vaccinated populations but reported on a surveillance method of COVID-19 and were therefore included in the review; it was assumed that they were still in effect but have not yet been updated. Eleven countries/regions were represented, including Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, India, New Zealand, Spain, United Kingdom, United States, Europe, and International. All of the guidance documents included surveillance methods appropriate for community settings. Other settings of interest were healthcare settings, including hospitals and primary care centres, long-term care facilities, points of entry for travel, schools, and other sentinel sites (e.g., prisons and closed settings). Seven overarching surveillance methods emerged in the literature. PCR-testing was the most recommended surveillance method, followed by genomic screening, serosurveillance, wastewater surveillance, antigen testing, health record screening, and syndromic surveillance. Only one document (published by Public Health England) was identified that provided guidance on surveillance specific to vaccinated populations. The document outlined a plan to surveil and monitor COVID-19 in vaccinated populations through a series of targeted longitudinal studies, routine surveillance, enhanced surveillance, use of electronic health records, surveillance of vaccine failure (including follow-up with viral whole genome sequencing), and sero-surveillance (including blood donor samples, routine blood tests, and residual sera). ConclusionEvidence for post-vaccination COVID-19 surveillance was derived from studies in partially or fully vaccinated populations. Population PCR screening, supplemented by rapid antigen tests, was the most frequently used surveillance method and also the most commonly recommended across jurisdictions. The selection of testing method and the frequency of testing was determined by the intensity of the disease and the scale of testing. Other common testing methods included wastewater surveillance and genomic surveillance. A few novel technologies are emerging, however, many of these are yet to be utilized in the real-world setting. There is limited evidence-based guidance on surveillance in a vaccinated population. Most recent guidance on COVID-19 surveillance is not specific to vaccinated individuals, or it is in effect but has not yet been updated to reflect that. Therefore, more evidence-informed guidance on testing and surveillance approaches in a vaccinated population that incorporates all testing modalities is required.

DESIGN: We performed an observational, cross-sectional, descriptive study for which we designed a survey that was distributed in May 2020. SETTING: We included internists who worked in Spain during the COVID-19 outbreak. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1015 internists responded to the survey. Of those 62.9% were women. RESULTS: Of 1015 people, 58.3% presented with high emotional exhaustion, 61.5% had a high level of depersonalisation and 67.6% reported low personal fulfilment. 40.1% presented with the 3 criteria described, and therefore burn-out syndrome. Burn-out syndrome was independently related to the management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 (HR: 2.26; 95% CI 1.15 to 4.45), the lack of availability of personal protective equipment (HR: 1.41; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.91), increased responsibility (HR: 2.13; 95% CI 1.51 to 3.01), not having received financial compensation for overtime work (HR: 0.43; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.62), not having rested after 24-hour shifts (HR: 1.61; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.38), not having had holidays in the previous 6 months (HR: 1.36; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.84), consumption of sleeping pills (HR: 1.83; 95% CI 1.28 to 2.63) and higher alcohol intake (HR: 1.95; 95% CI 1.39 to 2.73). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, 40.1% of Internal Medicine physicians in Spain presented with burn-out syndrome, which was independently related to the assistance of patients with SARS-CoV-2, overworking without any compensation and the fear of being contagious to their relatives.

Given the growing population of children with complex care needs (CCNs), this was an important area of focus within the Models of Child Health Appraised (MOCHA) project, funded by the European Union (EU) under the Horizon 2020 programme. We examined the structures and processes of care in place for children with CCNs and identified key constituents for effective integration of care for these children at the community and acute care interface across 30 EU/ European Economic Area (EEA) countries. METHODS: This was a non-experimental descriptive study with an embedded qualitative element. Data were collected by a Country Agent in each of the 30 countries, a local expert in child health services. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and a thematic analysis was undertaken of the free text data provided. RESULTS: A total of 27 surveys were returned from a possible 30 countries (90.0%) countries. One respondent indicated that their country does not have children on long-term ventilation (LTV) in the home, therefore, responses of 26 countries (86.7%) were analysed. None of the responding countries reported that they had all of the core components in place in their country. Three themes emerged from the free text provided: family preparedness for transitioning to home, coordinated pathway to specialist care and legal and governance structures. CONCLUSIONS: While the clinical care of children on LTV in the acute sector has received considerable attention, the results identify the need for an enhanced focus on the care required following discharge to the community setting. The results highlight the need for a commitment to supporting care delivery that acknowledges the complexity of contemporary child health issues and the context of the families that become their primary care givers.","output":"Key constituents for integration of care for children assisted with long-term home ventilation: a European study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study assesses the effectiveness of political measures adopted in Italy for the containment of Covid-19 infection between February and June 2020.

The second outbreak started in July, was associated with North Africa, and involved travelers and an outbreak on passenger ships. This suggested the involvement of a new viral variant. Methods: We sequenced the genomes from 916 SARS-CoV-2 strains from COVID-19 patients in our institute. The patients' demographic and clinical features were compared according to the infecting viral variant. Results: From June 26th to August 14th, we identified a new viral variant (Marseille-1). Based on genome sequences (n = 89) or specific qPCR (n = 53), 142 patients infected with this variant were detected. It is characterized by a combination of 10 mutations located in the nsp2, nsp3, nsp12, S, ORF3a, ORF8 and N/ORF14 genes. We identified Senegal and Gambia, where the virus had been transferred from China and Europe in February-April as the sources of the Marseille-1 variant, which then most likely reached Marseille through Maghreb when French borders reopened. In France, this variant apparently remained almost limited to Marseille. In addition, it was significantly associated with a milder disease compared to clade 20A ancestor strains.

As of July 27, 2020, the cumulative confirmed number of cases was about 4.2 million with almost 300,000 of them entailing hospitalizations. Due to data collection limitations the confirmed totals reported by the CDC undercount the actual number of cases and hospitalizations in the U.S. Using standard assumptions provided by the CDC, we estimate that as of July 27, 2020, the actual number of cumulative COVID-19 cases in the U.S. is about 47 million with almost 1 million involving hospitalizations. Applying value per statistical life (VSL) and relative severity/injury estimates from the Department of Transportation (DOT), we estimate an overall non-fatal unadjusted valuation of $2.2 trillion for the U.S. with a weighted average value of about $46,000 per case. This is almost 40% higher than the total valuation of $1.6 trillion (using about $11 million VSL from the DOT) for all approximately 147,000 COVID-19 fatalities. We also show a variety of estimates that adjust the non-fatal valuations by the dreaded and uncertainty aspect of COVID-19, age, income, and a factor related to fatality categorization. The adjustments show current overall non-fatal valuations ranging from about $1.5 trillion to about $9.6 trillion. Finally, we use CDC forecast data to estimate non-fatal valuations through November 2020, and find that the overall cumulative valuation increases from about $2.2 trillion to about $5.7 trillion or to about 30% of GDP.

Methods: All paediatric patients with positive RT-PCR on a respiratory sample and/or serology for SARS-CoV-2 up to 19th May 2020 were included. Results: 57 children met the inclusion criteria. 70% were of non-Caucasian ethnicity with a median age of 9.3 years (IQR 5.16-13.48).

Up to now, no specific therapy against COVID-19 disease exists. This paper aims to review COVID-19 treatment options currently under investigation. We divided the studied drugs into three categories (antiviral, immunomodulatory and other drugs). For each molecule, we discussed the putative mechanisms by which the drug may act against SARS-CoV-2 or may affect COVID-19 pathogenesis and the main clinical studies performed so far. The published clinical studies suffer from methodological limitations due to the emergency setting in which they have been conducted. Nevertheless, it seems that the timing of administration of the diverse categories of drugs is crucial in determining clinical efficacy. Antiviral drugs, in particular Remdesivir, should be administered soon after symptoms onset, in the viraemic phase of the disease; whereas, immunomodulatory agents, such as tocilizumab, anakinra and steroids, may have better results if administered in pneumonia/hyperinflammatory phases. Low-molecular-weight heparin may also have a role when facing COVID-19-related coagulopathy. Up to now, treatment choices have been inferred from the experience with other coronaviruses or viral infection outbreaks. Hopefully, in the near future, new treatment strategies will be available thanks to increased knowledge on SARS-CoV2 virus and COVID-19 pathogenesis.

We used verbal tasks on social distancing to test the hypotheses that individual differences in empathy, implicit theories of emotions, the Dark Triad traits, rationality, and risk readiness predict decisions on whether or not to wear a mask. We developed five verbal tasks - situations where decisions on whether to wear a mask or not were made by choosing from several given reasons. Among the reasons for wearing a mask, Care for Self was chosen by 46% of participants who received this as a reason, the Law-abidingness reason was chosen by 44%, and 31% selected Care for Others. Regarding the reasons for not wearing a mask, 16% of participants chose Autonomy for Oneself, 11% - Risk Underestimation and 5% - Autonomy for Others. Logistic regressions identified that empathy, rationality, and narcissism were significant predictors of a decision to wear a face mask, while risk readiness and psychopathy were predictors of a decision not to wear a mask. Implicit theories of emotions and problem-solving self-efficacy were significant predictors only for choices between the reasons for wearing a mask.

In response, federal nutrition assistance programs have introduced flexibility waivers in programs, including the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), to rapidly respond to support the nutritional health status of income-eligible participants during COVID-19. Waivers were approved that permitted flexibilities in the WIC food package, WIC vendor guidelines, and WIC clinic experience.

OBJECTIVES: Our aims were to understand the experiences of WIC participants in food retail settings and with WIC clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore WIC participants' perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on their family's overall health, well-being, and daily lives. DESIGN: We conducted semi-structured phone interviews between April 30 and May 7, 2020. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants were 24 adults in WIC-enrolled families residing in Tennessee. ANALYSIS: Using grounded theory as the analytical framework, 2 coders completed an iterative, data-driven analytic process within NVivo, version 12. Hierarchical maps, coding matrices, and concept maps were used to aid direct content analysis for theme detection. RESULTS: Five primary themes emerged, including shopping barriers (existing compounded with new), coping strategies, impact on mental and emotional health, social comparison, and unintended consequences of COVID-19 on WIC families.

Health care workers are among those most at risk of contracting the virus. In the fight against the coronavirus, nurses play a critical role. Still, most social media platforms demonstrate that nurses fear that their health is not being prioritized. The purpose of this study is to investigate nurses' experiences through analyzing the main themes shared on Instagram by nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast with highly structured research, the current paper highlights nurses' natural language use in describing their experiences during the first months of the outbreak in their workplace.

Synthetic T (8 stereoisomers; all rac-T) is added to infant formula at higher concentrations than natural T (RRR-T only) to adjust for bio-potency differences, but its effects on brain development are poorly understood. OBJECTIVES The objective was to determine the impact of bio-potency-adjusted dietary all rac-T versus RRR-T, fed to dams, on the hippocampal gene expression in weanling mice. METHODS Male/female pairs of C57BL/6J mice were fed AIN 93-G containing RRR-T (NAT) or all rac-T (SYN) at 37.5 or 75 IU/kg (n = 10/group) throughout gestation and lactation. Male pups were euthanized at 21 days. Half the brain was evaluated for the T concentration and stereoisomer distribution. The hippocampus was dissected from the other half, and RNA was extracted and sequenced. Milk T was analyzed in separate dams. RESULTS A total of 797 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the hippocampi across the 4 dietary groups, at a false discovery rate of 10%. Comparing the NAT-37.5 group to the NAT-75 group or the SYN-37.5 group to the SYN-75 group, small differences in brain T concentrations (10%; P < 0.05) led to subtle changes (<10%) in gene expression of 600 (NAT) or 487 genes (SYN), which were statistically significant. Marked differences in brain T stereoisomer profiles (P < 0.0001) had a small effect on fewer genes (NAT-37.5 vs. SYN-37.5, 179; NAT-75 vs. SYN-75, 182). Most of the DEGs were involved in transcription regulation and synapse formation. A network analysis constructed around known vitamin E interacting proteins (VIPs) revealed a group of 32 DEGs between NAT-37.5 vs. SYN-37.5, explained by expression of the gene for the VIP, protein kinase C zeta (Pkcz).

Despite efforts in the cryo-EM community to develop metrics for map and atomistic model validation, thus far, no specific scoring metrics have been applied systematically to assess the interface between the assembly subunits. Here, we comprehensively assessed protein-protein interfaces in macromolecular assemblies derived by cryo-EM. To this end, we developed Protein Interface-score (PI-score), a density-independent machine learning-based metric, trained using the features of protein-protein interfaces in crystal structures. We evaluated 5873 interfaces in 1053 PDB-deposited cryo-EM models (including SARS-CoV-2 complexes), as well as the models submitted to CASP13 cryo-EM targets and the EM model challenge. We further inspected the interfaces associated with low-scores and found that some of those, especially in intermediate-to-low resolution (worse than 4 ?) structures, were not captured by density-based assessment scores. A combined score incorporating PI-score and fit-to-density score showed discriminatory power, allowing our method to provide a powerful complementary assessment tool for the ever-increasing number of complexes solved by cryo-EM.","output":"Assessment of protein-protein interfaces in cryo-EM derived assemblies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rheological properties of triblock copolymers dissolved in a nematic liquid crystal (LC) solvent demonstrate that their microphase separated structure is heavily influenced by changes in LC order.

In more concentrated gels, endblock aggregates persist into the isotopic phase. Dramatic changes in network structure are observed over small temperature windows (as little as 1 C) due to tccche rapidly changing LC order near the isotropization point.

However, the extant literature lacks causal evidence about whether anti-corruption interventions can improve health outcomes. We examine the impact of randomized anti-corruption audits on early-life mortality in Brazil. Methods: The Brazilian government conducted audits in 1,949 randomly selected municipalities between 2003 and 2015. To identify the causal effect of anti-corruption audits on early-life mortality, we analyse data on health outcomes from individual- level vital statistics (DATASUS) collected by Brazil government before and after the random audits. Data on the audit intervention are from the Controladoria-Geral da Uniao, the government agency responsible for the anti-corruption audits. Outcomes are neonatal mortality, infant mortality, child mortality, preterm births, and prenatal visits. Analyses examine aggregate effects for each outcome, as well as effects by race, cause of death, and years since the intervention. Results: Anti-corruption audits significantly decreased early-life mortality in Brazil. Expressed in relative terms, audits reduced neonatal mortality by 6.7% (95% CI -8.3%, -5.0%), reduced infant mortality by 7.3% (-8.6%, -5.9%), and reduced child mortality by 7.3% (-8.5%, -6.0%). This reduction in early mortality was higher for nonwhite Brazilians, who face significant health disparities. Effects are greater when we look at deaths from preventable causes, and show temporal persistence with large effects even a decade after audits. In addition, analyses show that the intervention led to a 12.1% (-13.4%, -10.6%) reduction in women receiving no prenatal care, as well as a 7.4% (-9.4%, -5.5%) reduction in preterm births; these effects are likewise higher for nonwhites and are persistent over time. All effects are robust to various alternative specifications. Interpretation: Governments have the potential to improve health outcomes through anti-corruption interventions. Such interventions can reduce early-life mortality and mitigate health disparities. The impact of anti-corruption audits should be investigated in other countries, and further research should further explore the mechanisms by which combating corruption affects the health sector.","output":"Effects of Randomized Corruption Audits on Early-Life Mortality in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic, the evolution of Industry 4.0, and its implementation in logistics lead to the acceleration of Digital Supply Chains (DSC).

It acts as a selective force that favours the abundance and diversity of reservoir hosts and affects hostCpathogen dynamics and prevalence. This has led to land-use change being a significant driver of infectious diseases emergence. Here, we predict the presence of rodent taxa and map the zoonotic hazard (potential sources of harm) from rodent-borne diseases in the short and long term (2025 and 2050). The study considers three different land-use scenarios based on the shared socioeconomic pathways narratives (SSPs): sustainable (SSP1-Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6), fossil-fuelled development (SSP5-RCP 8.5) and deepening inequality (SSP4-RCP 6.0). We found that cropland expansion into forest and pasture may increase zoonotic hazards in areas with high rodent-species diversity. Nevertheless, a future sustainable scenario may not always reduce hazards. All scenarios presented high heterogeneity in zoonotic hazard, with high-income countries having the lowest hazard range. The SSPs narratives suggest that opening borders and reducing cropland expansion are critical to mitigate current and future zoonotic hazards globally, particularly in middle- and low-income economies.

RECENT FINDINGS: The true incidence of cutaneous reactions in children infected with SARS-CoV-2 is not known. Children's immune systems differ from those of adults and rashes as a manifestation of immune responses, in turn, differ in morphology and distribution. Rarely, children develop a severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome that has overlapping clinical features with Kawasaki disease. In addition, vaccinations produce rashes similar to natural infections. The rashes associated with COVID-19 vaccination are mild and transient, and should not preclude vaccination. Lastly, children who chronically wear masks are more likely to experience flaring of acne around the nose and mouth (maskne) and facial conditions such as seborrheic dermatitis. SUMMARY: There are ongoing worldwide registries, clinical and basic science studies to better understand the burden of skin disease and pathophysiology of rashes seen in patients infected with COVID-19.

While the COVID-19 pandemic has already had far-reaching socioeconomic consequences commonly associated with natural hazards (such as disruption to society, economic damage, and loss of lives), the response of governments around the world has been unparalleled and unlike anything seen before. Governments are faced with a myriad of multi-dimensional effects of the pandemic, including direct impacts on public health systems and population health and indirect socioeconomic effects including disruption to every single sector of the economy and mass unemployment. There is, additionally, the growing realisation that the timescale associated with this crisis may permanently change the very foundations of societies normal day-to-day life. As the world transitions to recovering from COVID-19, those developing that recovery need support in adjusting and improving their policies and measures. The situation seems dire, the stakes are high. Literature about the transition between the response and recovery phase in relation to pandemics is scarce. Further complication is that the pandemic will not allow countries to simply transition to the full-scale recovery, instead, a rebound from recovery to response phase is expected for a certain period until the immunization is in place. Pandemics indeed force us to think beyond typical emergency management structures; the cycles of the disaster risk management in the case of biological and other natural hazards are not exactly the same and no one-size-fits-all approach may be used. Still, some parallels may be drawn with the efforts to combat natural hazards and some lessons may be used from previous and the current pandemic. Based on these experiences and reflections, this paper provides a set of policy directions to be considered during the transition towards, as well as throughout, this transition phase. It is suggested that meeting this global, multi-dimensional, and complex challenge will require considerable international collaboration (even convention) and macro-scale changes to global and national policies. The recovery issues are mainly going to be dominated by politics, economics and social science. Necessary for an effective recovery, the pandemic response needs to be a holistic response, combined with an improved data ecosystem between the public health system and the community. We should also view this outbreak and our response to it as an opportunity to learn lessons and reaffirm our universal commitment to sustainable development and enhancing wellbeing around the world.","output":"Are we there yet?

However, manual delineation is time-consuming and prone to interobserver variability. Automatic spine delineation, especially using deep learning, has shown promising results in healthy subjects. We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of deep learning-based vertebral body delineations for radiotherapy planning purposes. Materials and methods: A multi-scale convolutional neural network (CNN) was used for automatic segmentation and labeling. Two approaches were tested: the combined approach using one CNN for both segmentation and labeling, and the sequential approach using separate CNN's for these tasks. Training and internal validation data included 580 vertebrae, external validation data included 202 vertebrae. For quantitative assessment, Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff distance (HD) were used. Axial slices from external images were presented to radiation oncologists for subjective evaluation. Results: Both approaches performed comparably during the internal validation (DSC: 96.7%, HD: 3.6 mm), but the sequential approach proved more robust during the external validation (DSC: 94.5% vs 94.4%, p < 0.001, HD: 4.5 vs 7.1 mm, p < 0.001). Subsequently, subjective evaluation of this sequential approach showed that experienced radiation oncologists could distinguish automatic from human-made contours in 63% of cases. They rated automatic contours clinically acceptable in 77% of cases, compared to 88% of human-made contours.

However, so far, most long-term policies to decrease the carbon footprint of our societies consider the cost of the system as the leading indicator in the energy system models. This paper is the first to develop a novel approach by adding the energy return on investment (EROI) to a whole energy system optimization model. We built the database with all EROI technologies and resources considered. In addition, moving away from fossil-based to carbon-neutral energy systems raises the issue of the uncertainty of low-carbon technologies and resource data. Thus, we conducted a global sensitivity analysis to identify the main parameters driving the variations in the EROI of the system. This novel approach can be applied to any energy system, and we use a real-world case study to illustrate the model: the 2035 Belgian energy system for several greenhouse gas emissions targets. The main results are threefold: (i) the EROI of the system decreases from 8.9 to 3.9 when greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by 5; (ii) the renewable fuels - mainly imported renewable gas - represent the largest share of the system primary energy mix; (iii) in the sensitivity analysis, the renewable fuels drive 67% of the variation of the EROI of the system for low greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The decrease in the EROI raises questions about meeting the climate targets without adverse socio-economic impact. Most countries rely massively on fossil fuels, and they could encounter an EROI decline when shifting to carbon neutrality. Thus, this study demonstrates the importance of considering other criteria, such as EROI, in energy system models.","output":"The energy return on investment of whole energy systems: application to Belgium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: We aimed to compare the characteristics of elderly and nonelderly COVID-19 pneumonia patients by describing their epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics Methods: It was a retrospective study of patients diagnosed COVID-19 pneumonia who were hospitalized in Tongji Hospital from February 9, 2020 to February 29, 2020 The patients were divided to elderly (65 years old) and non-elderly group (&lt;65 years old) Results: A total of 51 patients were enrolled with 21 in elderly group (42 18%) and 31 in non-elderly group (58 82%) There was a higher proportion of severe and critically ill patients in elderly group Bilateral pneumonia in the chest CT was present in all of the elderly patients, while in 83 33% of the non-elderly patients (P = 0 049) The severe/critically ill elderly patients had lowest proportion of respiratory symptoms, but the highest proportion of diabetes, hypertension and chronic respiratory diseases Half of the elderly patients who were severe/critically ill had lymphocytopenia IL-6 level was the highest among the four groups, and more intensive oxygen or respiratory support, corticosteroid and antibiotics usage were received in severe/critically ill elderly patients Conclusions: The study showed that the clinical symptoms of elderly COVID-19 patients were more insidious, but the clinical conditions were more severe COVID-19 pneumonia cases in elderly people require more precise attention due to its particular characteristics","output":"Clinical features of elderly and nonelderly inpatients with covid-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For all health conditions, reliable age-disaggregated data are vital for both epidemiological analysis and monitoring the relative prioritization of different age groups in policy responses.

One such approach is dark-field imaging, which has recently been introduced and already demonstrated significantly improved radiological benefit in small-animal models, especially for lung diseases. Until now, however, dark-field CT could not yet be translated to the human scale and has been restricted to benchtop and small-animal systems, with scan durations of several minutes or more.

Our study tested whether the association between multiple conditions and mortality varies across ethnic groups in England. Methods and Findings A random sample of primary care patients from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) was followed from 1st January 2015 until 31st December 2019. Ethnicity, usually self-ascribed, was obtained from primary care records if present or from hospital records. Cox regression models were used to estimate mortality by number of long-term conditions, ethnicity and their interaction, with adjustment for age and sex for 532,059 patients with complete data. During five years of follow-up, 5.9% of patients died. Each additional long-term condition at baseline was associated with increased mortality. This association differed across ethnic groups. Compared with 50-year-olds of white ethnicity with no conditions, the mortality rate was higher for white 50-year-olds with two conditions (HR 1.77) or four conditions (HR 3.13). Corresponding figures were higher for 50-year-olds of Black Caribbean ethnicity with two conditions (HR=2.22) or four conditions (HR 4.54). The direction of the interaction of number of conditions with ethnicity showed higher mortality associated with long-term conditions in nine out of ten minoritised ethnic groups, attaining statistical significance in four (Pakistani, Black African, Black Caribbean and Black other ethnic groups). Conclusions The raised mortality rate associated with having multiple conditions is greater in minoritised ethnic groups compared with white people.

Methods: We prospectively analyzed the effects of PP on respiratory mechanics from continuous data with over a thousand time points during 16-h PP sessions in patients with COVID-19 and ARDS under VV-ECMO conditions. The evolution of respiratory mechanical and oxygenation parameters during the PP sessions was evaluated by dividing each PP session into four time quartiles: first quartile: 0C4 h, second quartile: 4C8 h, third quartile: 8C12 h, and fourth quartile: 12C16 h. Results: Overall, 38 PP sessions were performed in 10 patients, with 3 [2C5] PP sessions per patient. Seven (70%) patients were responders to at least one PP session. PP significantly increased the PaO2/FiO2 ratio by 14  21% and compliance by 8  15%, and significantly decreased the oxygenation index by 13  18% and driving pressure by 8  12%. The effects of PP on respiratory mechanics but not on oxygenation persisted after supine repositioning. PP-induced changes in different respiratory mechanical parameters and oxygenation started as early as the first-time quartile, without any difference in PP-induced changes among the different time quartiles. PP-induced changes in driving pressure (?14  14 vs. ?6  10%, p = 0.04) and mechanical power (?11  13 vs. ?0.1  12%, p = 0.02) were significantly higher in responders (increase in PaO2/FiO2 ratio > 20%) than in non-responder patients. Conclusions: In patients with COVID-19 and severe ARDS, PP under VV-ECMO conditions improved the respiratory mechanical and oxygenation parameters, and the effects of PP on respiratory mechanics persisted after supine repositioning.","output":"Effects of Prone Positioning on Respiratory Mechanics and Oxygenation in Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 Requiring Venovenous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Assisted peritoneal dialysis (asPD) is a modality intended for not self-sufficient patients, mainly elderly, who are not able to perform peritoneal dialysis (PD) alone and require some help to manage the treatment.

In the present study, we focused on Internet use for e-services, which could improve youth efficiency in the financial domain (responsible consumer behaviour) and bridge the online divide in youth. Specifically, we explored how societal constructs (namely, institutional trust and personal values) influence the use of the Internet for online shopping, e-banking and communication with providers of goods and services online. We used a representative sample of adolescents (N = 10.902) from 10 countries of Southeast Europe where a great variability in Internet use is present, and where the use of e-services is generally lower than the EU average. This also allowed for meaningful cross-country comparisons. We tested a structural equation model of values predicting the use of the Internet through institutional trust (including some relevant demographic variables such as settlement size, SES and Internet use frequency) which was grounded in social capital theory, cultural theory and Schwartz human values model. The model exhibited a good fit to the data but the strengths of regressional paths were rather modest. Looking into the cross-country stability of the model, however, revealed some notable differences: while the relationship between trust and use of the Internet for e-services was modest in some countries, the relationship was insignificant in other countries, where Internet usage is lower in general. This suggests that strategies aimed at leveraging e-services and digital technology potential in youth should also account for cultural specificities in the transitional economies and cultural settings with sub-optimal adoption of digital services.","output":"Value Orientations and Institutional Trust as Contributors to the Adoption of Online Services in Youth: A Cross-Country Comparison"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, poses a severe threat to humanity.

Severe RNA virus respiratory infections often correlate with high viral load and excessive inflammation. Understanding the dynamics of the innate immune response and its manifestations at the cell and tissue levels is vital to understanding the mechanisms of immunopathology and to developing strain-independent treatments. Here, we present a novel spatialized multicellular computational model of RNA virus infection and the type-I interferon-mediated antiviral response that it induces within lung epithelial cells. The model is built using the CompuCell3D multicellular simulation environment and is parameterized using data from influenza virus-infected cell cultures. Consistent with experimental observations, it exhibits either linear radial growth of viral plaques or arrested plaque growth depending on the local concentration of type I interferons. The model suggests that modifying the activity of signaling molecules in the JAK/STAT pathway or altering the ratio of the diffusion lengths of interferon and virus in the cell culture could lead to plaque growth arrest. The dependence of plaque growth arrest on diffusion lengths highlights the importance of developing validated spatial models of cytokine signaling and the need for in vitro measurement of these diffusion coefficients. Sensitivity analyses under conditions leading to continuous or arrested plaque growth found that plaque growth is more sensitive to variations of most parameters and more likely to have identifiable model parameters when conditions lead to plaque arrest. This result suggests that cytokine assay measurements may be most informative under conditions leading to arrested plaque growth. The model is easy to extend to include SARS-CoV-2-specific mechanisms or to use as a component in models linking epithelial cell signaling to systemic immune models.","output":"Multicellular spatial model of RNA virus replication and interferon responses reveals factors controlling plaque growth dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The spatiotemporal profiling of molecular transmission clusters (MTCs) using viral genomic data can effectively identify transmission networks in order to inform public health actions targeting SARS-CoV-2 spread.

Screening, data extraction and quality grading were undertaken by two reviewers. Results were summarised using descriptive statistics, including a meta-analysis of overall mortality; the relationships between frailty and COVID-19 mortality were summarised narratively. RESULTS: A total of 2,286 papers were screened resulting in 26 being included in the review.

Although it is generally considered a single nosological entity, recent studies suggested remarkable clinical heterogeneity. To date, no studies have identified classes of children with bronchiolitis within the Italian population. This study aimed to identify discrete profiles of Italian children hospitalized with bronchiolitis using a clustering approach and to compare findings with those obtained in international cohorts. METHODS: This was a retrospective single-centre study conducted on children aged 2 years hospitalised with bronchiolitis (n = 401) at the Department of Infectious Diseases and the University Department of General Pediatrics in Giovanni Di Cristina Pediatric Hospital of Palermo, Italy, between November 2012 and May 2019. Bronchiolitis profiles were determined by latent class analysis, classifying children based on clinical characteristics at admission and viral aetiology. RESULTS: Three profiles were identified. Class 1 (49%) was composed of 45% male children; all children were aged 6 months at hospitalization; 77% were infected with RSV; 100% had respiratory distress, 11% had apnea and none had cough. Class 2 (77%) was mainly composed of male subjects (51%); 19% were aged > 6 months at admission; 37% were infected with RSV; 12% had respiratory distress, 5% had apnea and 90% had cough. Class 3 (19%) included the largest proportion of male subjects (94%) and was mostly composed of children aged > 6 months at the time of admission (68%); 70% had cough, 12% showed respiratory distress and none presented with apnoea. Children in Class 1 were more frequently born near the epidemic season (p = 0.028); breastfeeding duration was significantly longer for children in Class 3 (p = 0.004).

This study aims to determine the true effect of ACEI/ARBs use on the risk of infection and clinical outcome of COVID-19. Methods Five electronic databases (PubMed, Web of science, Cochrane library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, medRxiv preprint server) were retrieved to find eligible studies. Meta-analysis was performed to examine the association between ACEI/ARBs use and the risk of infection and clinical outcome of COVID-19. Results 22 articles containing 157,328 patients were included. Use of ACEI/ARBs was not associated with increased risk of infection (Adjusted OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.91-1.01, I2=5.8%) or increased severity (Adjusted OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.77-1.05, I2=27.6%) of COVID-19.

METHODS: We collected facility-based and household costs of all nine pregnant women with COVID-19 managed at the hospital. We compared their mean facility-based costs with those paid by pregnant women pre-COVID-19, identifying cost-drivers. We also estimated what would have been paid without subsidies, testing assumptions with a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Total utilization costs ranged from US $494 for SVD with mild COVID-19 to US $4553 for emergency CD with severe COVID-19. Though 32%-66% of facility-based cost were subsidized, costs of SVD and CD during the pandemic have doubled and tripled, respectively, compared with those paid pre-COVID-19. Of the facility-based costs, cost of personal protective equipment was the major cost-driver (50%). Oxygen was the major driver for women with severe COVID-19 (48%).

Recent research on mammals found that neutrophil concentrations disproportionately increased (scaled hypermetrically) with body mass, a result not predicted by any existing theory. Although the scaling relationship for mammals might predict how leucocyte concentrations scale with body mass in other vertebrates, vertebrate classes are distinct in many ways that might affect their current and historic interactions with parasites and hence the evolution of their immune systems. Subsequently, here, we asked which existing scaling hypothesis best-predicts relationships between body mass and lymphocyte, eosinophil and heterophil concentrations-the avian functional equivalent of neutrophils-among more than 100 species of birds. We then examined the predictive power of body mass relative to life-history variation, as extensive literature indicates that the timing of key life events has influenced immune system variation among species. Finally, we ask whether avian scaling patterns differ from the patterns we observed in mammals. We found that an intercept-only model best explained lymphocyte and eosinophil concentrations among birds, indicating that the concentrations of these cell types were both independent of body mass. For heterophils, however, body mass explained 31% of the variation in concentrations among species, much more than life-history variation (4%). As with mammalian neutrophils, avian heterophils scaled hypermetrically (b = 0.19  0.05), but more steeply than mammals (approx. 1.5 ; 0.11  0.03). As such, we discuss why birds might require more broadly protective cells compared to mammals of the same body size.

The results of network analysis showed that 8 genera were identified to be the main potential hosts of ARGs, including Mycobacterium, Ferruginibacter, Thermomonas, Morganella, Enterococcus, Bacteroides, Myroides and Romboutsia. The removal of ARGs and their possible bacterialhosts were synchronous and consistent by chlorine or ultraviolet (UV) disinfection in WWTPs. The mechanisms of ARB and ARGs removal, and conjugation transfer of RP4 plasmids by UV, chlorine and synergistic UV/chlorine disinfection was revealed. Compared to UV alone, ARB inactivation was improved 1.4 log and photoreactivation was overcomeeffectively by UV/chlorine combination (8 mJ/cm2, chlorine 2 mg/L). However, ARGs degradation was more difficult than ARB inactivation. Until UV dosage enhanced to 320 mJ/cm2, ARGs achieved 0.58-1.60 log removal. Meanwhile, when 2 mg/L of chlorine was combined with UV combination, ARGs removal enhanced 1-1.5 log. The synergistic effect of adding low-dose chlorine (1-2 mg/L) during UV radiation effectively improved ARB and ARGs removal simultaneously. The same synergistic effect also occurred in the horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Non-lethal dose chlorine (0.5 mg/L) increased the conjugation transfer frequency,which confirmed that the mRNA expression levels of type IV secretion system (T4SS) proteins vir4D, vir5B and vir10B were significantly enhanced. The risk of RP4 plasmid conjugation transfer was significantly reduced with UV/chlorine (UV  4 mJ/cm2, chlorine  1 mg/L).

Diarrhea is a common early symptom in a significant proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate in esophageal cells and enterocytes, leading to direct damage to the intestinal epithelium. The infection decreases the level of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, thereby altering the composition of the gut microbiota. SARS-CoV-2 elicits a cytokine storm, which contributes to gastrointestinal inflammation. The direct cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2, gut dysbiosis, and aberrant immune response result in increased intestinal permeability, which may exacerbate existing symptoms and worsen the prognosis. By exploring the elements of pathogenesis, several therapeutic options have emerged for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, such as biologics and biotherapeutic agents. However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the feces may facilitate the spread of COVID-19 through fecal-oral transmission and contaminate the environment. Thus gastrointestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection has important epidemiological significance.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of medical charts of patients arrived at the ED of Gaslini Children's Hospital from 10th March 2020 to 30th April 2019 and the same frame of 2020 were performed. We compared two groups by demographics, duration of fever before ED admission, triage code, number of patients hospitalized after ED evaluation. We calculated proportion and incidence rate for airborne infections, fever, and urinary tract infections (UTI), appendicitis, and gastroenteritis for control. RESULTS: 1362 children arrived at the ED during the lockdown compared to 5628 in the same period of 2019 (?75,8%). No difference was noticed (27.7% vs 28.4%) in the total amount of infectious episodes. A significant reduction in rate of incidence and proportion were observed for upper respiratory tract infections (21,4% vs 28%), otitis (2,6% vs 16,2%), streptococcal infections (0,5% vs 5,2%) and bronchiolitis (2,1% vs 5,7%). Conversely, FUO (27,8 vs 11,1%), infectious mononucleosis (2,6% vs 0,4%), UTI (7,4% vs 2,9%) and appendicitis (6,8% vs 1,1%) significantly increased. Median time from the onset of fever and arrival in ED was significantly lower in 2020 group. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated a reduction in community-acquired respiratory infections during the lockdown for COVID-19. The increase in rate of FUO and febrile conditions, together with the short time from fever onset and ED visit could be related to the fear for a SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on infectious diseases epidemiology: The experience of a tertiary Italian Pediatric Emergency Department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The Typus Melancholicus (TM) is the premorbid personality of endogenous depression defined by Tellenbach and Kraus and characterized by orderliness, conscientiousness, norm orientation and intolerance of ambiguity. Tellenbach's hypothesis was to find around 50% of TM in the sample of patients with an Unipolar Depression (UD). The present paper aims to make a literature review on the relationship between the Typus Melancholicus (TM) and Unipolar Depression (UD). METHODS Nineteen references were selected through searches on PubMed, Google Scholar and Sciences-Direct with the following MeSH terms in the title: Typus Melancholicus AND Depressive or Depression or Dpression or Depressione. Nine of them were selected for our review. RESULTS Eight of the nine reviewed articles confirm Tellenbach's hypothesis. The literature review also shows that, in a population of UD, TM is always constant regardless of age or sex, has no relationship to clinical characteristics and could contribute to the chronicity of depression. The TM with depression have increased levels of \\"lack of vital drive\\" and \\"feelings of guilt\\" and low scores in irritability and dysphoria compared to Non-Typus Melancholicus (NTM). Due to its characteristics, TM could also be involved in some pathologies such as burnout or postpartum depression. TM does not seem to be linked to a particular Personality Disorder or maladaptive personality, but the two may coexist in certain circumstances. It has been suggested that specific psychotherapeutic methods can be used to treat TM with UD. CONCLUSIONS The TM could be very useful in our clinical practice. Better practical knowledge of TM could lead to more efficient psychiatric care as well as heightened capacity to predict new episodes.","output":"The Relationship between Typus Melancholicus and Unipolar Depression: A Literature Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To identify the most common transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) parameters in patients hospitalised with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19) and their association with myocardial injury and outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective, single-centre, observational, exploratory cohort study was performed at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. All SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive patients who underwent a TTE during their inpatient admission between 1 March 2020 and 31 October 2020 were analysed. The most frequent cardiovascular risk factor profile and echocardiographic features were investigated. RESULTS: A total of 87 patients met the eligibility criteria. A salient 41.4% (n=36) of our cohort succumbed to this devastating virus. More than half of our hospital population (58.6%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ITU) and this was significantly associated with inpatient mortality (OR: 7.14, CI 2.53 to 20.19, p<0.001). Hypertension was the most common cardiovascular risk factor (51.7%) with no additional prominence in non-survivors (OR: 2.33, CI 0.97 to 5.61, p=0.059). Remarkably, 90.8% of our cohort demonstrated a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, although 69.1% had elevated troponin levels. Only 1 patient (1.1%) was given a diagnostic label of myocarditis. A raised pulmonary artery systolic pressure (36.8%) andright ventricle (RV) dysfunction (26.4%) were the most common echocardiographic features. In particular, the presence of RV dysfunction was significantly related to adverse outcomes (OR: 2.97, CI 1.11 to 7.94, p<0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of extremely unwell patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonitis, the presence of RV dysfunction or admission to ITU was significantly associated with inpatient case fatality ratio.

Fourteen participants were lost to follow-up. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were non-randomly allocated to the intervention group with two consecutive treatment modules (physiotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy) with a duration of 9 weeks each or to the control group (treatment as usual). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Feasibility was operationalised in terms of delivering and evaluating the therapeutic combination. Regarding eligibility as the first aspect of feasibility, willingness to participate, dropout and satisfaction were assessed; for the second aspect, standardised self-report questionnaires measuring health-related quality of life, depression severity and pain were applied. RESULTS: Although eligibility and willingness-to-participate rates were low, satisfaction of the participants in the intervention group was high and dropout rates were low. Results indicated a small and non-significant intervention effect in health-related quality of life and significant effects regarding depression severity and pain.

Two anti-SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 80R and 362 are known to bind to epitopes on the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and neutralize the virus. To investigate this further and hypothesize structures for potentially more effective antibodies, undergraduate students cooperated in teams as part of the CREST (Connecting Researchers, Educators, and STudents) Program with the Center for Biological Modeling. Working collaboratively, students from eight universities nationwide applied their knowledge to build 3-D printed models to explain a particular protein-based molecular story using crystal structures of proteins described in the literature. The Nova Southeastern University (NSU) CREST team modeled and compared the 80R antibody that binds to SARS-CoV-1 and the MAb362 antibody that can bind to both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Students developed skills with protein visualization software including Pymol and Jmol to design models which showed the 80R and 362 antibodies binding to the RBD of the corresponding proteins. By studying the point mutation differences between the two antibodies (80R and 362), a potentially more universal antibody (named NSU1 in this study) was modeled. This hypothesized antibody was expected to bind more effectively to future mutations in the SARS spike protein. At the binding interface between these antibodies and the SARS spike protein, MAb362 mutations trend smaller and less polar including: Arg149Ser, Asn151Ser, Asp170Gly, and Trp213Ser. Due to the trend of smaller amino acids appearing in the MAb362 binding interface, it was hypothesized that more space in this area could allow antibodies to be more resistant to future SARS-CoV spike protein structure variations. NSU1 was modeled based on MAb362 with the following four additional mutations: Asp103Gly, Trp104Leu, Gly170Ser, and Arg211Val. All of these except for Gly170 are mutations that decreased size and polarity of amino acid residues within the binding interface. Position 170 is Asp on the 80R structure and thus a mutation to Ser is still expected to maintain this trend of smaller residues in the antibody. Due to the additional space created due to these amino acid substitutions in the binding region between the antibody and RBD of the spike protein, NSU1 was predicted to be more resistant to spike protein mutations. These models allowed for deeper understanding of the impact that mutations in antibodies can have on binding interactions with viral proteins. Additionally, the modeling process also provided insight into the molecular structure of a potentially more universal antibody against variations in SARS-CoV.","output":"Minor Changes with Large Implications: Modeling Amino Acid Mutations in SARS-CoV Monoclonal Antibodies (80R and 362) Towards the Design of More Universal Antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infect the human respiratory tract. A prototype thermodynamic equilibrium model is presented here for the probability of the virions getting through the mucus barrier and infecting epithelial cells based on the binding affinity (K(mucin)) of the virions to mucin molecules in the mucus and parameters for binding and infection of the epithelial cell. Both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind strongly to their cellular receptors, DDP4 and ACE2, respectively, and infect very efficiently both bronchus and lung ex vivo cell cultures which are not protected by a mucus barrier. According to the model, mucin binding could reduce the infectivity for MERS-CoV compared to SARS-CoV-2 by at least 100-fold depending on the magnitude of K(mucin). Specifically K(mucin) values up to 10(6) M(?1) have little protective effect and thus the mucus barrier would not remove SARS-CoV-2 which does not bind to sialic acids (SA) and hence would have a very low K(mucin). Depending on the viability of individual virions, the ID(50) for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 500 virions (viral RNA genomic copies) representing 1 to 2 pfu. In contrast MERS-CoV binds both SA and human mucin and a K(mucin) of 5  10(9) M(?1) as reported for lectins would mop up 99.83% of the virus according to the model with the ID(50) for MERS-CoV estimated to be 295,000 virions (viral RNA genomic copies) representing 819 pfu. This could in part explain why MERS-CoV is poorly transmitted from human to human compared to SARS-CoV-2. Some coronaviruses use an esterase to escape the mucin, although MERS-CoV does not. Instead, it is shown here that clustering of virions into single aerosol particles as recently reported for rotavirus in extracellular vesicles could provide a co-operative mechanism whereby MERS-CoV could theoretically overcomes the mucin barrier locally and a small proportion of 10 m diameter aerosol particles could contain 70 virions based on reported maximum levels in saliva. Although recent evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 initiates infection in the nasal epithelium, the thermodynamic equilibrium models presented here could complement published approaches for modelling the physical entry of pathogens to the lung based on the fate and transport of the pathogen particles (as for anthrax spores) to develop a dose-response model for aerosol exposure to respiratory viruses. This would enable the infectivity through aerosols to be defined based on molecular parameters as well as physical parameters. The role of the spike proteins of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 binding to SA and heparan sulphate, respectively, may be to aid non-specific attachment to the host cell. It is proposed that a high K(mucin) is the cost for subsequent binding of MERS-CoV to SAs on the cell surface to partially overcome the unfavourable entropy of immobilisation as the virus adopts the correct orientation for spike protein interactions with its protein cellular receptor DPP4.","output":"Thermodynamic equilibrium dose-response models for MERS-CoV infection reveal a potential protective role of human lung mucus but not for SARS-CoV-2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines and compares financial market reaction and recovery of four broad classes of financial assets C equity indexes, precious metals, 10-year benchmark bonds and cryptocurrencies, to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite significant drug discovery research against dengue viruses (DENV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), no fully effective and specific drugs directed against these viruses have been discovered. Here, we examined the anti-DENV activity of tubercidin derivatives from a compound library from Hokkaido University and demonstrated that 5-hydroxymethyltubercidin (HMTU, HUP1108) possessed both potent anti-flavivirus and anti-coronavirus activities at submicromolar levels without significant cytotoxicity. Furthermore, HMTU inhibited viral RNA replication and specifically inhibited replication at the late stages of the SARS-CoV-2 infection process. Finally, we demonstrated that HMTU 5-triphosphate inhibited RNA extension catalyzed by the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase. Our findings suggest that HMTU has the potential of serving as a lead compound for the development of a broad-spectrum of antiviral agents, including SARS-CoV-2.","output":"5-Hydroxymethyltubercidin Exhibits Potent Antiviral Activity against Flaviviruses and Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 necessitates the rapid development of new therapies against COVID-19 infection.

To date, however, the effectiveness of teaching ear anatomy using 3-D holographic technology has not been studied. The present study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of learning ear anatomy using a holographic (HG) anatomic model in comparison to didactic lecture (DL) and a computer module (CM). METHODS A 3-D anatomic model of the middle and inner ear was created and displayed using presentation slides in a lecture, computer module, or via the Microsoft HoloLens. Twenty-nine medical students were randomized to one of the three interventions. All participants underwent assessment of baseline knowledge of ear anatomy. Immediately following each intervention, testing was repeated along with completion of a satisfaction survey. RESULTS Baseline test scores did not differ across intervention groups. All groups showed an improvement in anatomic knowledge post-intervention (p < 0.001); the improvement was equal across all interventions (p = 0.06). Participants rated the interventions equally for delivery of factual content (p = 0.96), but rated the HG higher than the DL and CM for overall effectiveness, ability to convey spatial relationships, and for learner engagement and motivation (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that 3-D holographic technology is an effective method of teaching ear anatomy as compared to DLs and CMs. Furthermore, it is better at engaging and motivating learners compared to traditional methods, meriting its inclusion as a tool in undergraduate medical education curriculum.","output":"Evaluating the effectiveness of learning ear anatomy using holographic models."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim is to improve the teaching quality of music majors and cultivate their innovative ability.

Secondly, the DTs platform is divided into online learning feature analysis and virtual-real teaching space integration functional modules. This article explores the online immersive education process design and technology application of the DTs platform from the two aspects of teaching and technology. Afterward, it designs a student action and expression recognition network based on the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) Net model and Google Net model in teaching data collection and management. Finally, the proposed system is tested. The test results show that the active and passive interaction curves of the traditional VME system have no obvious fluctuation, indicating that the interaction of the traditional VME system is not strong, and the ability of active feedback information is poor. By contrast, the active and passive interaction curves in the proposed VME have large fluctuations, showing that the proposed VME has more frequent interaction, and the teaching information can get real-time and active feedback. Therefore, the proposed VME system can better stimulate students' learning desire. Meanwhile, the constructed Neural Network (NN) has the highest recognition accuracy of 99.07% on the student action and expression dataset. When tested with the image data taken by the research experiment, the highest accuracy is 89%, with an average of more than 85%.

All hospitalized patients with confirmed and suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between 16 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. COVID-19 patients were separated into two groups, pneumonia and nonpneumonia, and then compared to determine predicting factors for COVID-19 pneumonia. Variables that had a P-value of less than 0.20 and were not correlated with each other were included in the logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of the 247 patients included in the study 58% were female, and the median age was 40. COVID-19 was confirmed in 70.9% of these patients. Among the confirmed COVID-19 cases, 21.4% had pneumonia. In the multivariate analysis male sex (P = 0.028), hypertension (P = 0.022), and shortness of breath on hospital admission (P = 0.025) were significant factors predicting COVID-19 pneumonia.

In this study, we found that dryocrassin ABBA and filixic acid ABA have an inhibitory activity against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, dryocrassin ABBA and filixic acid ABA exhibited inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero cells dose-dependently using the immunofluorescence-based antiviral assays. Moreover, these compounds inhibited SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection, suggesting their broad-spectrum anticoronaviral activity. In addition, a 5-day repeated-dose toxicity study of dryocrassin ABBA and filixic acid ABA suggested that an approximately lethal dose of these compounds in mice was >10 mg/kg. Pharmacokinetic studies of dryocrassin ABBA showed good microsomal stability, low hERG inhibition, and low CYP450 inhibition. In vivo pharmacokinetic properties of dryocrassin ABBA showed a long half-life (5.5C12.6 h) and high plasma exposure (AUC 19.3C65 gh/mL).

The objective of this study was to determine serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels during the first week of follow up, whether such levels are associated with severity during the first week and whether non-surviving patients showed higher MDA levels than survivors during the first week. METHODS: We performed an observational, prospective, multicenter study in six Spanish Intensive Care Units. Serum levels of MDA were measured in 328 patients (215 survivors and 113 non-survivors) with severe sepsis at days one, four and eight of diagnosis, and in 100 healthy controls. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality and the secondary endpoint was six -month mortality. The association between continuous variables was carried out using Spearmans rank correlation coefficient. Cox regression analysis was applied to determine the independent contribution of serum MDA levels on the prediction of 30-day and 6-month mortality. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated as measures of the clinical impact of the predictor variables. RESULTS: We found higher serum MDA in septic patients at day one (p < 0.001), day four (p < 0.001) and day eight (p < 0.001) of diagnosis than in healthy controls. Serum MDA was lower in surviving than non-surviving septic patients at day one (p < 0.001), day four (p < 0.001) and day eight (p < 0.001). Serum MDA levels were positively correlated with lactic acid and SOFA during the first week. Finally, serum MDA levels were associated with 30-day mortality (HR = 1.05; 95% CI = 1.02-1.09; p = 0.005) and six-month mortality (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.05; 95% CI = 1.02-1.09; p = 0.003) after controlling for lactic acid levels, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE)-II, diabetes mellitus, bloodstream infection and chronic renal failure. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest series providing data on the oxidative state in septic patients to date.

To address this issue, Transformers have drawn increasing interest in exploiting long-range dependencies among input data. In this study, we aim to enjoy the merits of both local and global feature extractions in CNN and Transformer architectures. To this end, we go beyond the conventional Transformer frameworks and introduce a highly efficient Transformer architecture for early diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients using CT images. Unlike conventional data-hungry Transformers, our model relaxes the requirement of large-scale training data in vision Transformers and also outperforms the state-of-the-art studies. This flexibility empowers our Transformer architecture to be exploited in data-scarce domains. Moreover, we tailor our Transformer architecture in two ways to embody the principle of locality, which once belonged to CNNs. First, we minimally inject convolutional inductive bias into the early blocks of our Transformer architecture and eliminate standard image patching in the vanilla Transformers. Second, unlike typical patch integration in the standard Transformers, we benefit from a deformable convolution in our architecture to adaptively attend to a small set of key features corresponding to nearby patches. Extensive evaluations verify that our Transformer surpasses its counterparts, alleviates the computational complexity of Transformers, and deals with the lack of large-scale training dataset for COVID-19 diagnosis. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Lightweight Local Transformer for COVID-19 Detection Using Chest CT Scans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical manifestations accompanying respiratory failure with insidious and rapidly progressive onset are often non-specific Symptoms such as a cough, dyspnea, and fever are common to a large number of inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic diseases During the COVID-19 pandemic it is essential to limit the use of hospital services and inappropriate diagnostic techniques A particular radiological pattern can orient the clinical and laboratory scenario and guide the diagnostic workup A 58-year-old woman was admitted to our COVID-19 unit for suspected coronavirus infection She was complaining of worsening dyspnea, tachycardia, and low grade fever A chest X-ray showed diffuse, alveolar, and interstitial lung involvement with micronodules tending to coalescence This radiographic pattern known as galaxy sign, consistent with diffuse, coalescing nodular miliary pulmonary involvement, simulating a non-specific alveolar opacification of the lungs is typical of a few pneumological differential diagnoses, represented by sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, pneumoconiosis, and metastatic lesions, and virtually excludes an interstitial viral pneumonitis The use of endoscopic techniques can, in such cases, confirm the clinical suspicion for initiating appropriate targeted therapies","output":"A Galactic Chest X-ray"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Bilateral cavitary lung lesions with calcification in a patient with chronic COVID requiring transplantation are described.

Annual rates and costs of spinal deformity surgery have both increased over the past two decades. However, the impact of non-elective status on total cost of hospitalization and patient outcomes has not been quantified. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of admission status on patient outcomes and healthcare costs in spinal deformity surgery. METHODS All patients who underwent spinal deformity surgery at a single institution between 2008 and 2016 were grouped by admission status: elective, emergency (ED), or transferred. Demographics were compared by univariate analysis. Cost of care and length of stay (LOS) were compared between admission statuses using multivariable linear regression with elective admissions as reference. Multivariate logistic regression was utilized to assess in-hospital complications, discharge destination, and readmission rates. RESULTS There were 427 spinal deformity surgeries included in this study. Compared to elective patients, ED patients had higher Elixhauser Comorbidity Index scores (p < 0.0001), longer LOS (+ 10.9 days, 97.5% CI 6.1-15.6 days, p < 0.0001), and higher costs (+ $20,076, 97.5% CI $9,073-$31,080, p = 0.0008). Transferred patients had significantly higher Elixhauser scores (p = 0.0002), longer LOS (+ 8.8 days, 97.5% CI 3.0-14.7 days, p < 0.0001), and higher rates of non-home discharge (OR = 15.8, 97.5% CI 2.3-110.0, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION Patients admitted from the ED undergoing spinal deformity surgery had significantly higher cost of care and longer LOS compared to elective patients.

METHODS: An international cross-sectional survey was administered to 2557 caregivers of children in 17 pediatric emergency departments (EDs) across 6 countries from March 26, 2020, to June 30, 2020. Caregivers were asked to select 1 of 4 choices with which they most agreed regarding a proposed COVID-19 vaccine-approval process, in addition to questions regarding demographic characteristics, the ED visit, and attitudes about COVID-19. Univariate analyses were conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test for comparing non-normally distributed continuous variables, an independent t test for comparing normally distributed continuous variables, and a &#967;2 or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used for determining independent factors associated with caregivers' willingness to accept abridged development of a COVID-19 vaccine. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. FINDINGS: Almost half (1101/2557; 43%) of caregivers reported that they were willing to accept less rigorous testing and postresearch approval of a new COVID-19 vaccine. Independent factors associated with caregivers' willingness to accept expedited COVID-19 vaccine research included having children who were up to date on the vaccination schedule (odds ratio [OR] = 1.72; 95% CI, 1.29-2.31), caregivers' concern about having had COVID-19 themselves at the time of survey completion in the ED (OR = 1.1; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16), and caregivers' intent to have their children vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine were to become available (OR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.54-2.21). Compared with fathers, mothers completing the survey were less likely to approve of changes in the vaccine-development process (OR = 0.641; 95% CI, 0.529-0.775). IMPLICATIONS: Less than half of caregivers in this worldwide sample were willing to accept abbreviated COVID-19 vaccine testing. As a part of an effort to increase acceptance and uptake of a new vaccine, especially in order to protect children, public health strategies and individual providers should understand caregivers' attitudes toward the approval of a vaccine and consult them appropriately.","output":"Caregivers' Willingness to Accept Expedited Vaccine Research During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For many years, the development of assays took place in the laboratories where the test was required.

This online landscape holds multiple negative consequences for society, such as a decline in human autonomy, rising incivility in online conversation, the facilitation of political extremism, and the spread of disinformation. Benevolent choice architects working with regulators may curb the worst excesses of manipulative choice architectures, yet the strategic advantages, resources, and data remain with commercial players. One way to address some of this imbalance is with interventions that empower Internet users to gain some control over their digital environments, in part by boosting their information literacy and their cognitive resistance to manipulation.

Among the 7 cases, serum white blood cell count was increased in 1 case, decreased in 1 case, liver transaminase was increased in 1 case, lactate dehydrogenase was increased in 3 cases, creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) was increased in 2 cases, and C-reactive protein was elevated in 2 cases. A total of 4 cases were complicated with mycoplasma pneumoniae and/or influenza B virus infection. A single case of chest computed tomography (CT) showed viral pneumonia. With routine antiviral and symptomatic support therapy, the median time taken for the results of nucleic acid testing by pharyngeal swab to become negative was 14 days (6-26 days) and the median hospital stay was 15 days (8-31 days). All participants were cured and subsequently discharged from hospital. Only 1 case was positive for nucleic acid testing by pharyngeal swab 1 month after being discharged, and the anal swab of 1 case for nucleic acid testing was positive 2 months after being discharged. Conclusions All children with COVID-19 who were included in this study in Jingzhou were infected via family clustering, and the laboratory examinations were not specific. Fever and cough were common symptoms, but all cases were mild and had good prognoses.","output":"Clinical analysis of seven pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Jingzhou, Hubei, China: a retrospective study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: An increased appreciation for vaccines could be expected due to COVID-19 However, surveys show a polarization in opinions with about 20% of Americans preemptively rejecting any COVID-19 vaccine, partly due to inconsistent risk communication While Health Care Professionals (HCPs) will be heavily relied upon to encourage uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine and 70% of Americans receive their vaccine information from HCPs, 84% also rely on peer networks Understanding that HCPs have an important, but not exclusive, influence on health decision making can signal a new approach This study provides data on where women, the main decision-makers regarding immunization in most families access information about vaccination Methods: Through an online survey conducted in UK, Brazil, Germany, Italy and Canada from 10 to 19-March 2020, we collected data on where, and from whom, women aged 25-54 years access information about vaccination We set 1000 respondents/ country quotas to reflect regional differences with data weighted as necessary Results: 5,036 women who met inclusion criteria responded: from the UK (1,003), Brazil (1,002), Germany (1,008), Italy (1,007), and Canada (1,016) Though most likely to receive vaccination info via their HCP: in Germany, women are least likely to be influenced by HCPs, with those aged 25-34 years more likely to turn to family members or online sources;in the UK, they are more likely to find info via a health authority's website;and in Brazil, they are more likely to see info in traditional media and on Facebook Only 50% ranked vaccine efficacy and disease risk in the Top 5 factors influencing their vaccine decisions, alongside the opinion of an HCP, recommendation of a Public Health Authority and impact of the disease Conclusion: HCPs, families and peers are important sources of info regarding vaccination COVID-19 is unlikely to improve vaccine confidence as the issue becomes increasingly polarized and communications more inconsistent We can respond by investing in health promotion and harmonized communications through peer networks Since caregivers, their families and peers have increased weight in vaccination decisions, then they should have increased weight in preventive health strategies","output":"Vaccine confidence, COVID19, and the influence of peer networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The residual slurry obtained from the anaerobic digestion (AD) of biogas feed substrates such as livestock dung is known as BGS. BGS is a rich source of nutrients and bioactive compounds having an important role in establishing diverse microbial communities, accelerating nutrient use efficiency, and promoting overall soil and plant health management. However, challenges such as lower C/N transformation rates, ammonia volatilization, high pH, and bulkiness limit their extensive applications. Here we review the strategies of BGS valorization through microbial and organomineral amendments. Such cohesive approaches can serve dual purposes viz. green organic inputs for sustainable agriculture practices and value addition of biomass waste. The literature survey has been conducted to identify the knowledge gaps and critically analyze the latest technological interventions to upgrade the BGS for potential applications in agriculture fields. The major points are as follows: (1) Bio/nanotechnology-inspired approaches could serve as a constructive platform for integrating BGS with other organic materials to exploit microbial diversity dynamics through multi-substrate interactions. (2) Advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) pave an ideal pathway to study the complex microflora and translate the potential information into bioprospecting of BGS to ameliorate existing bio-fertilizer formulations. (3) Nanoparticles (NPs) have the potential to establish a link between syntrophic bacteria and methanogens through direct interspecies electron transfer and thereby contribute towards improved efficiency of AD. (4) Developments in techniques of nutrient recovery from the BGS facilities negative GHGs emissions and energy-efficient models for nitrogen removal. (5) Possibilities of formulating low-cost substrates for mass-multiplication of beneficial microbes, bioprospecting of such microbes to produce bioactive compounds of anti-phytopathogenic activities, and developing BGS-inspired biofertilizer formulations integrating NPs, microbial inoculants, and deoiled seed cakes have been examined.

Furthermore, the model has a unique endemic and disease-free equilibria.

Chest computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in the diagnosis of lung diseases, but its value in the diagnosis of cardiac injury remains unknown. Methods: We enrolled 241 consecutive hospitalized patients (aged 61  16 years, 115 males) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 11 to March 2, 2020. They were divided into two groups according to whether major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) occurred during the follow-up. The anteroposterior diameter of the left atrium (LAD), the length of the left ventricle (LV), and cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) were measured. The values of myocardial CT were also recorded. Results: Of 241 patients, 115 patients (47.7%) had adverse cardiovascular events. Compared with no MACEs, patients with MACEs were more likely to have bilateral lesions (95.7% vs. 86.5%, p = 0.01). In multivariable analysis, bronchial wall thickening would increase the odds of MACEs by 13.42 (p = 0.01). LAD + LV and CTR was the best predictor for MACEs (area under the curve = 0.88, p < 0.001) with a sensitivity of 82.6% and a specificity of 80.2%.

Data were mainly collected from interviews with Zong-Teng managers and public online resources. Through case analysis, this paper identifies that a fit between the information processing requirements of a firm and its information processing capability leads to greater ambidexterity for exploitation and exploration, which in turn improves supply chain resilience (SCR) in the form of agility, redundancy and flexibility. In addition, ambidexterity in terms of morality improves SCR culture.

Older people with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and in particular hypertension, are at higher risk of hospitalization and death for COVID-19. Whether hypertension medications may increase the risk for death in older COVID 19 inpatients at the highest risk for the disease is currently unknown. Methods: Data from 5,625 COVID-19 inpatients were manually extracted from medical charts from 61 hospitals across Italy. From the initial 5,625 patients, 3,179 were included in the study as they were either discharged or deceased at the time of the data analysis. Primary outcome was inpatient death or recovery. Mixed effects logistic regression models were adjusted for sex, age, and number of comorbidities, with a random effect for site. Results: A large proportion of participating inpatients were 65 years old (58%), male (68%), non-smokers (93%) with comorbidities (66%). Each additional comorbidity increased the risk of death by 35% [(adj)OR = 1.35 (1.2, 1.5) p < 0.001]. Use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers or Ca-antagonists was not associated with significantly increased risk of death. There was a marginal negative association between ARB use and death, and a marginal positive association between diuretic use and death. Conclusions: This Italian nationwide observational study of COVID-19 inpatients, the majority of which 65 years old, indicates that there is a linear direct relationship between the number of comorbidities and the risk of death. Among CVDs, hypertension and pre-existing cardiomyopathy were significantly associated with risk of death. The use of hypertension medications reported to be safe in younger cohorts, do not contribute significantly to increased COVID-19 related deaths in an older population that suffered one of the highest death tolls worldwide.","output":"Comorbidities, Cardiovascular Therapies, and COVID-19 Mortality: A Nationwide, Italian Observational Study (ItaliCO)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Anal squamous cell carcinoma incidence is increasing nationally and, more so, in Kentucky. Squamous cell carcinoma of the anus unexpectedly identified at hemorrhoidectomy pathologic evaluation is not uncommon. We hypothesized this is occurring more frequently and sought to evaluate its impact on outcomes. METHODS The Kentucky Cancer Registry, a premier population database, was queried for all squamous cell carcinoma of the anus cases between 2007 and 2016. Hemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinoma of the anus patients were compared with nonhemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinomas of the anus. Patient demographics, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Of the 722 squamous cell carcinoma of the anus cases identified, 3.05% (n = 22) were within hemorrhoidectomy specimens. Demographics were similar between hemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinoma of the anus versus nonhemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinoma of the anus. Chemoradiation was the most common treatment strategy among all patients, and there were similar rates of disease, persistence, recurrence, and survival between hemorrhoidal and nonhemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinoma. Stage I disease was more common in the hemorrhoid group compared with the nonhemorrhoid group (63% vs 27%, P < .01). CONCLUSION Hemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinoma of the anus comprised 3.05% of our population-based cohort. Hemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinomas of the anus were more likely to receive chemoradiation compared with local excision, but there were similar oncologic outcomes. We postulate that some individuals may receive overtreatment with chemoradiation owing to imprecise labeling of hemorrhoid specimens.

Consequently, many countries have implemented flight restrictions to China. China itself has imposed a lockdown of the population of Wuhan as well as the entire Hubei province. However, whether these two enormous measures have led to significant changes in the spread of COVID-19 cases remains unclear. METHODS: We analyzed available data on the development of confirmed domestic and international COVID-19 cases before and after lockdown measures. We evaluated the correlation of domestic air traffic to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and determined the growth curves of COVID-19 cases within China before and after lockdown as well as after changes in COVID-19 diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: Our findings indicate a significant increase in doubling time from 2 days (95% Confidence Interval, CI): 1.9C2.6), to 4 days (95% CI: 3.5C4.3), after imposing lockdown. A further increase is detected after changing diagnostic and testing methodology to 19.3 (95% CI: 15.1C26.3), respectively. Moreover, the correlation between domestic air traffic and COVID-19 spread became weaker following lockdown (before lockdown: r = 0.98, p < 0.05 vs. after lockdown: r = 0.91, p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: A significantly decreased growth rate and increased doubling time of cases was observed, which is most likely due to Chinese lockdown measures. A more stringent confinement of people in high risk areas seem to have a potential to slow down the spread of COVID-19.","output":"The positive impact of lockdown in Wuhan on containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing global health crisis due to covid-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Although covid-19 leads to little or mild flu-like symptoms in the majority of affected patients, the disease may cause severe, frequently lethal complications such as progressive pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure driven by hyperinflammation and a cytokine storm syndrome. This situation causes various major challenges for gastroenterology. In the context of IBD, several key questions arise. For instance, it is an important question to understand whether patients with IBD (eg, due to intestinal ACE2 expression) might be particularly susceptible to covid-19 and the cytokine release syndrome associated with lung injury and fatal outcomes. Another highly relevant question is how to deal with immunosuppression and immunomodulation during the current pandemic in patients with IBD and whether immunosuppression affects the progress of covid-19. Here, the current understanding of the pathophysiology of covid-19 is reviewed with special reference to immune cell activation. Moreover, the potential implications of these new insights for immunomodulation and biological therapy in IBD are discussed.","output":"Covid-19 and immunomodulation in IBD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global outbreak of COVID-19 viral infection is associated with the absence of specific drug(s) for fighting this viral infection.

While policy and ethical frameworks are being developed to face these problems, the gender perspective has been largely overlooked in most of the issues at stake. Domestic violence is the most prevalent form of violence against women, which can be exacerbated during a pandemic: stress and economic uncertainty are triggers for abuse, and confinement limits access to support networks. Confinement also exacerbates the unfair distribution of unpaid labor, which is disproportionately assigned to women and girls, and highlights inequality in the overall labor market. Lack of security measures has resulted in attacks towards health workers, particularly female nurses, due to fear of contamination. Finally, resource results in lack of access to other health necessities, including sexual and reproductive health services.

Methods: Three methods were used to assess changes in responses to COVID-19. First, website visits and call centre traffic were compared across two time periods: the comparison period (1 to 28 September 2019), and during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic (19 March to 15 April 2020). Second, demographic and symptom data were compared across all patients who started an assessment during the comparison (n = 1650) and the COVID-19 period (n = 1668). Third, responses to questions about the impact of COVID-19 introduced to the assessment from 19 March 2020, and reports from treating therapists were examined. Results: There was an 89% increase in website visits and a 90% increase in telephone calls to the clinic in the early COVID-19 period compared to the comparison period. There was a higher proportion of females in the COVID-19 sample (76.9% vs. 72.9%), and a lower proportion reported being in employment (52.8% vs. 60.8%). There was a small but significant increase in the severity of anxiety symptoms, and an increase in the number of people reporting recent onset of anxiety and depression. However, there were no differences between groups in severity of symptoms of distress or depression. Most people (94%) reported concern about the impact of COVID-19, and 88% reported making changes in lifestyle. Older adults had higher levels of concern about COVID-19. Therapists reported that patients were concerned about how to access testing, manage quarantine, financial security and the effect of social isolation. Conclusions: COVID-19 has resulted in a significant increase in contact with an established DMHS, but we have not yet detected increases in baseline symptom severity.

Disease outbreaks that sweep through a single region can have massive impacts on food supply, while severe outbreaks of human pathogens can disrupt agricultural labor supply or demand for products perceived as unsafe. Market pressures have generally rewarded production of cash crops for fuel and energy dense, low nutrient processed foods over production of fruits and vegetables for local consumption.

This raised multiple questions regarding a more severe course of COVID-19 in relation to hypertension itself as well as its treatment with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). We provide a critical review on the relationship of hypertension, RAS, and risk of lung injury. We demonstrate lack of sound evidence that hypertension per se is an independent risk factor for COVID-19. Interestingly, ACEIs and ARBs may be associated with lower incidence and/or improved outcome in patients with lower respiratory tract infections. We also review in detail the molecular mechanisms linking the RAS to lung damage and the potential clinical impact of treatment with RAS blockers in patients with COVID-19 and a high cardiovascular and renal risk. This is related to the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, and expression of ACE2 in the lung, cardiovascular system, kidney, and other tissues.

Here a comparative study of the physico-chemical properties and liquid crystalline behavior of CNCs produced from cellulose II (CNC-II) and typical CNC-I is reported. CNC-I and CNC-II are isolated by sulfuric acid hydrolysis of cotton and mercerized cotton, respectively.

Interestingly, the self-assembly behavior of CNC-I and CNC-II in water is different. Whilst CNC-I forms a chiral nematic phase, CNC-II initially phase separates into an upper isotropic and a lower nematic liquid crystalline phase, before a slow reorganization into a large-pitch chiral nematic texture occurs. This is potentially caused by a combination of factors, including the inferred faster rotational diffusion of CNC-II and the different crystal structures of CNC-I and CNC-II, which are responsible for the presence and absence of a giant dipole moment, respectively.","output":"Patience is a virtue: self-assembly and physico-chemical properties of cellulose nanocrystal allomorphs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Circulating nucleic acids, alone and in complex with histones as nucleosomes, have been proposed to link systemic inflammation and coagulation after trauma to acute kidney injury (AKI).

We determined kinetics of plasma mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), nuclear DNA (nDNA), and nucleosome levels across time points and associations with AKI using multivariable linear mixed-effects models, adjusted for injury characteristics and blood transfusions. We evaluated the association of presentation nucleic acid damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) concentrations with subsequent AKI, adjusting for injury severity using multivariable logistic regression.

Currently, there is a lack of data around overall healthcare cost for these patients and their outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality. The objective of the study was to estimate healthcare costs and outcomes associated in tracheostomy patients at a tertiary level hospital in South Australia. Design Retrospective review of prospectively collected data in patients who underwent tracheostomy between July 2009 and May 2015. Methods Overall healthcare-associated costs, length of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit stay, and mortality rates were assessed. Results A total of 454 patients with tracheostomies were examined. Majority of the tracheostomies (n = 386 (85%)) were performed in intensive care unit patients, predominantly using bedside percutaneous approach (85%). The median length of hospital stay was 44 (29-63) days and the in-hospital mortality rate was 20%. Overall total cost of managing a patient with tracheostomy was median $192,184 (inter-quartile range $122560-$295553); mean 225,200 (range $5942-$1046675) Australian dollars. There were no statistically significant differences in any of the measured outcomes, including costs, between patients who underwent percutaneous versus surgical tracheostomy and patients who underwent early versus late tracheostomy in their intensive care unit stay.

However, many uncertainties remain pertaining to optimal intervention time, administration schedule, and predictors of response. To date, data on the use of subcutaneous sarilumab is limited and no randomized trial results are available. METHODS: Open label randomized controlled trial at a single center in Spain. We included adult patients admitted with microbiology documented COVID-19 infection, imaging confirmed pneumonia, fever and/or laboratory evidence of inflammatory phenotype, and no need for invasive ventilation. Participants were randomly assigned to receive sarilumab, a single 400 mg dose in two 200 mg subcutaneous injections, added to standard care or standard care, in a 2:1 proportion. Primary endpoints included 30-day mortality, mean change in clinical status at day 7 scored in a 7-category ordinal scale ranging from death (category 1) to discharge (category 7), and duration of hospitalization. The primary efficacy analysis was conducted on the intention-to-treat population. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients underwent randomization: 20 to sarilumab and 10 to standard care. Most patients were male (20/30, 67%) with a median (interquartile range) age of 61.5 years (56C72). At day 30, 2/20 (10%) patients died in the sarilumab arm vs. none (0/10) in standard care (Log HR 15.11, SE 22.64; p = 0.54). At day 7, no significant differences were observed in the median change in clinical status (2 [0C3]) vs. 3 [0C3], p = 0.32).

No significant differences were detected in the rate of progression to invasive and noninvasive mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our pragmatic pilot study has failed to demonstrate the benefit of adding subcutaneous sarilumab to standard care for mortality by 30 days, functional status at day 7, or hospital stay. Findings herein do not exclude a potential effect of sarilumab in severe COVID-19 but adequately powered blinded randomized phase III trials are warranted to assess the impact of the subcutaneous route and a more selected target population.

PURPOSE The increase in vasopressin price has required many healthcare systems to consider cost-saving strategies. To combat rising medication costs, our institution changed formulations from 50 units/250 mL to 20 units/100 mL and removed vasopressin from automated dispensing cabinets (ADCs). METHODS This retrospective review occurred at a 545-bed academic medical center with 97 adult intensive care unit beds. Adult patients receiving a continuous vasopressin infusion were included with no exclusion criteria. A 1-month period was assessed before and after changing the formulation (pre and post groups, respectively). Duplicate bags compounded by pharmacy and bedside teams were also assessed in the pre group. The primary outcome was the estimated annual cost savings due to formulation change with a secondary outcome of estimated annual cost savings due to removal of vasopressin from ADCs. Each 20-unit vial of vasopressin cost $183.21 (wholesale acquisition cost) at the time of the study. RESULTS In the pre group, 39 patients requiring a vasopressin infusion were allocated an average of 2 bags each costing $1,099.26 per patient. In the post group, 41 patients required an average of 4 bags each costing $732.84 per patient. With respect to the primary outcome, a savings of $366.42 per patient and an average of 40 patients per month would lead to an annual cost savings of $175,881.60. Secondary outcome analysis identified 9 duplicate bags prepared in the pre group; therefore, removal of vasopressin from ADCs is estimated to provide additional cost savings of $59,360.04. The estimated annual cost savings from both initiatives is $235,241.64. CONCLUSION Changing the vasopressin formulation and removing it from ADCs resulted in a significant cost savings to the health system.","output":"Adjusting vasopressin availability and formulation: A cost-savings initiative."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a kind of viral pneumonia with an unusual outbreak in Wuhan, China, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is currently no licensed antiviral treatment available to prevent human CoV infection. The widespread clinical use and existing knowledge on antiviral mechanisms of remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of previous epidemic diseases, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), may be helpful in the combat with novel SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent clinical evidence didn't confirm the beneficial role of lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 patients and their use was reassessed. We provide an overview of the current evidence into the mechanisms of action of these available drugs which are repurposed for treatment of the new virus. Available data identifies remdesivir as an adenosine analogue that can target the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and block viral RNA synthesis. It has been a promising antiviral drug against a wide array of RNA viruses. 3CLpro is a major CoV protease that cleaves the large replicase polyproteins during viral replication and can be targeted by the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir but the clinical effects are controversial. Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine could impair the replication of SARSCoV-2 by multiple mechanisms and their immunomodulatory properties could ameliorate clinical manifestations that are mediated by immune reactions of the host although its beneficial effects are under question and need to be proven at the clinical level. Existing in vitro and in vivo evidence delineate the molecular mechanisms of these drugs in CoV-infected cells. Numerous studies demonstrated the ability of remdesivir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication but future research would be needed to understand the exact mode of action of lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and to use this knowledge in the treatment of the current COVID-19.","output":"Insights into antiviral mechanisms of remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine affecting the new SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Asynchronous telepsychiatry (ATP; delayed-time) consultations are a novel form of psychiatric consultation in primary care settings. Longitudinal studies comparing clinical outcomes for ATP with synchronous telepsychiatry (STP) are lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the effectiveness of ATP in improving clinical outcomes in English- and Spanish-speaking primary care patients compared with STP, the telepsychiatry usual care method. METHODS: Overall, 36 primary care physicians from 3 primary care clinics referred a heterogeneous sample of 401 treatment-seeking adult patients with nonurgent psychiatric disorders. A total of 184 (94 ATP and 90 STP) English- and Spanish-speaking participants (36/184, 19.6% Hispanic) were enrolled and randomized, and 160 (80 ATP and 80 STP) of them completed baseline evaluations. Patients were treated by their primary care physicians using a collaborative care model in consultation with the University of California Davis Health telepsychiatrists, who consulted with patients every 6 months for up to 2 years using ATP or STP. Primary outcomes (the clinician-rated Clinical Global Impressions [CGI] scale and the Global Assessment of Functioning [GAF]) and secondary outcomes (patients self-reported physical and mental health and depression) outcomes were assessed every 6 months. RESULTS: For clinician-rated primary outcomes, ATP did not promote greater improvement than STP at 6-month follow-up (ATP vs STP, adjusted difference in follow-up at 6 months vs baseline differences for CGI: 0.2, 95% CI ?0.2 to 0.6; P=.28; and GAF: ?0.6, 95% CI ?3.1 to 1.9; P=.66) or 12-month follow-up (ATP vs STP, adjusted difference in follow-up at 12 months vs baseline differences for CGI: 0.4, 95% CI ?0.04 to 0.8; P=.07; and GAF: ?0.5, 95% CI ?3.3 to 2.2; P=.70), but patients in both arms had statistically and clinically significant improvements in both outcomes. There were no significant differences in improvement from baseline between ATP and STP on any patient self-reported ratings at any follow-up (all P values were between .17 and .96). Dropout rates were higher than predicted but similar between the 2 arms. Of those with baseline visits, 46.8% (75/160) did not have a follow-up at 1 year, and 72.7% (107/147) did not have a follow-up at 2 years. No serious adverse events were associated with the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first longitudinal study to demonstrate that ATP can improve clinical outcomes in English- and Spanish-speaking primary care patients. Although we did not find evidence that ATP is superior to STP in improving clinical outcomes, it is potentially a key part of stepped mental health interventions available in primary care. ATP presents a possible solution to the workforce shortage of psychiatrists and a strategy for improving existing systems of care.

This study focuses on the short-term forecasting, 15 min ahead, of the shared bikes demand in Montreal using a deep learning approach. Having a set of bike trips, the study first identifies 6 communities in the bike-sharing network using the Louvain algorithm. Then, four groups of LSTM-based architectures are adopted to predict pickup demand in each community. A univariate ARIMA model is also used to compare results as a benchmark. The historical trip data from 2017 to 2021 are used in addition to the extra inputs of demand related engineered features, weather conditions, and temporal variables. The selected timespan allows predicting bike demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that the deep learning models significantly outperform the ARIMA one. The hybrid CNN-LSTM achieves the highest prediction accuracy. Furthermore, adding the extra variables improves the model performance regardless of its architecture.

The aim of this review is to highlight the importance of the role of NK cells in the management of Ph+ Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, and emphasize the need and possible benefits of a more in-depth investigation into their role in classical MPNs and show potential strategies to harness the anti-tumoral capacities of NK cells. ABSTRACT: Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) comprise a heterogenous group of hematologic neoplasms which are divided into Philadelphia positive (Ph+), and Philadelphia negative (Ph?) or classical MPNs. A variety of immunological factors including inflammatory, as well as immunomodulatory processes, closely interact with the disease phenotypes in MPNs. NK cells are important innate immune effectors and substantially contribute to tumor control. Changes to the absolute and proportionate numbers of NK cell, as well as phenotypical and functional alterations are seen in MPNs. In addition to the disease itself, a variety of therapeutic options in MPNs may modify NK cell characteristics. Reports of suppressive effects of MPN treatment strategies on NK cell activity have led to intensive investigations into the respective compounds, to elucidate the possible negative effects of MPN therapy on control of the leukemic clones. We hereby review the available literature on NK cells in Ph+ and Ph? MPNs and summarize todays knowledge on disease-related alterations in this cell compartment with particular focus on known therapy-associated changes. Furthermore, we critically evaluate conflicting data with possible implications for future projects.

Herein we provide an overview of lipids and lipid metabolism in relation to COVID-19, with special attention on different forms of cholesterol. Cholesterol enriched lipid rafts represent a platform for viruses to enter the host cell by endocytosis. Generally, higher membrane cholesterol coincides with higher efficiency of COVID-19 entry. Inversely, patients with COVID-19 show lowered levels of blood cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and low-density lipoproteins. The modulated efficiency of viral entry can be explained by availability of SR-B1 receptor. HDL seems to have a variety of roles, from being itself a scavenger for viruses, an immune modulator and mediator of viral entry. Due to inverse roles of membrane cholesterol and lipoprotein cholesterol in COVID-19 infected patients, treatment of these patients with cholesterol lowering statins needs more attention.

Despite these challenges, AHSs played an invaluable role in responding to the pandemic. Clinicians worked tirelessly to care for patients, and institutions quickly reoriented their care delivery systems. Furthermore, AHSs played an important role in advancing science, launching studies and clinical trials to examine new vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. However, there is room for improvement; AHSs can use lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic to reshape their operations for the future. To prepare for the next pandemic, AHSs must modernize, adapt, and transform their clinical operations, research infrastructure, and education programs to include public health and to build surveillance capacity for detecting, monitoring, and managing emerging outbreaks. In this commentary, the authors describe the opportunities AHSs have to build on their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and the ways they can take advantage of their unique strengths in each of their 3 mission areas. Within clinical care, AHSs can reach patients outside traditional clinical settings, build national and regional networks, advance data-driven insights, engage with the community, and support and protect the workforce. Within research, they can leverage data science and artificial intelligence, perform pandemic forecasting, leverage the social and behavioral sciences, conduct clinical trials, and build a research and development preparedness and operational plan.

Knowledge of antibody seropositivity and its duration may help dictate post-pandemic planning. METHODS: Using assays to detect antibodies to either nucleocapsid (N) or spike (S) proteins performed on specimens from 39,086 individuals with confirmed positive COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from March 2020 to January 2021, we analyzed nationwide seropositivity rates of IgG up to 300 days following patients initial positive NAAT test. Linear regression identified trends in seropositivity rates and logistic regression tested positive predictability by age, sex, assay type and days post-infection. FINDINGS: Seropositivity of IgG antibodies to both SARS-CoV-2 S and N-proteins followed a linear trend reaching approximately 90% positivity at 21 days post-index. The rate of N-protein seropositivity declined at a sharper rate, decaying to 682% [95% CI: 631C708%] after 293 days, while S-antibody seropositivity maintained a rate of 878% [95% CI: 863C891%] through 300 days. In addition to antigen type and the number of days post-positive PCR, age and gender were also significant factors in seropositivity prediction, with those under 65 years of age showing a more sustained seropositivity rate.

Services implemented telehealth to cater for patients requiring musculoskeletal care. A service evaluation was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of a mixed telehealth/FTF approach and identify if stratifying patients could help tailor intervention. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data collected from patients who were assessed by Musculoskeletal Physiotherapists in one Scottish health board was undertaken. Patients were divided into low, medium and high risk sub-groups through the Keele STarT MSK tool. Outcome measures for pain and musculoskeletal health were taken at baseline/discharge along with satisfaction/preference. Descriptive and Inferential statistical analysis was conducted to establish whether changes in the outcome measures within and between risk sub-groups were statistically significant. RESULTS: Pain level difference from baseline to discharge demonstrated clinically and statistically significant improvements across all risk groups (N = 89). Musculoskeletal health demonstrated clinically significant improvements across all risk groups and statistically significant improvements in the medium/high risk groups but not the low risk. Patients with knee osteoarthritis and low back pain in the medium risk group had fewest appointments while patients with chronic shoulder pain had the most. The majority of patients were satisfied with all mediums but preferred FTF or an option between telehealth/FTF in the future. CONCLUSION: Telehealth is a promising model of care when utilised in combination with FTF for patients with musculoskeletal conditions.

A group of specialist dietitians, medical practitioners was convened, supported by the British Dietetic Association and Diabetes UK, to discuss dietary approaches to T2DM, and undertook a review of the available clinical trial and practice audit data regarding dietary approaches to remission of T2DM. Current available evidence suggests a range of dietary approaches, including low energy diets (mostly using TDR) and low carbohydrate diets, can be used to support the achievement of euglycaemia and potentially remission. The most significant predictor of remission is weight loss, and although euglycaemia may occur on a low carbohydrate diet without weight loss, which does not meet some definitions of remission, but may rather constitute a 'state of mitigation' of T2DM. This technical point may not be considered important for people living with T2DM, aside from that it may only last as long as the carbohydrate restriction is maintained.

There were four exams each for the first-, second-, and third-year students. Eight exams were conducted as PBEs, and four were administered as WBEs. We compared the mean scores of PBEs and WBEs between exams and batches. Additionally, we compared the PBE and WBE scores obtained by 10 high-performance and 10 lowest-achieving students. RESULTS: Variations were found in the scores of students from each of the three batches in PBEs or WBEs. In a few instances, the difference was statistically significant. No specific trend or pattern was detected in the difference between the scores of PBEs and WBEs. The mean score for the WBEs was intermediate among the means of PBEs for the first- and second-year students, but lower for the third-year students. Individual students marks in different exams consistently showed a positive correlation. The correlation was always high for PBEs (r = 0.782, 0.847).

The present systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to quantify the safety and tolerability of remdesivir, based on safety outcome findings from randomized controlled trials, observational studies and case reports of remdesivir in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: We have performed a systematic search in the PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library using specific keywords such as COVID-19 OR SARS CoV-2 AND Remdesivir. The study endpoints include total adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), grade 3 and grade 4 AEs, mortality and drug tolerability. Statistical analysis was carried out by using Revman 5.4 software. RESULTS: Total 15 studies were included for systematic review, but only 5 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (n = 13,622) were included for meta-analysis. Visual inspection of the forest plots for remdesivir 10-day versus placebo and remdesivir 10-day versus 5-day groups revealed that there is a significant difference in SAEs [10-day remdesivir versus control (odds ratio [OR] = 0.55, 0.40C0.74) p = 0.0001; I(2) = 0%; 10-day remdesivir versus 5-day remdesivir (OR = 0.56, 0.38C0.84) p = 0.005; I(2) = 13%].

DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION: Ten-day remdesivir was a safe antiviral agent but not tolerable over control in the hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a need of administration cautiousness for grade 3 AEs. There was no added benefit of 10- or 5-day remdesivir in reducing mortality over placebo. To avoid SAEs, we suggest for prior monitoring of liver function tests (LFT), renal function tests (RFT), complete blood count (CBC) and serum electrolytes for those with preexisting hepatic and renal impairments and patients receiving concomitant hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. Furthermore, a number of RCTs of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients are suggested. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Ten-day remdesivir is a safe antiviral drug with common adverse events in comparison to placebo. The rate of serious adverse events and grade 3 adverse events were significantly lower in 10-day remdesivir in comparison to placebo/5-day remdesivir. There was no significant difference in the rate of tolerability and mortality reduction in 10-day remdesivir over placebo/5-day remdesivir.

Therefore, this study aims to determine the best predictive models and investigate the impact of lockdown policy on the USA COVID-19 incidence and mortality. This study focuses on the statistical modelling of the USA daily COVID-19 incidence and mortality cases based on some intuitive properties of the data such as overdispersion and autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity. The impact of the lockdown policy on cases and mortality was assessed by comparing the USA incidence case with that of Sweden where there is no strict lockdown. Stochastic models based on negative binomial autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity [NB INGARCH (p,q)], the negative binomial regression, the autoregressive integrated moving average model with exogenous variables (ARIMAX) and without exogenous variables (ARIMA) models of several orders are presented, to identify the best fitting model for the USA daily incidence cases. The performance of the optimal NB INGARCH model on daily incidence cases was compared with the optimal ARIMA model in terms of their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). Also, the NB model, ARIMA model and without exogenous variables are formulated for USA daily COVID-19 death cases. It was observed that the incidence and mortality cases show statistically significant increasing trends over the study period. The USA daily COVID-19 incidence is autocorrelated, linear and contains a structural break but exhibits autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity. Observed data are compared with the fitted data from the optimal models. The results further indicate that the NB INGARCH fits the observed incidence better than ARIMA while the NB models perform better than the optimal ARIMA and ARIMAX models for death counts in terms of AIC and root mean square error (RMSE). The results show a statistically significant relationship between the lockdown policy in the USA and incidence and death counts. This suggests the efficacy of the lockdown policy in the USA.","output":"Comparison of Predictive Models and Impact Assessment of Lockdown for COVID-19 over the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Standard dose synacthen stimulation test (SDSST) is a gold standard screening test for evaluating adrenal gland function. Despite studies using SDSST to identify heterozygosity in CYP21A2, the reliability of the test for this purpose is still controversial. Therefore, the meta-analyses were performed to determine the differences in 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) responses to standard dose (0.25 mg) SDSST in the diagnosis of CYP21A2 heterozygous individuals, with or without clinical signs of androgen excess disorders. METHODS: PubMed and MEDLINE databases were searched. A total of 1215 subjects (heterozygous carriers n=669, mutation-free controls n=546) were included in the meta-analyses. RESULTS: Basal 17-OHP median/mean levels were 4.156 (3.05-10.5)/5.241 (2.59) nmol/L and 3.90 (2.20-9.74)/4.67 (2.62) nmol/L in symptomatic heterozygous carriers and symptomatic mutation-free controls, respectively. Stimulated 17-OHP median/mean levels were 17.29 (14.22-37.2)/19.51 (7.63) nmol/L and 9.27 (7.32-15.9)/10.77 (3.48) nmol/L in symptomatic heterozygous carriers and symptomatic mutation-free controls, respectively. Basal 17-OHP median/mean levels were 3.21 (2.64-4.78)/3.33 (0.84) nmol/L and 3.12 (1.82-3.6)/2.83 (0.71) nmol/L in asymptomatic heterozygous carriers and asymptomatic mutation-free healthy controls, respectively. Stimulated 17-OHP median/mean levels were 14.16 (12.73-16.37)/14.16 (1.37) nmol/L and 6.26 (4.9-8.23)/6.48 (1.2) nmol/L in asymptomatic heterozygous carriers and asymptomatic mutation-free healthy controls, respectively. The cut-off levels for stimulated 17-OHP were 10.48 nmol/L and 13.48 nmol/L for asymptomatic heterozygous and symptomatic heterozygous, respectively. CONCLUSION: The meta-analyses support the idea that stimulated 17-OHP level has potential for use in identifying CYP21A2 carriers. Besides, considering differences in the basal and stimulated 17-OHP levels in symptomatic heterozygous individuals compared to those who were asymptomatic heterozygous could increase the accuracy of the test.","output":"17-Hydroxyprogesterone Response to Standard Dose Synacthen Stimulation Test in CYP21A2 Heterozygous Carriers and Non-carriers in Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Groups: Meta-analyses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed a major challenge for protecting health care workers (HCWs) against the infection. Use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in health care workplace is recommended as a high priority. In order to investigate the relationship between PPE use and the number of COVID-19 cases among HCWs, we conducted a molecular epidemiological study among 142 HCWs who were dispatched from Hefei to work in Wuhan and 284 HCWs who remained in Hefei, China; both provided care for patients with COVID-19. Nucleic acid testing and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody (IgM, IgG, IgA) detection were performed to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection among those HCWs. We also extracted publicly released data on daily number of COVID-19 cases among HCWs, daily number of HCWs who were dispatched to Hubei province since January 24, and daily production of PPE in China and daily demand and supply of PPE in Hubei province. Our laboratory testing confirmed that none of the 142 HCWs who were dispatched to work in Wuhan and 284 HCWs who remained in Hefei were infected by SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with these findings, as of April 15, 2020, none of the 42,600 HCWs who were successively dispatched to Hubei province since January 24, 2020 was reported to have COVID-19. These HCWs were provided with adequate supply of PPE as committed by their original institutions or provinces. In contrast, during the early phase of COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei province, a substantial shortage of PPE and an increasing number of COVID-19 infection among HCWs were reported. With the continuing increase in domestic production of PPE in China, the PPE supply started to meet and then exceed the demand. This coincided with a subsequent reduction in the number of reported COVID-19 cases among HCWs. In conclusion, our findings indicate that COVID-19 infection among HCWs could be completely prevented. Appropriate and adequate PPE might play a crucial role in protecting HCWs against COVID-19 infection.","output":"Association of Personal Protective Equipment Use with Successful Protection Against

People's Republic of China (Dec 31, 2019 to Mar 5, 2020) and World Health Organization (Jan 20, 2020 to Mar 5, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the IFP of new cases in Hubei and non-Hubei on subsequent days and the data from Mar 6 to Mar 9 as validation set New close contacts, newly confirmed cases, cumulative confirmed cases, non-severe cases, severe cases, critical cases, cured cases, and death data were collected and analyzed Using this state transition matrix model, the horizon of the IFP of time (the rate of new increment reaches zero) could be predicted in South Korean, Italy, and Iran Also, through this model, the global trend of the epidemic will be decoded to allocate international medical resources better and instruct the strategy for quarantine Results: the optimistic scenario (non-Hubei model, daily increment rate of -3 87%), the relative pessimistic scenario (Hubei model, daily increment rate of -2 20%), and the relatively pessimistic scenario (adjustment, daily increment rate of -1 50%) were inferred and modeling from data in China Matching and fitting with these scenarios, the IFP of time in South Korea would be Mar 6-Mar 12, Italy Mar 10-Mar 24, and Iran is Mar 10-Mar 24 The numbers of cumulative confirmed patients will reach approximately 20k in South Korea, 209k in Italy, and 226k in Iran under fitting scenarios, respectively There should be room for improvement if these metrics continue to improve In that case, the IFP will arrive earlier than our estimation However, with the adoption of different diagnosis criteria, the variation of new cases could impose various influences in the predictive model If that happens, the IFP of increment will be higher than predicted above Conclusion: We can affirm that the end of the burst of the epidemic is still inapproachable, and the number of confirmed cases is still escalating With the augment of data, the world epidemic trend could be further predicted, and it is imperative

However, numerous technologies, including gold standard ELISA and PCR, can detect only one type of biomarker, either protein or nucleic acid (NA), respectively. In this work, we report for the first time simultaneous detection of proteins and NAs in the same solution, using solely functional NA (FNA) molecules. In particular, we combined the thrombin binding aptamer (TBA) and the 10-23 RNA-cleaving DNA enzyme (DNAzyme) in a single aptazyme molecule (Aptazyme(1.15-3)), followed by extensive optimization of buffer composition, sequences and component ratios, to establish a competitive bioassay. Subsequently, to establish a multiplex bioassay, we designed a new aptazyme (Aptazyme(2.20-5)) by replacing the target recognition and substrate sequences within Aptazyme(1.15-3). This designing process included an in silico study, revealing the impact of the target recognition sequence on the aptazyme secondary structure and its catalytic activity. After proving the functionality of the new aptazyme in a singleplex bioassay, we demonstrated the capability of the two aptazymes to simultaneously detect thrombin and NA target, or two NA targets in a multiplex bioassay. High specificity in target detection was achieved with the limits of detection in the low nanomolar range, comparable to the singleplex bioassays. The presented results deepen the barely explored features of FNA for diagnosing multiple targets of different origins, adding an extra functionality to their catalogue.

The therapeutic potential of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) is likely mediated by antibodies through direct viral neutralization and Fc-dependent functions such as a phagocytosis, complement activation, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In the United States, CCP became one of the most common treatments with over half million units transfused despite limited efficacy data. More than a dozen randomized trials now demonstrate that CCP does notprovide benefit for those with moderate to severe disease. However, similar to other passive antibody therapies, CCP is beneficial for early disease, when provided to elderly outpatients within 72 hours after symptom onset. Only high-titer CCP should be transfused. CCP should also be considered for immunosuppressed COVID-19 patients.CCP collected in proximity, by time and location, to the patient may be more beneficial due to SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Utilizing the YSD technique, antigens specific to the target antibody are displayed on the surface of engineered yeast cells with intracellular fluorescent proteins. The displayed antigens are then used for the detection of the target antibody, with the yeast cells as fluorescent labels. Multiplex immunoassay can be readily realized by using yeast cells expressing different intracellular fluorescent proteins to display different antigens. The implementation of this YSD-based immunoassay on the microfluidic platform eliminates the need for the bulky, complex and expensive flow cytometer. To improve the detection sensitivity and to eliminate the need for pumping, a functionalized micro pillar array (MPA) is incorporated in the microfluidic chip, resulting in a detection limit of 5 ng/mL (or 1 ng in terms of amount) and enhanced compatibility with practical applications such as clinical biopsy.

OBJECTIVE: Data-driven strategies that identify and prioritize the publics needs may engender a public health response to improve policing. We assessed how internet searches indicative of interest in police reform changed after Mr Floyds death. METHODS: We monitored daily Google searches (per 10 million total searches) that included the terms police and reform(s) (eg, reform the police, best police reforms, etc) originating from the United States between January 1, 2010, through July 5, 2020. We also monitored searches containing the term police with training, union(s), militarization, or immunity as markers of interest in the corresponding reform topics. RESULTS: The 41 days following Mr Floyds death corresponded with the greatest number of police reform(s) searches ever recorded, with 1,350,000 total searches nationally. Searches increased significantly in all 50 states and Washington DC. By reform topic, nationally there were 1,220,000 total searches for police and union(s); 820,000 for training; 360,000 for immunity; and 72,000 for militarization. In terms of searches for all policy topics by state, 33 states searched the most for training, 16 for union(s), and 2 for immunity. States typically in the southeast had fewer queries related to any police reform topic than other states. States that had a greater percentage of votes for President Donald Trump during the 2016 election searched more often for police union(s) while states favoring Secretary Hillary Clinton searched more for police training. CONCLUSIONS: The United States is at a historical juncture, with record interest in topics related to police reform with variability in search terms across states. Policy makers can respond to searches by considering the policies their constituencies are searching for online, notably police training and unions. Public health leaders can respond by engaging in the subject of policing and advocating for evidence-based policy reforms.","output":"Quantifying Public Interest in Police Reforms by Mining Internet Search Data Following George Floyds Death"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine if AYA oncology patients experienced a quantifiable improvement in psychosocial outcomes after attending a weekend retreat with their peers.

Controls were age-matched oncology patients who did not attend the retreat. FINDINGS: Retreat participants' scores did not significantly change over time; however, retreat participants' scores at 1-month follow-up were significantly higher than control group scores.

The relation between old age, lockdown, and social isolation, with respect to global ideas and rhetoric, focuses on vulnerability, individual autonomy, and caregiving fatigue. I examine how the representation of the 'burden' of caregiving in late age shaped the media depictions, and I analyze it in relation to the meanings of fatigue attached to narrations from family caregivers and the members of a local Alzheimer's Cafe. I also focus on the life story of one family caregiver to critique the idealized vision of family care that was reproduced during the pandemic. I argue that the recognition of aging and caregiving fatigue during the lockdown reflected pre-existing normative models and structural inequalities of family care rather than radically altering them.","output":"Recognizing Caregiving Fatigue in the Pandemic: Notes on Aging, Burden and Social Isolation in Emilia-Romagna, Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective to analyze sociodemographic variables associated with insufficient physical activity level in Bahian quilombolas.

In membranes of ventricular cultures, blocking of the A1-adenosine receptor pathway by the A1-selective antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) or by pertussis toxin treatment of the myocyte resulted in a significant adenosine agonist-mediated stimulation of the adenylate cyclase activity. The maximal increases in adenylate cyclase activity caused by the equipotent or the A2-adenosine receptor-selective agonists (from 52.1 +/- 3% to 63 +/- 10% [mean +/- SEM]) were significantly greater than those caused by the A1-selective agonists (from 11 +/- 5% to 34.6 +/- 7%) (p less than 0.01, by t test, n = 4-8). However, in membranes of atrial myocytes, when A1-subtype had been blocked, the various adenosine agonists had no effect on the adenylate cyclase activity. Whether the stimulatory adenylate cyclase-coupled adenosine receptor is also capable of stimulating contractility in the intact ventricular myocyte was next investigated. In ventricular but not in atrial cells, the various adenosine agonists caused an increase in the contractile amplitude in the presence of DPCPX or in myocytes preexposed to pertussis toxin. The increase in contraction amplitude caused by each agonist was expressed as percent of maximum (maximum is the increase in contractility caused by 2.4 mM calcium). In the pertussis toxin-treated myocyte, the maximal increases caused by the equipotent or A2-agonists (NECA, MECA, CV-1808, and CGS21680, from 49.6 +/- 3% to 52.5 +/- 6%, n = 8-12) were significantly greater than those elicited by the A1-agonists (2-CADO, S-PIA, R-PIA, and DCCA, from 12 +/- 4% to 37 +/- 3%, n = 8) (p less than 0.05, by t test). These data demonstrated that a stimulatory adenosine receptor, likely the A2-adenosine receptor, was present on the ventricular but not the atrial myocytes and was linked directly to a stimulation of the cardiac contractility. The functional effects mediated by the A1-subtype became manifested in the presence of isoproterenol, as evidence by an inhibition of the isoproterenol-stimulated increases in adenylate cyclase activity and in cardiac contractility by adenosine agonists. Thus, both subtypes of adenosine receptors, each mediating opposing responses, were present on the ventricular myocytes, whereas only the A1-subtype was found in the atria. The presence of a stimulatory functional A2-adenosine receptor may help explain the absence of a direct negative inotropic response to adenosine in the ventricle.","output":"Expression and pharmacological characterization of a stimulatory subtype of adenosine receptor in fetal chick ventricular myocytes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chest X-ray images permit the medical diagnosis of multiple pulmonary pathologies, including COVID-19.

DESIGN Modified Delphi method involving international experts and key individuals in subgroup work and electronic-based discussion among the entire group to achieve consensus. METHODS We used the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines as a framework to inform the structure and content of these guidelines. We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to rate the quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations, with grade 1 indicating clear benefit in the septic population and grade 2 indicating less confidence in the benefits in the septic population. In areas without complete agreement between all authors, a process of electronic discussion of all evidence was undertaken until consensus was reached. This process was conducted independently of any funding. RESULTS Sixty-three recommendations relating to the nursing care of severe sepsis patients are made. Prevention recommendations relate to education, accountability, surveillance of nosocomial infections, hand hygiene, and prevention of respiratory, central line-related, surgical site, and urinary tract infections, whereas infection management recommendations related to both control of the infection source and transmission-based precautions. Recommendations related to initial resuscitation include improved recognition of the deteriorating patient, diagnosis of severe sepsis, seeking further assistance, and initiating early resuscitation measures. Important elements of hemodynamic support relate to improving both tissue oxygenation and macrocirculation. Recommendations related to supportive nursing care incorporate aspects of nutrition, mouth and eye care, and pressure ulcer prevention and management. Pediatric recommendations relate to the use of antibiotics, steroids, vasopressors and inotropes, fluid resuscitation, sedation and analgesia, and the role of therapeutic end points. CONCLUSION Consensus was reached regarding many aspects of nursing care of the severe sepsis patient.

(1,2) Also, grief is encountered frequently in clinical practice with the elderly, and can be defined as the natural response to the death of a loved one. Still, when a failure of adaptation occurs then a Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) can be diagnosed, which has been recently included in ICD-11. The principal feature of PGD is a persistent preoccupation or an intense longing for the deceased that lasts longer than 6 months after the death. (3)Objective:Comprehend the grief in the elderly and its implications in their health.Methods:The author conducted a literature review by searching the Pubmed database using the keywords elderly;grief;complicated grief;covid-19Results:PGD is relatively prevalent among the elderly and has been associated with some variables related to the death time of the deceased, being the prevalence inversely correlated with the deceaseds. (4, 5) Additionally, older adults present a higher risk of developing PGD when they are lesseducated, male, have poorer cognitive performance, and a history of depression. (3) PGD is characterized by sadness, fascination with or excessive avoidance of the memories associated with the deceased, the memory of the loss and mental ruminations about death. According to some investigations, PGD reduces life expectancy, increasing the odds of death, causes severe behavioural symptoms, and is associated with longer-term functional impairment. (4,5)Conclusion:Given these results, it is easy to understand the need for a closer monitoring of these patients during this global crisis. Moreover, it is also important to find new ways to do that while complying with COVID-19 rules and restrictions. A short-term evidence-based intervention for PGD effective in the elderly is based on support focused upon these seven themes: understanding their grief, managing emotional pain, thinkingabout the future, strengthening their relationships, telling the story of the dead, learning to live with reminders of the deceased, and connecting with memories.

When stakeholders offer divergent input, it can be unclear how to prioritize information for decision aids (DAs) on mammography screening. Objectives. This analysis triangulates perspectives (breast cancer screening experts, primary care providers [PCPs], and patients with limited health literacy [LHL]) to understand areas of divergent and convergent input across stakeholder groups in developing a breast cancer screening DA for younger women with LHL. Design. A modified online Delphi panel of 8 experts rated 57 statements for inclusion in a breast cancer screening DA over three rounds. Individual interviews with 25 patients with LHL and 20 PCPs from a large safety net hospital explored informational needs about mammography decision making. Codes from the qualitative interviews and open-ended responses from the Delphi process were mapped across stakeholders to ascertain areas where stakeholder preferences converged or diverged. Results. Four themes regarding informational needs were identified regarding 1) the benefits and harms of screening, 2) different screening modalities, 3) the experience of mammography, and 4) communication about breast cancer risk. Patients viewed pain as the primary harm, while PCPs and experts emphasized the harm of false positives. Patients, but not PCPs or experts, felt that information about the process of getting a mammogram was important. PCPs believed that mammography was the only evidence-based screening modality, while patients believed breast self-exam was also important for screening. All stakeholders described incorporating personal risk information as important. Limitations. As participants came from one hospital, perceptions may reflect local practices.

As many Americans stayed home midyear, environmental groups noted the decrease in driving and transportation-related pollution, theorizing that the pandemic could have a positive impact on the environment by decreasing individuals' carbon emissions. However, it is dubious that individuals will behave in a more eco-friendly manner under the uncertain and stressful conditions of a global pandemic simply because they are more likely to be confined to their homes. We examined sustainability behaviors in 2018 and in the early pandemic in 2020 among a sample of members of a U.S., botanical garden. We surveyed members in MayCJuly 2018, asking whether they had or had not done 11 sustainability behaviors (e.g., used alternative transportation, took shorter showers) in the past month. We resurveyed members about their engagement in those behaviors in April 2020 as well as to recall their engagement in those behaviors pre-pandemic in February 2020. We examined differences in self-reported behaviors among respondents who had taken both the MayCJuly 2018 and April 2020 surveys (matched group n = 227), and then among respondents who had taken either the MayCJuly (n = 1057) or the April 2020 survey (n = 881), but not both. Respondents in the matched group were more likely to report recycling, reducing red meat consumption, eating a plant-based diet, and reducing food waste in April 2020 compared to MayCJuly 2018;they were less likely to compost, check the air in their tires, and use a smart thermostat. However, these differences also emerged when examining recalled behavior in February 2020, suggesting that matched group respondents' self-reports may reflect changes in behavior over time rather than due to the pandemic. The unmatched group was more likely to reduce food waste but less likely to use alternative transportation to commute, check the air in their tires for fuel efficiency, and recycle in April 2020 compared to MayCJuly 2018. Thus, few changes in sustainability behaviors can be attributed to the pandemic, but those that do involve personal travel or home confinement.

This open and universal access to information is a key value of democratic societies because, in principle, it supports well-informed decision-making on individual, local, and global matters. In practice, however, without appropriate readiness for navigation in a dynamic information landscape, such access to information can become a threat to public health, safety, and economy, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown. In the past, this readiness was often conceptualized in terms of adequate literacy levels, but the contemporarily observed highest-ever literacy levels have not immunized our societies against the risks of misinformation. Therefore, in this Perspective, we argue that democratization of access to information endows citizens with new responsibilities, and second, these responsibilities demand readiness that cannot be reduced to mere literacy levels. In fact, this readiness builds on individual adequate literacy skills, but also requires rational thinking and awareness of own information processing.

With huge amounts of content being posted to social media every second during these situations, it becomes very difficult to detect fake news (rumors) that poses threats to the stability and sustainability of the healthcare sector. A rumor is defined as a statement for which truthfulness has not been verified. During COVID 19, people found difficulty in obtaining the most truthful news easily because of the huge amount of unverified information on social media. Several methods have been applied for detecting rumors and tracking their sources for COVID 19-related information. However, very few studies have been conducted for this purpose for the Arabic language, which has unique characteristics. Therefore, this paper proposes a comprehensive approach which includes two phases: detection and tracking. In the detection phase of the study carried out, several standalone and ensemble machine learning methods were applied on the Arcov-19 dataset. A new detection model was used which combined two models: The Genetic Algorithm Based Support Vector Machine (that works on users' and tweets' features) and the stacking ensemble method (that works on tweets' texts). In the tracking phase, several similarity-based techniques were used to obtain the top 1% of similar tweets to a target tweet/post, which helped to find the source of the rumors. The experiments showed interesting results in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score for rumor detection (the accuracy reached 92.63%), and showed interesting findings in the tracking phase, in terms of ROUGE L precision, recall and F1-Score for similarity techniques. ? 2021 Tech Science Press.

Most studies have focused on the analysis of the humoral response, which means that the information available on the cellular response against SARS-CoV-2 in these patients is limited. Current recommendations include vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSTC), regardless of whether they have been previously exposed to the virus. These recommendations are based on previous studies with other vaccines. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the immune response that is developed in these patients in order to make specific recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination. Objective: To study the humoral and cellular immune response before and after AHSTC in patients with oncohematological neoplasms who were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 before the transplantation. Materials & methods: Nine patients with previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 who underwent AHSTC (Table 1) and 8 healthy donors who recovered from mild COVID-19 were recruited from Hospital Ramn y Cajal and Primary Healthcare Center Pedro Lan Entralgo (Madrid, Spain), respectively. Specific direct cellular cytotoxicity (DCC) of PBMCs from these patients against Vero E6 cells infected with pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 was determined. The activation of caspase-3 in Vero cells was measured after 1 hour of co-culture with PBMCs, in which cytotoxic cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometry. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) was analyzed by quantifying the binding of Annexin V to rituximab-coated Raji cells as targets of PBMCs. Results: 1) 66% of AHSTC patients did not develop detectable levels of IgGs against SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1). In 33% of these patients with detectable IgG, the titers decreased after AHSTC, as well as their neutralizing capacity (Fig. 1B and C). 2) AHSTC patients showed increased levels of immature B cells (9.5-fold;p=0.0586) and plasmablasts (28.8-fold), in comparison with healthy donors who had mild COVID-19, while naive and resting memory B cells decreased 1.7- and 6.9-fold, respectively. 3) Specific DCC against SARS-CoV-2-infected cells increased 1.5-fold in comparison with healthy donors (Fig. 2A). Cytotoxic populations with NK phenotypes (CD3-CD56+CD16+), NKT (CD3+CD56+CD16+), and CD8+ T cells (CD3+CD8+TCRæ+) increased 1.9- (p=0.0311), 1.9- (p=0.0592), and 1.6-fold, respectively (Fig. 2B). ADCC increased 2.1-fold in PBMCs from AHSTC patients in comparison with healthy donors (p = 0.0592). Conclusions: Our data show for the first time how the humoral and cellular immune response against the natural infection by SARS-Cov-2 may be modified in patients who were subsequently subjected to AHSTC. Although the humoral response may be reduced after AHSTC, the specific cellular response showed an increased cytotoxic activity. These results could be extrapolated to patients who were vaccinated against COVID-19 prior to AHSTC. Therefore, this information could be useful to define the recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination after AHSTC.

However, cognitive frailty, a new definition defined by an international consensus group, has been shown to be a better predictor of increased disability, mortality, and other adverse health outcomes among older people than just frailty or cognitive impairment. This study estimated the prospective association between social support and subsequent cognitive frailty over 1 year follow-up, and whether psychological distress mediated the association. METHODS: The data was drawn from a prospective repeated-measures cohort study on a sample of participants aged 60 and over. A total of 2785 older people who participated in both of the baseline and 1-year follow-up survey were included for the analysis. Cognitive frailty was measured by the coexistence of physical frailty and cognitive impairment without dementia. Control variables included sex, age, education, marital status, economic status, smoking status, alcohol drinking status, chronic conditions, and functional disability. Path analyses with logistic function were performed to examine the direct effects of social support (predictors) on subsequent cognitive frailty (outcome) at 1-year follow-up and the mediating role of psychological distress (mediator) in this link. RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates and prior cognitive frailty status, social support was negatively associated with psychological distress ( = ? 0.098, 95% CI = ? 0.137 to ? 0.066, P < 0.001) and was negatively associated with the log-odds of cognitive frailty ( = ? 0.040, 95% CI = ? 0.064 to ? 0.016, P < 0.001).

Recent studies have looked into such an impact on various industries such as retail and agriculture. The current study aims at applying a sociological framework, sociology of worth (SOW), to the gaming industry in Macau, the largest operator of state-allowed gambling and entertainment in China, which will allow for its development during the COVID-19 pandemic to be charted. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses the theory of SOW as a framework and collects data from various sources, such as the government, gaming operators and the public, to create timelines and SOW frameworks to analyze the impact of the virus on the gaming industry and the society as a whole. Findings: Detailed content analysis and the creation of different SOW matrices determined that the notion of a lonely economy during a time of a critical event may be ameliorated in the long term through compromises of the different worlds and actors of the SOW. Practical implications: Though largely theory-based, this study offers a thorough account of the COVID-19 incident for both the government and the gaming industry to reflect on and to consider new ways to fight against degrowth caused by disasters or crises. Social implications: The SOW framework divides society into different worlds of different worths. The current study shows how the worths of the different worlds are congruent during normal periods, and how cracks appear between them when a sudden crisis, such as COVID-19, occurs. The article serves as a social account of how these cracks are formed and how could they be resolved through compromise and reconstruction. Originality/value: This study is a first attempt to apply SOW to a controversial industry (gaming) while the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are ongoing. It offers a significant contribution to the social accounting literature through its consideration of the combination of unprecedented factors in a well-timed study that pays close attention to analyses and theoretical elaboration. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Accounting for gaming in the time of plague: COVID-19 in Macau"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel strain of coronavirus, which is the cause of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, ravaging many countries of the world.

In a previous study, we established an hDPP4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mouse model in which MERS-CoV infection causes severe acute respiratory failure and high mortality accompanied by an elevated secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Since excessive complement activation is an important factor that contributes to acute lung injury after viral infection, in this study, we investigated the role of complement in MERS-CoV-induced lung damage. Our study showed that complement was excessively activated in MERS-CoV-infected hDPP4-Tg mice through observations of increased concentrations of the C5a and C5b-9 complement activation products in sera and lung tissues, respectively. Interestingly, blocking C5a production by targeting its receptor, C5aR, alleviated lung and spleen tissue damage and reduced inflammatory responses. More importantly, anti-C5aR antibody treatment led to decreased viral replication in lung tissues. Furthermore, compared with the sham treatment control, apoptosis of splenic cells was less pronounced in the splenic white pulp of treated mice, and greater number of proliferating splenic cells, particularly in the red pulp, was observed. These data indicate that (1) dysregulated host immune responses contribute to the severe outcome of MERS; (2) excessive complement activation, triggered by MERS-CoV infection, promote such dysregulation; and (3) blockade of the C5aCC5aR axis lead to the decreased tissue damage induced by MERS-CoV infection, as manifested by reduced apoptosis and T cell regeneration in the spleen.

Therefore, construction of a comprehensive, high-confidence and well-organized resource to retrieve L-R interactions in order to study the functional effects of cell-cell communications would be of great value. RESULTS: In this study, we developed Cellinker, a manually curated resource of literature-supported L-R interactions that play roles in cell-cell communication. We aimed to provide a useful platform for studies on cell-cell communication mediated by L-R interactions. The current version of Cellinker documents over 3,700 human and 3,200 mouse L-R protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and embeds a practical and convenient webserver with which researchers can decode intercellular communications based on scRNA-seq data.

We addressed this shortcoming by developing a novel clinical-driven robotic hand rehabilitation device, which is capable of fine haptic rendering, and that supports physiological full flexion/extension of the fingers while offering an effortless setup. Our palmar design, based on a parallelogram coupled to a principal revolute joint, introduces the following novelties: (1) While allowing for an effortless installation of the user's hand, it offers large range of motion of the fingers (full extension to 180 flexion). (2) The kinematic design ensures that all fingers are supported through the full range of motion and that the little finger does not lose contact with the finger support in extension. (3) We took into consideration that a handle is usually comfortably grasped such that its longitudinal axis runs obliquely from the metacarpophalangeal joint of the index finger to the base of the hypothenar eminence. (4) The fingertip path was optimized to guarantee physiologically correct finger movements for a large variety of hand sizes. Moreover, the device possesses a high mechanical transparency, which was achieved using a backdrivable cable transmission. The transparency was further improved with the implementation of friction and gravity compensation. In a test with six healthy participants, the root mean square of the human-robot interaction force was found to remain as low as 1.37 N in a dynamic task.

Acute respiratory failure due to viral-lower respiratory tract disease necessitates PICU admission for mechanical ventilation. In critically ill patients in PICU settings, early fluid overload is common and associated with adverse outcomes such as prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased mortality. It is unclear, however, if this also applies to young children with viral-lower respiratory tract disease induced acute respiratory failure. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relation of early fluid overload with adverse outcomes in mechanically ventilated children with viral-lower respiratory tract disease in a retrospective dataset. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Single, tertiary referral PICU. PATIENTS One hundred thirty-five children (< 2 yr old) with viral-lower respiratory tract disease requiring mechanical ventilation admitted to the PICU of the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam between 2008 and 2014. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The cumulative fluid balance on day 3 of mechanical ventilation was compared against duration of mechanical ventilation (primary outcome) and daily mean oxygen saturation index (secondary outcome), using uni- and multivariable linear regression. In 132 children, the mean cumulative fluid balance on day 3 was + 97.9 (49.2) mL/kg. Higher cumulative fluid balance on day 3 was associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation in multivariable linear regression ( = 0.166; p = 0.048). No association was found between the fluid status and oxygen saturation index during the period of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS Early fluid overload is an independent predictor of prolonged mechanical ventilation in young children with viral-lower respiratory tract disease.

In this paper, we show the principle of the pressure mapping layer and the architecture of the dedicated electronic system that we developed for signal acquisition. In addition, we describe the algorithms for posture/movement classification (dedicated artificial neural network) and for extraction of the breathing rate (frequency domain analysis).

Sources of broad scale occurrence datasets include crowdsourced databases, such as eBird and iNaturalist, weather surveillance radars, and passive automated sensors including acoustic monitoring units and camera trap networks. Such data resources represent static observations, typically at the species level, at a given location. Nonetheless, by combining multiple observations across many locations and times it is possible to infer spatially continuous population-level movements. Population-level movement characterizes the aggregated movement of individuals comprising a population, such as range contractions, expansions, climate tracking, or migration, that can result from physical, behavioral, or demographic processes. A desire to model population movements from such forms of occurrence data has led to an evolving field that has created new analytical and statistical approaches that can account for spatial and temporal sampling bias in the observations. The insights generated from the growth of population-level movement research can complement the insights from focal tracking studies, and elucidate mechanisms driving changes in population distributions at potentially larger spatial and temporal scales. This review will summarize current broad-scale occurrence datasets, discuss the latest approaches for utilizing them in population-level movement analyses, and highlight studies where such analyses have provided ecological insights. We outline the conceptual approaches and common methodological steps to infer movements from spatially distributed occurrence data that currently exist for terrestrial animals, though similar approaches may be applicable to plants, freshwater, or marine organisms.","output":"Estimating the movements of terrestrial animal populations using broad-scale occurrence data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is the most severe pandemic globally since the 1918 influenza pandemic.

As older people are especially at risk of becoming severely ill, it is important to examine the personal factors that make members of this age group more prone to health anxiety. Previous studies indicated that cyberchondria, i.e., the repeated online search for medical information, exacerbates health anxiety. The present research investigated the effect of two opposing traits, optimism and neuroticism, on cyberchondria during the COVID-19 pandemic. The associations of cyberchondria with demographic factors (age, gender, and education) were also examined. A sample of 880 participants, aged 15C67, 65% of whom were female, participated in an online survey. Results show that neuroticism, age, and being female are positively associated with cyberchondria. Optimism was found to be related to cyberchondria, but this effect was qualified by a significant interaction with age. Further analysis revealed that the effect of optimism was significant only in the highest age group. Moreover, among these elderly participants, the psychologically protective influence of optimism against cyberchondria emerged as larger than the opposite effect of neuroticism. This demonstrates the mental benefits of encouraging a positive outlook on the current health crisis and on ones personal resilience in facing it, especially among the elderly.

Punitive drug law enforcement discourages help seeking and treatment and leads to unstable drug supplies that are contaminated with fentanyl and other high-potency synthetic opioids that heighten overdose risk.10 Incarcerated people are at an elevated risk of drug overdose in the weeks following release,11 and communities with high incarceration rates have higher mortality.12 Drug courts disproportionately cite low-income people of color for infractions, leading to imprisonment rather than treatment.13 Economic precarity and unstable housing disrupt the social networks that sustain health and prevent overdose.14 Urban planners often displace residents of Black and Latinx neighborhoods, leaving them exposed to narcotic trade and HIV.15 The child welfare system disproportionately removes low-income Black, Latinx, and Indigenous children from families affected by SUDs, and children raised in foster care are at high risk for SUDs.16,17 Therefore, reducing SUD-related deaths and disability requires the redress of discriminatory public policies.

METHODS Supine position safety in acute Achilles tendon repair was investigated. Consecutive cases of supine Achilles tendon surgical repair performed by one surgeon from 2010 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were included if they were surgically treated with primary repair in the supine position within 15 days of injury and did not undergo concomitant surgery.

In addition, these centers coordinate interhospital transfers of patients with COVID-19 and provide or arrange specialized telemedical consultations. OBJECTIVE: This study describes the establishment and management of a CCCC at a German university hospital. METHODS: We performed economic analyses (cost, cost-effectiveness, use, and utility) according to the CHEERS (Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards) criteria. Additionally, we conducted a systematic review to identify publications on similar institutions worldwide. The 2 months with the highest local incidence of COVID-19 cases (December 2020 and January 2021) were considered. RESULTS: During this time, 17.3 requests per day were made to the CCCC regarding admission or transfer of patients with COVID-19. The majority of requests were made by emergency medical services (601/1068, 56.3%), patients with an average age of 71.8 (SD 17.2) years were involved, and for 737 of 1068 cases (69%), SARS-CoV-2 had already been detected by a positive polymerase chain reaction test. In 59.8% (639/1068) of the concerned patients, further treatment by a general practitioner or outpatient presentation in a hospital could be initiated after appropriate advice, 27.2% (291/1068) of patients were admitted to normal wards, and 12.9% (138/1068) were directly transmitted to an intensive care unit. The operating costs of the CCCC amounted to more than 52,000 (US $60,031) per month. Of the 334 patients with detected SARS-CoV-2 who were referred via EMS or outpatient physicians, 302 (90.4%) were triaged and announced in advance by the CCCC. No other published economic analysis of COVID-19 coordination or management institutions at hospitals could be found. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high cost of the CCCC, we were able to show that it is a beneficial concept to both the providing hospital and the public health system. However, the most important benefits of the CCCC are that it prevents hospitals from being overrun by patients and that it avoids situations in which physicians must weigh one patients life against anothers.","output":"Central COVID-19 Coordination Centers in Germany: Description, Economic Evaluation, and Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated disease (COVID-19) represent a global health emergency that requires integrated and multidisciplinary intervention by international medical and scientific communities, in support of the national governments In Italy many public health measures have been adopted to contain the transmission of the disease, which also involved occupational physicians The regulatory path has had a rapid evolution due to the trend of infections and progressive scientific evidence: the most recent Circular from the Ministry of Labor and Social Policies and the Ministry of Health provides for the termination of the \\"exceptional health surveillance\\" activity, the management and protection of fragile individuals by activating the medical examination on request of the employee and excludes the old age, without comorbidities, as a specific condition of risk of serious complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection For preventive and insurance purposes, COVID-19 usually represents a generic biological risk, for which the same measures must be adopted for the entire population In the Inail Circular no 13 of April 3, 2020, however, it is stated that professional categories that perform front office duties are considered exposed to a higher risk, as well as, health professionals, can be considered exposed to a specific risk From January 1st to July 31st 2020, 51,363 cases of infection from SARS-CoV-2 were reported to INAIL as an accident In the same period INAIL noticed a decrease in reports of accidents and occupational disease overall, correlated to the effects of lockdown and smart working","output":"[COVID-19 and work environment: legislative developments about the role of the occupational physician in the emergency management and in the SARS-CoV-2-related work accidents notification]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The objective of this study was to evaluate the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease on women sensitized by pregnancy after the first case w","output":"Awareness of Coronavirus Disease from Conception to Delivery: Antenatal Mental Journey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose One of the main advantages of the proposed model is that it is flexible to generate n-day pairings simultaneously. It means that, despite previous researches, one-day to n-day pairings can be generated in a single model. The flexibility in generating parings causes that the proposed model leads to better solutions compared to existing models. Another advantage of the model is minimizing the risk of COVID-19 by limitation of daily flights as well as elapsed time minimization. As airports are among high risk places in COVID-19 pandemic, minimization of infection risk is considered in this model for the first time. Genetic algorithm is used as the solution approach, and its efficiency is compared to GAMS in small and medium-size problems. Design/methodology/approach One of the most complex issues in airlines is crew scheduling problem which is divided into two subproblems: crew pairing problem (CPP) and crew rostering problem (CRP). Generating crew pairings is a tremendous and exhausting task as millions of pairings may be generated for an airline. Moreover, crew cost has the largest share in total cost of airlines after fuel cost. As a result, crew scheduling with the aim of cost minimization is one of the most important issues in airlines. In this paper, a new bi-objective mixed integer programming model is proposed to generate pairings in such a way that deadhead cost, crew cost and the risk of COVID-19 are minimized. Findings The proposed model is applied for domestic flights of Iran Air airline. The results of the study indicate that genetic algorithm solutions have only 0.414 and 0.380 gap on average to optimum values of the first and the second objective functions, respectively. Due to the flexibility of the proposed model, it improves solutions resulted from existing models with fixed-duty pairings. Crew cost is decreased by 12.82, 24.72, 4.05 and 14.86% compared to one-duty to four-duty models. In detail, crew salary is improved by 12.85, 24.64, 4.07 and 14.91% and deadhead cost is decreased by 11.87, 26.98, 3.27, and 13.35% compared to one-duty to four-duty models, respectively.

Empirically, this study observes that the outbreak of pandemic crises curbs the crash risk of stock price. The more stable country is protected by the regulatory system, and the decrease in crash risk is smaller during the pandemic. The conclusions will enable the investors to trade with greater rationality and objectivity during the current pandemic situation caused by COVID-19.

One of the roadblocks to global malaria elimination is the lack of highly sensitive, specific, and accurate diagnostic tools. The absence of diagnostic tools in particular has led to poor differentiation among parasite species, poor prognosis, and delayed treatment. The improvement necessary in diagnostic tools can be broadly grouped into two categories: technologies-driven and omics-driven progress over time. This article discusses the recent advancement in omics-based malaria for identifying the next generation biomarkers for a highly sensitive and specific assay with a rapid and antecedent prognosis of the disease.

These students have a group of individuals, including educators, specialists, school leaders, and their own parents, collaborating to implement learning accommodations for them to support their academic success. This group is known as the Individualized Education Program Team (IEP Team). Without accommodations to the learning environment and to their learning activities, the academic achievement of SWD may be adversely impacted. The IEP Team must collaborate to create an effective Individualized Education Program (IEP) that is specially designed for their target student in the student's current educational placement. Special Education Directors (SED) are central to the functioning of IEP Teams as they support SWD in SOP. This relationship, and the resulting provision of special education services, has not been thoroughly researched. The purposes of this mixed methods study were to identify the needs of SWD in SOP, to identify the processes used by IEP Teams to support SWD in SOP, and to determine how those processes meet the needs and support SWD in SOP. The first phase of research was a quantitative online survey of SED followed by a second phase of qualitative semi-structured interviews of selected participants which more fully elucidated current student needs and IEP Team processes that address those needs and support these students. Findings include a confidence in the established IEP Team process and in special education staff, concerns over the ability of special education staff to support or accommodate SWD in online courses, the perception that the needs of SWD in online educations settings are different than those in face-to face settings, the perception that the SED give significant guidance to IEP Teams while allowing them independent function, and the use of the Covid-19 related increase in online learning to identify ways to better serve SWD online.

As AIDS vaccine recipients will not be exposed to strains exactly matching any immunogens due to multiple HIV-1 quasispecies circulating in the human population worldwide, heterologous SHIV challenges are essential for realistic vaccine efficacy testing in primates. We assessed whether polyclonal IgG, isolated from rhesus monkeys (RMs) with high-titer nAbs (termed SHIVIG), could protect RMs against the R5-tropic tier-2 SHIV-2873Nip, which was heterologous to the viruses or HIV-1 envelopes that had elicited SHIVIG. RESULTS: SHIVIG demonstrated binding to HIV Gag, Tat, and Env of different clades and competed with the broadly neutralizing antibodies b12, VRC01, 4E10, and 17b. SHIVIG neutralized tier 1 and tier 2 viruses, including SHIV-2873Nip. NK-cell depletion decreased the neutralizing activity of SHIVIG 20-fold in PBMC assays. Although SHIVIG neutralized SHIV-2873Nip in vitro, this polyclonal IgG preparation failed to prevent acquisition after repeated intrarectal low-dose virus challenges, but at a dose of 400 mg/kg, it significantly lowered peak viremia (P = 0.001). Unexpectedly, single-genome analysis revealed a higher number of transmitted variants at the low dose of 25 mg/kg, implying increased acquisition at low SHIVIG levels. In vitro, SHIVIG demonstrated complement-mediated Ab-dependent enhancement of infection (C-ADE) at concentrations similar to those observed in plasmas of RMs treated with 25 mg/kg of SHIVIG.

Southeast Asia is one of the areas in the world that has implemented various procedures and measures to slow down the disease outbreaks. The first cluster of COVID-19 was identified from the tourist-travel history, and then the diversity of coronavirus victims has posed a serious issue of human security on a massive scale. To evaluate whether or not naturally occurring mutations have strengthened the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, we computed in silico the structural dynamics of the RBD-spike protein mutation enhancing ACE2-binding. When considering emerging variations in Southeast Asia, 14 dominant mutations were analyzed by applying the structural and energetic characterization using MD simulations. The ones in the RBD region displayed higher affinity to ACE2 due to the improved interfacial stability of the RBD -strand surrounding the ACE2 across salt bridge hotspots. The binding hotspots and structurally conserved conformational-epitopes have been identified, which are deleterious for RBD mutation and ACE2 binding.

This drastically reduced the cost to applicants of accepting interview invitations. However, the reduction in cost was not symmetric since applicants, not programs, previously bore most of the costs of in-person interviews. We show that, starting from a situation where the final matching is stable, if doctors can accept more interviews, but the hospitals do not increase the number of interviews they offer, then no doctor is better off and many doctors are potentially harmed.

In recent history, the deployment of surge medical facilities and their importance in improving the provision of crisis care became relevant. The primary objective of this study was to describe the development and implementation of an alternate care site (ACS) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This was a retrospective, single-center study that was conducted between April 7, 2020, and May 26, 2020, of adult patients from a primary facility admitted to an ACS, labeled Staten Island University Hospital East (SIUH-E). These select patients met specific inclusion criteria for SIUH-E before transfer. Results During the operational course of SIUH-E, 813 patients were screened and 203 patients were accepted for transfer. Of the patients admitted to SIUH-E, 120 (59%) were male. The mean age was 63 years (SD = 13.91). The mean length of stay was 3.93 days (SD = 3.94). Among discharged patients, 179 (88%) were discharged to home or another long-term facility, whereas 24 (12%) patients required a transfer back to the main campus. Conclusions In this study, we describe the development and implementation of an alternate care surge facility during the COVID-19 pandemic. SIUH-E played a vital role in effectively caring for select COVID-19 patients, which allowed the primary facilities to treat a greater volume of higher acuity patients.

In this study, we constructed an attenuated S. enterica serovar Typhi strain stably expressing conserved nucleocapsid (N) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) by integrating the N gene into the pilV gene, which was under the control of the type IVB pilus operon promoter in S. enterica serovar Typhi. BALB/c mice were immunized with this recombinant strain through different routes: intranasally, orogastrically, intraperitoneally, and intravenously. Results showed that the intranasal route caused the highest production of specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgG2a, and secretory IgA, where IgG2a was imprinted as a Th1 cell bias. Moreover, this recombinant live vaccine induced significantly high levels of specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activities and increased gamma interferon-producing T cells compared with the parental strain. Our work provides insights into how the type IVB pilus operon promoter controlling SARS-CoV N gene expression in Salmonella might be attractive for a live-vector vaccine against SRAS-CoV infection, for it could induce mucosal, humoral, and cellular immune responses.

Good hygiene practices were considered an effective prevention method, but there were only minimal data on the effectiveness of hygiene practices against the pandemic at the community level. Thus, this study aims to assess hygiene practices in society by using a community-based survey. A cross-sectional study using survey monkey was conducted from December 2019 to February 2020. The Snowball sampling technique was used to recruit participants and exploratory factor analysis was applied to scrutinize the construct validity of the measurement. We used the Tobit regression model to assess the association. Hygiene in a high-risk environment and hygiene in the social and educational environment were two main factors after applying the EFA method. Participants grade community sanitation quite low (around 6 out of 10). Furthermore, the mean score of hygiene practice at a local level in a high-risk environment was slightly low at 6.0. The score of sanitation in the Central region (5.3) was quite low compared to the North (5.8) and the South (6.2). The most high-risk environment was construction, industrial zone and food safety. Moreover, younger respondents were more likely to report poorer hygiene practices in high-risk environments (Coefficient = ?1.67; 95% CI = ?3.03; ?0.32) and social and educational environment (Coefficient = ?1.29; 95% CI = ?2.54; ?0.04).

Due to limited prior knowledge, economists began researching this issue using cost-benefit analysis and found that infection control processes significantly affect economic efficiency. A UK study used economic parameters to numerically demonstrate an optimal balance in the process, including keeping the infected population stationary. However, universally applicable knowledge, which is indispensable for the guiding principles of infection control, has not yet been clearly developed because of the methodological limitations of simulation studies. Here, we propose a simple model and theoretically prove the universal result of economic irreversibility by applying the idea of thermodynamics to pandemic control. This means that delaying infection control measures is more expensive than implementing infection control measures early while keeping infected populations stationary. This implies that once the infected population increases, society cannot return to its previous state without extra expenditures. This universal result is analytically obtained by focusing on the infection-spreading phase of pandemics, and is applicable not just to COVID-19, regardless of \\"herd immunity.\\" It also confirms the numerical observation of stationary infected populations in its optimally efficient process.

Ample proposals have led to a good understanding of pathogenesis and drug efficacy against the novel virus disease. Excess systemic inflammation, which is described as cytokine storm, in the severe cases of COVID-19 can pass through the blood-brain barrier, enter the brain tissue, and activate the microglial cells and oligodenritcytes. Activation of the microglia cells and oligodenritcytes can increase generation of reactive oxygen species in the brain. Excess generation of reactive oxygen species can in turn increase neuro-inflammation in some cases of patients with COVID-19. Treatment of COVID-19 is far from clear.

Hence, the purpose of this review is to specifically point out how curcumin could interfere at different times/points during the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, providing a substantial contribution of curcumin as a new adjuvant therapy for the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Curcumin as a Potential Treatment for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The UK imports wild animals for commercial purposes from countries all across the world. We analyse a database of wildlife records from the UKs Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) to summarise the volume and variety of non-CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) listed wild animal imports over a recent 5-year period (2014C2018). We found that over 48 million individual animals were imported into the UK from 90 countries across nine global regions from 2014C2018. In terms of volume (semi-domesticated pigeons and game birds aside), amphibians were the most commonly imported group (73%), followed by reptiles (17%), mammals (4%), and birds (3%). The highest number of import records came from Europe and Africa, but the largest volume of animals came from North America and Asia. We review the potential for infectious diseases emerging from these vast and varied wildlife imports and discuss the potential threats they pose to public health. We also draw attention to an observed current lack of detail in the APHA database and suggest that better record keeping and reporting could help prevent and manage the introduction of infectious diseases. ABSTRACT: International wildlife trade is recognised as a major transmission pathway for the movement of pathogenic organisms around the world. The UK is an active consumer of non-native live wild animals and is therefore subject to the risks posed by pathogen pollution from imported wildlife. Here, we characterise a key yet overlooked portion of the UK wildlife import market. We evaluate the trade in live non-CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) wild terrestrial animals entering the UK over a 5-year period using data reported by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). Between 2014 and 2018, over 48 million individual animals, across five taxonomic classes and 24 taxonomic orders, were imported into the UK from 90 countries across nine global regions. The largest volumes of wild animals were imported from North America and Asia, and most of the import records were from Europe and Africa. Excluding Columbiformes (pigeons) and Galliformes (game birds), amphibians were the most imported taxonomic class (73%), followed by reptiles (17%), mammals (4%), birds (3%), and arachnids (<1%). The records described herein provide insight into the scope and scale of non-CITES listed wildlife imported in to the UK. We describe the potential for pathogen pollution from these vast and varied wildlife imports and highlight the potential threats they pose to public health. We also draw attention to the lack of detail in the UK wildlife import records, which limits its ability to help prevent and manage introduced infectious diseases. We recommend that improved record keeping and reporting could prove beneficial in this regard.","output":"Risky Business: Live Non-CITES Wildlife UK Imports and the Potential for Infectious Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since December 2019, 2019-nCoV has emerged in Wuhan, China, the fast pace of transmission is wreaking global public health crisis. Countrys reaction speed is critical for the control of public health emergency (PHE), especially in the early stage of an outbreak. Compared with SARS pandemic, whether has the efficiency of initial public health emergency response to COVID-19 in mainland China been improved? And whether is there still existing vulnerabilities in current PHE system? Studies on this topic are relatively few. We tried to find the answers, evidences and alternatives. Methods: : We conducted a retrospective comparative study. The speed of hospital reporting, pathogen identification and government decision-making between SARS and COVID-19 were compared by selecting 5 critical events from initial public health emergency response timeline. Besides, combining with the two pandemics' progress curves, we discussed the characteristics of their peak time. Results: : (1) SARS completed the entire initial public health emergency response in 127 days, and COVID-19 completed in 44 days. Response speed has been shorted nearly by 3 times. (2) Both the first SARS and COVID-19 cases were reported in 19 days. It doesn't appear that hospital reporting speed becomes faster. (3) The accumulated time completing pathogen identification were 118 days for SARS and 31 days for COVID-19. The speed has been improved by more than 3 times. (4) 9 days after the completion of pathogen identification, national government made emergency policies for SARS while the interval between pathogen identification and national government's decision-making for COVID-19 was 13 days. (5) The peak time of SARS came about 80 days later than that of COVID-19. But both the two pandemics' peak occurred about 20 days after the national government's decision-making, and then the curves went down dramatically. Conclusions: : The speed of initial public health emergency response to pandemic has been improved due to faster identification. However, some deficiencies and challenges in early alert and authorities' decision-making still remain. Therefore, Chinese government should put more stress on improving hospital's sensitivity to new emerging infectious diseases and timeliness of government's decision-making.","output":"Facts and Reflections on Initial Public Health Emergency Response to SARS and COVID-19 Pandemics in Mainland China: A Retrospective Comparative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite broad scientific consensus that sustainable use of wildlife can enhance conservation efforts, ethical concerns have led some community groups to oppose use of wild animals. Voicing those concerns is legitimate, but underlying philosophical bias should not influence science\\\\based analysis and interpretation. We argue that philosophical biases are common in the scientific literature on trade in wildlife. The critically important case of bias surrounding the use of reptile leathers for luxury fashion illustrates the problem. Based on analysis of official seizures of fashion products made from wildlife, a recent study inferred that criminal activity (as inferred by noncompliance with regulations) was common and increasing and, hence, that authorities needed to adopt more stringent restrictions on the trade. In fact, the conclusions of that study are artifacts of pseudoreplication (e.g., multiple counts of single violations) and biased sampling (e.g., focus on companies with high rates of error) and run directly opposite to actual patterns in the data. As a proportion of overall trade, rates of noncompliance are exceptionally low (<0.4%), are declining, and result primarily from paper\\\\work errors rather than criminal intent (e.g., such errors are more frequent for goods shipped by government authorities than by the commercial fashion industry). The recommendation by the study authors to prohibit the international trade in wildlife\\\\based fashion products is imperiling a sustainable trade that can benefit biodiversity and people's livelihoods by providing financial incentives for conservation of species and habitats. This example offers a warning of the dangers of basing research on the wildlife trade on ethical or philosophical positions rather than objective evaluations of evidence.","output":"The perils of flawed science in wildlife trade literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study evaluated the fidelity and effectiveness of a parent coach training program for toddlers at risk for autism spectrum disorder and identified factors required for successful training implementation under real-world conditions.

The derived environmental destruction has led to a biodiversity loss at an unprecedented rate. Following the large-scale losses of habitats and species, it was recognized that biodiversity is crucial in maintaining ecosystems. Since the 1970s a global sustainability agenda was set to develop different types of sustainable development (SD) related milestones, including Green-Blue Economic Growth which despite not specifically addressing the biodiversity issues served to reinforce the idea that economic development based on profit is compatible with our planet's ecology. Only after biodiversity literature became mainstream in the early 2000s a global biodiversity agenda was implemented. The agenda highlights biodiversity conservation as a major international challenge and finally recognizes that the main drivers for biodiversity loss derive from economic activities. Much alike pre-, the post-2000 biodiversity agendas, including the 2030 Agenda for SD and post-2020 Convention on Biological Diversity Global Strategy Framework, are based on SD principles, and do not consider the negative impacts of growth-oriented strategies on biodiversity. As a result, the global biodiversity conservation priorities are governed by the biodiversity's economic value and its assumed contribution to people's welfare. While pointing to a body of empirical evidence that unlimited economic growth is the main driver of biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene, we strongly argue for sustainable degrowth and a fundamental shift in societal values. An equitable downscaling of the physical economy can improve ecological conditions, reducing biodiversity loss, while enhancing our well-being.

Its clinical manifestations may have similarities to other septic, thoracic, or gastrointestinal post-surgical complications. Additionally, the post-operative period may be a time of increased risk for severe manifestations of COVID-19. We sought to evaluate the frequency of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients who had recently had operations who were undergoing imaging for acute symptoms and the role of chest computed tomography (CT) in this setting. Patients and Methods: We included all patients who had chest CT for acute symptoms in the 15 days after a surgical procedure between March 1 and 31, 2020. Results: Of 46 patients with acute post-operative symptoms requiring chest imaging, eight (17%) were ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19. Among them, five (62%) required mechanical ventilation and two (25%) died. All had abnormal chest CT with typical findings of COVID-19 in 87%. Computed tomography provided an alternate diagnosis in 53% of patients who did not have COVID-19. The average time between a COVID-19-positive chest CT and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmation was 1.2 days (range, 0-4 days). Conclusion: COVID-19 is a serious post-operative condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Chest CT provides prompt diagnosis of COVID-19.

Risks of hospitalization, including significant functional decline, are important considerations when deciding whether to treat a resident in the nursing home or transfer to a hospital. Little is known about postdischarge functional status, relative to baseline, of nursing home residents hospitalized for pneumonia. We sought to determine the risk of severe functional limitation or death for nursing home residents following hospitalization for treatment of pneumonia. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants included Medicare enrollees aged &#8805;65 years, hospitalized from a nursing home in the United States between 2013 and 2014 for pneumonia. METHODS: Activities of daily living (ADL), patient sociodemographics, and comorbidities were obtained from the Minimum Data Set (MDS), an assessment tool completed for all nursing home residents. MDS assessments from prior to and following hospitalization were compared to assess for functional decline. Following hospital discharge, all patients were evaluated for a composite outcome of severe disability (&#8805;4 ADL limitations) following hospitalization or death prior to completion of a postdischarge MDS. RESULTS: In 2013 and 2014, a total of 241,804 nursing home residents were hospitalized for pneumonia, of whom 89.9% (192,736) experienced the composite outcome of severe disability or death following hospitalization for pneumonia. Although we found that prehospitalization functional and cognitive status were associated with developing the composite outcome, 53% of residents with no prehospitalization ADL limitation, and 82% with no cognitive limitation experienced the outcome. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Hospitalization for treatment of pneumonia is associated with significant risk of functional decline and death among nursing home residents, even those with minimal deficits prior to hospitalization.

It has resulted in enormous economic as well as social costs, such as increased deaths from the spread of infection in a region. This is because public regulations imposed by national and local governments to deter the spread of infection inevitably involves a deliberate suppression of the level of economic activity. Given this trade-off between economic activity and epidemic prevention, governments should execute public interventions to minimize social and economic losses from the pandemic. A major problem regarding the resultant economic losses is that it unequally impacts certain strata of the society. This raises an important question on how such economic losses should be shared equally across the society. At the same time, there is some antipathy towards economic compensation by means of public debt, which is likely to increase economic burden in the future.

The disease has spread in almost every part of the world and has been declared a global pandemic in March 2020 by World Health Organization (WHO). The corona virus outbreak has emerged as one of the deadliest pandemics of all time in human history. The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 has forced several countries of the world to observe complete lockdown forcing people to live in their homes. India also faced the phase of total lockdown for 21 days (in first phase) to avoid the spread of coronavirus to the maximum possible extent. This lockdown impacted the pollution levels of environment and improved air and water quality in the short span owing to very less human activities. The present work scientifically analyzed the available data for primary air pollutants (PM(2.5), NO(2), SO(2) and CO) from two major Indian cities, Lucknow and New Delhi. The analysis was based on air quality data for before lockdown and after lockdown (first phase of 21 days) periods of 21 days each. The results showed significant decline in the studied air pollution indices and demonstrated improvement of air quality in both the cities. The major impact was seen in the levels of PM(2.5), NO(2) and CO. The levels of SO(2) showed less significant decline during the lockdown period.

Therefore, we present here a high resolution mapping of the 2018-2020 evolution of human activities and air pollutants in Wuhan. Human activities were assessed by nighttime light radiance. We measured the air quality index (AQI) as the maximum value among air quality sub-indices of SO2, NO2, CO, O3 and particulate matter. We also compared mean monthly pollutant concentration during January-April in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Mapping results show that variations of nighttime light radiance were heterogenous at local scale, showing both rises and declines in the same district. The radiance decreased in eight districts located mostly in the city center, as a result of lower human activity, but the radiance increased in the five surrounding districts, as a consequence of people staying at home. AQI was low during lockdown, averaging at 57, but showed strong daily variations with a slight pollution around February 5 with AQI rising to 126. During this pollution event, particulate matter, SO2, NO2 and CO levels were positively correlated, suggesting common sources, but were not correlated with ozone; and particulate matter, SO2, NO2 and CO decreased with relative humidity, suggesting removal by precipitation. Comparison of 2020 data with previous years shows that particulate matter and NO2 were highly reduced, CO was less reduced due to ongoing power industries, SO2 first declined then increased to exceed 2018-19 values due to coal combustion, and ozone levels was more abundant due both to less NOx pollution and the weekend effect.

Studies have reported significant associations between physical inactivity, sedentary behavior, and common mental health problems. This study investigated relations between participants reports of change in physical activity (PA; i.e., Reduced PA, Unchanged PA, or Increased PA) and levels of anxiety and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Norway in the time period from March 12, 2020 to June 15, 2020. The relations between age and gender and levels of anxiety and depression symptoms as well as how different levels of resilience influenced the relation between changes in PA and levels of anxiety and depression symptoms were also investigated. A cross-sectional survey design was used. Participants (N = 1,314; females = 31%) were members of an endurance sports organization aged between 18 and 81 years (M = 49 years; SD = 11.50 years). Participants completed the Resilience Scale for Adults and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and reported their changes in PA after lockdown restrictions were implemented on March 12, 2020. Regression analysis, independent samples t-test, and two-way multivariate analysis of variance were conducted. Reduced PA was associated with a higher risk of anxiety and depression symptoms. Younger participants in Reduced PA and Unchanged PA subgroups scored significantly higher on levels of anxiety symptoms and significantly higher on depression symptoms in Unchanged PA subgroup. Females in Unchanged PA and Increased PA subgroups scored significantly higher on levels of anxiety symptoms, whereas no gender differences were found for depression symptoms. The main and interaction effects of change in PA and resilience were significantly associated with depression symptoms. For anxiety symptoms, only the main effect of resilience, but not PA, and the interaction effect were significant. Results further showed that resilience was an important factor that influenced the levels of change in PA. High levels of resilience were associated with lower anxiety and depression symptoms in Reduced, Unchanged, and Increased PA subgroups during the COVID-19 lockdown. Promoting PA while boosting resilience factors such as confidence in own ability and drawing on the social support of even reduced social networks or connections while under lockdown can protect against common mental health problems.","output":"Change in Physical Activity During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Lockdown in Norway: The Buffering Effect of Resilience on Mental Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Uncertainty is at the center of debates on how to best cope with the Covid-19 pandemic.

Cervical fractures will have an impact on the patients work, and COVID-19 is a challenge in the hospital to treat a cervical fracture. This study aims to discuss the case of patients with cervical fractures that have undergone surgical treatment in the COVID-19 pandemic. CASE PRESENTATION: Two cases of emergency patients with cervical injury treated at the hospital in the acute setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. All these patients experienced delayed timing to arrive in the emergency department of Prof. Dr. R. Soeharso Orthopedic Hospital.

We suggest the diagnostic serial interval, the time between the diagnosis of the infector and infectee, as a new indicator for the effectiveness of contact tracing. METHODS Using an agent-based simulation model, we demonstrate how the diagnostic serial interval correlates with the course of the epidemic. We consider four scenarios of how diagnosis and subsequent isolation are triggered: 1. never, 2. by symptoms, 3. by symptoms and loose contact tracing, 4. by symptoms and tight contact tracing. We further refine scenario 3 and 4 with different lengths of target diagnostic serial intervals. RESULTS Scenarios 1 and 2 did not yield a notable difference. In scenarios 3 and 4, however, contact tracing led to a decrease of the height of the epidemic as well as the cumulative proportion of infected agents. Generally, the shorter the diagnostic serial interval was, the smaller the peak of the epidemic became, and the more proportion of the population remained susceptible at the end of the epidemic. CONCLUSION A short target diagnosis interval is critical for contact tracing to be effective in the epidemic control. The diagnosis interval can be used to assess and guide the contact tracing strategy.","output":"Diagnostic Serial Interval as an Indicator for Effectiveness of Contact Tracing in the COVID-19 Pandemic - A Simulation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We used two approaches to design proteins with shape and chemical complementarity to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein near the binding site for the human ACE2 receptor Scaffolds were built around an ACE2 helix that interacts with the RBD, or de novo designed scaffolds were docked against the RBD to identify new binding modes In both cases, designed sequences were optimized first in silico and then experimentally for target binding, folding and stability Nine designs bound the RBD with affinities ranging from 100pM to 10nM, and blocked bona fide SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells with IC (50) values ranging from 35 pM to 35 nM;the most potent of these - 56 and 64 residue hyperstable proteins made using the second approach - are roughly six times more potent on a per mass basis (IC (50) ~ 0 23 ng/ml) than the best monoclonal antibodies reported thus far Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain trimer in complex with the two most potent minibinders show that the structures of the designs and their binding interactions with the RBD are nearly identical to the computational models, and that all three RBDs in a single Spike protein can be engaged simultaneously These hyperstable minibinders provide promising starting points for new SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics, and illustrate the power of computational protein design for rapidly generating potential therapeutic candidates against pandemic threats","output":"De novo design of picomolar SARS-CoV-2 miniprotein inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study was done to analyze and compare synoptic conditions during the most durable pollution and clean waves (MDPW and MDCW) in Tehran City (capital of Iran). For this purpose, air quality index (AQI) data were first obtained during 2009C2019 from the Tehran Air Quality Control Company in Tehran Province. Then, a threshold of (AQI  101) representing a polluted and unhealthy atmosphere was considered as MDPW, and a threshold of (AQI  50) representing a clean (good) air was selected as MDCW in Tehran City by identifying the polluted days. The results showed the presence of MDPW during 43 polluted days from November 21, 2010 to January 2, 2011. Intensity and frequency of the polluted days during statistical period showed a decreasing trend that coincided with an increasing trend of precipitation. Analysis of synoptic conditions occurred during 43 days of MDPW indicated penetration of Siberian high-pressure from the east at sea level and extension of sub-tropical anticyclone in mid-level from the west that led to development of an anticyclone circulation with descending and converging flow in Iran and surrounding region. As a result, a calm and sustainable climate and stable concentration of pollutants were observed throughout Tehran City. Backward trajectory of sources and entry route of the polluted air to Tehran City during peak days of pollution showed that desert regions of southern Iraq and central Iran along the southern and southwestern parts played a major role in increasing concentration of pollutants during occurrence of durable wave. Different routes were observed in entry of dusty and the polluted air to Tehran City according to hybrid single-particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory (HY SPLIT) model, but in most of peak days, the areas that were near and adjacent to Tehran City with height of less than 1000 m played a greater role in particle transport. Investigation of instability indices during MDPW showed that in most days of pollution, values of instability intensity were classified into weak class and lower troposphere (1000C850 hPa) compared to higher levels, and degree of stability and calmness of the atmosphere was more. So that, the highest frequency of temperature inversions occurred near the earth's surface.","output":"Synoptic analysis of the most durable pollution and clean waves during 2009C2019 in Tehran City (capital of Iran)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microplastics (MPs) have been considered as a new vector for the long-distance transport of pathogens in aquatic ecosystems.

Nearly 2863 million raw reads were produced and assembled, and annotation resulted in the identification of 1719 different species of viruses in MPs. Viruses in polypropylene (PP) displayed the highest diversity, with about 250 specific viruses detected. Source tracking of viruses in MPs by the fast expectation-maximization microbial source tracking method (FEAST) demonstrated that viruses in upstream and downstream MPs are two major sources of viruses in estuary. Furthermore, the MP-type-dependent potential environmental risk of viruses was significant based on both antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs) detected in viral metagenomes, and PP was confirmed with the highest potential environmental risk. This study reveals the high diversity and potential environmental risk of viruses in different MPs, and provides an important guidance for future environmental monitoring and understanding the potential risks associated with both viral transmission and MPs pollution.","output":"Viral diversity and potential environmental risk in microplastic at watershed scale: Evidence from metagenomic analysis of plastisphere"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether micronutrients (vitamins/minerals) benefit attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and irritability in a North American pediatric sample. METHOD A three-site 8-week placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of micronutrients was conducted in unmedicated children ages 6-12 with ADHD and at least one impairing irritability symptom by parent report on the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory-5 (CASI-5). A priori-defined primary outcomes were Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) (CGI-I of 1 or 2 = treatment responder) and parent-rated CASI-5 composite score of ADHD, oppositional defiant, disruptive mood dysregulation, and peer conflict symptoms, including impairment scores. RESULTS Of 135 randomized (mean age 9.8 years), 126 (93%) comprised the modified intention-to-treat population. Blinding was maintained. For the CGI-I, 54% of the micronutrient and 18% of the placebo group were responders (Risk Ratio=2.97, 97.5% CI: 1.50, 5.90, p<0.001). CASI-5 composite scores improved significantly for both groups (p<0.01) with a mean change of -0.31 (95% CI: -0.39, -0.23) in the micronutrient group and a mean change of -0.28 (95% CI: -0.38, -0.19) in the placebo group.

Setting A construction camp, a factory and a training institution in Ghana. Participants Staff of a construction camp, a factory, workers and students of a training institution. Interventions We described and compared the three COVID-19 outbreak scenarios in Ghana, highlighting identification and diagnosis of cases, testing, contact tracing and stakeholder engagement for each scenario. We also outlined the challenges and lessons learnt in the management of these scenarios. Main outcome measures Approach used for diagnosis, testing, contact tracing and stakeholder engagement. Results Index cases of the training institution and construction camp were screened the same day of reporting symptoms, whiles the factory index case required a second visit before the screening. All index cases were tested with RT-PCR. The training institution followed and tested all contacts, and an enhanced contact tracing approach was conducted for staff of the other two sites. Multi-sectorial engagement and collaboration with stakeholders enabled effective handling of the outbreak response in all sites. Conclusion Comparing all three settings, early diagnosis and prompt actions taken through multi-sectorial collaborations played a major role in controlling the outbreak.

Over the past years there was a rise in reported incidents of respiratory disease in pigs in Norway, despite population wide freedom from Aujeszkys disease, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, porcine respiratory corona virus and enzootic pneumonia. The main objective of this study was to investigate acute outbreaks of respiratory disease in conventional Norwegian fattening pig herds. The study included 14 herds. In seven herds with reported outbreaks of acute respiratory disease, data on clinical signs was recorded and samples for laboratory examination were collected. Diagnostic protocols were compared by parallel analysis of clinically healthy pigs from seven non-outbreak herds. RESULTS: The most commonly reported clinical signs were sudden deaths and dyspnea. An average compartment morbidity of 60%, mortality of 4% and case fatality of 9% was recorded in the outbreak herds. Post-mortem examinations revealed acute lesions resembling porcine pleuropneumonia in all 28 pigs investigated from the outbreak herds and in 2 of the 24 (8%) pigs from the non-outbreak herds. Chronic lesions were recorded in another 2 pigs (8%) from the non-outbreak herds. Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serovar 8 was isolated from lungs and/or pleura from all tested pigs (n = 28) in the outbreak herds, and from 2 out of 24 pigs (8%) in the non-outbreak herds, one pig with an acute and another pig with a chronic infection. No other significant bacterial findings were made. Seroconversion to A. pleuropneumoniae antibodies was detectable in all outbreak herds analyzed and in six out of seven non-outbreak herds, but the risk ratio for seroconversion of individual pigs was higher (risk ratio 2.3 [1.50- 3.43 95% CI; P < 0.001]) in the outbreak herds. All herds tested positive for porcine circovirus type 2 and negative for influenza A viruses on oral fluid RT-qPCR. CONCLUSION: The main etiological pathogen found during acute outbreaks of respiratory disease was A. pleuropneumoniae serovar 8. All pigs from outbreak herds had typical lesions of acute porcine pleuropneumonia, and only A. pleuropneumoniae serovar 8 was identified.

The outcome of in vitro experiments validated that, out of five previously reported antiviral components, CGA significantly reduced the relative mRNA expression of IBV-N in CEK cells. At high concentration (400 mg/kg), CGA supplementation reduced IBV-N mRNA expression levels and ameliorated the injury in trachea and lungs. The mRNA expression levels of IL-6, IL-1, IL-12, and NF-B were considerably turned down, but IL-22 and IL-10 were enhanced in trachea. However, CGA-H treatment had considerably increased the expression levels of MDA5, MAVS, TLR7, MyD88, IRF7, IFN- and IFN- both in trachea and lungs. Moreover, CGA-H notably induced the CD3+, CD3+ CD4+ and CD4+/CD8+ proliferation and significantly increased the IgA, IgG, and IgM levels in the serum. In conclusion, these results showed that at high concentration CGA is a strong anti-IBV compound that can effectively regulate the innate immunity through MDA5, TLR7 and NF-B signaling pathways and have the potential to induce the cell mediated and humoral immune response in IBV infected chickens.","output":"Chlorogenic acid is a positive regulator of MDA5, TLR7 and NF-B signaling pathways mediated antiviral responses against Gammacoronavirus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding variability in clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 community infections is key in management of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

We evaluated the association between receipt of inactivated influenza vaccine during pregnancy and prematurity and small for gestational age (SGA) births. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a cohort analysis of surveillance data from the Georgia (United States) Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. Among 4,326 live births between 1 June 2004 and 30 September 2006, maternal influenza vaccine information was available for 4,168 (96.3%). The primary intervention evaluated in this study was receipt of influenza vaccine during any trimester of pregnancy. The main outcome measures were prematurity (gestational age at birth <37 wk) and SGA (birth weight <10th percentile for gestational age). Infants who were born during the putative influenza season (1 OctoberC31 May) and whose mothers were vaccinated against influenza during pregnancy were less likely to be premature compared to infants of unvaccinated mothers born in the same period (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38C0.94). The magnitude of association between maternal influenza vaccine receipt and reduced likelihood of prematurity increased during the period of at least local influenza activity (adjusted OR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26C0.73) and was greatest during the widespread influenza activity period (adjusted OR = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11C0.74). Compared with newborns of unvaccinated women, newborns of vaccinated mothers had 69% lower odds of being SGA (adjusted OR = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.13C0.75) during the period of widespread influenza activity. The adjusted and unadjusted ORs were not significant for the pre-influenza activity period. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates an association between immunization with the inactivated influenza vaccine during pregnancy and reduced likelihood of prematurity during local, regional, and widespread influenza activity periods. However, no associations were found for the pre-influenza activity period. Moreover, during the period of widespread influenza activity there was an association between maternal receipt of influenza vaccine and reduced likelihood of SGA birth.

Body mass index (BMI, from measured height and weight) was used as an indicator of overall obesity, and waist?hip ratio for central obesity. Main outcome was cases of COVID-19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission from 16 March 2020 to 26 April 2020. Around 0.2% (n = 640) of the sample were hospitalized for COVID-19. There was an upward linear trend in the likelihood of COVID-19 hospitalization with increasing BMI, that was evident in the overweight (odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.71; crude incidence 19.1 per 10,000) and obese stage I (1.70;1.34 to 2.16; 23.3 per 10,000) and stage II (3.38; 2.60 to 4.40; 42.7 per 10,000) compared to normal weight (12.5 per 10,000). This gradient was little affected after adjustment for a wide range of covariates; however, controlling for biomarkers, particularly high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and glycated hemoglobin, led to a greater degree of attenuation. A similar pattern of association emerged for waist?hip ratio. In summary, overall and central obesity are risk factors for COVID-19 hospital admission.

Data on the consequences during pregnancy are limited. The first Chinese data published seem to show that the symptoms in pregnant women are the same as those of the general population. There are no cases of intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission, but cases of newborns infected early suggest that there could be vertical perpartum or neonatal transmission. Induced prematurity and cases of respiratory distress in newborns of infected mothers have been described. Pregnancy is known as a period at higher risk for the consequences of respiratory infections, as for influenza, so it seems important to screen for Covid-19 in the presence of symptoms and to monitor closely pregnant women.

COVID-19 can also present with neurologic signs and symptoms, including headache, hyposmia/anosmia, encephalopathy, meningoencephalitis, Guillain-Barr syndrome, stroke, and seizure. Viral transmission occurs through aerosols generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales and by direct touching of contaminated surfaces. The present study evaluated the frequency of neurologic presentations of coronavirus disease in patients presenting at a tertiary care hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology This cross-sectional study included 350 inpatients and outpatients (self-isolated) with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who presented at Dow International Medical College of Karachi between March and June 2020. Of these 350 patients, 68 (18.9%) presented with neurological signs and symptoms and were further evaluated. The data were analyzed statistically using IBM Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) for Windows, version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results The 350 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection included 245 (70%) men and 105 (30%) women; of these, 262 (74.9%) were married, and 88 (25.1%) were unmarried. Patients ranged in age from 17 to 88 years (mean  standard deviation, 49.5  17.4 years), with 68 (18.9%) having neurological manifestations. Headache was the most frequent neurological symptom, reported in 21 (6%) patients, followed by vertigo in 12 patients (3.4%), numbness/paresthesia in 11 (3.1%), altered level of consciousness in seven (2%), hyposmia/anosmia in five (1.4%), and encephalitis in three (0.9%). Other symptoms included sudden hemiparesis (stroke) in two patients (0.6%), flaccid paralysis due to Guillain-Barre syndrome in one (0.3%), and seizure in one (0.3%).

Influenza is caused by influenza viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV). There are many subtypes of IAV but only a few seem to be able to adapt to humans and to cause disease. In 2013, an H7N9 IAV subtype emerged in China that does not cause clinical symptoms in its chicken host but leads to severe infections when transmitted into humans. Since 2013, there have been six epidemic waves of H7N9 with 1567 laboratory\\\\confirmed human infections and 615 deaths. Pathogenicity of IAV is complex, but a crucial feature contributing to virulence is the activation of the hemagglutinin (HA) fusion protein by host proteases that triggers membrane fusion and leads to subsequent virus propagation. METHODS: 293T, VERO, and MDCK cells were used to conduct Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence assays, and pseudoparticle and live virus infections, and to evaluate H7N9 HA cleavage\\\\activation. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: We show that human matriptase/ST 14 is able to cleave H7N9 HA. Cleavage of H7N9 HA expressed in cell culture results in fusogenic HA and syncytia formation. In infection studies with viral pseudoparticles carrying matriptase/ST 14\\\\activated H7N9 HA, we observed a high infectivity of cells.

Controlling for demographic variables, negative indicators of self-compassion (aka self-coldness) was found to intensify the impacts of threats on psychological distress. The positive indicators of self-compassion also moderated the link between threats and perceived benefits, such that perceived benefits tend to be less related to threats in participants with higher self-compassion.

As the Delta variant has continued to spread, we evaluated the impact of accelerated vaccination on reducing hospitalization and deaths across northeastern and southern regions of the US census divisions. METHODS: We used an age-stratified agent-based model of COVID-19 to simulate outbreaks in all states within two U.S. regions. The model was calibrated using reported incidence in each state from October 1, 2020 to August 31, 2021, and parameterized with characteristics of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and state-specific daily vaccination rate. We then projected the number of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths that would be averted between September 2021 and the end of March 2022 if the states increased their daily vaccination rate by 20 or 50% compared to maintaining the status quo pace observed during August 2021. FINDINGS: A 50% increase in daily vaccine doses administered to previously unvaccinated individuals is projected to prevent a total of 30,727 hospitalizations and 11,937 deaths in the two regions between September 2021 and the end of March 2022. Southern states were projected to have a higher weighted average number of hospitalizations averted (18.8) and lives saved (8.3) per 100,000 population, compared to the weighted average of hospitalizations (12.4) and deaths (2.7) averted in northeastern states. On a per capita basis, a 50% increase in daily vaccinations is expected to avert the most hospitalizations in Kentucky (56.7 hospitalizations per 100,000 averted with 95% CrI: 45.56 - 69.9) and prevent the most deaths in Mississippi, (22.1 deaths per 100,000 population prevented with 95% CrI: 18.0 - 26.9). INTERPRETATION: Accelerating progress to population-level immunity by raising the daily pace of vaccination would prevent substantial hospitalizations and deaths in the US, even in those states that have passed a Delta-driven peak in infections.

However, several randomized studies have now shown no benefit or increased adverse events associated with remdesivir treatment. Drug development is a time-intensive process and requires extensive safety and efficacy evaluations. In contrast, drug repurposing is a time-saving and cost-effective drug discovery strategy geared towards using existing drugs instead of de novo drug discovery.

A central tenet of our current understanding of this persistence is that infected cells are shielded from immune recognition and elimination through a lack of antigen expression from proviruses. Efforts to cure HIV infection have therefore focused on reactivating latent proviruses to enable immune-mediated clearance, but these have yet to succeed in reducing viral reservoirs. Here, we revisited the question of whether HIV reservoirs are predominately immunologically silent from a new angle: by querying the dynamics of HIV-specific T cell responses over long-term ART for evidence of ongoing recognition of HIV-infected cells. In longitudinal assessments, we show that the rates of change in persisting HIV Nef-specific responses, but not responses to other HIV gene products, were associated with residual frequencies of infected cells. These Nef-specific responses were highly stable over time and disproportionately exhibited a cytotoxic, effector functional profile, indicative of recent in vivo recognition of HIV antigens. These results indicate substantial visibility of the HIV-infected cells to T cells on stable ART, presenting both opportunities and challenges for the development of therapeutic approaches to curing infection.","output":"HIV-specific T cell responses reflect substantive in vivo interactions with antigen despite long-term therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given that the COVID-19 era has changed the behavior of all individuals, and since previous reports about its possible impact on atopic dermatitis (AD) patients remained speculative, in this survey we aimed to explore the real impact of COVID-19 among AD patients.

K-means clustering was applied to organize students according to their psychological health score, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was also conducted to determine the association among the student's activities and their mental health during the pandemic. In addition, these associations were examined through chi-square test and ordinal logistic regression. Results: Students were categorized into four categories where 4.32% had mild, 72.7% had moderate, 12.57% had moderately severe, and 10.41% suffered from severe mental health imbalance. The results showed that having family members affected by the coronavirus, facing insecurity, using social media, and smoking habits increased the mental health imbalances of students; in contrast, being worried about studying, future career, spending more time with family members, and participation in household chores reduced the mental health disturbances of students. On the other hand, the results of the ordinal logistic regression indicated that sleeping time and participation in household chores were preventive factors for students. Conclusion: This study reveals that a large proportion of University students of Bangladesh suffered from mental health disturbances during the lockdown period. Implementing mental health plans and providing job security, improved communication approaches toward family members, not flattening illusive news, and preoccupation in household activities may assist to enhance the mental health status of the university students. The authors believe that this study's findings will be helpful to expedite the rate of attaining the sustainable development goal associated with health status in Bangladesh.","output":"Assessing the mental health condition of home-confined university level students of Bangladesh due to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With concerns for presymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 and increasing burden of contact tracing and employee furloughs, several hospitals have supplemented pre-existing infection prevention measures with universal masking of all personnel in hospitals.

Due to its high infectiousness, the health care staff is even more exposed. Nevertheless, there is still very limited information about it, especially among pediatricians. OBJECTIVE: To assess the seroprevalence of SARSCoV- 2 antibodies among physicians from a children's hospital 3 months after the first case in Argentina. To explore if certain demographic, occupational, and epidemiological characteristics are risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of physicians randomly selected from the list of workers of a children's hospital. All of them were screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by chemiluminescence (immunoglobulins G/M [IgG/IgM]) and their epidemiological history was collected (age, place of residence, professional category, contact with infected people) in order to explore the association between predictors and seropositivity. RESULTS: A total of 116 physicians were included; their average age was 45.6  13.3 years. Of them, 62.9 % were staff physicians, and the rest, residents; 42.2 % worked in areas designated for direct care of COVID-19 patients. Four (3.5 %) referred contact with infected people without the appropriate protection, and 6 (5.2 %), having traveled to risk areas. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG) were only detected in one of the professionals. Because of this, it was impossible to assess the association between potential predictors and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

The objective of this Phase I trial (NCT03299309) was to assess the safety and feasibility of a novel pp65 peptide vaccine (PEP-CMV) in children and young adults with recurrent medulloblastoma and malignant glioma. METHODS: Vaccines contain a synthetic long peptide (SLP) of 26 amino acids encoding multiple potential class I, class II, and antibody epitopes of CMV pp65 across several haplotypes. This SLP is administered as an emulsion in Montanide ISA 51. Patients receive a single course of temozolomide to induce lymphopenia, tetanus/diphtheria toxoid site preconditioning, then vaccines administered intradermally every two weeks for 3 doses, then monthly. RESULTS: To date, 17 patients have been enrolled. Diagnoses include medulloblastoma (n=1), glioblastoma (n=9), anaplastic oligodendroglioma (n=2), anaplastic astrocytoma (n=2), and malignant glioma NOS (n=3). Mean number of prior treatment regimens is 4.9 (range 1C12). Mean age is 22yo (range 6C35) and 41% of patients are male. The median KPS is 80. The median number of vaccines given at time of analysis is 3.3 (range 1C12). There have been no  3 Grade toxicities related to the vaccine. One patient developed nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and tachycardia after vaccination and had elevated inflammatory cytokines consistent with cytokine release syndrome. Median PFS is 2.5 months (95% CI: 0.8, not estimable) and median OS is 6.5 months (95% CI 1.8, not estimable). Interim analysis of immune monitoring bloodwork and perfusion MRI to quantify responses to PEP-CMV has been delayed due to COVID-19. However, adults with GBM who received PEP-CMV (NCT02864368) had significant (p0.05) increases in GCSF, GM-CSF, IFN-, IL-10, IL-2, IL-8, MIP1-, and TNF- levels.

The main route of human-to-human transmission is through contact with infectious secretions from the respiratory tract. Clinical manifestations vary from mild non-specific symptoms to life-threatening conditions. Since WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020, it has affected many medical, legal, social and economic aspects of everyday life in countries around the world. In this article, the authors present a summary of recommendations for taking care of otorhinolaryngology patients in outpatient settings and the legal basis referring to a risk of infection in doctor's office. In the selection of articles, the authors used English- and Polish-language online medical databases, typing the following keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, otolaryngology, endoscopy, personal protective equipment, and legal responsibility of the physician. The mucosa of the upper respiratory tract is a potential site of virus replication. The specificity of an ear, nose and throat (ENT) examination and a direct patient-doctor contact favor the transmission of the infection. The authors discussed the elements of self-protection of medical personnel and the legal aspects a risk of the patient contracting the infection in the otolaryngology office. In the case of a direct contact with the patient, the following medical personal protective equipment is required: a cap, a mask with an FFP-2 filter, goggles, an apron and gloves. If, during the visit, exposure to secretions or aerosol from the respiratory tract is expected, the personnel should additionally wear a visor and a waterproof apron. The patient's visit in the clinic should be preceded by telemedicine consultation. Patients should be screened prior to having a direct contact with a physician, using a short patient questionnaire. The questionnaire may consist of simple questions about the characteristic symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and exposure to a sick person in the past 14 days. The question of staying in the areas of a high infection risk appears of little importance in view of the whole of Poland being perceived as constituting such an area. Due to the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, new procedures for providing medical services have been introduced.

METHODSClinical data of pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 in the designated hospitals of mainland China were retrieved up to April 12, 2020 through an epidemic reporting system maintained at the National Health Commission of the Peoples Republic China. Each pregnant patient was randomly matched to a nonpregnant woman with confirmed COVID-19 in the same hospital as control, then their clinical courses were formally compared. RESULTS138 pregnant women had been identified as confirmed COVID-19 cases. Among them, 17 severe cases and 1 maternal death were recorded, which was less than their nonpregnant peers (23 severe cases and 3 death). 57.2% had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the third trimester, including 13 severe cases and 1 maternal death. 7.3% of pregnant patients had diarrhea and 3.6% had nausea or vomiting, compared with related proportion as 15.2% (OR: 0.38, 95%CI: 0.15, 0.96) and 10.1% (OR: 0.25, 95%CI: 0.07, 0.89) in nonpregnant patients. Pregnant patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in early pregnancy presented similar laboratory tests with their nonpregnant peers, however, with pregnancy progresses, increased inflammation, coagulation and hepatic injury markers happened more and more frequently (p<0.001) in pregnant patients.

Qualitative student feedback to a teaching unit was collected and triangulated with data from focus groups with tutors. Results were thematically analyzed. Willingness and resistance to cultural competency and safety teaching emerged as two key themes. Willingness to engage with the unit was largely due to student interest in the content, teaching environment and relevance of cultural competency to students future practice. Resistance was linked to the students feeling personally attacked, or culturally confronted, with tutors noting the topics around sexuality and white privilege being more resisted. Acknowledging reasons for student resistance and developing strategies to reduce resistance can facilitate more student engagement with cultural competency topics, ultimately leading to their future provision of culturally competent healthcare.","output":"Exploring Tertiary Health Science Student Willingness or Resistance to Cultural Competency and Safety Pedagogy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, over 200 vaccine candidates against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) are under development and currently moving forward at an unparalleled speed.

However, despite the long history of visiting restrictions in health care systems, little is known about their effects. OBJECTIVES: This review sought to explore the consequences of visitor restrictions in health care services during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A systematic, integrative review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, based on a systematic search in PubMed, CHINAL full plus, Web of Science, PsychInfo, Scopus and the Cochrane Library. RESULTS: A total of 17 scientific papers covering intensive care, pediatric care, general medical care, hospital care, palliative care and nursing home settings were included. Although appreciation for the technical solutions enabling remote meetings was reported, visiting restrictions had several consequences, mainly negative, for the patient's health, the health and wellbeing of family members and the provision of care. Among physical health consequences, reduced nutrition intake, decreased activities of daily living and increased physical pain and symptoms were reported. Among mental health consequences for the patient, loneliness, depressive symptoms, agitation, aggression, reduced cognitive ability and overall dissatisfaction were observed. For family members, worry, anxiety and uncertainty occurred, and they reported an increased need for information from care providers. Family members of neonatal intensive care unit patients reported less bonding with their child and family relation disturbances due to the restrictions. For care providers, visiting restrictions added the burdens of ethical dilemmas, learning new technical means to enable social interaction and an increased demand for communication with families and providing social support to both family members and patients. CONCLUSIONS: When implementing visiting restrictions in health care services, decision makers and nurses need to be aware of their potential negative effects and adapt the provision of care to compensate for such effects. Nurses in all sectors should be aware that visiting restrictions may affect patients, families, and health care services for longer than the actual pandemic. Since the level of evidence regarding effect from visiting restrictions is low, further studies is strongly needed.","output":"Consequences of visiting restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic: An integrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Navigating the rapidly growing body of scientific literature on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is challenging, and ongoing critical appraisal of this output is essential. We aimed to summarize and critically appraise systematic reviews of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in humans that were available at the beginning of the pandemic. METHODS: Nine databases (Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Sciences, PDQ-Evidence, WHO's Global Research, LILACS, and Epistemonikos) were searched from December 1, 2019, to March 24, 2020. Systematic reviews analyzing primary studies of COVID-19 were included. Two authors independently undertook screening, selection, extraction (data on clinical symptoms, prevalence, pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, diagnostic test assessment, laboratory, and radiological findings), and quality assessment (AMSTAR 2). A meta-analysis was performed of the prevalence of clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Eighteen systematic reviews were included; one was empty (did not identify any relevant study). Using AMSTAR 2, confidence in the results of all 18 reviews was rated as \\"critically low\\". Identified symptoms of COVID-19 were (range values of point estimates): fever (82-95%), cough with or without sputum (58-72%), dyspnea (26-59%), myalgia or muscle fatigue (29-51%), sore throat (10-13%), headache (8-12%) and gastrointestinal complaints (5-9%). Severe symptoms were more common in men. Elevated C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase, and slightly elevated aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, were commonly described. Thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of procalcitonin and cardiac troponin I were associated with severe disease. A frequent finding on chest imaging was uni- or bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity. A single review investigated the impact of medication (chloroquine) but found no verifiable clinical data. All-cause mortality ranged from 0.3 to 13.9%. CONCLUSIONS: In this overview of systematic reviews, we analyzed evidence from the first 18 systematic reviews that were published after the emergence of COVID-19. However, confidence in the results of all reviews was \\"critically low\\". Thus, systematic reviews that were published early on in the pandemic were of questionable usefulness.

These symptoms and signs are poorly characterised but may be associated with significant morbidity. We sought to synthesise the evidence on their incidence to guide future research, policy and practice. Methods We searched Medline and Embase for longitudinal cohort studies from January 2020 to July 2021 that investigated adults with long COVID at least four weeks after acute infection. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for cohort studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed with subgroup analysis by follow-up time (4-12 vs more than 12 weeks). Results 19 studies were included, 13 of which included patients hospitalised with COVID-19. The total sample size was 10 643 and the follow-up time ranged from 30 to 340 days. Risk of bias was assessed as high in one study, moderate in two studies and low in the remaining 16 studies. The most common symptoms and signs seen at any time point in long COVID were fatigue (37%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 23-55), dyspnoea (21%; 95% CI = 14-30), olfactory dysfunction (17%; 95% CI = 9-29), myalgia (12%; 95% CI = 5-25), cough (11%; 95% CI = 6-20) and gustatory dysfunction (10%; 95% CI = 7-17). High heterogeneity was seen for all meta-analyses and the presence of some funnel plot asymmetry may indicate reporting bias. No effect of follow-up time was found for any symptom or sign included in the subgroup analysis. Conclusions We have summarised evidence from longitudinal cohort studies on the most common symptoms and signs associated with long COVID. High heterogeneity seen in the meta-analysis means pooled incidence estimates should be interpreted with caution.

The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes of home-NIV in hypercapnic patients with COPD who had been set-up at our centre using remote-monitoring and iVAPS-autoEPAP NIV mode (Lumis device, ResMed). METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a data set of 46 patients with COPD who commenced remote-monitored home-NIV (AirView, ResMed) between February 2017 and January 2018. Events including time to readmission or death at 12 months were compared with a retrospectively identified cohort of 27 patients with hypercapnic COPD who had not been referred for consideration of home-NIV. RESULTS: The median time to readmission or death was significantly prolonged in patients who commenced home-NIV (median 160 days, 95% CI 69.38 to 250.63) versus the comparison cohort (66 days, 95% CI 21.9 to 110.1; p<0.01).

It now has a much greater reliance on triaging, e-consultations, remote consultations, online meetings and less home visits. Re-evaluating the nature and value of learning medicine in primary care has therefore become a priority. METHOD: 70 final-year medical students placed in 38 GP practices (primary care centres) across the East of England undertook a 5-week clerkship during November 2020. A sample of 10 students and 11 supervising general practitioners from 16 different GP practices were interviewed following the placement. Qualitative analysis was conducted to determine their perceptions regarding the nature and value of learning medicine in primary care now compared with prior to the pandemic. RESULTS: A variety of models of implementing supervised student consultations were identified. Although contact with patients was felt to be less than pre-pandemic placements, triaging systems appeared to have increased the educational value of each individual student-patient contact. Remote consultations were essential to achieving adequate case-mix and they conferred specific educational benefits. However, depending on how they were supervised, they could have the potential to decrease students' level of responsibility for patient care.

In the absence of a vaccine, or an approved effective therapeutic, there is an intense interest in repositioning available drugs or designing small molecule antivirals. In this context, in silico modelling has proven to be an invaluable tool. An important target is the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), involved in processing translated viral proteins. Peptidomimetic &#945;-ketoamides represent prototypical inhibitors of Mpro. A recent attempt at designing a compound with enhanced pharmacokinetic properties has resulted in the synthesis and evaluation of the &#945;-ketoamide 13b analogue. Here, we performed molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to further characterize the interaction of &#945;-ketoamide 13b with the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We included the widely used antibiotic, amoxicillin, for comparison. Our findings indicate that &#945;-ketoamide 13b binds more tightly (predicted GlideScore = -8.7 and -9.2a?kcal/mol for protomers A and B, respectively), to the protease active site compared to amoxicillin (-5.0 and -4.8a?kcal/mol).

This study aimed to evaluate the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreading patterns in the SC state through March 2020 to April 2021 using genomic surveillance. During this period, 23 distinct variants, including two VOCs (Beta and Gamma) were identified, among which, the Gamma and related lineages were predominant in the second pandemic wave within SC. However, a regionalization of P.1-like-II in the Western region was observed, concomitant to the increase in cases, mortality, and case fatality rate (CFR) index. This is the first evidence of the regionalization of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission and highlights the importance of tracking variants, dispersion and their impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the public health system in Brazilian states.","output":"The emergence of two distinct SARS-CoV-2 Gamma related variants during the second wave of COVID-19 in Santa Catarina, Southern Brazil and the rapid spread of P.1-like-II SARS-CoV-2 variant transmission and a regionalization in the Western region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Reports on COVID-19 from the Spanish Health Ministry are valuable, but incomplete, with the perverse effect that the susceptibility to COVID-19 by sex is unclear.

COVID-19 posed challenges in terms of analgesia choice for reductions and altered follow-up arrangements. This study aimed to assess variance from the care pathway. METHOD: We performed a retrospective case note analysis of all emergency presentations with acute traumatic anterior shoulder dislocations at the MTC in Bristol from 01/04/2019-31/05/2019 to the same period in 2020 to analyse the effects of COVID-19 on management of these injuries. RESULTS: We identified 32 patients in 2019, and 24 in 2020. Entonox usage fell, in favour of Penthrox. Use of conscious sedation (requiring full PPE) remained around 20%. Pre- and post-reduction imaging was near 100% throughout. Referral to follow-up was 88% in 2019 but 38% in 2020. Those assessed in clinic during COVID-19, fewer were mobilised early or referred to outpatient physiotherapy compared to 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Acute management of anterior shoulder dislocations during COVID-19 was challenged by choice of suitable analgesia that limits AGPs, and limiting access to face-to-face follow-up. A key concern was a significant decrease in patient follow-up, thus limiting the access to optimal aftercare such as physiotherapy and further imaging.","output":"197 Acute Management of Traumatic Anterior Shoulder Dislocations During COVID-19: Are We Meeting Published National Standards for Treatment During the Pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microfluidics is an emerging technology that can be employed as a powerful tool for designing lipid nano-microsized structures for biological applications.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this case series, 14 eyes of 14 deceased patients with COVID-19 were enucleated during autopsy. RB and ONB were subjected to molecular detection of viral RNA, virus cultivation and immunohistochemistry. SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads were compared with RNA loads in the respective throat swabs, vitreous humour and blood samples. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 7/14 RBs and in 10/13 ONBs. While virus isolation failed and immunohistochemistry of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was negative, subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) was detectable (40% RB; 60% ONB). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detectable in RB and ONB of patients with COVID-19. Presence of sgRNA could point to a SARS-CoV-2 infection of neuronal tissue, but as virus isolation failed and immunohistochemistry of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was negative, an active infection seems unlikely.","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic and subgenomic RNA in retina and optic nerve of patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lockdown was crucial to stop the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, but it affected many aspects of social life, among which traditional live science caf&eacute;s Moreover, citizens and experts asked for a direct contact, not relying on mass-media communication In this paper, we describe how the Florence and Rome science caf&eacute;s, contacted by citizens and experts, either directly or through the Florence science shop, responded to these needs by organizing online versions of traditional face-to-face events, experiencing high levels of participation The science caf&eacute;methodology was also requested by a high school that needed to conclude an engagement experience with students and their families We also report the results of a survey about the satisfaction of this new methodology with respect to the old one","output":"Science Cafs, Science Shops and the Lockdown Experience in Florence and Rome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Lockdown and restricted mobility due to the pandemic of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has severely affected the continuity of healthcare of patients with acute and chronic diseases. We evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on the adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD), symptom control, and quality of life (QOL) in patients with celiac disease (CeD). METHODS: A questionnaire, consisting of both ad-hoc and validated questions, was created after review of literature, group discussions, and expert meetings. Standardized questionnaires namely CeD adherence test (CDAT), celiac symptom index score, and CeD-related QOL were used. The web-based questionnaire was sent to 3130 patients via social media and 452 responses (14.4%) were received. Also, additional 68 patients (not available on any social media application) were interviewed telephonically by a trained dietitian. RESULTS: Overall, 505 patients (females: 318; mean age: 24.114.2 years) were included. While only 6.7% (n = 34) had poor compliance to GFD (CDAT > 17) before COVID-19 pandemic, it almost doubled to 12.6% (n = 64) during the COVID-19 pandemic times (p = 0.02). Furthermore, 4.9% (n = 25) of patients were diagnosed contacting COVID-19. Interestingly, 73.2% (n = 370) patients preferred online appointment than physical appointment. Most common difficulties faced during lockdown period were high delivery charges for getting gluten-free (GF) food at home (54.4%), increased prices of regular GF food (43.1%), and travelling long distance to arrange GF food (44.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially affected the adherence, symptom control, and QOL in patients with CeD, attributable to unavailability, shortage of money, and heightened cost of GF food. The pandemic has offered an opportunity to practice teleconsultation approach for patients with CeD.

Diagnosis of the viral species affecting habanero productivity in Benin is limited, and understanding this will enable more efficient host resistance breeding. During 2019 and 2020, we characterized the incidence and severity of the viral diseases infecting nine promising habanero breeding lines and one commercial hybrid check under open field conditions in Benin. The horticultural performance, including yield and yield component traits of the entries, was determined during the 2 years of the experiment. A randomized complete block design was used with three replications, each with 24 plants. Data were recorded on days to 50% flowering and 50% fruit maturity, yield and on the yield components of fruit weight (g), fruit length (cm), and fruit width (mm), as well as disease incidence and severity. In total, 35 leaf samples were collected for viral diagnosis among habanero breeding lines. We found that Pepper veinal mottle virus (PVMV;Potyvirus) was the overwhelmingly predominant virus in our trials, with an 80% incidence;however, we found frequent coinfection of PVMV with Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV, Cucumovirus), Polerovirus, and, to a lesser extent, Chili veinal mottle virus (ChiVMV;Potyvirus). The mean disease incidence across all entries was 60%. AVPP1932 and PBC 2010 had the lowest disease incidence (35% and 43%, respectively), whereas AVPP1929 had the highest (86%) disease incidence. The F1 hybrid check Afadja had the overall highest yield, with 30 tha-1, followed by AVPP1932, with 19 tha-1, both in 2019. There was a negative correlation between disease incidence and total yield (r 5 20.44;P < 0.001), supporting previous studies indicating that viral diseases are major production constraints for habanero in West Africa.

However, patient preferences, privacy concerns, lack of regulations or over-regulation, and insufficient evidence on the efficacy of these methods may have hampered the potential positive benefits of using such tools to manage NCDs. OBJECTIVE: The current paper aims to discuss the output of an Advisory Board of patient and caregiver associations; specifically, to present their view on the role of digital health tools during and after the COVID- 19 pandemic for managing NCD patients, and identify future directions from the patients' perspectives. METHODS: As an initiative under the NCD Partnership model of Upjohn, a virtual Advisory Board with patient and caregiver advocates was held on July 28th 2020 to bring together key stakeholders from the public and private sector. RESULTS: Several key themes emerged: 1) technology developers should understand that the goals of patients may differ from HCPs and other stakeholders' perspectives; 2) patients, HCPs, caregivers, and other end users need to be involved in the development of digital health tools in the earliest phase possible to guarantee usability, efficacy, and adoption; 3) tools must be better tailored for people with complex conditions such as multimorbidity, older age, and cognitive or sensory impairment; 4) some patients do not want (or are unable) to utilize digital healthcare tools, so adequate alternatives should always be available. CONCLUSIONS: There was consensus that public-private partnership models such as the Upjohn NCD Partnership, can be effective models to foster innovation by synthetizing multiple perspectives, including patients, in the design, development, and implementation of digital (and non-digital) health tools, with the main overall objective of improving the life of NCD patients.","output":"Digital Health Tools for the Management of Non-communicable Diseases during and after the Covid-19 Pandemic: Perspectives of Patients and Caregivers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the COVID-19 lockdown, a new normal was established, involving a hybrid lifestyle that combined face-to-face with virtual activity. We investigated, in a case-control study, the impact of the new normal on daily sleep and eating routines, compared with pre-pandemic conditions. To do this, we propose using social and eating jet lag as markers of the regularity in daily routines. Additionally, we studied whether the new normal had an impact on the body mass index (BMI), diet quality, and other health-related variables. This study included 71 subjects in the pre-pandemic group, and 68 in the new normal group (20C30 years). For all participants, we evaluated social and eating jet lag, BMI, diet and sleep quality, eating behaviors, physical activity, and well-being. General linear models were used to compare outcome variables between pre-pandemic and new normal groups. The results revealed that the new normal was associated with greater regularity in daily sleep and eating routines (?0.7 h of social jet lag (95% CI: ?1.0, ?0.4), and ?0.3 h of eating jet lag (95% CI: ?0.5, ?0.1)), longer sleep duration on weekdays (1.8 h (95% CI: 1.5, 2.2)), and lower sleep debt (?1.3 h (95% CI: ?1.7, ?0.9)). Regarding BMI and other health-related variables, we observed that these variables were similar between new normal and pre-pandemic groups. These findings indicate that the new normal had a positive impact on daily sleep and eating routines.

The requirement of patients on dialysis for regular treatment in settings typically not conducive to social distancing may increase their vulnerability to COVID-19. METHODS: Over a 6-week period, we recorded new COVID-19 infections and outcomes for all adult patients receiving dialysis in a large dialysis center. Rapidly introduced control measures included a two-stage routine screening process at dialysis entry (temperature and symptom check, with possible cases segregated within the unit and tested for SARS-CoV-2), isolated dialysis in a separate unit for patients with infection, and universal precautions that included masks for dialysis nursing staff. RESULTS: Of 1530 patients (median age 66 years; 58.2% men) receiving dialysis, 300 (19.6%) developed COVID-19 infection, creating a large demand for isolated outpatient dialysis and inpatient beds. An analysis that included 1219 patients attending satellite dialysis clinics found that older age was a risk factor for infection. COVID-19 infection was substantially more likely to occur among patients on in-center dialysis compared with those dialyzing at home. We observed clustering in specific units and on specific shifts, with possible implications for aspects of service design, and high rates of nursing staff illness. A predictive epidemic model estimated a reproduction number of 2.2; cumulative cases deviated favorably from the model from the fourth week, suggesting that the implemented measures controlled transmission.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the feasibility of young adults performing the following tasks daily: wearing a UV dosimeter, receiving text messages and real-time UV-B doses on their smartphone, and responding to daily web-based surveys about sunburn and sun protection. METHODS: Young adults aged 18-39 years (n=42) were recruited in the United States in June 2020 via social media. Participants received the UV Guard sun protection system, which consisted of a UV dosimeter and a smartphone app. During 3 consecutive periods, intervention intensity increased as follows: real-time UV-B dose; UV-B dose and daily behavioral facilitation text messages; and UV-B dose, goal setting, and daily text messages to support self-efficacy and self-regulation. Data were self-reported through daily web-based surveys for 28 days, and UV-B doses were transmitted to cloud-based storage.

In July and August, the face was the most commonly sunburned area among 13 body locations; 52% (22/42) of sunburns occurred before the study and 45% (19/42) occurred during the study. The mean daily UV-B dose decreased during the 3 periods; however, this was not statistically significant. Young adults were most often exercising outdoors from 2 to 6 PM, walking from 10 AM to 6 PM, and relaxing from noon to 2 PM. Sunburn was most often experienced during exercise (odds ratio [OR] 5.65, 95% CI 1.60-6.10) and relaxation (OR 3.69, 95% CI 1.03-4.67) relative to those that did not exercise or relax in each category. The self-reported exit survey indicated that participants felt that they spent less time outdoors this summer compared to the last summer because of the COVID-19 pandemic and work. In addition, 38% (16/42) of the participants changed their use of sun protection based on their app-reported UV exposure, and 48% (20/42) shifted the time they went outside to periods with less-intense UV exposure. A total of 79% (33/42) of the participants were willing to continue using the UV Guard system outside of a research setting. CONCLUSIONS: In this proof-of-concept research, young adults demonstrated that they used the UV Guard system; however, optimization was needed. Although some sun protection behaviors changed, sunburn was not prevented in all participants, especially during outdoor exercise.

Humidity sensing is a promising way to establish a relationship between human respiration and electrical signal. This paper presents a polyimide-based film bulk acoustic resonator (PI-FBAR) humidity sensor operating in resonant frequency and reflection coefficient S(11) dual-parameter with high sensitivity and stability, and it is applied in real-time human respiration monitoring for the first time. Both these two parameters can be used to sense different breathing conditions, such as normal breathing and deep breathing, and breathing with different rates such as normal breathing, slow breathing, apnea, and fast breathing. Experimental results also indicate that the proposed humidity sensor has potential applications in predicting the fitness of individual and in the medical field for detecting body fluids loss and daily water intake warning. The respiratory rates measured by our proposed PI-FBAR humidity sensor operating in frequency mode and S(11) mode have Pearson correlation of up to 0.975 and 0.982 with that measured by the clinical monitor, respectively. BlandCAltman method analysis results further revealed that both S(11) and frequency response are in good agreement with clinical monitor.

Vaccine uptake in this vulnerable population is important to reduce the burden of COVID-19 on healthcare services and society. To prevent vaccine hesitancy and maximise compliance, we need to better understand individuals views on the vaccine. We aimed to explore perspectives of people with stroke/TIA on the COVID-19 vaccine and influences on its uptake. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional, electronic open survey comprising multiple choice and free text questions. Convenience sampling was used to recruit people who have experienced a stroke and/or TIA, and were residents in the UK or Ireland. Results: The survey was completed by 377 stroke/TIA survivors. 87% (328/377) had either received the first vaccine or were booked to have it. The vaccine was declined by 2% (7/377) and 3% (11/377) had been offered the vaccine but not yet taken it up. 8% (30/377) had not been offered the vaccine despite being eligible.Many people expressed concerns around the safety of the vaccine (particularly risk of blood clots and stroke) and some were hesitant to have the second vaccine. Most people had no difficulty accessing the vaccine appointment. Societal and personal benefits were motivations for vaccine uptake. There was uncertainty and lack of information about risk of COVID-19 related complications specifically for people who had a stroke/TIA. Conclusion: For people with stroke and TIA, confidence in the vaccines safety is the overriding behavioural influence on vaccine uptake. Despite high uptake of the first vaccine, many have legitimate concerns and information needs that should be addressed. Our findings can be used to identify targets for behaviour change to improve vaccine uptake specific to stroke/TIA patients, in particular, increase trust in the vaccines safety (confidence) and improve understanding of the greater risks of complications from contracting COVID-19 (complacency).","output":"Stroke and TIA Survivors Perceptions of The COVID-19 Vaccine: Cross Sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is growing recognition of the serious consequences of sarcopenia on the functionality and autonomy in old age. Recently, the age-related changes in several inflammatory mediators have been implicated in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia. The purposes of this systematic review were two-fold: (1) to describe the patterns of muscle strength loss with age in the general population, and (2) to quantify the loss of muscle strength in rheumatoid arthritis as representative for an underlying inflammatory state. Handgrip strength was used as a proxy for overall muscle strength. RESULTS: Results from 114 studies (involving 90,520 subjects) and 71 studies (involving 10,529 subjects) were combined in a meta-analysis for the general and rheumatoid arthritis population respectively and standardized at an equal sex distribution. For the general population we showed that between the ages of 25 years and 95 years mean handgrip strength declined from 45.5 kg to 23.2 kg for males and from 27.1 kg to 12.8 kg for females. We noted a steeper handgrip strength decline after 50 years of age (rate of 0.37 kg/year). In the rheumatoid arthritis population handgrip strength was not associated with chronological age between the ages of 35 years and 65 years and was as low as 20.2 kg in male and 15.1 in female. Rheumatoid arthritis disease duration was inversely associated with handgrip strength. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows distinct patterns of age-related decrease of handgrip strength in the general population. Handgrip strength is strongly associated with the presence and duration of an inflammatory state as rheumatoid arthritis. The putative link between age-related inflammation and sarcopenia mandates further study as it represents a potential target for intervention to maintain functional independence in old age.","output":"Patterns of muscle strength loss with age in the general population and patients with a chronic inflammatory state"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Forecasting models for intensive care occupancy of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are important in the current pandemic for strategic planning of patient allocation and avoidance of regional overcrowding They are often trained entirely on retrospective infection and occupancy data, which can cause forecast uncertainty to grow exponentially with the forecast horizon METHODOLOGY: We propose an alternative modeling approach in which the model is created largely independent of the occupancy data being simulated The distribution of bed occupancies for patient cohorts is calculated directly from occupancy data from \\"sentinel clinics\\" By coupling with infection scenarios, the prediction error is constrained by the error of the infection dynamics scenarios The model allows systematic simulation of arbitrary infection scenarios, calculation of bed occupancy corridors, and sensitivity analyses with respect to protective measures RESULTS: The model was based on hospital data and by adjusting only two parameters of data in the Aachen city region and Germany as a whole Using the example of the simulation of the respective bed occupancy rates for Germany as a whole, the loading model for the calculation of occupancy corridors is demonstrated The occupancy corridors form barriers for bed occupancy in the event that infection rates do not exceed specific thresholds In addition, lockdown scenarios are simulated based on retrospective events DISCUSSION: Our model demonstrates that a significant reduction in forecast uncertainty in occupancy forecasts is possible by selectively combining data from different sources It allows arbitrary combination with infection dynamics models and scenarios, and thus can be used both for load forecasting and for sensitivity analyses for expected novel spreading and lockdown scenarios","output":"[Nationwide exposure model for COVID-19 intensive care unit admission]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This paper aims to focus on the influences of the COVID-19 pandemic on business-to-business (B2B) firms relationship initiation and customer relationship management in an under-explored and unique context of high-tech industrial microenterprises. The authors analyze the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in the specific context of B2B relationship initiation and customer relationship management dynamics by examining Finnish B2B industrial microenterprises. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses exploratory in-depth case studies undertaken in three Finnish industrial microenterprises to analyze the influences of the COVID-19 pandemic on their new business relationship initiation and relationship management with the current customers. Findings: The case firms quickly adjusted to the new normal and used a number of technological resources, including online meetings and three-dimensional demonstrations, among others. A key reason for this quick adjustment was them being microenterprises. However, despite this, lack of access to customer sites remained a hindrance as their products need to fit certain production processes, which cannot be done without physical visits. Furthermore, the development of trust with new customers, especially those based in emerging markets, was challenging due to the lack of physical meetings and site visits. Research limitations/implications: The research highlights the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to B2B relationships and gives an account of the changing dynamics of relationship initiation and customer relationship management amid technological and societal disruptions. It also highlights the continued role of personal relationships and psychical meetings in such relationships. As such, the research informs B2B research that examines the role of personal relationships in B2B marketing. Practical implications: The study offers industrial microenterprise executives insights into how to face and tackle COVID-19 driven challenges in B2B customer relationship management and how to integrate technological tools in relationship management practices while understanding where face-to-face meetings are indispensable. Originality/value: The study demonstrates areas in which virtual tools can and cannot be substitutes for conventional means of B2B relationship initiation and customer relationship management across developed and emerging markets. It also highlights the specificities of industrial microenterprises and their business development and customer relationship management dynamics mechanisms, a research area that has been rather ignored by prior studies. ? 2021, Ahmad Arslan, Ismail Golgeci, Zaheer Khan, Petri Ahokangas and Lauri Haapanen.","output":"COVID-19 driven challenges in international B2B customer relationship management: empirical insights from Finnish high-tech industrial microenterprises"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the declaration of COVID-19 pandemic, several case reports of demyelination of both peripheral and central nervous systems have been published. The association between CNS demyelination and viral infection has long been documented, and this link was recently reported following SARS-CoV-2 infection as well. OBJECTIVES: In this systematic review, we aim to investigate the existing literature on CNS demyelination associated with SARS-CoV-2, and the proposed pathophysiological mechanisms. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of articles in PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, Cochrane, Google Scholar and Ovid databases, from 1 January 2020 until June 15, 2021. The following keywords were used: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, demyelination, demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and transverse myelitis. RESULTS: A total of 60 articles were included in the final analysis of this systematic review and included 102 patients: 52 (51%) men and 50 (49%) women, with a median age of 46.5 years. The demyelination mimicked a variety of conditions with a picture of encephalitis/encephalomyelitis being the most common. At the same time other patterns were less frequently reported such as MS, NMOSD and even MOGAD. Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) was the most frequently reported pattern of spinal cord involvement. CONCLUSION: A growing body of literature has shown an association between SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection and the development of different types of CNS demyelination.

Universities are the most prominent publishers, and there are very few publications from the private sector, which can negatively impact the commercialisation of nanotechnology research. The top 10 most prolific researchers, author or co-author over 20% of the nanotechnology papers are reported. A mixture of old and new top researchers names suggests succession planning in the system as the years progress. The emergence of computer science as one of the top 20 subjects publishing in nanotech in 2019 and a high level of researcher collaboration suggests possible convergence of nanotech, information technology and artificial intelligence in South Africa. The strategic socio-economic-focused nanotechnology research areas identified for South Africa include material science, photoluminance and optics, medicine, catalysis, electronics, energy, biotech, magnetism, sensors, water and communicable diseases. The top collaborating countries, top researchers, top institutions and nanotechnology economic hubs are reported for each strategic research area. The level of innovation was evaluated using the nanotechnology value chain, and there is a meagre 3.5% of papers reporting on nano-enabled products.","output":"A nanotechnology-foresight perspective of South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Applications of small-angle scattering (SAS) in structural biology have benefited from continuing developments in instrumentation, tools for data analysis, modeling capabilities, standards for data and model presentation, and data archiving.

However, the association between asthma and COVID-19 has not been well-established. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to determine the prevalence of asthma among COVID-19 patients in a major U.S. health system. We assessed the clinical characteristics and comorbidities in asthmatic and non-asthmatic COVID-19 patients. We also determined the risk of hospitalization associated with asthma and/or inhaled corticosteroid use. METHODS: Medical records of patients with COVID-19 were searched by a computer algorithm (March 1-April 15, 2020), and chart review was used to validate the diagnosis of asthma and medications prescribed for asthma. All patients were PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Demographics and clinical features were characterized. Regression models were used to assess the associations between asthma and corticosteroid use and the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 1,526 patients identified with COVID-19, 220 (14%) were classified as having asthma. Asthma was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (RR of 0.96 [95%CI: 0.77-1.19]) after adjusting for age, sex, gender, and comorbidities. The ongoing use of ICS did not increase the risk of hospitalization in a similar adjusted model (RR of 1.39 [95%CI: 0.90-2.15]). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a substantial prevalence of asthma in our COVID-19 cohort, asthma was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization. Similarly, the use of ICS with or without systemic corticosteroids was not associated with COVID-19-related hospitalization.","output":"Prevalence and characterization of asthma in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Organ transplant recipients may not mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 infection, and therefore may benefit greatly from passive immunization with anti-spike monoclonal antibodies (mAb), which have been shown to decrease hospitalization rates in the general outpatient population. We evaluated the efficacy of mAb therapy in decreasing hospitalizations or emergency room (ER) visits among kidney transplant recipients (KTR) with COVID-19. METHODS: We identified KTR with COVID-19 between 3/1/2020 and 4/30/2021. Patients were excluded if they had multiorgan transplant or hospital-acquired COVID-19. Data were analyzed by Cox regression with mAb administration as time-dependent variable, and the day of symptom onset as baseline. RESULTS: We studied 95 KTR; 20 received mAb. Comorbidities and immunosuppression were balanced between the two groups. mAb administration was associated with a significant decrease in hospitalizations or ER visits (15 vs. 76%, P< 0.001). This association remained significant after adjustment for confounders and by analyzing mAb administration as a time-dependent variable (Table: adj. HR 0.2, P=0.04). No KTR who received mAb died or required mechanical ventilation. Black or Hispanic KTR were less likely to receive mAb and more likely to be admitted to the hospital or visit the ER (Table). Table [Image: see text] Factors significantly associated with hospitalization or ER visit. CONCLUSION: In our KTR population, mAb therapy for COVID-19 may have helped decrease hospitalizations and ER visits. Healthcare inequities, including access to investigational treatments, were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Acknowledging the nonconcurrent control group as a limitation, we found a strong signal for benefit from mAb treatment. Antiviral mAb are a promising therapeutic modality for immunosuppressed patients.

Clinical characteristics, treatment options, and potential survival factors remain under investigation. This study aimed to fill this gap and provide clinically relevant factors associated with survival of elderly patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this multi-center study, elderly patients (age 65 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 4 Wuhan hospitals were included. The clinical end point was hospital discharge or deceased with last date of follow-up on Jul. 08, 2020. Clinical, demographic, and laboratory data were collected. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to analyze survival and risk factors. A metabolic flux analysis using a large-scale molecular model was applied to investigate the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 with regard to metabolism pathways. Results: A total of 223 elderly patients infected with COVID-19 were included, 91 (40.8%) were discharged and 132 (59.2%) deceased. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed in 140 (62.8%) patients, 23 (25.3%) of these patients survived. Multivariate analysis showed that potential risk factors for mortality were elevated D-Dimer (odds ratio: 1.13 [95% CI 1.04 - 1.22], p = 0.005), high immune-related metabolic index (6.42 [95% CI 2.66C15.48], p < 0.001), and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (1.08 [95% 1.03C1.13], p < 0.001). Elderly patients receiving interferon atmotherapy showed an increased probability of survival (0.29 [95% CI 0.17C0.51], p < 0.001). Based on these factors, an algorithm (AlgSurv) was developed to predict survival for elderly patients. The metabolic flux analysis showed that 12 metabolic pathways including phenylalanine (odds ratio: 28.27 [95% CI 10.56C75.72], p < 0.001), fatty acid (15.61 [95% CI 6.66C36.6], p < 0.001), and pyruvate (12.86 [95% CI 5.85C28.28], p < 0.001) showed a consistently lower flux in the survivors vs. the deceased subgroup.

At the same time, men already cohabiting with a partner leave their homes for dating purposes more frequently than single men and women. We interpret these findings in the sense that both individual and sex-specific differences in observed sociality could be a result of a fine-tuned adaptive populational response to a contemporary virus threat, predominantly rooted in the evolution of behavioral strategies in the reproductive and economic spheres of each sex.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of transitional care interventions with readmission rates and other outcomes for residents of LTCFs who are 65 years and older and LTCF staff and to explore factors that potentially mitigate the association. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature were searched for English-language studies published until July 21, 2021. Associated qualitative studies were identified using aspects of the CLUSTER (citations, lead authors, unpublished materials, searched Google Scholar, tracked theories, ancestry search for early examples, and follow-up of related projects) methodology. STUDY SELECTION: Controlled design studies evaluating transitional care interventions for residents of LTCFs 65 years and older were included. Records were independently screened by 2 reviewers; disagreements were resolved through discussion and involvement of a third reviewer. From 14 538 records identified, 15 quantitative and 4 qualitative studies met the eligibility criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Fixed-effect and random-effects models were used according to the number of studies reporting the outcomes of interest. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome consisted of 30-, 60-, and 90-day readmission rates (hospital and emergency department [ED]). Other outcomes included length of stay, functional independence (Barthel score), and quality of life. The I(2) statistic was used to quantify heterogeneity. RESULTS: Of 14 538 records identified from searches, 15 quantitative studies (totaling 32 722 participants or records) and 4 qualitative studies were included. People allocated to transitional care interventions were 1.7 times less likely to be readmitted to the hospital or ED compared with those in control groups (14 studies; odds ratio, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.18-2.35]; I(2) = 81% [95% CI, 70%-88%]).

People with schizophrenia show difficulty in discriminating completed shapes but the brain networks and functional connections underlying this perceptual difference remain poorly understood. Also unclear is whether similar neural differences arise in bipolar disorder or vary across the schizo-bipolar spectrum. To address these topics, we scanned (fMRI) people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or no psychiatric illness during rest and during a task in which they discriminated configurations that formed or failed to form completed shapes (illusory and fragmented condition, respectively). Illusory/fragmented task activation differences ('modulations'), resting-state functional connectivity, and multivariate pattern differences were identified on the cortical surface using 360 predefined parcels and 12 functional networks composed of such parcels. Brain activity flow mapping was used to evaluate the likely involvement of resting-state connections for shape completion. Dorsal attention network modulations distinguished people with schizophrenia (AUCs>.85) and could trans-diagnostically predict cognitive disorganization severity. Activity flow over functional connections from the dorsal attention network could predict secondary visual network modulations in each group, except among those with schizophrenia. Task modulations among patients were more heterogeneous and dispersed over a larger number of networks compared to controls. In summary, abnormal dorsal attention network activity emerges during perceptual organization in schizophrenia and may be related to improper attention-related feedback into secondary visual areas.

Ionophores have garnered interest as novel antimalarials due to their theorized ability to target unique systems found in the Plasmodium-infected erythrocyte. In this study, during the bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude extract of Streptomyces strain PR3, a group of cyclodepsipeptides, including valinomycin, and a novel class of cyclic ethers were identified and elucidated. Further study revealed that the ethers were cyclic polypropylene glycol (cPPG) oligomers that had leached into the bacterial culture from an extraction resin. Molecular dynamics analysis suggests that these ethers are able to bind cations such as K(+), NH(4)(+) and Na(+). Combination studies using the fixed ratio isobologram method revealed that the cPPGs synergistically improved the antiplasmodial activity of valinomycin and reduced its cytotoxicity in vitro. The IC(50) of valinomycin against P. falciparum NF54 improved by 4C5-fold when valinomycin was combined with the cPPGs. Precisely, it was improved from 3.75  0.77 ng/mL to 0.90  0.2 ng/mL and 0.75  0.08 ng/mL when dosed in the fixed ratios of 3:2 and 2:3 of valinomycin to cPPGs, respectively.

Previous studies revealed ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) exhibits Cd tolerance, and may be useful as a potential hyperaccumulator because of its wide distribution. In this study, the physiological and transcriptional responses of two ryegrass cultivars [i.e., high (LmHC) and low (LmLC) Cd tolerance] to Cd stress were investigated and compared. The Cd tolerance of LmHC was greater than that of LmLC at various Cd concentrations. The uptake of Evans blue dye revealed that Cd-induced root cell mortality was higher in LmLC than in LmHC after a 12-h Cd treatment. Furthermore, the content and influx rate of Cd in LmLC roots were greater than in LmHC roots under Cd stress conditions. The RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR data indicated that the Cd transport regulatory genes (ABCG37, ABCB4, NRAMP4, and HMA5) were differentially expressed between the LmLC and LmHC roots. This expression-level diversity may contribute to the differences in the Cd accumulation and translocation between LmLC and LmHC. These findings may help clarify the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying ryegrass responses to Cd toxicity.

METHODS: Comparative observational study using data collected from routine care at Hospital Universitario Cruces, Barakaldo, Bizkaia, Spain in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. We compared patients who received week-2-MP (125C250 mg/d x3) with those who did not, with the end-points time to death and time to death or endotracheal intubation. RESULTS: We included 242 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and elevated inflammatory markers at admission. Sixty-one patients (25%) received week-2-MP. Twenty-two patients (9%) died and 31 (12.8%) suffered death or intubation. The adjusted HRs for death and death or intubation for patients in the week-2-MP group were 0.35 (95%CI 0.11 to 1.06, p = 0.064) and 0.33 (95%CI 0.13 to 0.84, p = 0.020), respectively. These differences were specifically seen in the subcohort of patients with a SpO2/FiO2 at day 7 lower than 353 (adjusted HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.12, p = 0.073 and HR 0.34, 95%CI 0.12 to 0.94, p = 0.038, respectively) but not in patients with higher SpO2/FiO2. Patients receiving out-of-week-2-MP, non-pulse glucocorticoids or no glucocorticoids had an increased adjusted risk for both outcomes compared with week-2-MP group: HR 5.04 (95% CI 0.91C27.86), HR 10.09 (95% CI 2.14C47.50), HR 4.14 (95% CI 0.81C21.23), respectively, for death; HR 7.38 (95% CI 1.86C29.29), HR 13.71 (95% CI 3.76C50.07), HR 3.58 (95% CI 0.89C14.32), respectively, for death or intubation.

A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of severe pneumonia and has rapidly spread through many nations, crashing health systems and leading a large number of people to death. In Brazil, the emergence of local epidemics in major metropolitan areas has always been a concern. In a vast and heterogeneous country, with regional disparities and climate diversity, several factors can modulate the dynamics of COVID-19. What should be the scenario for inner Brazil, and what can we do to control infection transmission in each of these locations? Here, a mathematical model is proposed to simulate disease transmission among individuals in several scenarios, differing by abiotic factors, social-economic factors, and effectiveness of mitigation strategies. The disease control relies on keeping all individuals social distancing and detecting, followed by isolating, infected ones. The model reinforces social distancing as the most efficient method to control disease transmission. Moreover, it also shows that improving the detection and isolation of infected individuals can loosen this mitigation strategy. Finally, the effectiveness of control may be different across the country, and understanding it can help set up public health strategies.","output":"Addressing the COVID-19 transmission in inner Brazil by a mathematical model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It remains unclear whether COVID-19 is associated with psychiatric symptoms during or after the acute illness phase. Being affected by the disease exposes the individual to an uncertain prognosis and a state of quarantine. These factors can predispose individuals to the development of mental symptoms during or after the acute phase of the disease. There is a need for prospective studies assessing psychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 patients in the post-infection period. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 tests were collected at patients' homes under the supervision of trained healthcare personnel. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were classified as mild cases (N = 895) at treatment intake were further assessed for the presence of psychiatric symptoms (on average, 56.6 days after the intake). We investigated the association between the number of COVID-19 symptoms at intake and depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms approximately two months later, adjusting for previous mental health status, time between baseline and outcome, and other confounders. Multivariate logistic regression and generalized linear models were employed for categorical and continuous outcomes, respectively. RESULTS: A clinically significant level of depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms were reported by 26.2% (N = 235), 22.4% (N = 201), and 17.3% (N = 155) of the sample. Reporting an increased number of COVID-related symptoms was associated with the presence of clinically significant levels of depressive (aOR = 1.059;95%CI = 1.002C1.119), anxiety (aOR = 1.072;95%CI = 1.012C1.134), and post-traumatic stress (aOR = 1.092;95%CI = 1.024C1.166) symptoms. Sensitivity analyses supported findings for both continuous and categorical measures. CONCLUSION: Exposure to an increased number of COVID-19 symptoms may be associated with depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms after the acute phase of the disease. These patients should be monitored for the development of psychiatric symptoms after COVID-19 treatment discharge. Early interventions, such as brief interventions of psychoeducation on coping strategies, could benefit these individuals.","output":"Post-infection depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms: A prospective cohort study in patients with mild COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"De novo therapeutic design is challenged by a vast chemical repertoire and multiple constraints such as high broad-spectrum potency and low toxicity.

We aimed to develop a murine model to mimic this complex scenario to allow for further testing of various implants. METHODS Thirty-six female CL57BL/6J mice underwent implantation of a 0.7  0.7 cm polyester mesh in the dorsal subcutaneous position. Wounds were closed and inoculated with 100 L containing 1  104 CFU of GFP-labeled MSSA. After 2 weeks, the infected mesh was removed and the cavity was copiously irrigated with saline. Mice were split into four groups: with three groups receiving new polyester, polypropylene, and porcine mesh and remaining as non-mesh controls. Mice were survived for another 2 weeks and underwent necropsy. Gross infection was evaluated at 2 and 4 weeks. Tissue homogenization and direct plating to recover GFP MSSA was completed at 4 weeks. RESULTS At 2 weeks, all mice were noted to have gross mesh infection. One animal died due to overwhelming infection and wound breakdown. At 4 weeks, 5/6 (83 %) control mice who did not have a second mesh implantation had full clearance of their wounds. In contrast, 9/10 (90 %) mice with re-implantation of polypropylene were noted to have pus and recovery of GFP MSSA on plating. This was also observed in 100 % of mice with polyester and porcine mesh.

Those with poor quality speckle-tracking echocardiography (na?=a?2) or a known LV ejection fraction of <50% (na?=a?4) were excluded. Patients with an absolute value basal longitudinal strain of <13.9% (2 standard deviations below normal) were designated as cases (na?=a?39); those with a basal longitudinal strain of &#8805;13.9% were designated as controls (na?=a?36). Demographics and clinical variables were compared. Of 75 included patients (mean age 62  14 years, 41% women), 52% had reduced basal strain.

The dieless nature of this process makes it ideal at low volumes; however, several drawbacks of the process currently inhibit its widespread use in industry, including difficult-to-predict springback and poor surface finish. Another perceived drawback of SPIF is overall low formability. Conventional toolpaths form the blank through a series of successive passes in which the tool is generally constrained to the XY plane. Here a novel toolpath is proposed and tested experimentally and through simulation to determine its viability of improving formability.

According to the descriptive statistics analysis and presented data employed, it is clear that services trade is undervalued;services represent the majority of value added in the EU's GDP but less than half of foreign trade;domestic value added in the service sector is higher than in manufacturing, which indicates the importance of domestic resources in the creation and export of services. EU industries are highly serviced and, interestingly, services contribute to more than 30 per cent of manufacturing production, with a higher share of foreign services.","output":"Services in Global Value Chains - an Insight into the Current Situation in the Eu Member States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mononuclear phagocytes are a widely distributed family of cells contributing to innate and adaptive immunity.

Cellular senescence promotes chronic inflammation, named as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). We investigated whether COVID-19 disease is associated with cellular senescence and SASP. METHODS: Autopsy lung tissue samples from 11 COVID-19 patients and 43 age-matched non-COVID controls with similar comorbidities were analysed by immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2, markers of senescence and key SASP cytokines. Virally-induced senescence was functionally recapitulated in vitro, by infecting epithelial Vero-E6 cells and a three-dimensional alveosphere system of alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells with SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was detected by immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy predominantly in AT2 cells. Infected AT2 cells expressed the angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) and exhibited increased senescence (p16(INK4A) and SenTraGor(TM) positivity) and IL-1 and IL-6 expression. In vitro, infection of Vero-E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2 induced senescence (SenTraGor(TM)), DNA damage (-H2AX) and increased cytokine (IL-1, IL-6, CXCL8) and Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing (APOBEC) enzyme expression. Next-generation-sequencing analysis of progenies obtained from infected/senescent Vero-E6 cells demonstrated APOBEC-mediated SARS-CoV-2 mutations. Dissemination of the SARS-CoV-2-infection and senescence was confirmed in extra-pulmonary sites (kidney and liver) of a COVID-19 patient. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that in severe COVID-19, AT2 cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 exhibit senescence and a proinflammatory phenotype. In vitro, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces senescence and inflammation. Importantly, infected senescent cells may act as a source of SARS-CoV-2 mutagenesis mediated by APOBEC enzymes. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2-induced senescence may be an important molecular mechanism of severe COVID-19, disease persistence and mutagenesis.","output":"Pulmonary infection by SARS-CoV-2 induces senescence accompanied by an inflammatory phenotype in severe COVID-19: possible implications for viral mutagenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seafood has important health benefits, and the growing demand for aquatic products has stimulated rapid trade development. Using 2000C2018 data from the UN Comtrade Database, this study first introduced the export scale, product structure, and market distribution of Chinas aquatic products. Then, using an extended constant market share model, we investigated the factors affecting fluctuations in Chinas aquatic product exports to the USA, Japan, South Korea, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the European Union (EU). Import demand was found to be the most important factor affecting Chinas aquatic product exports. Moreover, Chinas export structure and market distribution for aquatic products have become increasingly consistent with global demand. In recent years, Chinas aquatic product competitiveness has declined while its market destinations have diversified. Regarding Chinas aquatic product types, the main focus has been on labor- and resource-intensive products with low competitiveness. More recently, however, Chinas competitiveness of product types 0371 and 0372 (Standard International Trade Classification) has been improving in the world market. To further develop Chinas aquatic product exports, policy should aim to maintain the fisheries ecosystem, encourage seafood operators to adopt good practices, increase investment in science and technology, overcome technical barriers to trade, strengthen research on the needs, preferences, and requirements of major importing countries, expand domestic demand, and strengthen international cooperation.","output":"Factors affecting fluctuations in Chinas aquatic product exports to Japan, the USA, South Korea, Southeast Asia, and the EU"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare symptoms day by day for non-hospitalised individuals tested positive and negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

As an effective treatment with few side effects, music therapy has been used to reduce anxiety for decades in clinical practice. Yet therapists continue to perform music selection, a key step in music therapy, manually. Considering the growing need for music therapy services and social distancing amid public emergencies, an automatic method for music selection would be of great practical utility. This paper marks the first effort to identify music with therapeutic effects on anxiety reduction via a novel music scoring model. We formulate the calculation of a therapeutic score as a quadratic programming problem, which minimizes score variance among known therapeutic songs while maintaining their superiority over other songs. The proposed model can uncover common features that contribute to anxiety reduction by learning from small and unbalanced data. Using a music therapy experiment, we find that the proposed model outperforms existing techniques in predicting therapeutic songs. Feature analysis is also conducted, revealing that high-frequency spectrums are important in therapeutic scoring.","output":"Finding therapeutic music for anxiety using scoring model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Last decade witnessed the outbreak of many life-threatening human pathogens including Nipah, Ebola, Chikungunya, Zika, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and more recently novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2). The disease condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century. The continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics.

There have been concerns regarding potential bias in pulse oximetry measurements for people with dark skin. We aimed to assess the effects of skin pigmentation on the accuracy of oxygen saturation measurement by pulse oximetry (SpO2) compared with the gold standard SaO2 measured by CO-oximetry. Methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and EBSCO CINAHL Plus (up to December 2021), as well as ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (up to August 2021). We identified studies comparing SpO2 values in any population, in any care setting, using any type of pulse oximeter, with SaO2 by standard CO-oximetry; and measuring the impact of skin pigmentation or ethnicity on pulse oximetry accuracy. We performed meta-analyses for mean bias (the primary outcome in this review) and its standard deviations (SDs) across studies included for each subgroup of level of skin pigmentation and ethnicity. We calculated accuracy root-mean-square (Arms) and 95% limits of agreement based on pooled mean bias and pooled SDs for each subgroup. Results We included 32 studies (6505 participants); 27/32 (84.38%) in hospitals and none in people's homes. Findings of 14/32 studies (43.75%) were judged, via QUADAS-2, at high overall risk of bias. Fifteen studies measured skin pigmentation and 22 referred only to ethnicity. Compared with standard SaO2 measurement, pulse oximetry probably overestimates oxygen saturation in people with dark skin (pooled mean bias 1.11%; 95% confidence interval 0.29% to 1.93%) and people described as Black/African American (pooled mean bias 1.52%; 0.95% to 2.09%) (moderate- and low-certainty evidence). These results suggest that, for people with dark skin, pulse oximetry may overestimate blood oxygen saturation by around 1% on average compared with SaO2. The bias of pulse oximetry measurements for people with other levels of skin pigmentation, or those from the White/Caucasian group is more uncertain. The data do not suggest overestimation in people from other ethnic groups such as those described as Asian, Hispanic, or mixed ethnicity (pooled mean bias 0.31%, 0.09% to 0.54%), but this evidence is low certainty. Whilst the extent of mean bias is small or negligible for all the subgroups of population evaluated, the associated imprecision is unacceptably large (with the pooled SDs > 1%). Nevertheless, when the extents of measurement bias and precision are considered jointly in Arms, pulse oximetry measurements for all the subgroups appear acceptably accurate (with Arms < 4%). Conclusions Low-certainty evidence suggests that pulse oximetry may overestimate oxygen saturation in people with dark skin and people whose ethnicity is reported as Black/African American, compared with SaO2, although the overestimation may be quite small in hospital settings. The clinical importance of any overestimation will depend on the particular clinical circumstance. Pulse oximetry measurements appear accurate but imprecise for all levels of skin pigmentation. The evidence relates to clinician-measured oximetry in health care environments and may not be reflected in home pulse oximetry where other factors may also influence accuracy.","output":"The effects of skin pigmentation on the accuracy of pulse oximetry in measuring oxygen saturation: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the advent of SARS-CoV-2 in Dec. 2019, the global endeavor to identify the pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19 has been ongoing.

CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Urethral diverticulum (UD) is uncommon and requires a relatively high level of suspicion, particularly in women with symptoms of atypical voiding. The widely-known classic symptoms involve the 'three Ds': post-void dribbling, dyspareunia, and dysuria. For radiological modalities, the transvaginal and transperineal ultrasound (US), Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), and cystoscopic examinations should be conducted to establish the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Urethral Diverticulum (UD) should always be considered in cases of urethral discharge and intravaginal mass.

Then hybrid models were introduced by combining the clusters with seven different classification algorithms individually and then evaluations were performed using ensembles. The proposed research was evaluated on two different benchmark telecom data sets obtained from GitHub and Bigml platforms. The analysis of results indicated that the proposed model attained the highest prediction accuracy of 94.7% on the GitHub dataset and 92.43% on the Bigml dataset.

Percutaneous nephrostomy tube drainage as a treatment for severe hemorrhagic cystitis has rarely been investigated. We examined children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for risk factors associated with severe hemorrhagic cystitis, as well as our experience with percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement as an adjunctive management strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Using prospectively collected data from the Blood and Marrow Transplant Database at the University of Minnesota, we reviewed 40 pediatric patients with severe hemorrhagic cystitis from 1996 to 2010. Specific treatment for each patient was administered at the discretion of the attending physician and generally included bladder irrigation before bladder fulguration or percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement. A percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed in 11 patients due to the intractable nature of the hemorrhagic cystitis. RESULTS Of the 11 patients who underwent percutaneous nephrostomy tube drainage 5 (45%) had improvement of the hemorrhagic cystitis within 30 days and the same number had long-term resolution. Among the patients with long-term resolution hemorrhagic cystitis resolved an average of 12.4 days after percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement, and the tubes were removed an average of 8.8 weeks after placement. Through September 2011 mortality among patients with percutaneous nephrostomy tubes was 55% (6 of 11 patients), which was identical to the overall mortality in the severe hemorrhagic cystitis group (22 of 40). No death could be directly attributed to hemorrhagic cystitis or percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement. CONCLUSIONS Placement of percutaneous nephrostomy tubes for treatment of severe hemorrhagic cystitis results in long-term improvement in intractable hemorrhagic cystitis, and is a safe and viable option for the majority of patients.","output":"Intractable hemorrhagic cystitis after hematopoietic stem cell tranplantation--is there a role for early urinary diversion in children?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) represents an ubiquitin-like protein (Ubl), which in a process termed ISGylation can be covalently linked to target substrates via a cascade of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. Furthermore, ISG15 exerts functions in its free form both, as an intracellular and as a secreted protein. In agreement with its role as a type I IFN effector, most functions of ISG15 and ISGylation are linked to the anti-pathogenic response. However, also key roles in other cellular processes such as protein translation, cytoskeleton dynamics, exosome secretion, autophagy or genome stability and cancer were described. Ubiquitin-specific protease 18 (USP18) constitutes the major ISG15 specific protease which counteracts ISG15 conjugation. Remarkably, USP18 also functions as a critical negative regulator of the IFN response irrespective of its enzymatic activity. Concordantly, lack of USP18 function causes fatal interferonopathies in humans and mice. The negative regulatory function of USP18 in IFN signaling is regulated by various proteinCprotein interactions and its stability is controlled via proteasomal degradation. The broad repertoire of physiological functions and regulation of ISG15 and USP18 offers a variety of potential intervention strategies which might be of therapeutic use. Due to the high mutation rates of pathogens which are often species specific and constantly give rise to a variety of immune evasion mechanisms, immune effector systems are under constant evolutionarily pressure. Therefore, it is not surprising that considerable differences in ISG15 with respect to function and sequence exist even among closely related species. Hence, it is essential to thoroughly evaluate the translational potential of results obtained in model organisms especially for therapeutic strategies. This review covers existing and conceptual assay systems to target and identify modulators of ISG15, ISGylation, USP18 function, and proteinCprotein interactions within this context.

The gold standard for diagnosis of OSA, polysomnogram (PSG), cannot anatomically localize obstruction. Precise identification of obstruction has potential to improve outcomes following surgery. Current diagnostic modalities that provide this information require anesthesia, involve ionizing radiation or disrupt sleep. To mitigate these problems, we conceived that ultrasound (US) technology may be adapted (i) to detect, quantify and localize airway obstruction and (ii) for translational application to home-based testing for OSA. Materials and Methods Segmental airway collapse was induced in 4 fresh cadavers by application of negative pressure. Following visualization of airway obstruction, a rotary US probe was used to acquire transcervical images of the airway before and after induction of obstruction. These images (n=800) were analyzed offline using image processing algorithms. Results Our results show that the non-obstructed airway consistently demonstrated the presence of a US air-tissue interface. Importantly, automated detection of the air-tissue interface strongly correlated with manual measurements. The algorithm correctly detected an air-tissue interface in 90% of the US images while incorrectly detecting it in 20% (area under the curve=0.91). Conclusion The non-invasive detection of airway obstruction using US represents a major step in expanding OSA diagnostics beyond PSG.

METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the Cochrane Handbook and preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, SciELO, and LILACS were searched until June 23, 2020. Observational studies that evaluated the frequency of epilepsy in children diagnosed with CZS according to international criteria were included in the study. RESULTS Fourteen studies evaluating 903 patients diagnosed with CZS were pooled in a meta-analysis. All studies were conducted in Brazil, with reports published between 2016 and 2020, and included children diagnosed with CSZ from 0 to 40 months of age. The overall rate of epilepsy in children diagnosed with CZS was estimated at 60% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51-0.68). The studies included in this review show that the frequency of epilepsy in patients with CSZ varies with age, with higher rates in older children. Epileptic spasms was the primary type of seizure observed in this group, followed by focal and generalized crisis. The response rate to anti-epileptic drugs was considerably low, ranging from 20% of seizure control in the first year and 30% in the second year. SIGNIFICANCE Children with CZS presented a high cumulative incidence of epilepsy episodes with increased severity and a low response to anti-epileptic therapy, which is associated with the extensive damage caused by the Zika virus on the cortical structures of patients.","output":"Epilepsy in children with Congenital Zika Syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Qatar experienced a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic that disproportionately affected the craft and manual worker (CMW) population who comprise 60% of the total population. This study aimed to assess ever and/or current infection prevalence in this population. METHODS: A cross-sectional population-based survey was conducted during July 26-September 09, 2020 to assess both anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity through serological testing and current infection positivity through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Associations with antibody and PCR positivity were identified through regression analyses. RESULTS: Study included 2,641 participants, 69.3% of whom were <40 years of age. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 55.3% (95% CI: 53.3-57.3%) and was significantly associated with nationality, geographic location, educational attainment, occupation, and previous infection diagnosis. PCR positivity was 11.3% (95% CI: 9.9-12.8%) and was significantly associated with nationality, geographic location, occupation, contact with an infected person, and reporting two or more symptoms. Infection positivity (antibody and/or PCR positive) was 60.6% (95% CI: 58.6-62.5%). The proportion of antibody-positive CMWs that had a prior SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was 9.3% (95% CI: 7.9-11.0%). Only seven infections were ever severe and one was ever criticalan infection severity rate of 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2-1.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Six in every 10 CMWs have been infected, suggestive of reaching the herd immunity threshold.

During the ribosomal frameshift event, the gag open reading frame is shifted -1 nt to allow in-phase reading of the pol open reading frame. A consensus frameshift signal sequence of GGGAAAC within the gag-pol overlap region of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) has been identified followed by a sequence that has the potential for a pseudoknot tertiary structure. Using recombinant baculoviruses in which the frameshift occurs efficiently, the consensus sequence has been shown to be the site of the frameshift event. A mutation creating a termination codon just downstream of the putative frameshift signal sequence but upstream of the potential pseudoknot structure made a shorter gag product, but did not affect the efficiency of frameshifting. A mutation creating a termination codon just upstream of the putative frameshift signal made a shorter product and essentially abrogated frameshifting. Mutations in the first stem or the second stem in the potential pseudoknot structure severely reduced the frameshifting efficiency. Mutations which altered the length between the frameshift signal and the pseudoknot structure (the so-called spacer region) also reduced the frameshift efficiency. The insertion of a palindromic sequence, which could form a hairpin structure just upstream of the frameshift signal sequence, also affected the frameshifting. These results support the view that the ribosomal frameshift event in the FIV gag-pol region involves the identified signal sequence and appears to require the precisely positioned downstream sequence and indicated pseudoknot structure for efficient frameshifting.","output":"Identification and analysis of the gag-pol ribosomal frameshift site of feline immunodeficiency virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the global COVID-19 pandemic affected Sri Lanka similar to how it affected other countries across the globe.

MG is a digital learning activity that supports pupils in achieving multiplication competence and provides teacher a dashboard to assess and watch own pupils performance. The game enriched with gamification elements to engage and motivate participants. Three versions of the game were used by pupils: without any Open Learner Modeling (OLM) support (i.e. without providing access to own progress data), with OLM support and with Open Social Learner Modeling (OSLM) support, to investigate the difference in motivation among these characteristics. After using the MG for a 2-month period, pupils answered a questionnaire anonymously to express their opinion about MG mechanics, MG aesthetics and intrinsic motivation MG can offer. Furthermore, the corresponding teachers were interviewed to provide insights on their attitude towards MG and its functionalities. A statistically significant difference in Intrinsic Motivation (IM) between the three different MG versions was found and a statistically significant difference in MG Aesthetics and Mechanics between the different grades of primary school. Additionally, Intrinsic Motivation was positively correlated with gamification motivators and MG Aesthetics. Participating teachers stated that MG can improve pupils multiplication competence and it is worthy of a stable place in the instructional procedure, as it is a means of pupils progress tracking and (self-) assessment, as well as a fun way of practicing and developing multiplication skills.","output":"Effect of OSLM features and gamification motivators on motivation in DGBL: pupils' viewpoint"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We previously reported the development of a neutralization assay system for evaluating Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) neutralizing antibody (NAb) using pseudotyped-JEV (JEV-PV).

Although women's agency and creative negotiation of structural forces offered possibilities for increased choices, their routine coping strategies ultimately posed as sources of risks. Women's socio-legal position constrained their choices, and this highlights how structural vulnerability is embodied as everyday survival strategies that shape exposure to harm and poor health.

However, in sub-Saharan Africa, a low prevalence and mortality have been observed so far. METHODS: We collected data on individuals' social contacts in the South West Shewa Zone (SWSZ) of Ethiopia across geographical contexts characterized by heterogeneous population density, work and travel opportunities, and access to primary care. We assessed how socio-demographic factors and observed mixing patterns can influence the COVID-19 disease burden, by simulating SARS-CoV-2 transmission in remote settlements, rural villages, and urban neighborhoods, under school closure mandate. RESULTS: From national surveillance data, we estimated a net reproduction number of 1.62 (95% CI 1.55-1.70). We found that, at the end of an epidemic mitigated by school closure alone, 10-15% of the population residing in the SWSZ would have been symptomatic and 0.3-0.4% of the population would require mechanical ventilation and/or possibly result in a fatal outcome. Higher infection attack rates are expected in more urbanized areas, but the highest incidence of critical disease is expected in remote subsistence farming settlements. School closure contributed to reduce the reproduction number by 49% and the attack rate of infections by 28-34%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the relatively low burden of COVID-19 in Ethiopia observed so far may depend on social mixing patterns, underlying demography, and the enacted school closures. Our findings highlight that socio-demographic factors can also determine marked heterogeneities across different geographical contexts within the same region, and they contribute to understand why sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing a relatively lower attack rate of severe cases compared to high-income countries.","output":"Modeling the interplay between demography, social contact patterns, and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the South West Shewa Zone of Oromia Region, Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A world in turmoil caused by Covid-19 has revealed again what has long been true: the Federal Reserve is arguably the most powerful administrative agency in government, but neither administrative-law scholars nor the Fed itself treat it that way. In this Article, we present the first effort to map the contours of what administrative law should mean for the Fed, with particular attention to the processes the Fed should follow in determining and announcing legal interpretations and major policy changes. First, we synthesize literature from administrative law and social science to show the advantages that an agency like the Fed can glean from greater openness and transparency in its interpretations of law and in its long-term policymaking processes. These advantages fall into two categories: (1) sending more credible signals of future action and thereby shaping the behavior of regulated parties and other constituents, and (2) increasing the diversity of incoming information on which to base decisions, thereby improving their factual and predictive accuracy. Second, we apply this framework to two key areas monetary policy and emergency lending to show how the Fed can improve its policy signaling and input diversity in the areas of its authority that are most expansive. The result is a positive account of what the Fed already does as an administrative agency and a normative account of what it should do in order to preserve necessary policy flexibility without sacrificing the public demands for policy clarity and rigor.","output":"Towards an Administrative Law of Central Banking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the face of the rapid evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals on the frontline are in urgent need of frequent updates in the accomplishment of their practice.

One proposed strategy to increase hospital surge capacity is to restrict elective hospitalizations, yet the degree to which this measure would meet the anticipated is unknown. OBJECTIVES To compare the reduction in hospitalizations resulting from widespread nonurgent hospital admission restrictions during the Toronto severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak with the expected increase in admissions resulting from an influenza pandemic in Toronto. METHODS The authors compared the expected influenza-related hospitalizations in the first eight weeks of a mild, moderate, or severe pandemic with the actual reduction in the number of hospital admissions in Toronto, Ontario, during the first eight weeks of the SARS-related restrictions. RESULTS Influenza modeling for Toronto predicts that there will be 4,819, 8,032, or 11,245 influenza-related admissions in the first eight weeks of a mild, moderate, or severe pandemic, respectively. In the first eight weeks of SARS-related hospital admission restrictions, there were 3,654 fewer hospitalizations than expected in Toronto, representing a modest 12% decrease in the overall admission rate (a reduction of 1.40 admissions per 1,000 population). Therefore, influenza-related admissions could exceed the reduction in admissions resulting from restricted hospital utilization by 1,165 to 7,591 patient admissions, depending on pandemic severity, which corresponds to an excess of 0.44 to 2.91 influenza-related admissions per 1,000 population per eight weeks, and an increase of 4% to 25% in the overall number of admissions, when compared with nonpandemic conditions. CONCLUSIONS Pandemic modeling for Toronto suggests that influenza-related admissions would exceed the reduction in hospitalizations seen during SARS-related nonurgent hospital admission restrictions, even in a mild pandemic.

Although IRAK3 is known as a negative regulator of inflammation, several studies have reported opposing functions, and the temporal actions of IRAK3 on inflammation remain unclear. A systematic review and meta-analyses were performed to investigate IRAK3 expression and its effects on inflammatory markers (TNF- and IL-6) after one- or two-challenge interventions, which mimic the hyperinflammatory and immunosuppression phases of sepsis, respectively, using human or animal in vivo models. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analyses has been registered in the Open Science Framework (OSF) (Registration DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/V39UR). A systematic search was performed to identify in vivo studies reporting outcome measures of expression of IRAK3 and inflammatory markers. Meta-analyses were performed where sufficient data was available. RESULTS: The search identified 7778 studies for screening. After screening titles, abstracts and full texts, a total of 49 studies were included in the systematic review. The review identified significant increase of IRAK3 mRNA and protein expression at different times in humans compared to rodents following one-challenge, whereas the increases of IL-6 and TNF- protein expression in humans were similar to rodent in vivo models. Meta-analyses confirmed the inhibitory effect of IRAK3 on TNF- mRNA and protein expression after two challenges. CONCLUSIONS: A negative correlation between IRAK3 and TNF- expression in rodents following two challenges demonstrates the association of IRAK3 in the immunosuppression phase of sepsis. Species differences in underlying biology affect the translatability of immune responses of animal models to human, as shown by the dissimilarity in patterns of IRAK3 mRNA and protein expression between humans and rodents following one challenge that are further influenced by variations in experimental procedures.","output":"A systematic review and meta-analyses of interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 3 (IRAK3) action on inflammation in in vivo models for the study of sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused great disruption in education systems around the world.

To compensate for that, we examine a large set of qualitative interviews and media diaries collected in four eastern European countries during the first wave of the pandemic. We show that changes in news consumption-including the resurgence of television and decline of print consumption-were not driven solely by audience demand for up-to-date information, but also by practical constrains of home-bound life in lockdown, and the introduction of live briefings. Our findings underscore disruption and uncertainty as key elements of audience experiences and highlight the markedly privatized and depoliticized nature of public debate in the early phase of the pandemic. We argue that the pandemic was an unpredictable, open-ended, and exhausting media event with high potential for divisiveness and polarization, especially in contexts marked by low levels of media freedom, declining democratic standards, and elite-led politicization of the crisis.","output":"Audience Engagement with COVID-19 News: The Impact of Lockdown and Live Coverage, and the Role of Polarization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a highly suspicious case of COVID-19 infection, incidentally found on F-FDG PET/CT images.

Subjects were selected from among Iranian experts using purposeful and snowball sampling methods. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and were analyzed by the content analysis. RESULTS: Efficient and effective triage and priority-oriented triage were the main categories. These categories summarized a number of medical and nonmedical factors that should be considered in the prioritization of the victims in disaster triage. CONCLUSION: A combination of measures should be considered to maximize the benefits of the prioritization of causalities in disasters.

Although the common cold is a self-limited infection, there are no effective treatments presently available and complications, missed time from work and school, and overall discomfort are not insignificant. Understanding how infections are transmitted may lead to interventions to reduce rates of infection. In order to establish a route of transmission, certain conditions must be met. The virus must be produced and shed at the site of infection. The virus must be deposited in the environment and be able to survive there. The virus must then be able to reach the portal of entry. Finally, interruption of the proposed route of transmission must reduce the incidence of infection under natural conditions. Applying this framework, there is clear evidence in both experimental and home settings that colds can be transmitted via self-inoculation. A small amount of evidence is available relating to large and small particle aerosol transmission. Because rhinovirus is responsible for half of all colds, it has been used as the model to understand how virus is transmitted from one person to another in experimental settings. Rhinovirus has been shown to infect via self-inoculation following hand-to-hand contact with contaminated hands or hand-to-surface contact with contaminated objects in the environment. Similarly, there is convincing evidence that the self-inoculation method of cold virus transmission occurs in the home environment, where colds arre most often transmitted. Aerosol transmission has been studied in the experimental setting and may provide another, albeit less common method for transmission of rhinovirus infection. As more is understood about the transmission of cold viruses, effective methods to interrupt transmission may be devised.","output":"Transmission of colds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There are an abundance of commercially available lateral flow assays (LFAs) that detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Whilst these are usually evaluated by the manufacturer, externally performed diagnostic accuracy studies to assess performance are essential. Herein we present an evaluation of 12 LFAs. METHODS: Sera from 100 SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive participants were recruited through the FASTER study. A total of 105 pre-pandemic sera from participants with other infections were included as negative samples. RESULTS: At presentation sensitivity against RT-PCR ranged from 37.4-79% for IgM/IgG, 30.3-74% for IgG, and 21.2-67% for IgM. Sensitivity for IgM/IgG improved 21 days post symptom onset for 10/12 tests. Specificity ranged from 74.3-99.1% for IgM/IgG, 82.9-100% for IgG, and 75.2-98% for IgM.

The effects of those interventions on hospital use have not been systematically evaluated. The investigation could provide data-driven evidence to potentially improve the implementation of public health interventions in the future. OBJECTIVE: We aim to study two representative areas in the United States and one area in China (New York State, Ohio State, and Hubei Province), and investigate the effects of their public health interventions by time periods according to key interventions. METHODS: This observational study evaluated the numbers of infected, hospitalized, and death cases in New York and Ohio from March 16 through September 14, 2020, and Hubei from January 26 to March 31, 2020. We developed novel Bayesian generalized compartmental models. The clinical stages of COVID-19 were stratified in the models, and the effects of public health interventions were modeled through piecewise exponential functions. Time-dependent transmission rates and effective reproduction numbers were estimated. The associations of interventions and the numbers of required hospital and intensive care unit beds were studied. RESULTS: The interventions of social distancing, home confinement, and wearing masks significantly decreased (in a Bayesian sense) the case incidence and reduced the demand for beds in all areas. Ohio's transmission rates declined before the state's \\"stay at home\\" order, which provided evidence that early intervention is important. Wearing masks was significantly associated with reducing the transmission rates after reopening, when comparing New York and Ohio. The centralized quarantine intervention in Hubei played a significant role in further preventing and controlling the disease in that area. The estimated rates that cured patients become susceptible in all areas were small (<0.0001), which indicates that they have little chance to get the infection again.

The full genome sequence was determined within weeks of the first outbreak by the Canadian group with international collaboration. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), the continual lack of a rapid laboratory test to aid the early diagnosis of suspected cases of SARS makes this area a priority for future research. To prevent deaths in the future, early diagnosis and therapy of this infectious disease is of paramount importance. METHODS This review describes the specific molecular targets for diagnostics and therapeutics of viral infection. RESULTS The three major diagnostic methods available for SARS includes viral RNA detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), virus induced antibodies by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) or by enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) of nucleocapsid protein (NP). The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S1 region of the spike glycoprotein contains multiple conformational epitopes that induces highly potent neutralizing antibodies. The genetically engineered attenuated form of the virus or viral vector vaccine encoding for the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein has been shown to elicit protective immunity in vaccinated animals. CONCLUSION NP is the preferred target for routine detection of SARS-CoV infection by ELISA which is an economical method compared to other methods. The RBD of the spike glycoprotein is both a functional domain for cell receptor binding and also a major neutralizing determinant of SARS-CoV. The progress in evaluating a therapeutic or vaccine would depend on the avail ability of clinically relevant animal model.","output":"Molecular targets for diagnostics and therapeutics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The health crisis caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 disease has devastated the worldwide hospitality sector.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analysed the records of all 713 consecutive primary LRYGB patients operated in our centre from December 2007 until July 2012. Surgeon 1 and 3 had previous laparoscopic bariatric experience whilst Surgeon 2 and 4 had not. We stratified the data between the four surgeons with different levels of experience and in a chronology of 50 cases. RESULTS Sixty-seven (9.4 %) complications occurred in the study period. Surgeon 1 had more complications occurring within the first 50 cases than Surgeon 4 (10 versus 1, p < 0.05). There was no difference in complication rate between groups of 50 consecutive cases. None of the patients died. DOS decreased for every consecutive surgeon, irrespective of their experience. The learning curve defined by DOS was steepest for Surgeon 1, followed by Surgeon 2, 3 and 4.

A total of 283 patients (104 in the metformin and 179 in the no-metformin group) were included in this study. There were no significant differences between the two groups in gender, age, underlying diseases, clinical severity, and oxygen-support category at admission. The fasting blood glucose level of the metformin group was higher than that of the no-metformin group at admission and was under effective control in both groups after admission. Other laboratory parameters at admission and treatments after admission were not different between the two groups. The length of hospital stay did not differ between the two groups (21.0 days for metformin versus 19.5 days for no metformin, P = 0.74). However, in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in the metformin group (3/104 (2.9%) versus 22/179 (12.3%), P = 0.01). Antidiabetic treatment with metformin was associated with decreased mortality compared with diabetics not receiving metformin. This retrospective analysis suggests that metformin may offer benefits in patients with COVID-19 and that further study is indicated.","output":"Metformin Treatment Was Associated with Decreased Mortality in COVID-19 Patients with Diabetes in a Retrospective Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Labor pain is the worst pain that almost every woman experiences during childbirth. Labor pain management plays a crucial role in promoting maternal-wellbeing, contributing enormously to maternal satisfaction with the childbirth experience and the high quality of services. Although there have been previous studies, they have primarily been conducted at referral or general hospitals located in urban settings. Thus, this study aimed to assess the utilization of labor pain analgesia and associated factors among obstetric care providers at all levels of health facilities in central Ethiopia. METHODS: A multicenter institution-based cross-sectional study design was employed from 1 July to 30 September 2020. Simple random sampling using the lottery method was employed to select 399 obstetric care providers. The data were entered into Epi-data version 4.2 and analyzed using SPSS version 26. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were used to identify the associated factors. The adjusted odds ratio with its 95% confidence interval and p value ? 0.05 were used to identify associated factors. RESULTS: The overall utilization of obstetric analgesia was 46% (95% confidence interval: 41.2%C50.8%). Being a Midwife (adjusted odds ratio: 2.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.27C3.47), having heard of the World Health Organization pain ladder (adjusted odds ratio: 2.95, 95% confidence interval: 1.73C5.01), having favorable attitude (adjusted odds ratio: 1.89, 95% confidence interval: 1.17C3.05), the expectation of obstetric care providers about labor pain (adjusted odds ratio: 3.26, 95% confidence interval: 1.27C8.36), having training on labor pain management (adjusted odds ratio: 2.51, 95% confidence interval: 1.03C6.07), and presence of chance for preference of obstetric analgesia for mothers in the facility (adjusted odds ratio = 2.30, 95% confidence interval: 1.33C3.98) were identified as factors significantly associated with the practice of obstetric analgesia among obstetric care providers. CONCLUSION: The overall use of labor pain management methods among obstetric care providers is low. Professional category, provider attitude, labor pain severity expectations, and having training were found to be factors associated with the use of obstetric analgesia. Therefore, working on adapting and disseminating the harmonized guideline and protocols on labor pain management and provision of training for obstetric care providers on labor pain management techniques were recommended.","output":"Obstetric analgesia utilization in labor pain management and associated factors among obstetric care providers in the West Shewa Zone, Central Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the coronavirus has led to containment policies in many places, with concomitant shifts in routine activities.

However, little is known about the regulatory role of FTO in the expression of FASN and de novo lipogenesis through m6 A modification. In this study, we used FTO siRNA to explore the effects of FTO knockdown on hepatic lipogenesis and its underlying epigenetic mechanism in HepG2 cells. We found that knockdown of FTO increased m6 A levels in total RNA and enhanced the expression of YTH domain family member 2 (YTHDF2) which serves as the m6 A-binding protein. The de novo lipogenic enzymes and intracellular lipid content were significantly decreased under FTO knockdown. Mechanistically, knockdown of FTO dramatically enhanced m6 A levels in FASN mRNA, leading to the reduced expression of FASN mRNA through m6 A-mediated mRNA decay. The protein expressions of FASN along with acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) and ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) were further decreased, which inhibited de novo lipogenesis, thereby resulting in the deficiency of lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells and the induction of cellular apoptosis. The results reveal that FTO regulates hepatic lipogenesis via FTO-dependent m6 A demethylation in FASN mRNA and indicate the critical role of FTO-mediated lipid metabolism in the survival of HepG2 cells. This study provides novel insights into a unique RNA epigenetic mechanism by which FTO mediates hepatic lipid accumulation through m6 A modification and indicates that FTO could be a potential target for obesity-related diseases and cancer.

Forty-seven patients with VS (male:female = 18:29, mean age: 54.06  13.50 years) underwent the cochleovestibular function test (pure-tone audiometry, caloric test, video head impulse test (vHIT), cervical and ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potential, and posturography).

The tumor originated from the superior vestibular nerve (SVN group) in 21 patients, the inferior vestibular nerve (IVN group) in 26 patients, and an undetermined site in eight patients. The only value that differed significantly among the groups was the gain of the vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR) in the ipsilesional posterior canal (iPC) during the vHIT. Our results indicate that VOR gain in the iPC may be used to predict the nerve origin in patients with VS.

How such DSBs are resolved is still unknown, despite our previous report showing that Rad52 effects the short-range microhomology-mediated synapsis of intra-S region DSBs. Here we find that induction of IgD CSR downregulates Zfp318, and promotes Rad52 phosphorylation and recruitment to S and Ҧ, thereby leading to alternative end-joining (A-EJ)-mediated S-Ҧ recombination with extensive microhomologies, V(H)DJ(H)-Cs transcription and sustained IgD secretion. Rad52 ablation in mouse Rad52(?/?) B cells aborts IgD CSR in vitro and in vivo and dampens the specific IgD antibody response to OVA. Rad52 knockdown in human B cells also abrogates IgD CSR. Finally, Rad52 phosphorylation is associated with high levels of IgD CSR and anti-nuclear IgD autoantibodies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and in lupus-prone mice.

Postural tests (i.e., passive leg raising in the supine position or Trendelenburg maneuver in the prone position) combined with measurement of cardiac output are highly reliable to identify preload-dependence and may provide new insights into the mechanisms involved in hemodynamic instability related to CRRT (HIRRT). We aimed to assess the prevalence and risk factors of HIRRT associated with preload-dependence in ICU patients. We conducted a single-center prospective observational cohort study in ICU patients with acute kidney injury KDIGO 3, started on CRRT in the last 24 h, and monitored with a PiCCO? device. The primary endpoint was the rate of HIRRT episodes associated with preload-dependence during the first 7 days after inclusion. HIRRT was defined as the occurrence of a mean arterial pressure below 65 mmHg requiring therapeutic intervention. Preload-dependence was assessed by postural tests every 4 h, and during each HIRRT episode. Data are expressed in median [1st quartileC3rd quartile], unless stated otherwise. RESULTS: 42 patients (62% male, age 69 [59C77] year, SAPS-2 65 [49C76]) were included 6 [1C16] h after CRRT initiation and studied continuously for 121 [60C147] h. A median of 5 [3C8] HIRRT episodes occurred per patient, for a pooled total of 243 episodes. 131 episodes (54% [CI(95%) 48C60%]) were associated with preload-dependence, 108 (44%, [CI(95%) 38C51%]) without preload-dependence, and 4 were unclassified. Multivariate analysis (using variables collected prior to HIRRT) identified the following variables as risk factors for the occurrence of HIRRT associated with preload-dependence: preload-dependence before HIRRT [odds ratio (OR) = 3.82, p < 0.001], delay since last HIRRT episode > 8 h (OR = 0.56, p < 0.05), lactate (OR = 1.21 per 1-mmol L(?1) increase, p < 0.05), cardiac index (OR = 0.47 per 1-L min(?1) m(?2) increase, p < 0.001) and SOFA at ICU admission (OR = 0.91 per 1-point increase, p < 0.001). None of the CRRT settings was identified as risk factor for HIRRT. CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center study, HIRRT associated with preload-dependence was slightly more frequent than HIRRT without preload-dependence in ICU patients undergoing CRRT. Testing for preload-dependence could help avoiding unnecessary decrease of fluid removal in preload-independent HIRRT during CRRT.

Applying this anatomical repair concept to the treatment of other abdominal wall hernias, we developed an endoscopic totally extraperitoneal approach (TEA) to treat primary midline ventral hernias, including umbilical and epigastric hernias, in which for mesh placement, an anatomical space is developed between the peritoneum and the posterior rectus sheath in the ventral part of the abdominal wall (preperitoneal space). METHODS Between September 2017 and December 2019 according to the selection criterions, 28 consecutive primary midline ventral hernias were repaired using TEA. After extensive endoscopic development of the midline extraperitoneal plane, which was started in the suprasymphysic area, and reduction of the hernia sac, the hernia defect was closed and a large mesh was placed in the preperitoneal position to enforce the anterior abdominal wall. RESULTS All operations were successfully performed without conversion to open surgery. The mean operation time was 103.3 min (range 85-145 min). Patient-reported postoperative pain was qualitatively mild with a mean pain visual analogue scale score of 1.9 on postoperative day 1. The average hospital stay was 1.9 days (range 1-3 days). Three patients developed minor complications and were treated with no long-term adverse effects. Readmissions within 30 days or hernia recurrences were not observed with a mean follow-up period of 18 months (range 10-27 months). CONCLUSION In selected cases, TEA is a safe and feasible minimally invasive alternative in treating primary ventral hernias. This technique preserves the anatomical and physiological structure of the abdominal wall and may significantly reduce trauma and postoperative complications. Additionally, anti-adhesion-coated meshes and fixation tackers are not required, thus being cost-effective. Further studies are necessary to proof the true clinical efficacy in comparison to well-known alternative techniques.","output":"Endoscopic totally extraperitoneal approach (TEA) technique for primary ventral hernia repair."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The world's economies are on their knees following the negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic over the past 8 months Growing number of researches has been conducted on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on developed countries with little attention on developing countries, who are still grappling with the negative impact of the coronavirus The rationale for this study is to assess the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on Ghana's economy and government response to the pandemic as well as policy options to revive the ailing economy Design/methodology/approach: This study explored the socio-economic impact of the coronavirus on Ghana's economy using a discourse analysis with data from various secondary sources to analyze the impact of the pandemic from the Ghanaian perspective Findings: The findings from the discourse analysis revealed that the coronavirus pandemic has negatively impacted on the socio-economic situation of the citizens of Ghana Whiles an estimated 42,000 people lost their jobs in the first two months of the pandemic in Ghana, tourist attraction sector of the country alone lost $171 million dollars in the past three months due to the partial lockdown and closure of tourism and hospitality centers in the country The study revealed that Ghana's healthcare system has been overwhelmed by the number of increasing cases in the country to extent of making use of temporary structures as isolation and treatment centers of the pandemic The study revealed that Ghana may convert these challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic into prospects and opportunities by investing massively in the health sector and creating support for the SMEs which creates massive employment for many Ghanaians Research limitations/implications: This study focuses on the impact of the COVID-19 on Ghana's economy and how the pandemic has negatively affected the country The study is an exploratory study that makes use of secondary data However, conducting a study with primary data sources from specific communities or regions in the country may not produce the same results The results from the primary level or community level may be different from the general results obtained from the study In future it is expected that the study focuses specifically on the extent of the coronavirus pandemic on Ghana's fiscal deficit which seems to have ballooned in recent times Originality/value: The study is the first of its kind to extensively explore the socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Ghanaian economy The novelty of this paper is that it recognizes governments response to the pandemic and proposes three practical measures adopted to put the country's economy back on its feet through survive, revive and ensuring growth in all sectors of the economy ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"Socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on Ghana's economy: challenges and prospects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasing rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination coverage will result in more vaccine-related side effects, including acute myocarditis.

Medication non-adherence can blur drug efficacy results in clinical trials, lead to substantial financial losses, increase the risk of relapse and hospitalisation, or lead to death. The most common methods of measuring adherence are post-treatment measures; that is, adherence is usually measured after the treatment has begun. What the authors are proposing in this multidisciplinary study is a new technique for predicting the factors that are likely to cause non-adherence before or during medication treatment, illustrated in the context of potential non-adherence to COVID-19 antiviral medication. Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), allows system analysts to determine how combinations of simple faults of a system can propagate to cause a total system failure. Monte Carlo simulation is a mathematical algorithm that depends heavily on repeated random sampling to predict the behaviour of a system. In this study, the authors propose a new technique called Non-Adherence Tree Analysis (NATA), based on the FTA and Monte Carlo simulation techniques, to improve adherence. Firstly, the non-adherence factors of a medication treatment lifecycle are translated into what is referred to as a Non-Adherence Tree (NAT). Secondly, the NAT is coded into a format that is translated into the GoldSim software for performing dynamic system modelling and analysis using Monte Carlo. Finally, the GoldSim model is simulated and analysed to predict the behaviour of the NAT. NATA is dynamic and able to learn from emerging datasets to improve the accuracy of future predictions. It produces a framework for improving adherence by analysing social and non-social adherence barriers. Novel terminologies and mathematical expressions have been developed and applied to real-world scenarios. The results of the application of NATA using data from six previous studies in relation to antiviral medication demonstrate a predictive model which suggests that the biggest factor that could contribute to non-adherence to a COVID-19 antiviral treatment is a therapy-related factor (the side effects of the medication). This is closely followed by a condition-related factor (asymptomatic nature of the disease) then patient-related factors (forgetfulness and other causes). From the results, it appears that side effects, asymptomatic factors and forgetfulness contribute 32.44%, 22.67% and 18.22% respectively to discontinuation of medication treatment of COVID-19 antiviral medication treatment. With this information, clinicians can implement relevant interventions and measures and allocate resources appropriately to minimise non-adherence.","output":"Non-Adherence Tree Analysis (NATA)An adherence improvement framework: A COVID-19 case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: A recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurs in the worldwide.

Subsequently, we thoroughly reviewed the articles related to microbiota and miRNAs in COVID-19 to generate a comprehensive picture depicting the association between human microbiota and microRNAs in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. [RESULTS]: There exists strong experimental evidence suggesting that the composition and diversity of human microbiota are altered in COVID-19 patients, implicating a bidirectional association between the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 encoded miRNAs and host cellular microRNAs modulated by human microbiota can interfere with viral replication and regulate host gene expression involved in the initiation and progression of COVID-19. These findings suggest that the manipulation of human microbiota with probiotics may play a significant role against SARS-CoV-2 infection by enhancing the host immune system and lowering the inflammatory status.

Consequences of COVID-19 infection among women during early pregnancy remain unknown. We cannot conclude if pregnancy is a risk factor for more severe disease in women with COVID-19. Little is known about disease severity in neonates, and from very few samples, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 has not been documented in human milk. Links to websites of organizations with updated COVID-19 information are provided. Infographics summarize an approach to the pregnant woman or neonate with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

The pandemic caused anxiety and depression in individuals. However, there is insufficient information on the effects of COVID-19 on individuals and their coping methods. Therefore, mental problems associated with the pandemic need to be evaluated rapidly. AIMS: This study was carried out to determine depression levels and related factors in a society affected by COVID-19. METHOD: The study was planned using a descriptive cross-sectional design. The study started 2 weeks after the first diagnosis of COVID-19 in Turkey and was carried out between March 23 and April 3, 2020. The study included 1115 adult participants who were between 18 and 65 years of age and were citizens of the Turkish Republic. The study was carried out using online questionnaires, and data were collected with the Personal Information Form and the Beck Depression Inventory. The data were evaluated using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 20 software program. RESULTS: The depression scores of female participants who were between 18 and 29 years of age, single, students, and had less income than their expenses were found to be higher than others. People who experienced fear of being infected and infecting others, had a cleaning obsession, anxiety about the future, sadness, and anxiousness experienced depression at lower levels when compared to other participants. Participants who had to change their place of residence during the quarantine, experienced loneliness, fear of death, hopelessness, sleep problems, felt useless and worthless, started to smoke and drink alcohol, and experienced depression at moderate levels. Depression scores of those who spent time with their family, made time for themselves, were busy with home education or work were lower compared to others.

We wondered whether miR-30b could promote primary sensory neuron (PSN) axon growth in inhibitory microenvironment. The neurite growth was promoted by miR-30b agomir and inhibited by antagomir. MiR-30b targeted and degraded sema3A mRNA. MiR-30b regulated the formation of sema3A-NRP-1-PlexinA1 complex via targeting sema3A. The neurite length was induced by the miR-30b agomir, and the application of sema3A protein could reverse the effect of agomir. GTP-RhoA and ROCK expression were down-regulated by miR-30b. Neurite outgrowth that inhibited by sema3A and the miR-30b antagomir was increased by Y-27632. Agomir promoted neurite growth in NogoA inhibitory conditions, which indicated miR-30b could both enhance neuronal intrinsic regenerative ability and promote neurite growth against inhibitory microenvironment via Sema3A/NRP-1/PlexinA1/RhoA/ROCK axis. The agomir could also regulate Sema3A/NRP-1/PlexinA1/RhoA/ROCK axis in vivo and restore spinal cord sensory conductive function.

Local conditions may, however, differ from distant ones, and current conditions may poorly predict future conditions. This may be particularly true for early wet season conditions in tropical systems, as storms and associated rainfall events are generally not predictable at the scale of weeks or days and are heterogeneously distributed even at the scale of a few kilometres. How migratory animals cope with such challenges, and the consequences they may have, remain poorly known. We used time-to-event models based on GPS data from 19 African elephant herds from Hwange National Park (Zimbabwe) to study the effect of local and distant rainfall events on the elephants' decision to initiate their wet season migration. Elephants relied more on distant rainfall events occurring along the future migration route than on local events when initiating their migration. Such ability to use distant cues does not, however, ensure an immediate migration success. In over 30% of the cases, the elephants came back to their dry season range, sometimes after having travelled > 80% of the expected migration distance. This happened particularly when there was little additional rain falling during the migration. All elephants successfully migrated later in the season. Our study improves the understanding of the migratory ecology of elephants. More broadly, it raises questions about the reliability of rainfall as a migratory cue in tropical systems, and shed light on one of its potential consequences, the poorly quantified phenomenon of migration false starts.","output":"Cueing on distant conditions before migrating does not prevent false starts: a case study with African elephants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several important aspects related to SARS-CoV-2 transmission are not well known due to a lack of appropriate data.

Approaches to public health problems are best handled through collaborative processes, recognizing the critical importance of the local public health response. Nevertheless, this paper argues that a legislative back-up plan must be available to the federal government in the event that collaborative relationships break down. At the minimum, legislation should give the federal government the authority to have guaranteed access to surveillance data during a public health emergency. The legislation should also consider providing the federal government with the authority to devote the nation's resources to the management of an emergency at its earliest stages.

This study aims at exploring the role of tour operators in developing sustainable tourism in Pakistan and how the tour operators (TOs) conceive their role in this regard. TOs were reached through phone calls, emails, and virtual sources as face-to-face interviews were not possible due to COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions on travel by the government. In-depth interviews were conducted to gather data. Results suggest that the TOs although realize the importance of social, environmental, and economic dimensions of tourism on the communities but have no management systems in place to cater accordingly. There are no incentives in place by the government facilitate TOs to design and implement such systems. The TOs do not select a destination based on Global Sustainable Tourism Council criterion, but rather the selection of destination is mostly demand-based and profit-oriented. The study suggests that corporate profit motive is the sole criterion for decision making and is one of the major causes impeding sustainable tourism in Pakistan. The role of TOs in developing sustainable tourism is vague as the TOs do not have any systems in place to implement sustainable models. The study recommends that efforts need to be put in place to incentivize sustainable tourism in Pakistan and proper laws should be set forth by the authorities to comply by the TOs.

The antibody response in infected patients remains largely unknown, and the clinical value of antibody testing has not been fully demonstrated. METHODS: 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (na? =a? 535) collected during hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM, and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of antibodies with disease progress were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rates for Ab, IgM, and IgG were 93.1%, 82.7%, and 64.7%, respectively. The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might be due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness. The median seroconversion times for Ab, IgM, and then IgG were days 11, 12, and 4, respectively. The presence of antibodies wasa? <40% among patients within 1 week of onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM), and 79.8% (IgG) by day 15 after onset. In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day 7 to 45.5% (25/55) during days 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detection significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (Pa? <a? .001), even in the early phase of 1 week from onset (Pa? =a? .007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (Pa? =a? .006).

The questionnaire was validated using a testCretest reliability analysis. Kappa values  0.6 were accepted. SPSS software was used for data analysis and chi-square tests to compare subgroups. RESULTS: Total responses received were 279. The most reported actions to supplement missing referral information were to ask the patient or relative, examine the body region of concern and check medical records (73%, 70%, 67%, responded often/always, respectively). The actions when confronted with unjustified referrals were reported equally to consult the radiologist, referring clinician and radiographer (69C68% often/always responses). The hindering factors ranked high (agreed/strongly agreed responses) pertained to inadequate information in referral forms (83%), ineffective communication among healthcare professionals (79%), lack of training (70%) and allocated time (61%). Statistically significant associations were observed for a few actions and hindrances with education level, modality of practice and responsibility to screen imaging referrals.

The development of devices to specifically mitigate cross-contamination by droplet/splatter is crucial to stop infection transmission. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a perioral suction device (Oral BioFilter, OBF) to reduce biological contamination spread during dental procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients were randomized 1:1 to a standard professional dental hygiene treatment with OBF and without. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence assay was used to evaluate the spread of potential contaminants. The total number of relative light units (RLU) from key dental operatory locations: operator's face-shield, back of the surgical operator's-gloves, patient's safety-goggles, and instrumental table were measured. Percentage contamination reductions between control and OBF were compared. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Primary outcome, total RLU, was analyzed by comparing the means of logged data, using a two-sided two-sample t-test. Secondary outcomes as RLU of logged data for the different locations were analyzed in the same way. Proportion of patients from whom different locations reported events (clean, acceptable, and failure) were analyzed by using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: For the whole dental environment, RLUs reduction (<150 units) achieved with OBF was 98.4% (97.4-99%). By dental operatory location the reduction in RLUs was from 99.6%, on the operator face-shield, to 83% on instrumental table. The control group reported a very high percentage of failures, (>300) being 100% on the surfaces closer to the patient's mouth and decreasing to 70% on instrumental table. In contrast, the higher failure percentage in the OBF group was found on the patient's goggles (40%), while the operator face-shield showed an absence of contamination. CONCLUSION: OBF device has shown efficient reduction of biological aerosol cross-contamination during dental procedures as proved by ATP-bioluminescence assay.

METHODS: We reported 169 COVID-19 patients that were infected with the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 and hospitalized in Suzhou, China, from February to March 2022, with their demographic information, medical/immunization history, clinical symptom, and hematological profile. At the same time, patients with none/partial (one-dose), full (two-dose) and threeCdose vaccination were also compared to assess the vaccine effectiveness. FINDINGS: For the omicron COVID-19 patients included in this study, their median age was 33.0 [interquartile range (IQR): 24.0C45.5], 53.3% were male and the median duration from illness onset to hospitalization was 2 days. Hypertension, bronchitis, and diabetes were the leading comorbidities among patients. While the common clinical symptoms included cough, fever, expectoration, and fatigue, etc., asymptomatic patients took up a significant portion (46.7%). For hematological parameters, most values revealed the alleviated pathogenicity induced by the omicron variant infection. No critically ill or deceased patients due to COVID-19 infection were reported in this study. INTERPRETATION: Our results supported that the viremic effect of the omicron variant became milder than the previous circulating variants, while full vaccination or booster shot was greatly desired for an effective protection against clinical severity.","output":"Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 Patients Infected by the Omicron Variant of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: When the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic hit the UK, clinicians within Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust (a five-borough mental health trust) were faced with the challenge of rapidly switching to a novel way of assessing patients remotely. The idea for a QI project on trainees experience with remote consultations was conceived in April 2020. We present our February 2021 results here. We aimed to improve trainee confidence in conducting remote psychiatric assessments by at least 40%, to ensure effective and safe patient care during their 6 months placement. METHOD: Our discovery process included surveying trainees in April 2020 to explore experiences with remote psychiatric consultations, a literature search of current UK guidance and a local audit. The audit reviewed documentation of consent to remote consultations, with reference to standards as per NHS England remote consultation guidance. Key change ideas included publication of an article, Remote consultations C top tips for clinical practitioners, video-simulated remote consultations and a session on remote consultations in the trainee induction. In the first plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycle, we presented key findings from the article in a video presentation, which was sent trust-wide. We measured confidence in conducting remote assessments pre- and post-presentation via a feedback survey. Unfortunately, response rates were low and in the second PDSA cycle we targeted a smaller cohort of trainees at the August 2020 induction, although encountered similar difficulties. In the third PDSA cycle, we collected real-time data using an interactive app at the February 2021 trainee induction, and measured pre- and post- confidence following a presentation and a video-simulated remote consultation. RESULT: 2/34 respondents had accessed previous remote psychiatric consultation training and12/35 had some telepsychiatry experience. Pre-induction trainee confidence results revealed: extremely uncomfortable (16%), not confident (31%), neutral (47%), confident (6%) and very confident (0%) and post-induction confidence was 0%, 22%, 52%, 26% and 0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our project started during the first peak of the pandemic, which may be a reason for initial limited response rates. Our results suggest that the remote psychiatric consultation trainee induction session has shown some improvement in trainee confidence; the confident cohort improved from 6% to 26%. Our next steps include collecting similar real-time data, mid-rotation and uploading video-simulated remote consultations to the Trust Intranet. We plan to complete the local audit cycle. We also plan to incorporate patient experience (from an ongoing systematic review) to inform a potential triage process post-pandemic, choosing between face-to-face versus remote consultations.","output":"A quality improvement (QI) project on improving trainee confidence in conducting remote psychiatric consultations at Pennine Care National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust in the United Kingdom (UK)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To study the influence of age and gender on pre-competitive and post-competitive anxiety and self-confidence in young tennis players. A total of 42 U'12 to U'18 category tennis players, 12 females and 30 males, participated in this cross-sectional study. The players had a mean age of 13.74 (2.07) years old and a national competitive experience of 4.00 (2.14) years. The pre-competitive anxiety of the participants was assessed using the Competitive State Anxiety InventoryC2R (CSAI-2R) and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-E) before and after an official tournament's match. Results showed that younger players showed lower trait anxiety (r = 0.333;p < 0.05), lower pre-match state anxiety (r = 0.501;p < 0.01) and lower pre-match somatic anxiety (r = 0.313;p < 0.05). Furthermore, girls exhibited higher values of state anxiety (r = 0.445;p < 0.01) and somatic anxiety (r = 0.440;p < 0.01) than boys before the match. However, differences were not observed in the trait anxiety measured by STAI-E (r = 0.203;p = 0.213), cognitive anxiety (r = 0.140;p = 0.363), and self-confidence measured by the CSAI questionnaire (r = 0.150;p = 0.333), before the match. Therefore, coaches and sport psychologists should implement adequate on- and off-court individualized interventions to manage anxiety, specifically in girls and players over 14 years old. Although anxiety levels were similar to those before the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the influence of the pandemic on mental health, results might be taken with caution.","output":"Gender and Age Influence in Pre-Competitive and Post-Competitive Anxiety in Young Tennis Players"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this analysis of the global workforce, the Joint Learning Initiative-a consortium of more than 100 health leaders-proposes that mobilisation and strengthening of human resources for health, neglected yet critical, is central to combating health crises in some of the world's poorest countries and for building sustainable health systems in all countries.

Administration by continuous infusion has been suggested to optimize antibiotic exposure and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment for -lactams. In an observational study, unbound piperacillin concentrations (n=196) were assessed in 78 critically ill patients following continuous infusion of piperacillin/tazobactam (ratio 8:1). The initial dose of 8, 12 or 16 g (piperacillin component) was determined by individual creatinine clearance (CRCL). Piperacillin concentrations were compared to the EUCAST clinical breakpoint MIC for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 mg/L), and the following PK/PD targets were evaluated: 100% fT>1xMIC and 100% fT>4xMIC. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using NONMEM 7.4.3 consisting of a one-compartment disposition model with linear elimination separated into non-renal and renal (linearly increasing with patient CRCL) clearances. Target attainment was predicted and visualized for all individuals based on the utilized CRCL dosing algorithm. The target of 100% fT>1xMIC was achieved for all patients based on the administered dose, but few patients achieved the target of 100% fT>4xMIC. Probability of target attainment for a simulated cohort of patients showed, that increasing the daily dose by 4 g increments (piperacillin component) did not result in substantially improved target attainment for the 100% fT>4xMIC target. To conclude, in patients with high CRCL combined with high-MIC bacterial infections, even a CI regimen with a daily dose of 24 g may be insufficient to achieve therapeutic concentrations.","output":"Population pharmacokinetics of piperacillin following continuous infusion in critically ill patients: Impact of renal function on target attainment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Endovascular therapy is a promising aspect of acute ischemic stroke treatment.

Ultrasound (US) of the inferior vena cava (IVC) may be a fast, noninvasive tool to gauge volume status, but its utility is unclear. Our objectives were to determine the interobserver agreement of IVC collapse and collapse duration, then correlate IVC collapse with the outcome of intravenous (IV) versus oral (PO) rehydration. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study by enrolling patients 0 to 21 years old with emesis requiring ondansetron or diarrhea requiring IV hydration. Clinical operators interpreted US examinations in real time to determine whether the IVC was collapsed. Two blinded reviewers interpreted the US videos to determine IVC collapse and collapse duration. Cohen's kappa(&#954;) was calculated for reviewer-reviewer and reviewer-operator agreement. Primary outcomes were PO versus IV rehydration, and admitted versus discharged. RESULTS: One hundred twelve patients were enrolled, and 102 had complete data for analysis. The mean age was 7.2 years with 51% female. Twenty-nine patients received IV hydration. The reviewer-operator agreement for IVC collapse was &#954; = 0.57 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.75) and interreviewer agreement was &#954; = 0.93 (95% CI, 0.83-1.0). The interreviewer agreement for collapse duration was &#954; = 0.66 (95% CI, 0.51-0.82). All patients with noncollapsed IVCs tolerated PO hydration. The likelihood of receiving IV hydration was correlated with the duration of IVC collapse (P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: Based on a novel dynamic measure of IVC collapse duration, children with increasing duration of IVC collapse correlated positively with the need for IV rehydration. Noncollapsing IVCs on US were associated with successful PO rehydration without need for IV fluids or emergency department revisits.","output":"Interobserver Agreement of Inferior Vena Cava Ultrasound Collapse Duration and Correlated Outcomes in Children With Dehydration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the past one and half year elapsed since the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its genome, an extraordinary effort by the scientific community has led to the development of many vaccine projects.

This study aims to develop a strategic framework managing challenges of integrating lean construction (LC) and integrated project delivery (IPD) on construction megaprojects (CMPs) towards global integrated delivery (GID) transformative initiatives in multinational AEC organisations. Design/methodology/approach \\"Mixed research methods\\" involving a two-stage quantitative and qualitative research approach is adopted. The qualitative research methodology consists of a literature review to assess challenges to integrate LeanIPD&GID on CMPs. There is an assessment of conceptualisation of LeanIPD&GID and GID strategy placements, development of LeanIPD&GID integration framework and future of work (FOW) global initiatives with multiple validations. The analysis involved semi-structured interviews and focus group techniques. Stage 2 consisted of an empirical questionnaire survey that shaped the foundation of analysis and findings of 190 respondents from 23 countries with an extensive cosmopolitan experience of megaprojects in construction. The survey examined a set of 20 challenges to integrate LeanIPD&GID on CMPs resulting from a detailed analysis of extant literature after validation. Descriptive and inferential statistical tests were exploited for data analysis and percentage score analysis. Findings The research conceptualised LeanIPD&GID principles, proposed GID strategy placements, a framework for managing challenges of LeanIPD&GID transformative initiatives, FOW global initiatives and key performance indicators (KPIs). It concluded that the most significant challenges to integrate of LeanIPD&GID on CMPs are \\"lack of governmental incentives, policies, regulations or legal frameworks\\", \\"lack of client's awareness and IPD experience amongst key stakeholders\\", \\"lack of organisation's senior-management and client's commitment to IPD approaches\\", \\"resistance of industry to change from traditional procurement to IPD\\" and \\"lack of integrated synergies between LC, IPD working towards LeanIPD&GID\\".

Messaging used by instructors, which varies in content and approach on the first day, shapes classroom social dynamics and can affect subsequent learning in a course. Prior work established the non-content Instructor Talk Framework to describe the language that instructors use to create learning environments, but little is known about the extent to which students detect those messages. In this study, we paired first day classroom observation data with results from student surveys to measure how readily students in introductory STEM courses detect non-content Instructor Talk. RESULTS: To learn more about the instructor and student first day experiences, we studied 11 introductory STEM courses at two different institutions. The classroom observation data were used to characterize course structure and use of non-content Instructor Talk. The data revealed that all instructors spent time discussing their instructional practices, building instructor/student relationships, and sharing strategies for success with their students. After class, we surveyed students about the messages their instructors shared during the first day of class and determined that the majority of students from within each course detected messaging that occurred at a higher frequency. For lower frequency messaging, we identified nuances in what students detected that may help instructors as they plan their first day of class. CONCLUSIONS: For instructors who dedicate the first day of class to establishing positive learning environments, these findings provide support that students are detecting the messages. Additionally, this study highlights the importance of instructors prioritizing the messages they deem most important and giving them adequate attention to more effectively reach students. Setting a positive classroom environment on the first day may lead to long-term impacts on student motivation and course retention.

We study how five epidemiological models forecast and assess the course of the pandemic in India: a baseline curve-fitting model, an extended SIR (eSIR) model, two extended SEIR (SAPHIRE and SEIR-fansy) models, and a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model (ICM). METHODS: Using COVID-19 case-recovery-death count data reported in India from March 15 to October 15 to train the models, we generate predictions from each of the five models from October 16 to December 31. To compare prediction accuracy with respect to reported cumulative and active case counts and reported cumulative death counts, we compute the symmetric mean absolute prediction error (SMAPE) for each of the five models. For reported cumulative cases and deaths, we compute Pearsons and Lins correlation coefficients to investigate how well the projected and observed reported counts agree. We also present underreporting factors when available, and comment on uncertainty of projections from each model. RESULTS: For active case counts, SMAPE values are 35.14% (SEIR-fansy) and 37.96% (eSIR). For cumulative case counts, SMAPE values are 6.89% (baseline), 6.59% (eSIR), 2.25% (SAPHIRE) and 2.29% (SEIR-fansy). For cumulative death counts, the SMAPE values are 4.74% (SEIR-fansy), 8.94% (eSIR) and 0.77% (ICM). Three models (SAPHIRE, SEIR-fansy and ICM) return total (sum of reported and unreported) cumulative case counts as well. We compute underreporting factors as of October 31 and note that for cumulative cases, the SEIR-fansy model yields an underreporting factor of 7.25 and ICM model yields 4.54 for the same quantity. For total (sum of reported and unreported) cumulative deaths the SEIR-fansy model reports an underreporting factor of 2.97. On October 31, we observe 8.18 million cumulative reported cases, while the projections (in millions) from the baseline model are 8.71 (95% credible interval: 8.63C8.80), while eSIR yields 8.35 (7.19C9.60), SAPHIRE returns 8.17 (7.90C8.52) and SEIR-fansy projects 8.51 (8.18C8.85) million cases. Cumulative case projections from the eSIR model have the highest uncertainty in terms of width of 95% credible intervals, followed by those from SAPHIRE, the baseline model and finally SEIR-fansy. CONCLUSIONS: In this comparative paper, we describe five different models used to study the transmission dynamics of the SARS-Cov-2 virus in India. While simulation studies are the only gold standard way to compare the accuracy of the models, here we were uniquely poised to compare the projected case-counts against observed data on a test period. The largest variability across models is observed in predicting the total number of infections including reported and unreported cases (on which we have no validation data). The degree of under-reporting has been a major concern in India and is characterized in this report. Overall, the SEIR-fansy model appeared to be a good choice with publicly available R-package and desired flexibility plus accuracy.

Prior studies have not investigated the reliability of different fluorescent tracers for the purpose of studying aerosols and small droplets. Objectives include (1) comparing vitamin B2, fluorescein, and a commercial fluorescent green dye in terms of particle dispersion pattern, suspension into aerosols and small droplets, and fluorescence in aerosolized form and (2) determining the utility of vitamin B2 as a fluorescent tracer coating the aerodigestive tract mucosa in otolaryngology contamination models. METHODS: Vitamin B2, fluorescein, and a commercial fluorescent dye were aerosolized using a nebulizer and passed through the nasal cavity from the trachea in a retrograde-intubated cadaveric head. In another scenario, vitamin B2 was irrigated to coat the nasal cavity and nasopharyngeal mucosa of a cadaveric head for assessment of aerosol and droplet generation from endonasal drilling. A cascade impactor was used to collect aerosols and small droplets 14.1 m based on average aerodynamic diameter, and the collection chambers were visualized under UV light. RESULTS: When vitamin B2 was nebulized, aerosols 5.4 m were generated and the collected particles were fluorescent. When fluorescein and the commercial water tracer dye were nebulized, aerosols 8.61 m and 2.08 m respectively were generated, but the collected aerosols did not appear visibly fluorescent. Endonasal drilling in the nasopharynx coated with vitamin B2 irrigation yielded aerosols 3.30 m that were fluorescent under UV light.

We obtained follow-up information from our original 17 patients and compared this to data summarized and published about them from 12 months previously. We also created and administered a 100-question needs assessment survey. Follow-up 12-month clinical information was available from 13/17 homeless and 13/17 non-homeless controls. Homeless patients remained less well with more disease than non-homeless patientspoorer access to clinic appointments (80% vs 91%, p < 0.05), more emergency services use (20 vs 5 ED visits), less DMARDs use (43% vs 100%, p < 0.01), and more steroid use (29% vs 0%, p < 0.01). Homeless patients also had higher inflammatory markers than non-homeless patients (ESR 32 vs 26 mm/h and CRP 17 vs 5 mg/L), although these findings were not statistically significantly different. Seventy-eight percent of homeless patients were stable, 14% improved, and 7% worse; 21% had stable controlled and 57% stable active disease vs 62% and 0% of non-homeless (p < 0.01).

The average monthly income was $873. 5/6 (83.3%), were unable to work due to health, and were in considerable pain that adversely impacted their physical and mental health and ability to perform ADLs. Their perceived greatest need included dental care, physical therapy, knee surgery, employment, socialization secondary to isolation, and stable housing.

A timely and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is the cornerstone for the prompt management of the patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the performance of an automated machine learning algorithm in the diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia using chest CT scans. Diagnostic performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and positive predictive value. The method's average precision was 0.932. We suggest that auto-ML platforms help users with limited ML expertise train image recognition models by only uploading the examined dataset and performing some basic settings.

Like many other human and animal viruses, coronavirus infection of mammalian cells induces apoptosis. In this study, the global gene expression profiles are first determined in IBV-infected Vero cells at 24 hours post-infection by Affymetrix array, using avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) as a model system. It reveals an up-regulation at the transcriptional level of both pro-apoptotic Bak and pro-survival myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). These results were further confirmed both in vivo and in vitro, in IBV-infected embryonated chicken eggs, chicken fibroblast cells and mammalian cells at transcriptional and translational levels, respectively. Interestingly, the onset of apoptosis occurred earlier in IBV-infected mammalian cells silenced with short interfering RNA targeting Mcl-1 (siMcl-1), and was delayed in cells silenced with siBak. IBV progeny production and release were increased in infected Mcl-1 knockdown cells compared to similarly infected control cells, while the contrary was observed in infected Bak knockdown cells. Furthermore, IBV infection-induced up-regulation of GADD153 regulated the expression of Mcl-1. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathways by chemical inhibitors and knockdown of GADD153 by siRNA demonstrated the involvement of ER-stress response in regulation of IBV-induced Mcl-1 expression. These results illustrate the sophisticated regulatory strategies evolved by a coronavirus to modulate both virus-induced apoptosis and viral replication during its replication cycle.","output":"Up-Regulation of Mcl-1 and Bak by Coronavirus Infection of Human, Avian and Animal Cells Modulates Apoptosis and Viral Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Automation and electrification in road transport are trends that will influence several economic sectors of the European economy. The automotive maintenance and repair (M&R) sector will experience the effects of such transitions in the long term. This paper assesses the research in the road transport to derive the factors that may influence the M&R demand based on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) uptake. Starting from current scientific research and grounded on interviews with experts, the paper reviews major drivers influencing M&R demand and provides indications on possible future effects. While for BEVs, previous work has been conducted to estimate the M&R cost variations, the research addressing the impacts of AVs deployment on the M&R sector is at its incipient stage, hence the views of experts were paramount to shed light on this topic. We identified a scientific consensus that BEVs have less M&R requirements compared with Conventional Vehicles (CVs). For AVs, our analysis and expert views identify some important factors influencing M&R requirements: hardware components, software that enables autonomy, the rise in vehicle kilometres travelled leading to higher wear and tear of replaceable parts, the need for adequate cleaning services, especially for fleets and shared vehicles.

High immunization coverage is essential for reducing the risk of vaccine preventable diseases. METHODS: We used data from two nationwide sources covering the whole of Brazil. Data from the Information System of the National Immunization Program (SIPNI) on the monthly number of vaccine doses administered to young children were analyzed. The second source was a survey in 133 large cities in the 27 states in the country, carried out from August 24-27. Respondents answered a question on whether children under the age of three years had missed any scheduled vaccinations during the pandemic, and available vaccination cards were photographed for later examination. RESULTS: SIPNI data showed that, relative to January and February 2020, there was a decline of about 20% in vaccines administered to children aged two months or older during March and April, when social distancing was at the highest level in the country. After May, vaccination levels returned to pre-pandemic values. Survey data, based on the interviews and on examination of the vaccine cards, showed that 19.0% (95% CI 17.0;21.1%) and 20.6% (95% CI 19.0;23.1%) of children, respectively, had missed immunizations. Missed doses were most common in the North (Amazon) region and least common in the South and Southeast, and also more common among children from poor than from wealthy families. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that the pandemic was associated with a reduction of about 20% in child vaccinations, but this was reverted in recent months. Children from poor families and from the least developed regions of the country were most affected. There is an urgent need to booster immunization activities in the country to compensate for missed doses, and to reduce geographic and socioeconomic inequalities.","output":"Missed childhood immunizations during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil: Analyses of routine statistics and of a national household survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The ability to rapidly detect emerging and re-emerging threats relies on a strong network of laboratories providing high quality testing services. Improving laboratory quality systems to ensure that these laboratories effectively play their critical role using a tailored stepwise approach can assist them to comply with the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Health Regulations (IHRs) and the World Organization for Animal Health's (OIE) guidelines. METHODS: Fifteen (15) laboratories in Armenia's human and veterinary laboratory networks were enrolled into a quality management system strengthening programme from 2017 to 2020. Training was provided for key staff, resulting in an implementation plan developed to address gaps. Routine mentorship visits were conducted. Audits were undertaken at baseline and post-implementation using standardised checklists to assess laboratory improvements. RESULTS: Baseline audit general indicator scores ranged from 21% to 46% for human laboratories and 37% to 60% for the veterinary laboratories. Following implementation scores improved ranging from 7 to 39% for human laboratories and 12% to 19% for veterinary laboratories. CONCLUSION: In general, there has been improvement for both human and veterinary laboratories in the areas of QMS implementation, particularly in organizational structure, human resources, equipment management, supply chain and data management.

Although GP costs are mainly covered by public services or social insurances in Europe, they are still self-employed physicians everywhere, differently from their colleagues in hospitals who are traditionally employees. TM is a very general term open to various interpretations and definitions.

Although the adoption of TM seems to be compelling in our era, its practical dissemination in PC has been quite slow so far, and many different concerns have been raised on it. On the whole, TM widespread adoption in PC seems to be more a matter of labor organization and health care funding than of technology and ethics. Larger-scale organizations comprising a wide range of health professionals have become a pressing priority for a modern PC, because working together is crucial to provide high-quality care to patients, and co-location should boost teamwork and facilitate the management of information technology.

We present the clinical, neuropathological, and molecular findings of 41 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections who died and underwent autopsy in our medical center. The mean age was 74 years (38-97 years), 27 patients (66%) were male and 34 (83%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. Twenty-four patients (59%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Hospital-associated complications were common, including 8 (20%) with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), 7 (17%) patients with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, and 10 (24%) with positive blood cultures during admission. Eight (20%) patients died within 24 hours of hospital admission, while 11 (27%) died more than 4 weeks after hospital admission. Neuropathological examination of 20-30 areas from each brain revealed hypoxic/ischemic changes in all brains, both global and focal; large and small infarcts, many of which appeared hemorrhagic; and microglial activation with microglial nodules accompanied by neuronophagia, most prominently in the brainstem. We observed sparse T lymphocyte accumulation in either perivascular regions or in the brain parenchyma. Many brains contained atherosclerosis of large arteries and arteriolosclerosis, though none had evidence of vasculitis. Eighteen (44%) contained pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, not unexpected given the age range of our patients. We examined multiple fresh frozen and fixed tissues from 28 brains for the presence of viral RNA and protein, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT- PCR), RNAscope, and immunocytochemistry with primers, probes, and antibodies directed against the spike and nucleocapsid regions. qRT-PCR revealed low to very low, but detectable, viral RNA levels in the majority of brains, although they were far lower than those in nasal epithelia. RNAscope and immunocytochemistry failed to detect viral RNA or protein in brains. Our findings indicate that the levels of detectable virus in COVID-19 brains are very low and do not correlate with the histopathological alterations. These findings suggest that microglial activation, microglial nodules and neuronophagia, observed in the majority of brains, do not result from direct viral infection of brain parenchyma, but rather likely from systemic inflammation, perhaps with synergistic contribution from hypoxia/ischemia. Further studies are needed to define whether these pathologies, if present in patients who survive COVID-19, might contribute to chronic neurological problems.","output":"COVID-19 Neuropathology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Family and consumer sciences (FCS) has a long history in embracing the value of hands-on, project-based learning in the classroom.

These data were combined into an aggregate stringency index (SI) score for each country on each day (range: 0C100). Countries were divided into successive waves via a mathematical algorithm to identify peaks and troughs of disease. Within our period of analysis, 63 countries experienced at least one wave, 40 countries experienced two waves, and 10 countries saw three waves, as defined by our approach. Within each wave, regression was used to assess the relationship between the strength of government stringency and subsequent deaths related to COVID-19 with a number of controls for time and country-specific demographic, health system, and economic characteristics. Across the full period of our analysis and 113 countries, an increase of 10 points on the SI was linked to 6 percentage points (P < 0.001, 95% CI = [5%, 7%]) lower average daily deaths. In the first wave, in countries that ultimately experiences 3 waves of the pandemic to date, ten additional points on the SI resulted in lower average daily deaths by 21 percentage points (P < .001, 95% CI = [8%, 16%]). This effect was sustained in the third wave with reductions in deaths of 28 percentage points (P < .001, 95% CI = [13%, 21%]).

Healthcare worker recommendations are strong predictors of increased vaccination uptake in the population. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze seasonal influenza vaccination recommendation behavior among pharmacists towards high-risk groups including patients, coworkers, and pharmacists family members during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional, questionnaire-based research was conducted in Switzerland during the flu season and sent to all members of the Swiss Pharmacist Association. In December 2020, 569 community pharmacists completed the online survey. The influenza vaccination recommendation rates for high-risk patients were 93.6% for the elderly, 70.7% for pregnant women, 65.2% for immunocompromised people, and 60.3% for patients with chronic diseases. Pharmacists tend to recommend influenza immunization to patients more than to family members and colleagues. Holding a certification to administer immunization and personal influenza vaccine history were the main predictors for recommending influenza vaccination to patients, family members, and colleagues. Our results indicated that influenza vaccination recommendation rates in our whole sample of pharmacists, were higher for vaccinated and immunizing pharmacists.

Therefore, we aimed to assess the perception and hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccination in this population and explore the possible factors when it comes to vaccination decisions. Methods: The present cross-sectional phone interview study was conducted between May 10 and 20, 2021. The questionnaire was administered by the medical staff. The participants were all patients with SCD presented to King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Results: Out of 346 patients, 147 patients agreed to participate. Only 52 (35.37%) patients received at least one dose of the nationally available vaccines, and there were no reported serious side effects. Among the unvaccinated participants, 45 patients (47.8%) were undecided. The most reported reasons for hesitancy were the fear of developing complications as their acquaintance had and the fear of developing brain blood clots post vaccination. Conclusions: The number of vaccinated patients with SCD was unfortunately low in our study, secondary to hesitancy. This represents a significant barrier and needs to be tackled appropriately at any proper interaction with a patient with SCD.

Multikinase inhibitors have shown potential in treating high-risk NB, but their efficacy is likely impaired by the cancer cells ability to adapt to these drugs through the employment of alternative signaling pathways. Based on the expression of 48 growth factor-related genes in 1189 NB tumors, we have developed a model for NB patient survival prediction. This model discriminates between stage 4 NB tumors with favorable outcomes (>80% overall survival) and very poor outcomes (<10%) independently from MYCN-amplification status. Using signaling pathway analysis and gene set enrichment methods in 60 NB patients with known therapy response, we identified signaling pathways, including EPO, NGF, and HGF, upregulated in patients with no or partial response. In a therapeutic setting, we showed that among six selected growth factors, EPO, and NGF showed the most pronounced protective effects in vitro against several promising anti-NB multikinase inhibitors: imatinib, dasatinib, crizotinib, cabozantinib, and axitinib. Mechanistically kinase inhibitors potentiated NB cells to stronger ERK activation by EPO and NGF. The protective action of these growth factors strongly correlated with ERK activation and was ERK-dependent. ERK inhibitors combined with anticancer drugs, especially with dasatinib, showed a synergistic effect on NB cell death.

In Canada, the Canadian Shellfish Sanitation Program aims to avoid consumption of contaminated molluscan bivalves by monitoring fecal coliform bacteria through vessel-based water sample collection. Uncrewed aerial vehicles or drones are becoming more commonly used for water sample collection given their relatively low cost but are rarely used to support microbiological analyses. A prerequisite for the acceptance of a new collection method for a regulatory program is to determine if the method of sample collection affects results.

However, the hand hygiene compliance of facility-based birth attendants, parents and other caregivers along this continuum is low and behavioural-science informed interventions targeting the range of caregivers in both the healthcare facility and home environments are scarce. We assessed the limited efficacy of a novel multimodal behaviour change intervention, delivered at the facility, to improve the hand hygiene practices among midwives and caregivers during childbirth through the return to the home environment. Methods The 6-month intervention was implemented in 4 of 8 purposively selected facilities and included environmental restructuring, hand hygiene infrastructure provision, cues and reminders, and participatory training. In this controlled before-and-after study, the hand hygiene practices of all caregivers present along the care continuum of 99 women and newborns were directly observed. Direct observations took place during three time periods;labour, delivery and immediate aftercare in the facility delivery room, postnatal care in the facility ward and in the home environment within the first 48hrs following discharge. Multilevel logistic regression models, adjusted for baseline measures, assessed differences in hand hygiene practices between intervention and control facilities. Results The intervention was associated with increased odds of improved practice of birth attendants during birth and newborn care in the delivery room (Adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 4.7;95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.7, 7.7), and that of parental and non-parental caregivers prior to newborn care in the post-natal care ward (AOR = 9.2;CI = 1.3, 66.2);however, the absolute magnitude of improvements was limited.

The findings of the study revealed that various factors influence student engagement in online learning during the crisis including infrastructure factors, cultural factors, digital inequality, and the threat to digital privacy. Cultural factors were the important factor that influences females because of parents culture and their bias against females using online learning compared to male students.

Setting: Clinical Hospital of the School of Medicine of the University of Sao Paulo. Participants: One hundred ninety-six patients were evaluated. Ten patients did not test positive for SARS-CoV-2 during hospitalization and were excluded from the analyses. The sample comprised patients of both sexes (50% male) with a mean age (SD) of 59 (SD = 15) years, body mass index of 29.5 (SD = 6.9) kg/m2. The prevalence of current smoking patients was 24.7%, and more prevalent coexisting conditions were hypertension (67.7%), obesity (40.9%), and type 2 diabetes (36.0%). Mean (SD) LOS was 8.6 days (7.7); 17.0% of the patients required intensive care; 3.8% used invasive mechanical ventilation; and 6.6% died during the hospitalization period.

Conclusions and Relevance: Muscle strength and mass assessed upon hospital admission are predictors of LOS in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, which stresses the value of muscle health in prognosis of this disease.","output":"Muscle Strength and Muscle Mass as Predictors of Hospital Length of Stay in Patients with Moderate to Severe COVID-19: A Prospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Resident parents are at the intersection of converging challenges during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and their perspective has yet to be explored. This qualitative study aimed to identify themes related to the experience of pediatric resident parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed semi-structured interviews with pediatric residents who were also parents. Using thematic analysis, transcripts were analyzed iteratively until theoretical sufficiency was achieved. RESULTS: 12 residents were interviewed from 9 pediatric residency programs. Five major themes, representing conflicts or tensions experienced by participants, were defined by the data: (1) Duty as a doctor versus duty as a parent; (2) Balance of work obligations versus childcare challenges; (3) Appreciation of added support versus worry about peers' perceptions of accommodations; (4) Gratitude for the recognition of challenges faced by resident parents versus fear of reversion to the norm; and (5) Protective impact of parenthood versus challenges to mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Both parents and healthcare workers faced innumerable challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this exploration of the experiences of pediatric resident parents provides a unique lens for examining the tensions that this group faced.

To meet these goals and to understand the strengths and weaknesses of current vaccine strategies, scientists routinely study human responses toward seasonal influenza vaccines. This research is frequently performed with clinical samples taken throughout an influenza season, often without strict attention to the month of inoculation for each study participant. Here, we ask how the timing of vaccination affects outcomes. Results demonstrate significant influences of inoculation month on the immune response. During the progression from fall to winter months, there are changes in host lifestyles and in the frequencies of clinical/sub-clinical viral infections that can significantly alter vaccine immunogenicity. We now recommend routine assessment of inoculation month during clinical studies to inform data interpretation and expedite the development of successful vaccines.

We conducted a longitudinal study to analyze characteristics and trends of online information during a major COVID-19 outbreak in Da Nang province, Vietnam in July-August 2020 to understand public awareness and perceptions during an epidemic. METHODS: We collected online information on COVID-19 incidence and mortality from online platforms in Vietnam between 1 July and 15 September, 2020, and assessed their trends over time against the epidemic curve. We explored the associations between engagement, sentiment polarity, and other characteristics of online information with different outbreak phases using Poisson regression and multinomial logistic regression analysis. We assessed the frequency of keywords over time, and conducted a semantic analysis of keywords using word segmentation. RESULTS: We found a close association between collected online information and the evolution of the COVID-19 situation in Vietnam. Online information generated higher engagements during compared to before the outbreak. There was a close relationship between sentiment polarity and posts topics: the emotional tendencies about COVID-19 mortality were significantly more negative, and more neutral or positive about COVID-19 incidence. Online newspaper reported significantly more information in negative or positive sentiment than online forums or social media. Most topics of public concern followed closely the progression of the COVID-19 situation during the outbreak: development of the global pandemic and vaccination; the unfolding outbreak in Vietnam; and the subsiding of the outbreak after two months. CONCLUSION: This study shows how online information can reflect a public health threat in real time, and provides important insights about public awareness and perception during different outbreak phases. Our findings can help public health decision makers in Vietnam and other low and middle income countries with high internet penetration rates to design more effective communication strategies during critical phases of an epidemic.","output":"Using infodemics to understand public awareness and perception of SARS-CoV-2: A longitudinal analysis of online information about COVID-19 incidence and mortality during a major outbreak in Vietnam, JulySeptember 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectivesTo describe clinical characteristics and treatment used in subjects who had Sars-Cov-2 infection during the first pandemic and to assess the correlation between serological titers and clinical characteristics; to evaluate the persistence of antibody titer.

ParticipantsConsecutive subjects aged 15 to 75 who were discharged with the diagnosis of Sars-Cov-2 from the hospitals of the AUSL Umbria 2, or resulted positive to a PCR test for Sars-Cov-2 infection with or without symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing for antibodies targeting the Nucleocapside and Spike proteins were determined. ResultsOf 184 eligible subjects, 149 were available for evaluation: 17 were classified as Oligo/asymptomatic, 107 as Symptomatic, 25 as Hospital admitted. While fever resulted common to all the groups, headache or musculoskeletal pain was common to symptomatic participants whereas cough and dyspnea was present in all the hospital admitted. Participants with significant signs and symptoms were more likely to use antibiotics, hydroxychloroquine, heparin and steroids. Compared to Oligo/asymptomatic participants, Symptomatic and Hospital admitted participants had higher levels of anti-S titers at every follow-up (median titer at 12 month follow-up: 29 vs 94 vs 116 respectively; P < 0.001). At 12 months follow-up, anti-S titers persisted above the threshold for at least 12 months in all Hospital admitted participants, in 90% of the Symptomatic participants and 83% in the oligo/asymptomatic participants; in 30% of participants the titer raised significantly probably due to reinfection. Anti-N antibody titer tended to decrease over time and in 62% of the entire cohort resulted negative. None of the participants reported clinical reinfection with Sars-Cov-2 virus.

The article outlines the main causes of such situations and substantiates the need to address them by joining efforts both at the national level and at the level of local self-government. The concept of fiscal space is considered by the authors as the presence of a certain budget reserve to achieve the desired goals without violating financial stability. In the context of emergencies, this is a fiscal space to fund certain goals, which can sometimes be actualized in a very short time (as happened with the situation in health care in 2020). The possibility of targeting the fiscal space in the field of health care, social protection, overcoming the effects of natural disasters, combating poverty, achieving the goals of sustainable development, etc. is noted. The article presents the results of a study of the impact of emergencies (eg, the COVID-19 pandemic) on the ability of local authorities to respond to their consequences. The authors analyzed budget expenditures to combat COVID-19 and assessed changes in the financial capacity of municipalities and funding priorities, including funding for pandemic control at the national and subnational levels, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on municipal finances in terms of compliance with the principles of the European Charter of Local Self-Government, the impact on funding priorities at the local level and municipality development strategies, the ability of local governments to respond to emergencies and highlighted some already tested effective practices.

RESULTS: A total of 237 members, aged 28-72 years, completed the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI), Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and HOPE questionnaires; 86.92% were female, 58.65% worked in hospitals, 21.10% were exposed to COVID-19, 11.39% experienced peritraumatic distress, and 3.38% had posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Peritraumatic distress was associated with living alone (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 3.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41-8.13), using sleep remedies (AOR 3.79; 95% CI 1.41-10.21), and the perception of being avoided by family or friends because of work (AOR 2.69; 95% CI 1.02-7.11); high HOPE-Agency scores were associated with the absence of peritraumatic stress (AOR 0.40; 95% CI 0.16-0.96) after adjustment for age and sex. CONCLUSIONS: Psycho-oncologists showed greater resilience than other healthcare workers as they are trained to help others, but also to review their own values and behavior in light of stressful events. Of interest is the association between peritraumatic distress and social isolation, real or perceived.

The recently published Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline on blood pressure (BP) management in CKD stresses the importance of standardized BP measurement and strict control of BP. This is a useful document that will help to improve the management of hypertension in CKD globally. However, the recommendation of systolic BP target of <120 mm Hg by KDIGO is controversial. It is based on weak evidence derived mainly from a single randomized controlled trial and its CKD subgroup analysis. Here, we review the current evidence surrounding BP target in CKD. We argue that the target recommended by KDIGO is not generalizable to the majority of people with CKD. Standardized BP measurements are challenging to implement outside specialist hypertension and research clinics, and the target of <120 mm Hg BP systolic cannot be extrapolated to routine clinic BP measurements. If applied to routine BP measurement, this target will expose the multimorbid and frail CKD patients to the risk of adverse events including falls and fractures. Furthermore, it will not be achievable in the majority of CKD patients. The target recommended by KDIGO is an outlier among contemporary major international hypertension guidelines and is likely to perplex clinicians. We believe the KDIGO-recommended target systolic BP <120 mm Hg for CKD is inappropriate in the majority of CKD patients and it may even be harmful for patients managed in routine clinical practice.","output":"Is the KDIGO Systolic Blood Pressure Target <120 mm Hg for Chronic Kidney Disease Appropriate in Routine Clinical Practice?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the disease COVID-19 has been declared as pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) and has spread to more than 200 countries around the world.

Existing devices to test muscle strength are not always suitable to accurately measure the high forces of this muscle group. Therefore, a device to test muscle strength that is convenient, feasible, reliable, and valid in clinical settings is required. This study evaluated the reliability, responsiveness, and level of discomfort of the newly developed Q-Force ?? (i.e. a portable device to measure isometric knee extensor strength) in healthy middle-aged and elderly adults. METHODS: Participants (n = 22) conducted two standardized test sessions on the Q-Force ?? (five to ten days apart). Each session consisted of one familiarisation trial followed by three trials of peak isometric knee extension per each leg. Per trial, peak and mean knee extension force (N) and torque (Nm) were measured at 90 flexion. The level of discomfort was determined using a visual analog scale (VAS: 0-100). Intra Class Correlation (ICC, model: two-way mixed with absolute agreement), Standard Error of Measurement (SEM), and minimal detectable change (MDC) were determined. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to determine between-test variation. RESULTS: Excellent test-retest (ICC > 0.95) and inter-trial (ICC > 0.91) reliability for both legs were shown. No significant differences were found in peak and mean knee forces and torques between test and retest of both legs, indicating good test-retest reliability (P-value range: 0.360-0.538; F(1,21) range: 0.4-0.9). The SEM of the peak and mean forces and torques ranged from 28.0 to 30.4 N (6.0-6.8%) and from 9.2 to 10.4 Nm (6.4-7.7%), respectively. The MDC for these outcomes ranged respectively from 77.6 to 84.1 N (16.5-18.8%) and from 25.5 to 28.9 Nm (17.6-21.4%). The level of discomfort was low (median range: 7-10, IQR: 4-18). CONCLUSION: The portable Q-Force ?? is a comfortable, responsive, and relatively cheap device with excellent test-retest reliability.

Results: The most frequent symptoms were fever, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, sore throat, and dyspnea. Regarding the combined results of the meta-analysis, fever (46%, 95% CI 40C53%), cough (37%, 95% CI 29C46%), diarrhea (19%, 95% CI 9C28%), and pharyngalgia (13%, 95% CI 5C20%) were the most widely reported symptom.

Early warning of such communicable diseases before the onset of symptoms could improve both patient care and public health responses. However, the potential impact of such a host-based early warning system on containing the spread of an outbreak and in steering public health response is unknown. Methods: We extend the deterministic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model to simulate disease outbreak scenarios and to quantify the potential impact of a host-based early warning capability to mitigate pathogen transmission during an outbreak. In particular, we compare and contrast the performance of five different policies: Self-monitoring and reporting (baseline SEIR model), Quarantining the entire population, Quarantine-on-alert (with high sensitivity early warning), Quarantine-on-alert (with high specificity early warning), and Quarantine-on-alert (ideal early warning). We further evaluate these five policy options against four different outbreak scenarios with high or low disease transmission and high or low initial population exposures. Results: For all scenarios, a quarantine-on-alert policy coupled with the near-ideal early warning capability reduces quarantine needs with only a small increase in the number of additional infections. The cost of a highly specific early detection system (i.e., a reduction in false alarms and thus quarantine costs) is an increase in additional infections relative to the near-ideal system. Conversely, a highly sensitive early detection system increases the percentage of the population in quarantine compared to both the ideal and high-specificity early detection system while also reducing the number of additional infections to nearly the numbers seen by quarantining the entire population a priori.

The association between body image and mental well-being was much stronger in urban subjects (b = - 0.38, p < 0.001) than in rural subjects (b = - 0.20, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that multidimensional body image is associated with physical and mental well-being in Chinese breast cancer survivors. Body image appears to play a larger role in urban breast cancer survivors' mental well-being. Our results indicate that incorporating interventions that address body image issues would be advantageous for survivorship care to enhance QoL in breast cancer survivors. Furthermore, rural-urban differences should be considered in the strategic design of survivorship care programs in rural and urban settings.","output":"Assessing the relationship between body image and quality of life among rural and urban breast cancer survivors in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After implementing restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus, governments in the United States and around the world are trying to identify the path to social and economic recovery. The White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have published guidelines to assist US states, counties, and territories in planning these efforts. As the impact of the coronavirus pandemic has not been uniform, these central guidelines need to be translated into practice in ways that recognize variation among jurisdictions. We present a core methodology to assist governments in this task, presenting a case for appropriate actions at each stage of recovery based on scientific data and analysis. Specifically, 3 types of data are needed: data on the spread of disease should be analyzed alongside data on the overall health of the population and data on infrastructure-for example, the capacity of health systems. Local circumstances will produce different needs and present different setbacks, and governments may need to reinstate as well as relax restrictions. Transparent, defensible analysis can assist in making these decisions and communicating them to the public.

Of the 388 COVID-19-related deaths occurring nationwide, most occurred in the community. We report findings from COVID-19 mortality surveillance among community deaths brought to the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) mortuary in Lusaka. Methods: In Zambia, when a person dies in the community, and is brought into a health facility mortuary, they are recorded as 'brought in dead' (BID). The UTH mortuary accepts persons BID for Lusaka District, the most populated district in Zambia. We analyzed data for persons BID at UTH during 2020. We analyzed two data sources: weekly SARS-CoV-2 test results for persons BID and monthly all-cause mortality numbers among persons BID. For all-cause mortality among persons BID, monthly deaths during 2020 that were above the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the historic mean (2017-2019) were considered significant. Spearman's rank test was used to correlate the overall percent positivity in Zambia with all-cause mortality and SARS-CoV-2 testing among persons BID at UTH mortuary. Results: During 2020, 7,756 persons were BID at UTH (monthly range 556-810). SARS-CoV-2 testing began in April 2020, and through December 3,131 (51.9%) of 6,022 persons BID were tested. Of these, 212 (6.8%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive with weekly percent test positivity ranging from 0-32%, with the highest positivity occurring during July 2020. There were 1,139 excess persons BID from all causes at UTH mortuary in 2020 compared to the 2017-2019 mean. The monthly number of persons BID from all causes was above the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval during June-September and December. Conclusion: Increases in all-cause mortality and SARS-CoV-2 test positivity among persons BID at UTH mortuary corresponded with the first peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in June and August 2020, indicating possible increased mortality related to the COVID-19 epidemic in Zambia. Combining all-cause mortality and SARS-CoV-2 testing for persons BID provides useful information about the severity of the epidemic in Lusaka and should be implemented throughout Zambia.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Mortality Surveillance among Community Deaths brought to University Teaching Hospital Mortuary in Lusaka, Zambia, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated how young Italian people experienced the period of peak spread of COVID-19 in their country by probing their emotions, thoughts, events, and actions related to interpersonal and community bonds.

The aim was to investigate young people's experiences because they are the most fragile group due to their difficulty staying home and apart from their peers and because they are, at the same time, the most potentially dangerous people due to their urge to gather in groups. The research involved 568 university students, 475 females, and 93 males, with an average age of 21.82 years (SD = 4.836). The collected data were analyzed with the Grounded Theory Methodology, using the Atlas 8.0 software. From the textual data, representative codes were defined and grouped into 10 categories, which reflect the individuals' prosocial attitudes, behaviors, and values. These categories formed three macro-categories, called: Collective Dimensions, which includes Connectedness, Solidarity, Italian-ness, Social Problems, and Collective Mourning; Prosocial Orientation, which includes Trust and Hope; and Collective Values, which includes Values of Freedom, Respect of Social Rules, and Civic-Mindedness. All these macro-categories are indicative of the shared feelings experienced by Italians during the first time of the pandemic.

The aim of the high fidelity simulation suite in clinical education is to practice true to life on-call scenarios in a safe, supported and non-judgemental environment. The objectives included: increasing confidence in assessing and treating acutely unwell deteriorating patients;improving communication between physiotherapy colleagues and the MDT and escalating care appropriately. Methods: Six case studies were designed to replicate a true to life situation to challenge clinical reasoning and help improve confidence in an on-call situation. A simulation co-ordinator was present during the simulation to act as the nurse on duty. The participants were encouraged to communicate with each other and work together. They could ask the nurse questions and the control room could feedback the information. The facilitators in the control room observed the simulation, changed clinical observations in response to treatments and responded as the patient through a microphone. The simulation was fluid and whilst it was designed to target specific clinical skills, if clinically reasoned the participants could use any treatments that they felt were appropriate. Colleagues watched the simulation from a viewing room and made notes to feedback to their peers. After the simulation, a de-brief was carried out to enable participants to reflect on the scenario in the form of facilitated discussion to share learning from each other. Results: We have successfully completed 6 scenarios with 20 physiotherapists. Reflections were completed via a group de-brief and participants were given the opportunity to complete a structured reflection for continuing professional development. Participants feedback in response to the simulation was very positive, reporting to be just right in terms of skill level and beneficial to their clinical and professional development. It has increased participants confidence in assessing and treating acutely unwell patients as well as highlighting the importance of escalating care to the appropriate members of the multi-disciplinary team, identifying strategies for effective communication. Conclusion(s): The experiences created an open learning environment in which mistakes were not judged but lead to a greater potential for continuing professional development via self-reflection and peer reviews. Whilst some found the experience daunting and uncomfortable it has the potential to increase skills, knowledge and confidence, similar to the findings by Mansell, Harvey and Thomas, 2019. High fidelity simulation could increase skills of non-on-call physiotherapy staff quickly to help meet workforce requirements demanded by surges to service demand such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This has highlighted the need to transform clinical education to improve service provision and delivery of on-call physiotherapy service and enhance patient experience. Further investigation is warranted to identify how high fidelity simulation could also enhance collaborative working within the multi-disciplinary team in acutely unwell patients.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this case-control study, mergers at community nonrehabilitation hospitals in Federal Office of Rural Health PolicyCeligible zip codes during 2009 to 2016 in 32 states were identified from Irving Levin Associates and the American Hospital Association Annual Survey. Outcomes for inpatient stays for select conditions and elective procedures were derived from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases. Difference-in-differences linear probability models were used to assess premerger to postmerger changes in outcomes for patients discharged from merged vs comparison hospitals that remained independent. Data were analyzed from February to December 2020. EXPOSURES: Hospital mergers. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was in-hospital mortality among patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure, stroke, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hip fracture, or pneumonia, as well as complications during stays for elective surgeries. RESULTS: A total of 172 merged hospitals and 266 comparison hospitals were analyzed. After matching, baseline patient characteristics were similar for 303 747 medical stays and 175 970 surgical stays at merged hospitals and 461 092 medical stays and 278 070 surgical stays at comparison hospitals. In-hospital mortality among AMI stays decreased from premerger to postmerger at merged hospitals (9.4% to 5.0%) and comparison hospitals (7.9% to 6.3%). Adjusting for patient, hospital, and community characteristics, the decrease in in-hospital mortality among AMI stays 1 year postmerger was 1.755 (95% CI, ?2.825 to ?0.685) percentage points greater at merged hospitals than at comparison hospitals (P < .001). This finding held up to 4 years postmerger (DID, ?2.039 [95% CI, ?3.388 to ?0.691] percentage points; P = .003). Greater premerger to postmerger decreases in mortality at merged vs comparison hospitals were also observed at 5 years postmerger among stays for heart failure (DID, ?0.756 [95% CI, ?1.448 to ?0.064] percentage points; P = .03), stroke (DID, ?1.667 [95% CI, ?3.050 to ?0.283] percentage points; P = .02), and pneumonia (DID, ?0.862 [95% CI, ?1.681 to ?0.042] percentage points; P = .04).

To identify the nuclear localization signals (NLS), BAdV-3 fiber deletion mutants and GFP/-galactosidase fusion proteins were expressed in transfected cells, and subcellular localization was visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy. Analysis of deletion mutants localized the NLS to the N-terminal 41 amino acids. Analysis of the N-terminal 41 amino acids identified a cluster of basic residues between amino acid 14 and 20. Substitution of the basic residues ((16)KAKR(19)) with acidic residues ((16)EAEE(19)) resulted in the accumulation of fiber in the cytoplasm. However, (16)KAKR(19) or (12)VYPYKAKRPNI(22) were not sufficient for efficient transport of a cytoplasmic protein GFP/-galactosidase to the nucleus.

We sought to identify additional members of the Coronaviridae in both bony and jawless fish through a combination of total RNA sequencing (meta-transcriptomics) and data mining of published RNA sequencing data, and from this reveal more of the long-term patterns and processes of coronavirus evolution. Accordingly, we identified a number of divergent viruses that fell within the Letovirinae subfamily of the Coronaviridae, including those in a jawless fish C the pouched lamprey. By mining fish transcriptome data we identified additional virus transcripts matching these viruses in bony fish from both marine and freshwater environments. These new viruses retained sequence conservation in the RNA-dependant RNA polymerase across the Coronaviridae, but formed a distinct and diverse phylogenetic group. Although there are broad-scale topological similarities between the phylogenies of the major groups of coronaviruses and their vertebrate hosts, the evolutionary relationships of viruses within the Letovirinae does not mirror that of their hosts. For example, the coronavirus found in the pouched lamprey fell within the phylogenetic diversity of bony fish letoviruses, indicative of past host switching events. Hence, despite possessing a phylogenetic history that likely spans the entire history of the vertebrates, coronavirus evolution has been characterised by relatively frequent cross-species transmission, particularly in hosts that reside in aquatic habitats.","output":"Slippery When wet: Cross-Species Transmission of Divergent Coronaviruses in Bony and Jawless Fish and The Evolutionary History of the Coronaviridae"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Youth suicide is a global public health issue, and using technology is one strategy to increase participation in preventive interventions. However, there is minimal knowledge on how technology-enhanced interventions for youth correspond to the stages of care, from illness or risk recognition to treatment follow-up. OBJECTIVE This systematic review aims to examine the efficacy of technology-enhanced youth suicide prevention and interventions across the continuum of care. METHODS Four electronic databases were searched up to spring 2019 for youth suicide preventive interventions that used technology. The review was not restricted by study design and eligible studies could report outcomes on suicidality or related behaviors, such as formal treatment initiation. An adapted version of the Methodological Quality Ratings Scale was used to assess study quality. RESULTS A total of 26 studies were identified. The findings support the emerging efficacy of technology-enhanced interventions, including a decline in suicidality and an increase in proactive behaviors. However, evidence suggests that there are gaps in the continuum of care and recent study samples do not represent the diverse identities of vulnerable youth. CONCLUSIONS The majority of identified studies were conducted in school settings and were universal interventions that aligned with the illness and risk recognition and help-seeking stages of the continuum of care.

However, by increasing lean body mass, pre-habilitation could reduce the time needed to recover gastrointestinal (GI) functions. The aim was to assess the impact of pre-habilitation before colorectal cancer surgery on postoperative GI motility recovery. METHODS: This is a matched retrospective study based on a prospective database including patients undergoing colorectal surgery without pre-habilitation (NPH) (2016-2018) and with pre-habilitation (PH group) (2018-2019). The main outcome measure was the time to GI-3 recovery (tolerance to solid food and flatus and/or stools). RESULTS: One hundred thirteen patients were included, 37 underwent pre-habilitation (32.7%). The patient's age, the surgical procedure, the surgical access, the rate of synchronous metastasis, the rate of preoperative chemoradiotherapy, and the rate of stoma were more important in the PH group. Conversely, the rate of patients with an ASA score of > 2 was higher in the NPH group. By matching patients according to age, gender and surgical procedure, 84 patients were compared (61 in the NPH group and 23 in the PH group). The mean of GI-3 recovery was significantly lower in the PH group. The other endpoints were not significantly different but time to GI function recovery and medical morbidity tended to be higher in the NPH group.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association among complement activation, endothelial damage and disease severity or activity in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this single-centre cohort study, 148 patients with COVID-19 of different severity were evaluated upon hospital admission and 30 days later. Markers of complement activation (SC5b-9 and C5a) and endothelial perturbation (von Willebrand factor [vWF], tissue-type plasminogen activator [t-PA], plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1], soluble thrombomodulin [sTM], and soluble endothelial selectin [sE-selectin]) were measured in plasma. RESULTS: The patients had high plasma levels of SC5b-9 and C5a (p = 0.0001 for both) and vWF, t-PA and PAI-1 (p = 0.0001 for all). Their SC5b-9 levels correlated with those of vWF (r = 0.517, p = 0.0001) and paralleled disease severity (severe vs mild p = 0.0001, severe vs moderate p = 0.026 and moderate vs mild p = 0.001).

We believe this study will help pre-digital organizations to rethink their strategies according to employee involvement to respond to the challenges of digital transformation. The study also encourages scholars to investigate whether and how those factors are shaped differently due to COVID-19 pandemic context.","output":"Digital workplace transformation in the financial service sector: Investigating the relationship between employees' expectations and intentions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This systematic review was conducted to summarize and clarify the evidence on the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin-D [25(OH)D] concentrations and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) risk and outcomes. PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases and Google Scholar were searched up to 26 November 2020. All retrospective and prospective cohort, cross-sectional, case-control, and randomized controlled trial studies that investigated the relation between 25(OH)D and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19 severity were included. Thirty-nine studies were included in the current systematic review. In studies that were adjusted (OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.24, 2.53; I2: 44.2%) and nonadjusted for confounders (OR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.44, 2.13; I2: 33.0%) there was a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the vitamin D deficiency (VDD) group. Fifteen studies evaluated associations between VDD and composite severity. In the studies that were adjusted (OR: 2.57; 95% CI: 1.65, 4.01; I2 = 0.0%) and nonadjusted for confounders (OR: 10.61; 95% CI: 2.07, 54.23; I2 = 90.8%) there was a higher severity in the VDD group. Analysis of studies with crude OR (OR: 2.62; 95% CI: 1.13, 6.05; I2: 47.9%), and adjusted studies that used the Cox survival method (HR: 2.35; 95% CI: 1.22, 4.52; I2: 84%) indicated a significant association of VDD with mortality, while in adjusted studies that used logistic regression, no relation was observed (OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.75; I2: 76.6%). The results of studies that examined relations between VDD and intensive care unit (ICU) admission, pulmonary complications, hospitalization, and inflammation were inconsistent. In conclusion, although studies were heterogeneous in methodological and statistical approach, most of them indicated a significant relation between 25(OH)D and SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 composite severity, and mortality. With regard to infection, caution should be taken in interpreting the results, due to inherent study limitations. For ICU admission, inflammation, hospitalization, and pulmonary involvement, the evidence is currently inconsistent and insufficient.","output":"Association of Vitamin D Status with SARS-CoV-2 Infection or COVID-19 Severity: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The present study aims to identify the death awareness and spiritual experience of the health care workers in Iran.","output":"The death awareness and spiritual experience of health care workers during Coronavirus outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: What effect does a novel education programme have on emergency hospital transfers of, and advance care planning decisions among, nursing home residents?

OBJECTIVE: To characterize e-cigarette use behaviors among US youth in 2020. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The 2020 National Youth Tobacco Survey, a nationally representative, cross-sectional, school-based survey of middle school (grades 6-8) and high school (grades 9-12) students, was conducted from January 16, 2020, to March 16, 2020. A total of 14 531 students from 180 schools participated in the 2020 survey, yielding a corresponding student-level participation rate of 87.4% and school-level participation rate of 49.9%. The overall response rate, a product of the school-level and student-level participation rates, was 43.6%. EXPOSURES: Current (past 30-day) e-cigarette use. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-reported current e-cigarette use behaviors (frequency of use, usual e-cigarette brand, and access source) by school level and flavored e-cigarette use and flavor types among current e-cigarette users by school level and device type. Prevalence estimates were weighted to account for the complex survey design. RESULTS: Overall, 14 531 students completed the survey, including 7330 female students and 7133 male students with self-reported grade level and sex. In 2020, 19.6% (95% CI, 17.2%-22.2%) of high school students and 4.7% (95% CI, 3.6%-6.0%) of middle school students reported current e-cigarette use. Among them, 38.9% (95% CI, 35.2%-42.6%) of high school users and 20.0% (95% CI, 16.0%-24.8%) of middle school users reported e-cigarette use on 20 to 30 days within the past 30 days. Among current users, JUUL was the most commonly reported usual brand (high school: 25.4%; 95% CI, 18.8%-33.4%; middle school: 35.1%; 95% CI, 27.9%-43.1%). Among current users, the most common source of obtaining e-cigarettes was from a friend (high school: 57.1%; 95% CI, 52.6%-61.4%; middle school: 58.9%; 95% CI, 51.4%-66.1%). Among current users, 84.7% (95% CI, 82.2%-86.9%) of high school students and 73.9% (95% CI, 66.9%-79.8%) of middle school students reported flavored e-cigarette use. Fruit-flavored e-cigarettes were the most commonly reported flavor among current exclusive e-cigarette users of prefilled pods or cartridges (67.3%; 95% CI, 60.9%-73.0%), disposable e-cigarettes (85.8%; 95% CI, 79.8%-90.3%), and tank-based devices (82.7%; 95% CI, 68.9%-91.1%), followed by mint-flavored e-cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest that although current e-cigarette use decreased during 2019 to 2020, overall prevalence, frequent use, and flavored e-cigarette use remained high. Continued actions are warranted to prevent and reduce e-cigarette use among US youth.","output":"Characteristics of e-Cigarette Use Behaviors Among US Youth, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Food production accounts for 30% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Less environmentally sustainable diets are also often more processed, energy-dense and nutrient-poor. To date, the environmental impact of diets have mostly been based on a limited number of broad food groups. OBJECTIVES: We link GHG emissions to over 3000 foods, assessing associations between individuals GHG emissions, their nutrient requirements and their demographic characteristics. We also identify additional information required in dietary assessment to generate more accurate environmental impact data for individual-level diets. METHODS: GHG emissions of individual foods, including process stages prior to retail, were added to the UK Composition Of Foods Integrated Dataset (COFID) composition tables and linked to automated online dietary assessment for 212 adults over three 24-hour periods. Variations in GHG emissions were explored by dietary pattern, demographic characteristics and World Health Organization Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs). RESULTS: GHG emissions estimates were linked to 98% (n = 3233) of food items. Meat explained 32% of diet-related GHG emissions; 15% from drinks; 14% from dairy; and 8% from cakes, biscuits and confectionery. Non-vegetarian diets had GHG emissions 59% (95% CI 18%, 115%) higher than vegetarian. Men had 41% (20%, 64%) higher GHG emissions than women. Individuals meeting RNIs for saturated fats, carbohydrates and sodium had lower GHG emissions compared to those exceeding the RNI. DISCUSSION: Policies encouraging sustainable diets should focus on plant-based diets. Substituting tea, coffee and alcohol with more sustainable alternatives, whilst reducing less nutritious sweet snacks, presents further opportunities. Healthier diets had lower GHG emissions, demonstrating consistency between planetary and personal health. Further detail could be gained from incorporating brand, production methods, post-retail emissions, country of origin, and additional environmental impact indicators.","output":"Variations in greenhouse gas emissions of individual diets: Associations between the greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient intake in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The Q223R polymorphism of the leptin receptor (LEPR) gene is one of the most common polymorphisms and it is believed to be associated with a damaged capacity of LEPR signaling and with high circulating leptin levels. METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional, analytical study was carried out in the Autonomous University of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, where a sample of young adult participants (ranging from 18 to 30 years of age) was obtained. They were classified based on the results of body mass index: non-obese, and overweight/obese. The polymorphic variant was determined by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) from the DNA sample and serum leptin levels were measured by Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay. RESULTS: A total of 159 participants were included (non-obese, n=103; overweight/obese, n=56). Leptin levels were 15.1412.3 ng/mL in the non-obese group and 26.1319.0 ng/mL in the overweight/obese group (p0.001). The allelic frequencies of the Q and R alleles of the LEPR gene in the studied subjects were as follows: non-obese, Q=0.56, R=0.44; overweight/obese, Q=0.62, R=0.38. The relative risk for the Q/Q genotype was 1.18 (Cl 0.53-2.34), for Q/R was 1.14 (Cl 0.59-2.18) and for R/R was 0.59 (Cl 0.23-1.50). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that leptin levels are associated with overweight/obesity in Mexican young adults, but this is not related to the presence of the Q223R polymorphism in the LEPR gene, so the underlying mechanisms for a possible disturbance in leptin signaling in obese Mexican young adults await further studies.","output":"Leptin Levels and Q223R Leptin Receptor Gene Polymorphism in Obese Mexican Young Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nuclear medicine has an important role in the care of newborns and children less than 1 y old.

Despite the rapidly increasing number of cases in subsequent weeks, the clinical characteristics of pediatric cases are rarely described. A cross-sectional multicenter study was carried out in 10 hospitals across Hubei province. A total of 25 confirmed pediatric cases of COVID-19 were collected. The demographic data, epidemiological history, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiological data, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed. Of 25 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the boy to girl ratio was 1.27:1. The median age was 3 years. COVID-19 cases in children aged <3 years, 3.6 years, and &#8805;6-years patients were 10 (40%), 6 (24%), and 9 (36%), respectively. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (13 [52%]), and dry cough (11 [44%]). Chest CT images showed essential normal in 8 cases (33.3%), unilateral involvement of lungs in 5 cases (20.8%), and bilateral involvement in 11 cases (45.8%). Clinical diagnoses included upper respiratory tract infection (n=8), mild pneumonia (n=15), and critical cases (n=2). Two critical cases (8%) were given invasive mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, and immunoglobulin. The symptoms in 24 (96%) of 25 patients were alleviated and one patient had been discharged. It was concluded that children were susceptible to COVID-19 like adults, while the clinical presentations and outcomes were more favorable in children.

We present the perspectives of diverse, experienced mentors in a range of HIV research disciplines on the impact of COVID-19 on mentoring the next generation of HIV researchers. In November to December, 2020, we used an online data collection platform to cross-sectionally query previously-trained HIV mentors on the challenges related to mentoring during the pandemic, surprising/positive aspects of mentoring in that context, and recommendations for other mentors. Data were coded and analyzed following a thematic analysis approach. Respondents (180 of 225 mentors invited [80% response]) reported challenges related to relationship building/maintenance, disruptions in mentees training and research progress, and mentee and mentor distress, with particular concerns regarding mentees who are parents or from underrepresented minority backgrounds. Positive/surprising aspects included logistical ease of remote mentoring, the relationship-edifying result of the shared pandemic experience, mentee resilience and gratitude, and increased enjoyment of mentoring. Recommendations included practical tips, encouragement for patience and persistence, and prioritizing supporting mentees and one's own mental well-being. Findings revealed gaps in HIV mentors competencies, including the effective use of remote mentoring tools, how to work with mentees in times of distress, and the prioritization of mentor well-being. Mentors are in a unique position to identify and potentially address factors that may lead to mentees leaving their fields, especially parents and those from underrepresented backgrounds.

The activation of dendritic cells (DC) via the STING pathway, and their subsequent production of type I interferon (IFN) is considered central to eradicating tumours in mouse models. However, this contribution of STING in preclinical murine studies has not translated into positive outcomes of STING agonists in phase I & II clinical trials. We therefore questioned whether a difference in human DC responses could be critical to the lack of STING agonist efficacy in human settings. This study sought to directly compare mouse and human plasmacytoid DCs and conventional DC subset responses upon STING activation. We found all mouse and human DC subsets were potently activated by STING stimulation. As expected, Type I IFNs were produced by both mouse and human plasmacytoid DCs. However, mouse and human plasmacytoid and conventional DCs all produced type III IFNs (i.e., IFN-s) in response to STING activation. Of particular interest, all human DCs produced large amounts of IFN-1, not expressed in the mouse genome. Furthermore, we also found differential cell death responses upon STING activation, observing rapid ablation of mouse, but not human, plasmacytoid DCs. STING-induced cell death in murine plasmacytoid DCs occurred in a cell-intrinsic manner and involved intrinsic apoptosis. These data highlight discordance between STING IFN and cell death responses in mouse and human DCs and caution against extrapolating STING-mediated events in mouse models to equivalent human outcomes.","output":"Discordance in STING-Induced Activation and Cell Death Between Mouse and Human Dendritic Cell Populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

To understand the impact that COVID-19 has had on the myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patient population, we conducted an internet based survey. Methods: Survey: This survey was hosted Mayo Clinic's secured REDCap system for online surveys with a link to the survey alongside a brief description posted via the www.mpnqol.com website, as well as other MPN organizational partners. Survey responses were completely anonymous. Questions included MPN-Total symptom score (TSS), NCCN distress thermometer (NCCN-DT), questions regarding impact on medical care, and questions from CDC COVID-19 community survey question bank regarding the impact of social distancing as well as changes in health behaviors. Distress thermometer, MPN-TSS, and/or questions related to the impact of COVID-19 on MPN treatment were analyzed by: MPN diagnosis, among those with ET, PV, or MF diagnoses; medication status; stay at home order; community spread; and country. Associations were tested using Kruskal-Wallis or Wilcoxon rank sum tests (for continuous variables) or Fisher Exact tests (for categorical variables). Analysis: Results: Patient Demographics (Table 1): 1560 people responded to the survey, 1217 were eligible for analysis. Median age was 62 (range: 21-93), and 298 (24.6%) respondents were male. There were respondents from USA, Australia, Canada, Netherlands, Ireland, and UK. 233 patients (19.2%) have myelofibrosis, 419 (34.6%) polycythemia vera and 543 (44.8%) essential thrombocythemia. At the time of the COVID outbreak, 1026 (84.3%) were on MPN directed medical therapy, including ruxolitinib (15.3%), interferon (14.7%), hydroxyurea (42.7%) and ASA (47.7%). 165 (13.6%) respondents received COVID testing, of which 5 had positive tests. Impact on MPN Care (Table 2): We sought to understand how patient's clinical care changed. Over half respondents who spoke to their MPN doctor had a telemedicine visit after COVID19 (57.1%). 422 (36.5%) patients spaced out visits, of which 99 (22.7%) felt there were consequences. A change in therapy due to COVID-1 occurred in only 5.4% of patients. MPN Symptom Burden and QoL: Data captured on the NCCN-DT had a median of 4 (0-10). MPN-SAF-TSS composite score was collected in 1150 respondents, median score was 26 (0-90). These scores are higher than those previously reported. Pandemic Impact on Lifestyle (Table 1): 595 (49.5%) of patients report living in a community where there is significant COVID-19 spread. 946 (78.9%) reported that COVID-19 has impacted their day to day life. 198 (17.2%) of patients agreed, or strongly agreed that COVID had a significant impact on their finances. 799 (67.8%) had a stay at home order. Of those who quarantined (112), the median duration was 30d (1-120). The majority of people increased hand-washing, and cleaning habits. 954 (81.7%) respondents reported wearing masks in public. 908 (76.8%) reported increased stress from social distancing. The majority of respondents report using healthy coping habits, such as reaching out to friends/loved ones, breathing and relaxation, as well as healthy diet. Less than 15% of patients report unhealthy coping strategies, such as use of opioids, benzodiazepines, alcohol, or cannabis Factors associated with response: There were no differences in responses based on type of MPN. If a patient was on medication, they were more likely to have spoken to their provider (p<0.001). If there was a stay at home order in place, there was a higher MPN-TSS score (p<0.001). If the respondent lived in an area of high community spread, they had a higher NCCN-DT score (p<0.001). Patients in the USA had a higher NCCN-DT score (p=0.001), were more likely to stretch out the duration of time between visits (p<0.001) and less likely to have a telemedicine visit (p<0.001). Although fewer respondents in the USA thought COVID-19 was a serious disease (p=0.02), a higher percentage of respondents wore masks (p <0.001). Conclusions: In our survey of MPN patients, there were many changes noted in clinical care. The use of telemedicine was common, and at least a third had significant changes in their care. Most experienced increased stress, however, employed healthy coping strategies. Only a minority of patients had a COVID test, and only 5 were positive, further data will be needed to understand the impact of COVID infection.

Off-label prescribing (i.e. prescribing a drug for an indication outside of that for which it is licensed) is legal and an integral part of medical practice. In psychiatry, off-label prescribing is common and gives clinicians scope to treat patients who are refractory to standard therapy or where there is no licensed medication for an indication. However, efficacy or safety of such off-label use may not be established. There is a growing list of licensed indications for atypical antipsychotics (AAP) beyond schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder, and also more evidence for other indications where pharmaceutical companies have not obtained a license. Pharmaceutical companies have promoted AAPs for off-label indications to increase sales and consequently have been fined by the US FDA for this. Since the 1990s, AAP use has expanded considerably, for example, the off-label use of quetiapine alone accounted for an estimated 17% of the AAP spend in New Zealand in 2010. There are a number of potential problems with the expanded use of AAPs outside of schizophrenia and related psychoses. A larger population will be exposed to their adverse effects, which include weight gain, type 2 diabetes mellitus, sudden cardiac death and increased mortality rates in the elderly with dementia. There are also concerns with the abuse of these agents, in particular quetiapine. Given that an increasing percentage of the population is being treated with these agents, off-label prescribing of AAPs is a cause for concern; they have a propensity to cause significant side effects and their efficacy and long-term safety for most off-label indications remains largely unknown, and therefore the risks and benefits of their use should be carefully weighed up prior to prescribing these agents off-label.","output":"Off-label use of atypical antipsychotics: cause for concern?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a reduction in emergency department visits and hospital admissions.

Background Artificial intelligence implementation in healthcare settings is rapidly growing, though its widespread use in clinical practice is still limited. The employment of machine learning algorithms in thoracic surgery is wide-ranging, including all steps of the clinical pathway. Methods We performed a narrative review of the literature on Scopus, PubMed and Cochrane databases, including all the relevant studies published in the last ten years, until March 2021. Conclusion Machine learning methods are promising encouraging results throughout the key issues of thoracic surgery, both clinical, organizational, and educational. Artificial intelligence-based technologies showed remarkable efficacy to improve the perioperative evaluation of the patient, to assist the decision-making process, to enhance the surgical performance, and to optimize the operating room scheduling. Still, some concern remains about data supply, protection, and transparency, thus further studies and specific consensus guidelines are needed to validate these technologies for daily common practice.

During such periods of isolation, people with psychoactive substance-related disorders and other addictions may be tempted to reduce tension, stress, uncertainty and possible distress by increasing the use of substances or practices they have abused. This can mean relapses and setbacks for patients undergoing treatment. A multidisciplinary team of health professionals specializing in addiction at the Center for Academic Development in Drug Addiction, in Havana, Cuba, cares for people with these disorders and followed their evolution during the initial period of COVID-19 social isolation. With the aim of characterizing strategies employed by patients undergoing treatment for substance abuse and addictions, we conducted a qualitative study from April 2020 through May 2020, using a convenience sample of 37 patients (all students) who had been progressing towards recovery from addictive behaviors when face-to-face encounters were suspended due to COVID-19 restrictions. Contact was maintained through information and communication technologies. The research used telepsychology and focused on understanding patient life experiences. Patients were interviewed using a semi-structured survey, which was then transcribed and coded thematically using a grounded-theory approach. We found that patients' ability to cope successfully with challenges presented by COVID-19 were influenced by: 1) the individual's own methods for maintaining self-control (commitment to studies, projects, and work with therapists) that aided them in their goals concerning abstinence; 2) difficulties faced in addressing specific events and situations (doubts, uncertainties, disagreements, isolation and time use); 3) perpetuation and revivification of myths related to substances and addictive activities (exacerbation of supposed benefits of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, overuse of social networks); and 4) tendencies toward irrationality and lack of emotional control (fear, sadness, anger, constant worry and self-imposed demands). Our findings suggest that despite the potential negative psychological impact of preventive social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, individual coping mechanisms developed by these patients, aiming at improved self-control, allowed most to avoid setbacks that could have affected their recovery. Nevertheless, patients faced challenges to their recovery that were compounded by difficulties in specific situations, myths related to substances and addictive activities, and tendencies toward irrationality or lack of emotional control.","output":"Persons with Substance Abuse Disorders and Other Addictions: Coping with the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Lung point-of-care ultrasonography (L-POCUS) is highly effective in detecting pulmonary peripheral patterns and may allow early identification of patients who are likely to develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We hypothesized that L-POCUS performed during the initial examination would identify non-severe COVID-19 patients with a high risk of getting worse. Methods POCUSCO was a prospective, multicenter study. Non-critical adult patients who were admitted to the emergency department (ED) for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were included and had L-POCUS performed within 48 hours following admission. The severity of lung damage was assessed using the L-POCUS score based on 36 points for ARDS. The primary outcome was the rate of patients requiring intubation or who died within 14 days following inclusion. Results Among 296 participating patients, 8 (2.7%) had primary outcome. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic of L-POCUS was 0.80 [95%CI:0.60-0.94]. The score values which achieved a sensibility > 95% in defining low-risk patients and a specificity > 95% in defining high-risk patients were <1 and []16, respectively. The rate of patients with an unfavorable outcome was 0/95 (0%[95%CI:0-3.9]) for low-risk patients (score=0) versus 4/184 (2.17%[95%CI:0.8-5.5]) for intermediate-risk patients (score 1-15) and 4/17 (23.5%[95%CI:11.4-42.4]) for high-risk patients (score []16).

We investigated how media framed bats and bat-associated diseases before and during the COVID-19 pandemic by assessing the content of 2651 online reports published across 26 countries, to understand how and how quickly worldwide media may have affected the perception of bats. We show that the overabundance of poorly contextualized reports on bat-associated diseases likely increased the persecution towards bats immediately after the COVID-19 outbreak.

Achieving this goal seemed inevitable in 1982 when a series of calcium channel blockers were demonstrated to restore the efficacy of chemotherapy agents. A large number of other compounds have since been demonstrated to restore chemotherapeutic sensitivity in cancer cells or tissues. Where do we stand almost three decades since the first reports of ABCB1 inhibition? Unfortunately, in the aftermath of extensive fundamental and clinical research efforts the situation remains gloomy. Only a small handful of compounds have reached late stage clinical trials and none are in routine clinical usage to circumvent chemoresistance. Why has the translation process been so ineffective? One factor is the multifactorial nature of drug resistance inherent to cancer tissues; ABCB1 is not the sole factor. However, expression of ABCB1 remains a significant negative prognostic indicator and is closely associated with poor response to chemotherapy in many cancer types. The main difficulties with restoration of sensitivity to chemotherapy reside with poor properties of the ABCB1 inhibitors: (1) low selectivity to ABCB1, (2) poor potency to inhibit ABCB1, (3) inherent toxicity and/or (4) adverse pharmacokinetic interactions with anticancer drugs. Despite these difficulties, there is a clear requirement for effective inhibitors and to date the strategies for generating such compounds have involved serendipity or simple chemical syntheses. This chapter outlines more sophisticated approaches making use of bioinformatics, combinatorial chemistry and structure informed drug design.

The increased incidence of rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis is a matter of concern, as this fulminant infection has high morbidity and mortality. Hence, it is imperative to understand its imaging features, for early diagnosis, staging and treatment. METHODS: We systematically reviewed 32 COVID-19 cases with imaging diagnosis of acute invasive fungal rhino-sinusitis or rhino-orbital-cerebral disease between March to May 2021. These patients underwent contrast MRI of the paranasal sinus, orbit and brain. Contrast enhanced CT chest and paranasal sinuses were done as needed. RESULTS: The age group ranged between 30 to 71 yrs with male preponderance. The most common predisposing factors were intravenous steroid therapy and supplemental oxygen. All cases were confirmed by fungal culture and most common was Mucor. The rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis was staged as below In our study we found that the most common site in the nasal cavity was the middle turbinate /meatus and the earliest sign was non-enhancing / black turbinate. Premaxillary and retroantral fat necrosis was the earliest sign of soft tissue invasion. Spread via the sphenopalatine foramen and pterygopalatine fossa was more common than bony erosions. Orbital cellulitis and optic neuritis were the most common among stage 3 cases. Of patients with CNS involvement, the most common were cavernous sinus thrombosis and trigeminal neuritis. Two patients with pulmonary mucormycosis showed large necrotic cavitary lesions, giving the characteristic birds nest appearance. Figure 1.

[Image: see text] Figure 3: Contrast enhanced axial T1 FS images of paranasal sinuses shows necrotic non-enhancing left middle meatus spreading along sphenopalatine foramen in to pterygopalatine fossa (arrow head) [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The mortality rate was 20% in our study. In our short term follow up, 30 % of recovered patients had relapse on imaging due to incomplete clearance and partial antifungal treatment. High clinical suspicion and low imaging threshold are vital for early Mucormycosis detection in COVID-19 patients.

Profound inflammation is the hallmark of severe COVID-19 disease, and commonly does not occur until the second week of infection. Although risk factors for this late hyperinflammatory disease have been identified, most notably age and pre-existing co-morbidities, even within high-risk groups the specific factors leading to severe COVID-19 illness remain elusive. Acquired somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), termed clonal hematopoiesis (CH), are associated with advanced age, and loss of function (LOF) mutations in certain genes, most commonly DNMT3A and TET2, have been linked to a marked hyperinflammatory phenotype as well as clonal expansion of mutant HSPCs. Given the similar age range of frequent CH and severe COVID-19 disease, the presence of CH could impact the risk of severe COVID-19. Several human cohort studies have suggested this relationship may exist, but results to date are conflicting. Rhesus macaques (RM) have been established as a model for SARS-CoV infection and are being utilized to test therapies and vaccine development, but up to now, macaques have not been reported to develop late hyperinflammatory COVID-19 disease. We have created a robust RM model of CH by introducing LOF TET2 mutations into young adult HSPC via CRISPR/Cas9 followed by autologous transplantation, recapitulating the clonal expansion and hyperinflammatory phenotype. Thus, we hypothesized that macaques with CH could develop severe late COVID-19 disease and be utilized as a model to study disease pathophysiology or test therapeutic approaches. Macaques with either engineered (n=2) or natural CH (n=1) along with age-matched transplanted controls (n=3) were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and monitored clinically and via laboratory studies until 12 days post-inoculation (dpi). Macaques normally clear infection and symptoms within 3-5 days of infection. No significant differences in clinical symptoms and blood counts were noted, however, an aged animal with natural DNMT3A CH died on 10 dpi. IL-6 levels were somewhat higher in sera of the CH animals until 12 dpi, and in BAL, mean concentrations of MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8 and MIP-1b were consistently higher in CH macaques compared to controls. Interestingly, we found the median copy number of subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA was higher at every timepoint in the CH group as compared with the control group, in both upper and lower respiratory samples. Lung sections from euthanasia at 10 or 12 dpi showed evidence of mild inflammation in all animals. However, in the immunohistochemical analysis, the viral antigen was detected in the lung tissues of all three animals in the CH group even at the time of autopsy, whereas only one animal of three controls had detectable viral antigen. Although the striking inflammation and serious disease have not been observed, data so far provide evidence of potential pathophysiological differences with or without CH upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. We continue to expand sample size and conduct further analyses to draw a solid conclusion, but we believe this model may be of benefit to understand the relationship between COVID-19 disease and CH.

With the current COVID-19 pandemic, remote interpreting appears to be the most appropriate solution to address the health inequalities of migrant populations while intervening to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. The purpose of the research was to identify ways of providing a framework for the remote interpretation of public service encounters in the province of Quebec, Canada. A series of recommendations available in the literature were discussed with 27 key actors in the field during focus groups and individual conversations. A thematic analysis of participant discourse allowed us to confirm the extent to which existing recommendations were applicable, to clarify certain recommendations and to add seven new ones. The Guide to the planning and practice of remote public service interpreting (see appendices) consists of 10 recommendations on the planning and management of remote interpreting services and 25 recommendations on the actual encounter.

However, current detection methods based on Watson-Crick hybridization suffers from false positives due to the cross-reactivity of wild-type sequences. In this study, we developed an accurate identification of mutant pathogens by combining programmable DNAzyme and target nucleic acid sequence-triggered transcription. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) are the most plentiful type of mutations in the genome. High specificity to discriminate SNV was first achieved by rational design of dual-hairpin DNA structure and DNAzyme's capability of site-specific cleavage. T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription amplification was introduced to exponentially increase the sensitivity by encompassing T7 promoter sequence into the dual-hairpin DNA structure. The design of this biosensor is fast and straightforward without many computational steps, and the highly sensitive biosensor can detect not only SNVs but also occasional insertions and large deletions in the genome. We showed that the assay could rapidly detect COVID-19 variant and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and the limit of detection is 0.96 copy/L.

Although the term rat respiratory virus (RRV) was adopted to confer a putative viral etiology to the idiopathic pulmonary lesions, the etiology of this disease remains to be elucidated. Recently, inflammatory lesions have been observed in the lungs of immunocompetent laboratory rats similar to those previously described. Based on the latest evidence indicating that Pneumocystis carinii (P. carinii), and not putative RRV, causes infectious interstitial pneumonia in laboratory rats, the present study investigated whether the pulmonary lesions observed were caused by P. carinii infection. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, free of known pathogens, were introduced into a rat colony positive for RRV-type lesions. Routine histopathological examinations were performed on the rat lung tissues following exposure. The presence of Pneumocystis organisms was confirmed using Grocotts methenamine silver (GMS) staining. At week 3 following introduction, a few small lymphoid aggregates were located adjacent to the edematous vascular sheath. By week 5, foci of dense perivascular lymphoid cuffing were observed. Multifocal lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia and prominent lymphoid perivascular cuffs were observed between week 7 and 10. GMS staining confirmed the presence of Pneumocystis cysts. Thus, the results of the present study demonstrated that P. carinii caused lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia in a group of laboratory rats.

When $R_{0}<1$, the disease-free equilibrium point is unique and locally asymptotically stable. When $R_{0}>1$, the endemic equilibrium point is also unique. Furthermore, some conditions are established to ensure the local asymptotic stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. The trend of COVID-19 spread in the United States is predicted. Considering the influence of the individual behavior and government mitigation measurement, a modified SEIQRP model is proposed, defined as SEIQRPD model. According to the real data of the United States, it is found that our improved model has a better prediction ability for the epidemic trend in the next two weeks.

Methods Fifty-eight COVID-19 patients post-hospital discharge and 30 comorbidity-matched controls were prospectively enrolled for multiorgan (brain, lungs, heart, liver and kidneys) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spirometry, six-minute walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), quality of life, cognitive and mental health assessments. Findings At 2-3 months from disease-onset, 64% of patients experienced persistent breathlessness and 55% complained of significant fatigue. On MRI, tissue signal abnormalities were seen in the lungs (60%), heart (26%), liver (10%) and kidneys (29%) of patients. COVID-19 patients also exhibited tissue changes in the thalamus, posterior thalamic radiations and sagittal stratum on brain MRI and demonstrated impaired cognitive performance, specifically in the executive and visuospatial domain relative to controls. Exercise tolerance (maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency on CPET) and six-minute walk distance (405{+/-}118m vs 517{+/-}106m in controls, p<0.0001) were significantly reduced in patients. The extent of extra-pulmonary MRI abnormalities and exercise tolerance correlated with serum markers of ongoing inflammation and severity of acute illness. Patients were more likely to report symptoms of moderate to severe anxiety (35% versus 10%, p=0.012) and depression (39% versus 17%, p=0.036) and significant impairment in all domains of quality of life compared to controls. Interpretation A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital experience ongoing symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, anxiety, depression and exercise limitation at 2-3 months from disease-onset. Persistent lung and extra-pulmonary organ MRI findings are common.

We performed a random effects single-arm meta-analysis of studies to calculate pooled proportion estimates for pro-arrhythmic effects. Meta-regression analyses were conducted to explain between-study heterogeneity. RESULTS: Thirty-four studies with a total of 3088 patients were included. Among 12 studies, the incidence of > 60ms QTc prolongation from baseline was 13% (95% CI 9%-18%, I2 = 73%), whereas, among 28 studies, the incidence of QTc  500 ms at follow-up was 8% (95% CI 6%-11%, I2 = 78%).

Geographic information systems and big geospatial technologies have come to the forefront in this fight against COVID-19 by playing an important role by integrating multisourced data, enhanced and rapid analytics of mapping services, location analytics, and spatial tracking of confirmed, forecasting transmission trajectories, spatial clustering of risk on epidemiologic levels, public awareness on the elimination of panic spread and decision-making support for the government and research institutions for effective prevention and control of COVID-19 cases. Big geospatial data has turned itself as the major support system for governments in dealing with this global healthcare crisis because of its advanced and innovative technological capabilities from preparation of data to modeling the results with quick and large accessibility to every spatial scale. This robust data-driven system using the accurate and prediction geoanalysis is being widely used by governments and public health institutions interfaced with both health and nonhealth digital data repositories for mining the individual and regional datasets for breaking the transmission chain. Profiling of confirmed cases on the basis of location and temporality and then visualizing them effectively coupled with behavioral and critical geographic variables such as mobility patterns, demographic data, and population density enhance the predictive analytics of big geospatial data.

Our method captures semantic information from the whole lung and highlights the functionality of each lung region for better representation learning. The method is then integrated to the last stage of the proposed transfer learning framework to reuse the complex patterns learned from the same CT images. We use a base model integrating self-attention (ATTNs) and convolutional operations. Experimental results show that networks with ATTNs induce greater performance improvement through transfer learning than networks without ATTNs.

Group 2 was instrumented using an 8-hole (3.5-mm-diameter) precontoured posterolateral LCP plate placed on the distal humerus. Four-point bending tests and torsion tests were performed until the specimens broke. Results: The four-point bending stiffness test showed that the stiffness of anterolaterally fixed humeri was significantly higher than that of posterolaterally fixed humeri (p<0.05). Torsion testing revealed that posterolateral fixation was associated with better yield strength (p<0.05), but the torsional stiffness did not differ significantly between the two plates (p> 0.05). Conclusions: The anterolateral plate exhibited higher bending stiffness and torsional yield strength than the posterolateral plate.

Of special interest are their roles in innate immunity, inflammation, and virus replication. We discuss novel roles of TRIM proteins during virus infections that lead to increased pathogenicity. RECENT FINDINGS: TRIM proteins regulate different antiviral and inflammatory signaling pathways, mostly by promoting ubiquitination of important factors including pattern recognition receptors, adaptor proteins, kinases, and transcription factors that are involved in type I interferon and NF-B pathways. Therefore, viruses have developed mechanisms to target TRIMs for immune evasion. New evidence is emerging indicating that viruses have the ability to directly use TRIMs and the ubiquitination process to enhance the viral replication cycle and cause increased pathogenesis. A new report on TRIM7 also highlights the potential pro-viral role of TRIMs via ubiquitination of viral proteins and suggests a novel mechanism by which ubiquitination of virus envelope protein may provide determinants of tissue and species tropism. SUMMARY: TRIM proteins have important functions in promoting host defense against virus infection; however, viruses have adapted to evade TRIM-mediated immune responses and can hijack TRIMs to ultimately increase virus pathogenesis. Only by understanding specific TRIM-virus interactions and by using more in vivo approaches can we learn how to harness TRIM function to develop therapeutic approaches to reduce virus pathogenesis.","output":"TRIM Proteins in Host Defense and Viral Pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[...]breaches are permissible only under certain serious circumstances, such as in the case of a public healthC reportable issue or to inform a potential victim, and possibly authorities, of impending danger or harm.5,6 In the present case, no unreasonable risk (other than those de minimis, as noted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention7) will occur to the health of the children or third parties.

No effective prophylactic or post-exposure therapy is currently available. RESULTS: We report, however, that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage. In addition to the well-known functions of chloroquine such as elevations of endosomal pH, the drug appears to interfere with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This may negatively influence the virus-receptor binding and abrogate the infection, with further ramifications by the elevation of vesicular pH, resulting in the inhibition of infection and spread of SARS CoV at clinically admissible concentrations. CONCLUSION: Chloroquine is effective in preventing the spread of SARS CoV in cell culture. Favorable inhibition of virus spread was observed when the cells were either treated with chloroquine prior to or after SARS CoV infection. In addition, the indirect immunofluorescence assay described herein represents a simple and rapid method for screening SARS-CoV antiviral compounds.","output":"Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection are at high risk of complications due to the intensive care unit stay. Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) are one of the most common complication and cause of death in this group of patients, it is important to know the epidemiology and microbiology of this hospital-acquired infections in order to begin to the patients a proper empirical treatment. We describe the epidemiologic and microbiologic characteristics of HAI in patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at intensive care unit (ICU) in a tertiary level private hospital in Mexico City. Methods From April to December 2020, data from all HAIs in patients with severe pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection with mechanical ventilation at ICU were obtained. The type of infection, microorganisms and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined. Results A total of 61 episodes of HAIs were obtained, the most common was ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) in 52.4% (n=32) followed by urinary tract infection (UTI) 34.4%(n=21) and bloodstream infection (BSI) 9.84% (n=6). Only two episodes corresponded to C. difficile associated diarrhea. We identified 82 different microorganisms, the most frequent cause of VAP was P. aeruginosa 22% (10/45) followed by K. pneumoniae 20% (9/45);for UTI, E. coli 28.5% (6/21), and S. marcescens 19% (4/21);for BSI the most frequent microorganism was S. aureus 28.5 (2/7). Regarding the antimicrobial susceptibility patters the most common were Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) Gram-negative rods followed by Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Conclusion In patients with severe COVID-19 hospitalized in the ICU the most frequent HAIs were VAP and UTI caused by P. aeruginosa and E. coli respectively.

METHODS: An ecological and time series study was conducted. Data were obtained from the Hospital Information System (SIH) of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The inflection point regression model was applied for temporal trend analyses. Trends were classified as increasing, decreasing, or stationary according to the slope of the regression line. The Annual Percent Charge (APC) and the Average Annual Percent Change (AAPC) were calculated considering a confidence interval of 95% and p-value <0.05. Furthermore, spatial distribution maps of epidemiological indicators related to PE in Brazil were elaborated. RESULTS: There was an increasing trend in the hospitalization rate for PE in Brazil, ranging from 2.57 in 2008 to 4.44/100,000 in 2019 (AAPC=5.6%; p<0.001). Total and average hospitalizations costs also showed increasing trend in the country (AAPC=9.2% and 3.0%, respectively). Still, there was a decrease in the in-hospital mortality rate (from 21.21% to 17.11%; AAPC=-1.9%; p<0.001). Similar trends were observed in most regions.

The revised Wells-Riley model, which took into account the non-uniform air distribution generated with the methods, was used to calculate the infection probability in an office room shared by ten occupants for 4 h. One of the occupants was an infector. The significance of the infector's location was studied.

Under specified conditions of this study, personalized ventilation (PV) performed the best in terms of preventing cross-infection, followed by displacement ventilation (DV), impinging jet ventilation (IJV), stratum ventilation (SV) and wall attachment ventilation (WAV). The number of infected occupants was reduced below the number obtained under the complete mixing assumption by using these air distribution methods. Mixing ventilation (MV) and diffuse ceiling ventilation (DCV) exhibited the worst performance. In comparison to the case of complete mixing the infection probability for seven out of nine susceptible occupants was higher with MV and for all occupants in the case of DCV. In SV, the position of the infector had a clear impact on the infection probability of susceptible individuals. WAV may perform better in practice if the system is well designed.

This can have different effects on chemokine function, ranging from reduced, unchanged to enhanced activity. CD26 is differentially expressed in tumors, which affects the dominant chemokine isoform present in the tumor microenvironment. In this review, we aim to recapitulate the current knowledge on the interplay between CD26 and chemokine activity in cancer. ABSTRACT: Chemokines are a large family of small chemotactic cytokines that fulfill a central function in cancer. Both tumor-promoting and -impeding roles have been ascribed to chemokines, which they exert in a direct or indirect manner. An important post-translational modification that regulates chemokine activity is the NH(2)-terminal truncation by peptidases. CD26 is a dipeptidyl peptidase (DPPIV), which typically clips a NH(2)-terminal dipeptide from the chemokine. With a certain degree of selectivity in terms of chemokine substrate, CD26 only recognizes chemokines with a penultimate proline or alanine. Chemokines can be protected against CD26 recognition by specific amino acid residues within the chemokine structure, by oligomerization or by binding to cellular glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Upon truncation, the binding affinity for receptors and GAGs is altered, which influences chemokine function. The consequences of CD26-mediated clipping vary, as unchanged, enhanced, and reduced activities are reported. In tumors, CD26 most likely has the most profound effect on CXCL12 and the interferon (IFN)-inducible CXCR3 ligands, which are converted into receptor antagonists upon truncation. Depending on the tumor type, expression of CD26 is upregulated or downregulated and often results in the preferential generation of the chemokine isoform most favorable for tumor progression. Considering the tight relationship between chemokine sequence and chemokine binding specificity, molecules with the appropriate characteristics can be chemically engineered to provide innovative therapeutic strategies in a cancer setting.","output":"The Role of Post-Translational Modifications of Chemokines by CD26 in Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although COVID-19 vaccination is warmly suggested for psoriatic patients by several dermatological societies worldwide, only a recently published Italian case-series has sustained a safe and effective role of the vaccine in this patients' subset.

METHODS: This study incorporated 527 GC patients and 441 controls from a cohort at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. The associations between GC risk and single nucleotide polymorphisms were calculated, stratified by H. pylori status, adjusting for age, sex, and smoking. mRNA expression from non-cancerous gastric mucosae was evaluated using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In the entire cohort, genome-wide association study showed no significant variants reached the genome-wide significance level. In the H. pyloriCpositive group, rs2671655 (chr17:47,468,020;hg19, GH17J049387 enhancer region) was identified at a genome-wide significance level, which was more pronounced in diffuse type GC. There was no significant variant in the H. pyloriCnegative group, indicating the effect modification of rs2671655 by H. pylori. Among the target genes of GH17J049387 enhancer (PHB1, ZNF652 and SPOP), PHB1 mRNA was expressed more in cases than in controls, who were not affected by H. pylori. By contrast, an increase in ZNF652 and SPOP in GC was observed only in the H. pyloriCnegative group (P < 0.05). Mediation analysis showed that PHB1 (P = 0.0238) and SPOP (P = 0.0328) mediated the effect of rs2671655 on GC risk. The polygenic risk score was associated with the number of rs2671655 risk alleles only in the H. pyloriCpositive group (P = 0.0112). CONCLUSION: After H. pylori infection, rs2671655 may increase GC risk, especially in diffuse-type GC, by regulating the expression of several genes that consequently modify susceptibility to GC.

Methods: Tuberculosis (TB) detected by sputum culture, the corresponding drug susceptibility tests data, and basic clinical information of TB patients diagnosed in Xi'an from January 2018 to October 2020 were collected from the management system;then the epidemic status and the drug resistance status were analyzed. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between the patients' treatment history and the drug resistance of TB strains, and the trend of changes in the drug resistance rate in retreated patients. Results: In the past three years, there was a total drug resistance rate of 25.3% in 5 146 strains of MTB, and 24.8% in treatment initiation and 38.22% in retreatment, respectively. The treatment initiation patients showed a decreased MDR-TB detection rate, and the retreated patients had an increased MDR-TB detection rate. The spectrum of MDR-TB in the retreated patients gradually became more complicated, and the resistance rate of second-line drugs such as Kanamycin and Ofloxacin gradually increased. There were 10 drug-resistant combinations mainly in H+R+S and H+R+S+E. During the year 2020 of COVID-19 epidemic, the number of initial and retreated patients decreased significantly compared with that in 2018 and 2019, but with no difference in the drug-resistance rate. There was an increasing detection rate of PDR and MDR-TB strains in the retreated patients. Multinomial logistic regression results showed that in 2020 the retreated patients had 4.28 times of developing PDR-TB (P=0.001, 95% CI=1.417-12.930), and 5.378 times of developing MDR-TB (P&lt; 0.001, 95% CI=2.641-10.952) than patients of treatment initiation. Conclusion: In the past three years, the prevention and control of drug-resistant TB in Xi'an has achieved some progress, but drug resistance in retreated patients is still serious.

The proposed method is different from existing methods as it not only uses a shared CNN feature space to train these two tasks jointly, but it also fuses predicted soft biometric features with the periocular features in the training step to improve the overall periocular recognition performance.

Precise estimates of the incidence of AMI after aSAH are unavailable. Our goal was to estimate the incidence of registry-based AMI (rb-AMI) after aSAH and determine its association with clinical outcomes. METHODS Adult patients with aSAH in the National Inpatient Samples from 2002 to 2014 were included in the study. We evaluated risk factors for rb-AMI using univariate and multivariate regression models. Clinical outcomes that were assessed included functional status at discharge, in-patient mortality, length of stay, and total hospitalization cost, adjusting for patient demographics and cardiovascular risk factors through an inverse probability weighted analysis. Subgroup analyses were further performed stratified by rb-AMI type (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] vs. non-STEMI [NSTEMI]). RESULTS A total of 139,734 patients with aSAH were identified, 3.6% of whom had rb-AMI. NSTEMI was the most common type of rb-AMI occurring after aSAH (71% vs. 29% for NSTEMI vs. STEMI, respectively). Patient characteristics associated with higher odds of rb-AMI included age, female sex, poor aSAH grade, and various cardiovascular risk factors. Rb-AMI was also associated with poor functional status at discharge, higher in-hospital mortality, and a longer and more costly hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS Rb-AMI occurs in 3.6% of patients with aSAH and is associated with poor functional status at discharge, higher in-patient mortality, and a longer and more costly hospitalization. Differentiating between different types of rb-AMI would be important in optimizing the management of patients with aSAH. Our definition of rb-AMI likely includes patients with neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy, which may confound the results.","output":"Incidence and Outcomes of Registry-Based Acute Myocardial Infarction After Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Research and clinical observations suggest that during times of pandemic many people exhibit stress- or anxiety-related psychopathology that include fear of becoming infected, fear of coming into contact with possibly contaminated objects or surfaces, fear of foreigners who might be carrying infection (i.e., disease-related xenophobia), fear of the socio-economic consequences of the pandemic, compulsive checking and reassurance-seeking regarding possible pandemic-related threats, and traumatic stress symptoms about the pandemic (e.g., nightmares, intrusive thoughts). We developed the 36-item COVID Stress Scales (CSS) to measure these features, as they pertain to COVID-19. The CSS were developed to better understand and assess COVID-19-related psychopathology. The scales were intentionally designed so they could be readily adapted for future pandemics. The CSS were developed and initially validated in population-representative samples from Canada (N = 3,479) and the United States (N = 3,375). A stable 5-factor solution was identified, corresponding to scales assessing COVID-related stress and anxiety symptoms: (1) Danger and contamination fears, (2) fears about economic consequences, (3) xenophobia, (4) compulsive checking, and (5) traumatic stress symptoms about COVID-19. The scales performed well on various indices of reliability and validity. The scales were intercorrelated, providing evidence of a COVID Stress Syndrome. The scales offer promise as tools for better understanding the psychopathology associated with COVID-19 and for identifying people in need of mental health services.","output":"Development and Initial Validation of the COVID Stress Scales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic prompted rapid changes in cancer care delivery. We sought to examine oncology provider perspectives on clinical decisions and care delivery during the pandemic and to compare provider views early versus late in the pandemic. Methods: We invited oncology providers, including attendings, trainees and advanced practice providers, to complete a cross-sectional online survey using a variety of outreach methods including social media (Twitter), email contacts, word of mouth and provider list-serves. We surveyed providers at two time points during the pandemic when the number of COVID-19 cases was rising in the United States, early (March 2020) and late (January 2021). The survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Chisquared tests to evaluate differences in early versus late provider responses. Results: A total of 132 providers completed the survey and most were white (n = 73/132, 55%) and younger than 49 years (n = 88/132, 67%). Respondents were attendings in medical, surgical or radiation oncology (n = 61/132, 46%), advanced practice providers (n = 48/132, 36%) and oncology fellows (n = 16/132, 12%) who predominantly practiced in an academic medical center (n = 120/132, 91%). The majority of providers agreed patients with cancer are at higher risk than other patients to be affected by COVID-19 (n = 121/132, 92%). However, there was a significant difference in the proportion of early versus late providers who thought delays in cancer care were needed. Early in the pandemic, providers were more likely to recommend delays in curative surgery or radiation for early-stage cancer (p < 0.001), delays in adjuvant chemotherapy after curative surgery (p = 0.002), or delays in surveillance imaging for metastatic cancer (p < 0.001). The majority of providers early in the pandemic responded that reducing risk of a complication from a COVID-19 infection to patients with cancer was the primary reason for recommending delays in care (n = 52/76, 68%). Late in the pandemic, however, providers were more likely to agree that any practice change would have a negative impact on patient outcomes (p = 0.003). At both time points, the majority of providers agreed with the need for other care delivery changes, including screening patients for infectious symptoms (n = 128/132, 98%) and the use of telemedicine (n = 114/132, 86%) during the pandemic. Conclusions: We found significant differences in provider perspectives of delays in cancer care early versus late in the pandemic which reflects the swiftly evolving oncology practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies are needed to determine the impact of changes in treatment and care delivery on outcomes for patients with cancer.","output":"Evolving oncology provider perspectives on care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveTo review evidence of the effectiveness of travel measures implemented during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to recommend change on how evidence is incorporated in the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR). DesignWe used an abbreviated preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis protocol (PRISMA-P) and a search strategy aimed to identify studies that investigated the effectiveness of travel-related measures (advice, entry and exit screening, medical examination or vaccination requirements, isolation or quarantine, the refusal of entry, and entry restrictions), pre-printed or published by June 1, 2020. ResultsWe identified 29 studies, of which 26 were modelled (vs. observational). Thirteen studies investigated international measures while 17 investigated domestic measures (one investigated both), including suspended transportation (24 studies), border restrictions (21), and screening (5). There was a high level of agreement that the adoption of travel measures led to important changes in the dynamics of the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most of the identified studies investigated the initial export of cases out of Wuhan, which was found to be highly effective, but few studies investigated the effectiveness of measures implemented in other contexts. Early implementation was identified as a determinant of effectiveness. Most studies of international travel measures failed to account for domestic travel measures, and thus likely led to biased estimates. Poor data and other factors contributed to the low quality of the studies identified. ConclusionTravel measures, especially those implemented in Wuhan, played a key role in shaping the early transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the effectiveness of these measures was short-lived. There is an urgent need to address important evidence gaps, but also a need to review the way in which evidence is incorporated in the IHR in the early phases of a novel infectious disease outbreak. What is already known on this subject?O_LIPrevious reviews of the evidence from outbreaks of influenza and other infectious disease have generally found that there is limited evidence that travel-measures are effective at containing outbreaks. C_LIO_LIHowever, it is unclear if the lessons from other infectious disease outbreaks would be relevant in the context of COVID-19. C_LIO_LIBased on evidence at the time, WHO did not recommend any travel restrictions when it declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. C_LI What does this study add?O_LIThis study rapidly reviews the evidence on the effectiveness of travel measures implemented in the early phase of the pandemic on epidemiological countries. C_LIO_LIThe study investigated both international and domestic travel measures and a wide range of travel measures. C_LIO_LIThe study finds that the domestic travel measures implemented in Wuhan were effective at reducing the importation of cases internationally and within China. The study also finds that travel measures are more effective when implemented earlier in the outbreak. C_LIO_LIThe findings generate recommendations on how to incorporate evidence into the International Health Regulations and highlights important research gaps that remain. C_LI How might this affect future outbreaks?O_LIThe findings of this study suggest the need to decouple recommendations of travel measures from the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern. C_LIO_LIHighlights the need to evaluate the potential effectiveness of travel measures for each outbreak, and not just assume effectiveness based on past outbreak scnearios.

COVID-19 has been associated with immune dysregulation of the host which might increase the risk of infections like HSVE following SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is paucity of literature on post COVID-19 HSVE. This study was conducted with the aim of analysing the clinical presentation, brain imaging, and outcome of patients presenting with HSVE within six weeks of COVID-19 and providing a comprehensive review on the possible mechanisms of post COVID-19 HSVE. METHODS: This observational study included patients who had laboratory confirmed HSVE (type 1 or type 2) and a history of COVID-19 within the previous six weeks. Patients were followed up for 3 months. RESULTS: Eight patients were included and all of them had type 1 HSVE. The mean latency of onset of neurological symptoms from being diagnosed with COVID-19 is 23.87 days and majority of the patients have received injectable steroids with a mean duration of 6.5 days. Behavioral abnormality was the commonest neurological presentation and typical brain imaging involved T2 FLAIR hyperintensities of the medial temporal lobes. All patients received intravenous acyclovir 10mg/kg every eight hourly for atleast 14 days. One patient with concomitant rhinocerebral mucormycosis succumbed while majority had complete recovery. CONCLUSION: Possible immune dysregulation in COVID-19 may increase the susceptibility of HSVE in patients with history of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

It can lead to an array of pathological conditions, including but not limited to a decreased capability to surveil and clear senescent cells (SnCs) and cancerous cells, an increased autoimmune responses leading to tissue damage, a reduced ability to tackle pathogens, and a decreased competence to illicit a robust response to vaccination. Cellular senescence is a phenomenon by which oncogene-activated, stressed or damaged cells undergo a stable cell cycle arrest. Failure to efficiently clear SnCs results in their accumulation in an organism as it ages. SnCs actively secrete a myriad of molecules, collectively called senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which are factors that cause dysfunction in the neighboring tissue. Though both cellular senescence and immunosenescence have been studied extensively and implicated in various pathologies, their relationship has not been greatly explored. In the wake of an ongoing pandemic (COVID-19) that disproportionately affects the elderly, immunosenescence as a function of age has become a topic of great importance.

ACE2 is thus key to the infection and treatment of the coronavirus. ACE2 is highly expressed in the heart and respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, playing important regulatory roles in the cardiovascular and other biological systems. However, the genetic basis of the ACE2 protein levels is not well understood. METHODS: We have conducted the largest genome-wide association meta-analysis of plasma ACE2 levels in >28 000 individuals of the SCALLOP Consortium (Systematic and Combined Analysis of Olink Proteins). We summarize the cross-sectional epidemiological correlates of circulating ACE2. Using the summary statisticsCbased high-definition likelihood method, we estimate relevant genetic correlations with cardiometabolic phenotypes, COVID-19, and other human complex traits and diseases. We perform causal inference of soluble ACE2 on vascular disease outcomes and COVID-19 severity using mendelian randomization. We also perform in silico functional analysis by integrating with other types of omics data. RESULTS: We identified 10 loci, including 8 novel, capturing 30% of the heritability of the protein. We detected that plasma ACE2 was genetically correlated with vascular diseases, severe COVID-19, and a wide range of human complex diseases and medications. An X-chromosome cisCprotein quantitative trait lociCbased mendelian randomization analysis suggested a causal effect of elevated ACE2 levels on COVID-19 severity (odds ratio, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.10C2.42]; P=0.01), hospitalization (odds ratio, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.05C2.21]; P=0.03), and infection (odds ratio, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.08C2.37]; P=0.02).

This mass spectrometry-based approach allowed identification of 3,026 proteins across four culture time points corresponding to sequential stages of differentiation, confirming the expression dynamics of established molecules and offering new information into other pathways involved. The availability of a SWATH CTB global spectral library serves as a beneficial resource for hypothesis generation and a foundation for further understanding of CTB differentiation dynamics.","output":"Global proteomic analyses of human cytotrophoblast differentiation/invasion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide share the ability to be beneficial or harmful molecules depending on the concentrations to which organisms are exposed.

In patients with severe COVID-19 without macrovascular thrombosis, escalating into high-dose prophylactic anticoagulation (HD-PA) or therapeutic anticoagulation (TA) could be beneficial in limiting the extension of microvascular thrombosis and forestalling the evolution of lung and multiorgan microcirculatory dysfunction. In the absence of data from randomised trials, clinical practice varies widely. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a French multicentre, parallel-group, open-label, randomised controlled superiority trial to compare the efficacy and safety of three anticoagulation strategies in patients with COVID-19. Patients with oxygen-treated COVID-19 showing no pulmonary artery thrombosis on computed tomography with pulmonary angiogram will be randomised to receive either low-dose PA, HD-PA or TA for 14 days. Patients attaining the extremes of weight and those with severe renal failure will not be included. We will recruit 353 patients. Patients will be randomised on a 1:1:1 basis, and stratified by centre, use of invasive mechanical ventilation, D-dimer levels and body mass index. The primary endpoint is a hierarchical criterion at day 28 including all-cause mortality, followed by the time to clinical improvement defined as the time from randomisation to an improvement of at least two points on the ordinal clinical scale. Secondary outcomes include thrombotic and major bleeding events at day 28, individual components of the primary endpoint, number of oxygen-free, ventilator-free and vasopressor-free days at day 28, D-dimer and sepsis-induced coagulopathy score at day 7, intensive care unit and hospital stay at day 28 and day 90, and all-cause death and quality of life at day 90. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by an ethical committee (Ethics Committee, Ile de France VII, Paris, France; reference 2020-A03531-38). Patients will be included after obtaining their signed informed consent. The results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with NSCLC may experience delays in care, and some national guidelines recommend delays in surgery by >3a??months for early NSCLC. METHODS: Using data from the National Lung Screening Trial, a multi-center randomized trial, and the National Cancer Data Base, a multi-institutional oncology registry, the impact of \\"early\\" versus \\"delayed\\" surgery (surgery received 0-30 vs 90-120a??days after diagnosis) for stage I lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was assessed using multivariable Cox regression analysis with penalized smoothing spline functions and propensity score-matched analyses. RESULTS: In Cox regression analysis of the National Lung Screening Trial (n = 452) and National Cancer Data Base (n = 80,086) cohorts, an increase in the hazard ratio was seen the longer surgery was delayed. In propensity score-matched analysis, no significant differences in survival were found between early and delayed surgery for stage IA1 adenocarcinoma and IA1-IA3 SCC (all P > 0.13). For stage IA2-IB adenocarcinoma and IB SCC, delayed surgery was associated with worse survival (all P < 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The mortality risk associated with an extended delay to surgery differs across patient subgroups, and difficult decisions to delay care during the COVID-19 pandemic should take substage and histologic subtype into consideration.","output":"Estimating the Impact of Extended Delay to Surgery for Stage I Non-small-cell Lung Cancer on Survival"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) was announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 According to a WHO report on COVID-19, the disease has nospecific manifestation and the patient's pres-entation can range from completely asymptomatic to severe pneumonia and death Objective: To retrospectively characterize and interpret the spectrum of chest computed tomography (CT) imaging features of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in infected Indian population and to correlate CT total severity score with clinical classification and study extra-pulmonary manifestation of Corona-virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Methods: A retrospective single-centre study was conducted on patients with COVID-19 from May 10, 2020, to July 13, 2020, in tertiary care Max super specialty hospital, Delhi, India A total of 532 patients either laboratory-confirmed or strongly suspected of having COVID-19 underwent CT chest and their imaging features were analyzed and interpreted in detail and studied for extra-pulmonary manifestation of COVID-19 The consistency of observers was evaluated for CT total severity score (TSS) and TSS was compared with clinical classification Result: This study included 532 patients, 10 patients were excluded from the study Among a total of 522 patients in the study, 362 (69 3%) were males and 160 (30 7%) were females with a mean age of 52 75 years (range 14-88) According to the clinical subtype classification there were mild 17 (3 3%), common 355 (68 0%), severe 105 (20 1%) and critical 45 (8 6%) cases 57 (10 9%) patients died and 37 (7 08%) patients showed extra-pulmonary manifestation of COVID-19 There were 17 patients with normal CT chest Only 2 cases had unilateral lung disease and the rest of 503 cases showed bilateral lung involvement with multiple opacities and multiple lobe involvement Diffuse lung involvement i e white lung noted in 10 cases and none of the patient had single lesion Opacities on CT imaging tended to be both peripheral and central in most cases, followed by purely peripheral and rarely are with the purely central distribution According to CT attenuation of opacity, Ground glass opacity (GGO), and the mixture of Ground glass opacity & consolidative opacities and consolidative opacities was the dominant abnormality founded almost in all cases Perilesional or intralesional, thickened small vessel was observed in almost all cases Accompany-ing signs were crazy paving (40 6%), reverse halo sign (10 9 %), subpleural lines (47 9%), air bronchogram (28 4%), bronchiec-tasis (18 6%), pleural effusion (5 6%) and mediastinal lymphadenopathy (4 8%) Follow up scanning was obtained in 28 cases, showed no change in 2 cases, turned better in 12 cases, and became worse in 14 cases on follow up imaging studies Conclusions: The typical pattern of COVID-19 pneumonia in Delhi, India, was ground glass opacity in the form of pure ground glass opacity, ground glass opacity with superimposed crazy paving pattern or Ground glass opacity admixed with consolidation with intralesional vascular enlargement were the most dominant lung parenchymal abnormalities with the peripheral and pos-terior distribution encountered in most of the cases In the short term follow-up, more patients had disease progression rather than absorption Proportion of patients [17 (3 2%)] with normal CT chest in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was relatively low;hence chest CT may play a complementary role in the early detection of COVID-19 pneumonia and could be regarded as a diagnotic standard of COVID-19 COVID-19 is progressive viral pneumonia with broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and can also present with extra-pulmonary manifestations ?

In patients with severe symptoms of the disease, pneumonia develops due to Covid-19 virus. This causes intense involvement and damage in lungs. Although the emergence of the disease occurred a short time ago, many literature studies have been carried out in which these effects of the disease on the lungs were revealed by the help of lung CT imaging. In this study, the amount of 25 lung CT images in total (15 of Covid-19 patients and 10 of normal) was multiplied (250 images in total) using three data augmentation methods which relate to contrast change, brightness change and noise addition, and these images were subjected to automatic classification. Within the scope of the study, experiments were made for each case which include the use of the CT images of lungs (gray-level and RGB) directly, the images obtained by applying Local Binary Pattern (LBP) to these images (gray-level and RGB) and the images obtained by combining these images (gray-level and RGB). In the study, a 23-layer Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architecture was developed and used in classification processes. Leave-one-group-out cross validation method was used to test the proposed system. In this context, the result of the study indicated that the best AUC and EER values were obtained for the combination of original (RGB) and LBP applied (RGB) images, and these figures are 0,9811 and 0,0445 respectively. It was observed that, applying LBP to images, the use of CNN input causes an increase in sensitivity values while it causes a decrease in values of specificity. The highest sensitivity was obtained for the case of using LBP-applied (RGB) images and has a value of 0,9947. Within the scope of the study, the highest values of specificity and accuracy were obtained by the help of CT of lungs (gray-level) with 0,9120 and 95,32%, respectively.

Dysfunctions of endothelial cells and platelets are tightly linked in contributing to the systemic inflammatory response that appears to be both a cause and a consequence of COVID-19-associated coagulation disorders and thrombotic events. Indeed, elevated levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines are often associated with abnormal coagulation parameters in COVID-19 patients. Although treatments with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) have shown beneficial effects in decreasing patient mortality with severe COVID-19, additional therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Utilizing the anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties of natural compounds may provide alternative therapeutic approaches to prevent or reduce the risk factors associated with pre-existing conditions and comorbidities that can worsen COVID-19 patients' outcomes. In this regard, resveratrol, a natural compound found in several plants and fruits such as grapes, blueberries and cranberries, may represent a promising coadjuvant for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. By virtue of its anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties, resveratrol would be expected to lower COVID-19-associated mortality, which is well known to be increased by thrombosis and inflammation. This review analyzes and discusses resveratrol's ability to modulate vascular hemostasis at different levels targeting both primary hemostasis (interfering with platelet activation and aggregation) and secondary hemostasis (modulating factors involved in coagulation cascade).","output":"Therapeutic Potential of Resveratrol in COVID-19-Associated Hemostatic Disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Our behavioral traits, and subsequent actions, could affect the risk of exposure to the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). The current study aimed to determine whether unique brain networks are associated with the COVID-19 infection risk. METHODS: This research was conducted using the UK Biobank Resource. Functional magnetic resonance imaging scans in a cohort of general population (n = 3662) were used to compute the whole-brain functional connectomes. A network-informed machine learning approach was used to identify connectome and nodal fingerprints that are associated with positive COVID-19 status during the pandemic up to February fourth, 2021. RESULTS: The predictive models successfully identified 6 fingerprints that were associated with COVID-19 positive, compared to negative status (all p values < 0.005). Overall, lower integration across the brain modules and increased segregation, as reflected by internal within module connectivity, were associated with higher infection rates. More specifically, COVID-19 positive status was associated with 1) reduced connectivity between the central executive and ventral salience, as well as between the dorsal salience and default mode networks; 2) increased internal connectivity within the default mode, ventral salience, subcortical and sensorimotor networks; and 3) increased connectivity between the ventral salience, subcortical and sensorimotor networks. CONCLUSION: Individuals are at increased risk of COVID-19 infections if their brain connectome is consistent with reduced connectivity in the top-down attention and executive networks, along with increased internal connectivity in the introspective and instinctive networks.

OBJECTIVE: The Pediatric Infection-Point-of-Care (PI-POC) trial is investigating novel methods to improve and strengthen the differential diagnostics of suspected childhood CNS infections in low-income health systems such as those in Southwestern Uganda. This will be achieved by evaluating (1) a novel DNA-based diagnostic assay for CNS infections, (2) a commercially available multiplex PCR-based meningitis/encephalitis (ME) panel for clinical use in a facility-limited laboratory setting, (3) proteomics profiling of blood from children with severe CNS infection as compared to outpatient controls with fever yet not severely ill, and (4) Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) as a biomarker in blood for viral CNS infection. Further changes in the etiology of childhood CNS infections after the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine against Streptococcus pneumoniae will be investigated. In addition, the carriage and invasive rate of Neisseria meningitidis will be recorded and serotyped, and the expression of its major virulence factor (polysaccharide capsule) will be investigated. METHODS: The PI-POC trial is a prospective observational study of children including newborns up to 12 years of age with clinical features of CNS infection, and age-/sex-matched outpatient controls with fever yet not severely ill. Participants are recruited at 2 Pediatric clinics in Mbarara, Uganda. Cerebrospinal fluid (for cases only), blood, and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs (for both cases and controls) sampled at both clinics are analyzed at the Epicentre Research Laboratory through gold-standard methods for CNS infection diagnosis (microscopy, biochemistry, and culture) and a commercially available ME panel for multiplex PCR analyses of the cerebrospinal fluid. An additional blood sample from cases is collected on day 3 after admission. After initial clinical analyses in Mbarara, samples will be transported to Stockholm, Sweden for (1) validation analyses of a novel nucleic acidCbased POC test, (2) biomarker research, and (3) serotyping and molecular characterization of S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis. RESULTS: A pilot study was performed from January to April 2019. The PI-POC trial enrollment of patients begun in April 2019 and will continue until September 2020, to include up to 300 cases and controls. Preliminary results from the PI-POC study are expected by the end of 2020.

In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable and in special need for preventive mental health strategies. Thus far, no reports exist to investigate the mental health response of pregnant women to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women across China. STUDY DESIGN: A multicenter, cross-sectional study was initiated in early December 2019 to identify mental health concerns in pregnancy using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This study provided a unique opportunity to compare the mental status of pregnant women before and after the declaration of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. A total of 4124 pregnant women during their third trimester from 25 hospitals in 10 provinces across China were examined in this cross-sectional study from January 1, 2020, to February 9, 2020. Of these women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020, when the coronavirus epidemic was publicly declared and 2839 were assessed before this pivotal time point. The internationally recommended Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms. Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared between the pre- and poststudy groups. RESULTS: Pregnant women assessed after the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P=.02) than women assessed before the epidemic declaration. These women were also more likely to have thoughts of self-harm (P=.005). The depressive rates were positively associated with the number of newly confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (P=.003), suspected infections (P=.004), and deaths per day (P=.001). Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy, primiparous, younger than 35 years, employed full time, in middle income category, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk for developing depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak. CONCLUSION: Major life-threatening public health events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak may increase the risk for mental illness among pregnant women, including thoughts of self-harm. Strategies targeting maternal stress and isolation such as effective risk communication and the provision of psychological first aid may be particularly useful to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses.","output":"Perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms of pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection, responsible for COVID-19, can determine cardiac events, which require a quick diagnosis and management, and should not be overlooked due to the presence of COVID-19 infection.

A checklist for critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modeling studies (CHARMS) and the prediction model risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST) were used for the data extraction process and critical appraisal. RESULTS: From the 29,668 retrieved articles, eleven studies meeting the selection criteria were included in this review. Forty-eight predictors were identified from prognostic prediction models. The c-statistic ranged from 0.67 to 0.95. Critical appraisal has shown that all modeling studies were subject to a high risk of bias in methodological quality mainly driven by outcome and statistical analysis, and six modeling studies were subject to a high risk of bias in applicability. CONCLUSION: Future model development and validation studies should adhere to the transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement to improve methodological quality and applicability, thus increasing the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study.

COVID-19 ARDS displays the typical features of diffuse alveolar damage with extensive pulmonary coagulation activation resulting in fibrin deposition in the microvasculature and formation of hyaline membranes in the air sacs. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who manifest severe disease have high levels of inflammatory cytokines in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and significant coagulopathy. There is a strong association between the extent of the coagulopathy and poor clinical outcomes. The anti-coagulant actions of nebulised UFH limit fibrin deposition and microvascular thrombosis. Trials in patients with acute lung injury and related conditions found inhaled UFH reduced pulmonary dead space, coagulation activation, microvascular thrombosis and clinical deterioration, resulting in increased time free of ventilatory support. In addition, UFH has anti-inflammatory, mucolytic and anti-viral properties and, specifically, has been shown to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus and prevent its entry into mammalian cells, thereby inhibiting pulmonary infection by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, clinical studies have shown that inhaled UFH safely improves outcomes in other inflammatory respiratory diseases and also acts as an effective mucolytic in sputum-producing respiratory patients. UFH is widely available and inexpensive, which may make this treatment also accessible for low- and middle-income countries.

Using simulation, we devised a testing method to evaluate devices that may mitigate the spread of aerosol and droplet-sized particles. METHODS In this prospective single-center study, participants intubated a manikin 3 times using standard personal protective equipment, once with no barrier device, once with an acrylic box, and once with a modified horizontal drape. The micrometer-sized particle count, generated by a nebulization model, was recorded before and after each intubation. The first-pass intubation rate and time to intubation were recorded. Each operator completed a postsimulation survey about their experience using the barrier devices. RESULTS Thirty airway proceduralists completed the simulation and survey. There was no significant difference in particle counts (aerosols or droplets) or first-pass intubation, but the horizontal drape was found to significantly increase intubation time (P = 0.01).

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the extent to which individual resilience, well-being and demographic characteristics may predict two indicators of Coronavirus pandemic: distress symptoms and perceived danger. METHOD: Two independent samples were employed: 1) 605 respondents recruited through an internet panel company; 2) 741 respondents recruited through social media, using snowball sampling. Both samples filled a structured online questionnaire. Correlations between psychological/demographic variables and distress and perceived danger were examined. Path analysis was conducted to identify predictive indicators of distress and perceived danger. RESULTS: Significant negative correlations were found between individual/community resilience and sense of danger (-.220 and -.255 respectively; p <.001) and distress symptoms (- .398 and -.544 respectively; p <.001). Significant positive correlations were found between gender, community size, economic difficulties and sense of danger (.192, .117 and .244 respectively; p <.001). Gender and economic difficulties also positively correlated with distress symptoms (.130 and .214 respectively; p <.001). Path analysis revealed that all paths were significant ( p <.008 to .001) except between family income and distress symptoms ( p =.12). The seven predictors explained 20% of sense of danger variance and 34% the distress symptoms variance. The most highly predictive indicators were the two psychological characteristics, individual resilience, and well-being. Age, gender, community size, and economic difficulties due to COVID-19 further add to predicting distress, while community and national resilience do not. . CONCLUSIONS: Individual resilience and well-being have been found as the first and foremost predictors of COVID-19 anxiety.

Here, we present our study elucidating the interplay between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses; and hosts miRNAs, an epigenetic regulator, as a mode of pathogenesis, and enlightened how the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections differ in terms of their miRNA mediated interactions with host and its implications in the disease complexity. We have utilized computational approaches to predict potential host and viral miRNAs, and their possible roles in different important functional pathways. We have identified several putative host antiviral miRNAs that can target the SARS viruses, and also SARS viruses encoded miRNAs targeting host genes. In silico predicted targets were also integrated with SARS infected human cells microarray and RNA-seq gene expression data. Comparison of the host miRNA binding profiles on 67 different SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 24 different countries with respective countrys normalized death count surprisingly uncovered some miRNA clusters which are associated with increased death rates. We have found that induced cellular miRNAs can be both a boon and a bane to the host immunity, as they have possible roles in neutralizing the viral threat, parallelly, they can also function as proviral factors. On the other hand, from over representation analysis, interestingly our study revealed that although both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viral miRNAs could target broad immune signaling pathways; only some of the SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs are found to uniquely target some immune signaling pathways like-autophagy, IFN-I signaling etc, which might suggest their immune-escape mechanisms for prolonged latency inside some hosts without any symptoms of COVID-19. Further, SARS-CoV-2 can modulate several important cellular pathways which might lead to the increased anomalies in patients with comorbidities like-cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, breathing complications, etc. This might suggest that miRNAs can be a key epigenetic modulator behind the overcomplications amongst the COVID-19 patients. Our results support that miRNAs of host and SARS-CoV-2 can indeed play a role in the pathogenesis which can be further concluded with more experiments. These results will also be useful in designing RNA therapeutics to alleviate the complications from COVID-19.","output":"Epigenetic regulator miRNA pattern differences among SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 world-wide isolates delineated the mystery behind the epic pathogenicity and distinct clinical characteristics of pandemic COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has infected over more than 28.3 million people around the globe and killed 913K people worldwide as on 11 September 2020.

Chest X-rays are the widely available modalities for immediate diagnosis of COVID-19. Hence, automation of detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using machine learning approaches is of greater demand. A model for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images is proposed in this paper. A novel concept of cluster-based one-shot learning is introduced in this work. The introduced concept has an advantage of learning from a few samples against learning from many samples in case of deep leaning architectures. The proposed model is a multi-class classification model as it classifies images of four classes, viz., pneumonia bacterial, pneumonia virus, normal, and COVID-19. The proposed model is based on ensemble of Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) classifiers at decision level. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been demonstrated through extensive experimentation on a publicly available dataset consisting of 306 images. The proposed cluster-based one-shot learning has been found to be more effective on GRNN and PNN ensembled model to distinguish COVID-19 images from that of the other three classes. It has also been experimentally observed that the model has a superior performance over contemporary deep learning architectures. The concept of one-shot cluster-based learning is being first of its kind in literature, expected to open up several new dimensions in the field of machine learning which require further researching for various applications.","output":"One-shot Cluster-Based Approach for the Detection of COVIDC19 from Chest XCray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rash associated with a febrile illness often poses challenges in diagnosis.

Herein, we evaluated the development of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL) after vaccination with the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, up to 50 days post their first vaccine dose. Methods: This is a large prospective study (NCT04743388) evaluating the kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after COVID-19 vaccination in healthy subjects and patients with hematological malignancies. We report here the results in CLL, NHL and HL patients in comparison to age- and gender-matched controls who were vaccinated at the same time period (January to May 2021). After vein puncture, the serum of both patients and controls was collected on day 1 (D1; before the first BNT162b2 dose), on day 22 (D22; before the second dose of the BNT162b2) and on day 50 (D50; 3 weeks post second dose of the BNT162b2). Serum was separated within 4 hours from blood collection and stored at -80C until the day of measurement. NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 were measured using FDA approved methodology (ELISA, cPass? SARS-CoV-2 NAbs Detection Kit; GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) on the abovementioned timepoints. A NAb titer of at least 30% is considered as positive, according to manufacturer, whereas a NAb titer of at least 50% has been associated with clinically relevant viral inhibition [Walsh et al. N Engl J Med 2020, 383, 2439-50]. Samples of the same individual were measured in the same ELISA plate. Results: We evaluated 132 patients with CLL/Lymphomas after vaccination with the BNT162b2. Patient population included 53 with CLL, 57 with NHL and 22 with HL, while 214 healthy controls, of similar age and gender, were also studied. At the time of vaccination, 30% (n=40) of patients had asymptomatic disease and out of 92 symptomatic patients, 49% (n=45) were on active treatment. Vaccination with two doses of the BNT162b2 led to lower production of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 in patients compared with controls, both on day 22 and on day 50 (P<0.001 for all comparisons) for all subgroups. After the first dose of the vaccine, on D22, the patient group had lower NAb titers compared with controls: the median NAb inhibition titer was 18% (IQR: 8.5-29%) for patients versus 41.6% (IQR: 25.3-59%) for controls; p<0.001. On D50, the median NAb inhibition titer was 32.5% (IQR: 13.5-93%) for patients versus 94.7% (IQR: 89-97%) for controls; p<0.001. More specifically, only 50.8% (67/132) of the patients versus 98.1% (210/214) of the controls developed NAb titers 30% and 43.9% (58/132) of patients versus 95.3% (204/214) titers 50% (high protective titers) at day 50 (p<0.0001 for all comparisons; Figure-left part). Importantly, active treatment (which included anti-CD antibodies, Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors, a combination of the above, chemotherapy-only regimens or Bcl-2 inhibitors) was an independent prognostic factor for suboptimal antibody response at day 50 (<50%) in the patient subgroup (p<0.001). Rituximab administration in the last 12 months correlated with decreased antibody response at day 50 (p<0.01). Patients with HL were more likely to achieve humoral responses (>50% at day 50) compared to other disease types (p<0.05; Figure-right part). Disease-related immune dysregulation and therapy-related immunosuppression were therefore involved in the low humoral responses seen in patients. Regarding adverse events, 9% and 9.8% patients reported mild reactions after the first and second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, respectively. Conclusion: Patients with CLL/NHL/HL have a low humoral response following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, particularly patients who are on active treatment with rituximab or BTK inhibitors. These patient subgroups therefore should continue utilizing protective measures against SARS-CoV-2 (masks, social distancing, etc) as they are at high risk for COVID-19. Further studies on the kinetics of immune subpopulations following COVID-19 vaccination will elucidate the underlying immune landscape and determine the potential need for additional booster vaccine doses or protective administration of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in CLL/NHL/HL patients with poor response after full vaccination.

This is particularly concerning in old age psychiatry inpatient wards where patients often have multiple compounding comorbidities and complex decisions regarding capacity are often made. Our aim for this quality improvement project was to pilot a novel TEP proforma within a UK old age psychiatry inpatient hospital. We first adapted a TEP proforma used in our partner acute tertiary hospital and implemented it on our old age psychiatry wards. We then further refined the form and gathered data about uptake, length of time to complete a TEP and the ceiling of care documented in the TEP. We also explored staff, patient and family views on the usefulness of TEP proformas using questionaries. TEP decisions were documented in 54% of patient records at baseline. Following revision and implementation of a TEP proforma this increased to 100% on our two wards. The mean time taken to complete a TEP was reduced from 7.1 days to 3.2 days following inclusion of the TEP proforma in admission packs. Feedback from staff showed improvements in understanding about TEP and improved knowledge of where these decisions were documented. We advocate the use of TEP proformas on all old age psychiatry inpatient wards to offer clear guidance to relatives and treating clinicians about the ceilings of care for patients.

In Israel, the Arab and Ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities have unique demographic and cultural characteristics that place them at higher risk of infection. OBJECTIVE: To examine socioeconomic and ethnic differences in rates of COVID-19 testing, confirmed cases and deaths, and to analyze patterns of transmission in ethnically diverse communities. METHODS: A cross-sectional ecologic study design was used. Consecutive data on rates of COVID-19 diagnostic testing, lab-confirmed cases, and deaths collected from March 31 through May 1, 2020, in 174 localities across Israel (84% of the population) were analyzed by socioeconomic ranking and ethnicity. RESULTS: Tests were performed on 331,594 individuals (4.29% of the total population). Of those, 14,865 individuals (4.48%) were positive for COVID-19 and 203 died (1.37% of confirmed cases). Testing rate was 26% higher in the lowest SE category compared with the highest. The risk of testing positive was 2.16 times higher in the lowest socioeconomic category, compared with the highest. The proportion of confirmed cases was 4.96 times higher in the Jewish compared with the Arab population. The rate of confirmed cases in 2 Ultra-Orthodox localities increased relatively early and quickly. Other Jewish and Arab localities showed consistently low rates of confirmed COVID-19 cases, regardless of socioeconomic ranking.

In the Global South, the COVID-19 pandemic compounds existing crises, frailties, and inequities as the impoverished suffer food insecurity, physical conflict, and crises of health and water. Existing research suggests that the pandemic has further disadvantaged marginalised communities, weakened learner performance, increased learning losses, and stretched already strained education budgets. However, little is known about the role of teachers in the policymaking process relating to matters that have a direct impact on their work. It is this gap that we address in this paper. Drawing on research, commissioned by the Open Society Foundation and Education International, based on a detailed desk-based review and interviews with purposefully selected Teachers' Union and Government officials in eight African countries, we examine the role of teachers in education policy-making processes and the kinds of support made available to them, or the lack thereof, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the conceptual framing of de Sousa Santos's sociology of absences and cognitive injustice, we demonstrate that teachers have been absent from policymaking processes and have not been adequately provided with the necessary professional development (PD) and psychosocial support to navigate the uncertainties and pedagogical requirements imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Teacher support, preparedness and resilience during times of crises and uncertainty: COVID-19 and education in the Global South"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The exponential expansion of the human population has led to overexploitation of resources and overproduction of items that have caused a series of potentially devastating effects, including ocean acidification, ozone depletion, biodiversity loss, the spread of invasive flora and fauna and climatic changes - along with the emergence of new diseases in animals and humans. Climate change occurs as a result of imbalances between incoming and outgoing radiation in the atmosphere. This process generates heat. As concentrations of atmospheric gases reach record levels, global temperatures are expected to increase significantly. The hydrologic cycle will be altered, since warmer air can retain more moisture than cooler air. This means that some geographic areas will have more rainfall, whereas others have more drought and severe weather. The potential consequences of significant and permanent climatic changes are altered patterns of diseases in animal and human populations, including the emergence of new disease syndromes and changes in the prevalence of existing diseases. A wider geographic distribution of known vectors and the recruitment of new strains to the vector pool could result in infections spreading to more and potentially new species of hosts. If these predictions turn out to be accurate, there will be a need for policymakers to consider alternatives, such as adaptation. This review explores the linkages between climate change and animal diseases, and examines interrelated issues that arise from altered biological dynamics.

Automated screening plays a critical role in the fight against this pandemic, and much of the previous work has been very successful in designing effective screening models. However, they would lose effectiveness under the semi-supervised learning environment with only positive and unlabeled (PU) data, which is easy to collect clinically. In this paper, we report our attempt towards achieving semi-supervised screening of COVID-19 from PU data. We propose a new PU learning method called Constraint Non-Negative Positive Unlabeled Learning (cnPU). It suggests the constraint non-negative risk estimator, which is more robust against overfitting than previous PU learning methods when giving limited positive data. It also embodies a new and efficient optimization algorithm that can make the model learn well on positive data and avoid overfitting on unlabeled data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that realizes PU learning of COVID-19. A series of empirical studies show that our algorithm remarkably outperforms state of the art in real datasets of two medical imaging modalities, including X-ray and computed tomography. These advantages endow our algorithm as a robust and useful computer-assisted tool in the semi-supervised screening of COVID-19. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Semi-Supervised Screening of COVID-19 from Positive and Unlabeled Data with Constraint Non-Negative Risk Estimator"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anemia is common in pediatric intensive care units (PICU).

STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study reviewing pediatric patients with SARS (n = 43) and COVID-19 (n = 244) who were admitted to the Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong and Wuhan Children's Hospital in Wuhan, respectively. Demographics, hospital length of stay, and clinical and laboratory features were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 97.7% of patients with SARS and 85.2% of patients with COVID-19 had epidemiologic associations with known cases. Significantly more patients with SARS developed fever, chills, myalgia, malaise, coryza, sore throat, sputum production, nausea, headache, and dizziness than patients with COVID-19. No patients with SARS were asymptomatic at the time of admission, whereas 29.1% and 20.9% of patients with COVID-19 were asymptomatic on admission and throughout their hospital stay, respectively. More patients with SARS required oxygen supplementation than patients with COVID-19 (18.6 vs 4.7%; P = .004). Only 1.6% of patients with COVID-19 and 2.3% of patients with SARS required mechanical ventilation. Leukopenia (37.2% vs 18.6%; P = .008), lymphopenia (95.4% vs 32.6%; P < .01), and thrombocytopenia (41.9% vs 3.8%; P < .001) were significantly more common in patients with SARS than in patients with COVID-19. The duration between positive and negative nasopharyngeal aspirate and the length in hospital stay were similar in patients with COVID-19, regardless of whether they were asymptomatic or symptomatic, suggesting a similar duration of viral shedding.

The present study discusses interview comments made by upper secondary level students in England when 15 young people were asked to give their personal responses to brief vignettes describing scientific careers. Using an interview-about-scenarios approach, the students were asked about whether they would feel comfortable working in the scientific careers represented. The career areas were purposefully selected because they might be considered to potentially raise issues in relation to personal values or commitments that some students might hold. A range of student perceptions relating to the mooted careers were elicited (positive, negative and indifferent), but all of the participants raised issues that impacted on the acceptability or attractiveness of at least one of the mooted scientific careers, in terms of aspects of their own personal beliefs and values systems. It is recommended that teachers and career advisors should be aware of the range of value-related considerations that influence student views of science-related careers and should consider exploring aspects of science-based careers that link to values commonly shared by young people.

METHODS Medical records were reviewed retrospectively from February 1989 to April 2013 in a single institution. Three different techniques of PPP were evaluated: surgical subcutaneous implantable port (SIP), surgical peritoneal dialysis catheter (PDC), and radiologic multipurpose drainage catheter (MDC). Collected data included patients' age, sex, body mass index, medical and surgical history, hernia location, PPP technique, length of hospitalization, volume of air injected, morbidity and mortality linked to PPP, and the procedure of hernia repair. RESULTS Thirty-seven patients with a mean age of 63.1 years were evaluated. Progressive preoperative pneumoperitoneum was performed using SIP, PDC, and MDC for 14, 11, and 12 patients, respectively. Overall morbidity related to the technique was seen in 36 % of SIP, 27 % of PDC, and 0 % of MDC.

CONCLUSION The MDC is an interesting modification of the original technique and is a safe procedure. It is a minimally invasive technique with a very low risk of perforation of the viscera.

We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n = 28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n = 18). In addition, we adjust for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase.

CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 41-year-old female patient who presented to the emergency department complaining of diplopia and headache over the last 2 days. She denied any medical history, as well as any other neurological or respiratory symptom. A detailed neurological and ophthalmological examination revealed a limitation to the abduction of the right eye due to palsy of the right lateral rectus muscle causing painless, horizontal diplopia in the right gaze. The computed tomography of the brain was normal. Based on the detected lymphopenia, she was tested for COVID-19 and was positive. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed no abnormalities, while also a repeated head computed tomography was similarly normal. The patient received no specialized medical treatment, and after 6 days, she was discharged home having a minimal degree of persistent diplopia. Two weeks later, brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed that was similarly unrevealing. CONCLUSIONS: Isolated abducens nerve palsy can be the only presenting symptom in COVID-19. Although several pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed, the exact nature of this manifestation has not been clarified yet. Vigilance is required by neurologists to detect and manage patients with such subtle clinical presentations.","output":"Isolated Abducens Nerve Palsy in a Patient With COVID-19: A Case Report and Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inpatient early mobility initiatives are effective therapeutic interventions for improving patient outcomes and decreasing use of hospital resources among adult ICU and general medicine patients. To establish and demonstrate guidelines for early patient ambulation, we developed and implemented a novel multidisciplinary mobility bundle utilizing the JH-HLM (Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility) scale for mobility classification, on a single adult general medicine unit of a community hospital. Our results show that patients admitted to the unit after implementation of the mobility bundle had improved mobility scores, reduced rates of 30-day hospital readmission, and a shortened length of hospital stay. This study emphasizes the importance of measuring mobility using a systematic method, easing workflow among unit practitioners, and allowing mobility initiatives to be jointly driven by nursing, physical therapy, and physicians.","output":"A novel early mobility bundle improves length of stay and rates of readmission among hospitalized general medicine patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Machine learning modeling can provide valuable support in different areas of mental health, because it enables to make rapid predictions and therefore support the decision making, based on valuable data. However, few studies have applied this method to predict symptoms worsening, based on sociodemographic, contextual, and clinical data. Thus, we applied machine learning techniques to identify predictors of symptomatologic changes in a Spanish cohort of OCD patients during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: 127 OCD patients were assessed using the YaleCBrown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and a structured clinical interview during the COVID-19 pandemic. Machine learning models for classification (LDA and SVM) and regression (linear regression and SVR) were constructed to predict each symptom based on patients sociodemographic, clinical and contextual information. RESULTS: A Y-BOCS score prediction model was generated with 100% reliability at a score threshold of  6. Reliability of 100% was reached for obsessions and/or compulsions related to COVID-19. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were predicted with less reliability (correlation R of 0.58 and 0.68, respectively). The suicidal thoughts are predicted with a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 88%. The best results are achieved by SVM and SVR. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that sociodemographic and clinical data can be used to predict changes in OCD symptomatology. Machine learning may be valuable tool for helping clinicians to rapidly identify patients at higher risk and therefore provide optimized care, especially in future pandemics. However, further validation of these models is required to ensure greater reliability of the algorithms for clinical implementation to specific objectives of interest.","output":"Viability Study of Machine Learning-Based Prediction of COVID-19 Pandemic Impact in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent decline in crude oil prices due to global competition and COVID-19-related demand issues has highlighted the need for the efficient operation of an oil and gas plant. One such avenue is accurate predictions about the remaining useful life (RUL) of components used in oil and gas plants. A tribosystem is comprised of the surfaces in relative motion and the lubricant between them. Lubricant oils play a significant role in keeping any tribosystem such as bearings and gears working smoothly over the lifetime of the oil and gas plant. The lubricant oil needs replenishment from time to time to avoid component breakdown due to the increased presence of wear debris and friction between the sliding surfaces of bearings and gears. Traditionally, this oil change is carried out at pre-determined times. This paper explored the possibilities of employing machine learning to predict early failure behavior in sensor-instrumented tribosystems. Specifically, deep learning and tribological data obtained from sensors deployed on the components can provide more accurate predictions about the RUL of the tribosystem. This automated maintenance can improve the overall efficiency of the component. The present study aimed to develop a deep learning-based digital twin for accurately predicting the RUL of a tribosystem comprised of a ball bearing-like test apparatus, a four-ball tester, and lubricant oil. A commercial lubricant used in the offshore oil and gas components was tested for its extreme pressure performance, and its welding load was measured using a four-ball tester. Three accelerated deterioration tests was carried out on the four-ball tester at a load below the welding load. Based on the wear scar measurements obtained from the experimental tests, the RUL data were used to train a multivariate convolutional neural network (CNN). The training accuracy of the model was above 99%, and the testing accuracy was above 95%. This work involved the model-free learning prediction of the remaining useful lifetime of ball bearing-type contacts as a function of key sensor input data (i.e., load, friction, temperature). This model can be deployed for in-field tribological machine elements to trigger automated maintenance without explicitly measuring the wear phenomenon. ? 2021 by the authors.

By inhibition of the IL-6 receptor, tocilizumab may help to mitigate the hyperinflammatory response associated with progressive respiratory failure from SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A retrospective, observational study was conducted on hospitalized adults who received intravenous tocilizumab for COVID-19 between March 23, 2020 and April 10, 2020. RESULTS: Most patients were male (66.7%), Hispanic (63.3%) or Black (23.3%), with a median age of 54 years. Tocilizumab was administered at a median of 8 days (range 1-21) after initial symptoms and 2 days (range 0-12) after hospital admission. Within 30 days from receiving tocilizumab, 36 patients (60.0%) demonstrated clinical improvement, 9 (15.0%) died, 33 (55.0%) were discharged alive, and 18 (30.0%) remained hospitalized. Successful extubation occurred in 13 out of 29 patients (44.8%). Infectious complications occurred in 16 patients (26.7%) at a median of 10.5 days. After tocilizumab was administered, there was a slight increase in PaO2/FiO2 and an initial reduction in CRP, but this effect was not sustained beyond day 10. CONCLUSIONS: Majority of patients demonstrated clinical improvement and were successfully discharged alive from the hospital after receiving tocilizumab.

We analyzed the gene co-expression networks (GCNs) derived from an aging signature of 130 immune-related genes obtained from CD3+ T-cell splenocytes extracted from FVB/N, C57BL/6N, and BALB/c mice at ages 2 and 22- 24 months. The network structure for the two different mouse age-groups was derived and subsequently analyzed. Analysis of network hubs using clustering coefficients, degree, betweenness, eigenvector, and closeness centralities, as well as local, indirect, and total influence measures, demonstrated changes in gene behavior and network control between the two age groups. Our quantification shows that the young, 2-month old mouse network is more organized than the 22-24-month, old mouse network, while the network structure of the older mouse GCN appears to be far more complicated but far more dispersed. Changes in network structure between the old and young mice suggest deterioration in transcription regulation with age in peripheral T- cells, particularly within the TCR signaling pathway, and potential compensatory mechanisms in older T-cells to overcome loss to regular function resulting from transcriptional irregularity. These results demonstrate the need for more research into gene co-expression in peripheral T-cells in order to better understand both network irregularities and the phenotypic dysfunction observed in older individuals. Author Summary In order to better understand the potential mechanisms of transcriptional irregularities in the immune system with aging, we analyzed the structure of gene co-expression networks of T-cells extracted from the spleens of 2 and 22-24-month old mice. Gene co-expression describes the correlation relationship between two expressed genes; as the expression of one gene goes up, the expression of another gene might also increase (or, conversely, decrease). Strong gene co- expression relationships can signal the existence of a number of important biological phenomena, such as two genes belonging to a transcription pathway or protein structure. Network diagrams visualizing these co-expression relationships in both younger and older mice demonstrated the existence of differences in network structure and properties that may be attributed to the aging of the immune system. Network mathematical methods were used to examine the complexity of each network. We found that the younger mouse network was more organized than the older mouse network. The older mouse group exhibited a 255% increase in co-expression relationships but a decrease of 92% of the connections from the young mouse network. This suggests the older mouse T-cells suffer dysfunction at a transcriptional level. This results in the loss of regular immune and cellular functions. These results demonstrate the importance of future research into gene co-expression to decipher senescence or diseases that perturb gene expression through time.","output":"Network topology and evolution of the gene co-expression of T-cells during immuno-senescence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Numerous studies conducted in the United States found associations between prenatal exposure to particulate matter (PM) and adverse birth outcomes, and some studies identified vulnerable populations, including certain racial/ethnic groups and people with low-socioeconomic status. However, their findings are not always consistent. In this review, we compared the risk of adverse birth outcomes due to PM exposures among subpopulations and investigated whether any particular population is more vulnerable. METHODS We selected U.S. studies examining associations between PM exposure during pregnancy and birth outcomes that included results for effect modification by race/ethnicity and/or maternal education. We summarized the findings for various sizes of PM and birth outcomes. Meta-analysis was conducted to quantify vulnerable race/ethnicity for the association between fine PM (PM2.5) and birthweight. RESULTS In total, 19 studies were assessed, and PM-related risks of adverse birth outcomes, particularly those related to fetal growth, likely differ across subpopulations. A meta-analysis from five studies showed that a 10 g/m3 increase of PM2.5 during the full-gestation reduced birthweight by 21.9 g (95% confidence interval 11.7, 32.0), 15.7 g (10.1, 21.4), 9.3 g (2.7, 15.8), and 5.8 g (- 9.0, 20.7) for Black, White, Hispanic, and Asian mothers, respectively. CONCLUSION Our review indicated that Black mothers and mothers with low educational attainment are more vulnerable subpopulations. More investigation is needed for effect modification by other maternal factors, such as household income.

Little description has been made of their antibody response over time in the presence or absence detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA and of symptoms. We followed a cohort of patient-facing HCWs at an acute hospital in London to measure seroconversion and RNA detection at the peak of the pandemic in London. Methods We enrolled 200 front-line HCWs between 26 March and 8 April 2020 and collected twice-weekly self-administered nose and throat swabs and monthly blood samples. Baseline and regular symptom data were also collected. Swabs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction, and serum for IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies to the virus spike protein by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry. Findings We enrolled HCWs with a variety of roles who worked in areas where COVID-19 patients were admitted and cared for. During the first month of observation, 42/200 (21%) HCWs were PCR positive in at least one nose and throat swab. Only 8/42 HCW (19%) who were PCR positive during the study period had symptoms that met the current case definition. Of 181 HCWs who provided enrollment and follow-up blood samples, 82/181 (45.3%) were seropositive; 36/181 (19.9%) seroconverted during the study and 46/181 (25.4%) were seropositive at both time points. In 33 HCWs who had positive serology at baseline but were PCR negative, 32 remained PCR negative throughout follow-up. One HCW had a PCR positive swab six days after enrollment, likely representing a waning infection. Interpretation The extremely high seropositivity and RNA detection in this cohort of front-line HCWs who worked during the peak of the pandemic brings policies to protect staff and patients in the hospital environment into acute focus. Our findings have implications for planning for the expected second wave and for future vaccination roll out campaigns in similar settings.

Yellow Fever and smallpox vaccines are excellent benchmarks for primary immune response to viral vaccination and induce long-lived virus-reactive CD8 T-cells, which are measurable within 1-4 months of vaccination. Progress in laboratory markers for SARS-CoV2 has been made with identification of epitopes on CD4 and CD8 T-cells in convalescent blood. These are much less dominated by spike protein than in previous coronavirus infections. Although most vaccine candidates are focusing on spike protein as antigen, natural infection by SARS-CoV-2 induces broad epitope coverage, cross-reactive with other betacoronviruses. It will be important to understand the relation between breadth, functionality and durability of T-cell responses and resulting protective immunity. It would be a public health and general trust-in-medicine nightmare - including a boost to anti-vaccine forces - if immune protection wears off or new disease patterns develop among the immunized. Data correlating clinical outcomes with laboratory markers of cell-mediated immunity, not only with antibody response, after SARS-CoV2 natural infection and vaccines may prove critically valuable if protective immunity fades or if new patterns of disease emerge.","output":"What are the roles of antibodies versus a durable, high quality T-cell response in protective immunity against SARS-CoV2?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) outbreaks in Wuhan, China, healthcare systems capacities in highly endemic areas have been overwhelmed. Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed and key to a quicker control of the outbreaks and casualties. We aimed to characterize the clinical features of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and develop a mortality risk index for COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this retrospective one-centre cohort study, we included all the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a COVID-19-designated hospital from January 21 to February 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and clinical outcome data were collected from the hospital information system, nursing records and laboratory reports. Results: Of 577 patients with at least one post-admission evaluation, the median age was 55 years (interquartile range [IQR], 39 - 66); 254 (44.0%) were men; 22.8% (100/438) were severe pneumonia on admission, and 37.7% (75/199) patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The clinical, laboratory and radiological data were comparable between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients. During a median follow-up of 8.4 days (IQR, 5.8 - 12.0), 39 patients died with a 12-day cumulative mortality of 8.7% (95% CI, 5.9% to 11.5%). A simple mortality risk index (called ACP index), composed of Age and C-reactive Protein, was developed. By applying the ACP index, patients were categorized into three grades. The 12-day cumulative mortality in grade three (age  60 years and CRP  34 mg/L) was 33.2% (95% CI, 19.8% to 44.3%), which was significantly higher than those of grade two (age  60 years and CRP < 34 mg/L; age < 60 years and CRP  34 mg/L; 5.6% [95% CI, 0 to 11.3%]) and grade one (age < 60 years and CRP < 34 mg/L, 0%) (P <0.001), respectively. Conclusion: The ACP index can predict COVID-19 related short-term mortality, which may be a useful and convenient tool for quickly establishing a COVID-19 hierarchical management system that can greatly reduce the medical burden and therefore mortality in highly endemic areas.","output":"ACP risk grade: a simple mortality index for patients with confirmed or suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease (COVID-19) during the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Health insurance is associated with better care in the U.S., but little is known about the associations of coverage disruptions (i.e., periods without insurance) with care access, receipt, and affordability. METHODS: Adults aged 18-64 years with current private (n=124,746), public (n=30,932), or no (n=31,802) insurance coverage were identified from the 2011-2018 National Health Interview Survey. Data were analyzed in 2020. Separate multivariable logistic regressions evaluated the associations of having coverage disruptions or being uninsured with care access, receipt, and affordability. RESULTS: Overall, 5.0% of currently insured adults with private and 10.7% with public insurance reported a coverage disruption in the previous year, representing nearly 9.1 million adults in 2018. Among currently uninsured, 24.9% reported coverage loss within the previous year, representing nearly 8.1 million adults in 2018. Among adults with current private or current public coverage, disruptions were associated with lower receipt of all preventive services (AOR=0.42, 95% CI=0.37, 0.46 and AOR=0.48, 95% CI=0.40, 0.58, respectively), with forgoing any needed care because of cost (AOR=4.79, 95% CI=4.44, 5.17 and AOR=4.28, 95% CI=3.86, 4.75), and with medication nonadherence because of cost (AOR=3.55, 95% CI=3.13, 4.03 and AOR=4.09, 95% CI=3.43, 4.88) compared with that among adults with continuous coverage (p<0.05). Longer disruptions among currently insured adults were significantly associated with worse care access, receipt, and affordability, with dose-response patterns. Currently uninsured adults, especially those with longer uninsured periods, reported significantly worse care access, receipt, and affordability than currently insured adults with coverage disruptions or continuous coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the importance of continuous insurance coverage; disruptions owing to the COVID-19 pandemic will likely have adverse consequences for care access and affordability.","output":"Health Insurance Disruptions and Care Access and Affordability in the U.S"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The live-attenuated yellow fever 17D (YF17D) vaccine is one of the most efficacious human vaccines and also employed as a vector for novel vaccines. However, in the lack of appropriate immunocompetent small animal models, mechanistic insight in YF17D-induced protective immunity remains limited. To better understand YF17D vaccination and to identify a suitable mouse model, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of YF17D in five complementary mouse models, i.e. wild-type (WT) BALB/c, C57BL/6, IFN-/ receptor (IFNAR(-/-)) deficient mice, and in WT mice in which type I IFN signalling was temporally ablated by an IFNAR blocking (MAR-1) antibody. Alike in IFNAR(-/-) mice, YF17D induced in either WT mice strong humoral immune responses dominated by IgG2a/c isotype (Th1 type) antibodies, yet only when IFNAR was blocked. Vigorous cellular immunity characterized by CD4(+) T-cells producing IFN- and TNF- were mounted in MAR-1 treated C57BL/6 and in IFNAR(-/-) mice. Surprisingly, vaccine-induced protection was largely mouse model dependent. Full protection against lethal intracranial challenge and a massive reduction of virus loads was conferred already by a minimal dose of 2 PFU YF17D in BALB/c and IFNAR(-/-) mice, but not in C57BL/6 mice. Correlation analysis of infection outcome with pre-challenge immunological markers indicates that YFV-specific IgG might suffice for protection, even in the absence of detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies. Finally, we propose that, in addition to IFNAR(-/-) mice, C57BL/6 mice with temporally blocked IFN-/ receptors represent a promising immunocompetent mouse model for the study of YF17D-induced immunity and evaluation of YF17D-derived vaccines.","output":"Comparing immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the yellow fever 17D vaccine in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the mass shutdown of universities across the United States in the spring of 2020. As the pandemic progressed, regional regulations resulted in a broad range of teaching modalities for the 2020-2021 academic year. While some regions remained tightly locked down (resulting in online-only instruction), others allowed limited or full campus operations within higher education. Located in Spokane, WA, Whitworth University is a small, liberal arts university which was allowed limited operations under a socially distanced model. While the pandemic resulted in some obvious campus changes (for example, masks were required on campus), more subtle changes were required at the curricular level. Adopting a flex model where students and faculty were allowed the option to participate online only while in-person classes were offered, Whitworth maintained in-person education through the 2020-2021 academic year. This FLEX model presented specific difficulties to laboratory courses due to social distancing restrictions. In this work, we describe five models developed in the Whitworth University Department of Chemistry toward teaching laboratories in a socially distanced manner with reduced room capacity. The primary modes of instruction were (1) a reduction of in-person laboratory time so that only half of the students were working in the laboratory at any given time, (2) an alternating weeks model where students came to the laboratory every other week and performed online laboratory experiences in the off weeks, (3) a split room model where one faculty member oversaw two laboratory spaces containing one-half of the normal number of students, (4) a higher number of smaller lab sections where social distancing could be maintained, and (5) a hybrid technique utilizing several of these concepts dependent upon the learning outcomes of the laboratory procedure each week. Benefits and challenges for each model are described by faculty herein. End-of-semester student course evaluation scores provide a comparison of student perceptions of learning outcomes and experiences in the laboratory in the various models. In addition, grade point averages were compared to prior years. Finally, departmental leadership provides insight on the administrative challenges of implementing these course models. Statistically, the models presented no significant change in student perceptions of learning or grade point averages for most courses regardless of the model when compared to prior offerings of these courses. Overall, the implementation of these protocols allowed students hands-on laboratory experiences with a minimal impact on the curriculum presented. ?","output":"Implementation of a Socially Distanced In-Person Laboratory Experience across the Chemistry Curriculum during the COVID-19 Pandemic at a Small, Liberal Arts University"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nervous system is the target for acute encephalitic viral infections, as well as a reservoir for persisting viruses. Intrathecal antibody (Ab) synthesis is well documented in humans afflicted by infections associated with neurological complications, as well as the demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis. This review focuses on the origin, recruitment, maintenance, and biological relevance of Ab-secreting cells (ASC) found in the central nervous system (CNS) following experimental neurotropic RNA virus infections. We will summarize evidence for a highly dynamic, evolving humoral response characterized by temporal alterations in B cell subsets, proliferation, and differentiation. Overall local Ab plays a beneficial role via complement-independent control of virus replication, although cross or self-reactive Ab to CNS antigens may contribute to immune-mediated pathogenesis during some infections. Importantly, protective Ab exert anti-viral activity not only by direct neutralization, but also by binding to cell surface-expressed viral glycoproteins. Ab engagement of viral glycoproteins blocks budding and mediates intracellular signaling leading to restored homeostatic and innate functions. The sustained Ab production by local ASC, as well as chemokines and cytokines associated with ASC recruitment and retention, are highlighted as critical components of immune control.","output":"Intrathecal Humoral Immunity to Encephalitic RNA Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over time, ethical judgments evolve, but so do the phenomena they are applied to.

Primary risk factors of interest were an influenza vaccination within 6 months prior to infection and oseltamivir prescriptions (filled on the day diagnosis, the following day, or 2-5 days). A multivariable logistic regression model was run to identify risk factors for influenza-related hospitalizations within 30 days of diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 2 395 498 influenza infections, 0.27% were hospitalized. Of those prescribed oseltamivir the day of diagnosis, 0.13% were later hospitalized, compared to 0.67% among those who filled prescriptions the following day and 11.8% when filled within 2 to 5 days. Upon adjustment, oseltamivir prescriptions filled on the day of diagnosis were associated with significantly decreased odds of hospitalization (OR 0.51 CI 0.48-0.55).

Although several strategies have been studied in terms of how and when to relax such stringent constraints, there is a lack of consensus on the optimal strategy for managing the pandemic beyond lockdown. The risks posed by delaying return to work and school openings are real and sizeable, particularly for relevant working sectors and for students from low-income families Inclusion criteria: This review will consider studies that focussed on relaxation strategies for lockdown exit among workers and students facing an epidemic /pandemic crisis. Methods: The searches will be conducted across four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciSearch, Google Scholar), and the bibliography of all selected studies will be hand-searched. In addition, because the topic is new, relevant literature will be checked using daily, updated COVID-19 collections from NCBI (LitCovid) and MedRxiv servers. Studies published in English, German, Spanish, Italian and French will be included, with no limits on publication dates. This review will consider all study designs, regardless of their rigor. The review method will be based on a two-phase approach: a title and abstract screening, and a full-text review performed by two independent researchers. Data will be summarised and categorised, and results will be presented in a tabular/diagrammatic form.","output":"Strategies for exiting COVID-19 lockdown for workplace and school: a scoping review protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is a commonly expressed sentiment that the science and philosophy of well-being would do well to learn from each other. Typically such calls identify mistakes and bad practices on both sides that would be remedied if scientists picked the right bit of philosophy and philosophers picked the right bit of science. We argue that the differences between philosophers and scientists thinking about well-being are more difficult to reconcile than such calls suggest, and that pluralism is central to this task. Pluralism is a stance that explicitly drives towards accommodating and nurturing the richness and diversity of well-being, both as a concept and as an object of inquiry. We show that well-being science manifests a contingent pluralism at the level of methodology, whereas philosophy of well-being has largely rejected pluralism at the conceptual level. Recently, things have begun to change. Within philosophy, conceptual monism is under attack. But so is methodological pluralism within science. We welcome the first development, and bemoan the second. We argue that a joined-up philosophy and science of well-being should recognise the virtues of both conceptual and methodological pluralism. Philosophers should embrace the methodological justification of pluralism that can be found in the well-being sciences, and scientists should embrace the conceptual reasons to be pluralist that can be found in philosophical debate.","output":"Well-Being and Pluralism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Assessing individuals knowledge and preventive behaviors towards the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is essential for the related public health surveillance strategies. Although some of the studies were conducted in Bangladesh, none of these studies considered the geographical distribution of knowledge and preventive behaviors towards COVID-19. Therefore, the present nationwide cross-sectional study with 10,067 samples for the first-time aims to assess the knowledge gap by presenting the geographical distribution of the COVID-19 knowledge and preventive behaviors across all administrative districts of Bangladesh. The measures included socio-demographics and questions about knowledge and preventive behaviors related to COVID-19. One-way ANOVA, independent t-test, and multiple linear regression were used to analyze the data. In addition, GIS-based mapping identified district-wise distribution of the outcomes. Results indicated that the overall mean score of knowledge related to COVID-19 was 14.363  3.073, whereas 16.95  2.89 was for preventive behaviors. Participants being male, being divorced or widowed, consuming alcohol, smoking cigarettes, living in villages, and having no formal education reported lower performing preventive COVID-19 behaviors. Those participants with higher knowledge scores reported higher preventive COVID-19 behaviors ( = 0.053, p<0.001). However, the model predicted only 13.2% of the variation in preventive COVID-19 behaviors while the overall model being significant. The findings suggest that the Bangladeshi government should initiate appropriate far-reaching program of health education focusing on knowledge and preventive behaviors towards COVID-19 at a community level.

METHODS A multiinstitutional robotic surgical consortium was created to evaluate the usefulness of robotics for gynecologic oncology surgery. An analysis of a multiinstitutional database of all patients who underwent robotic surgery for endometrial carcinoma between April 2003 and January 2009 was performed. Records were reviewed for demographic data and perioperative outcomes. Individual surgeon outcomes were analyzed as well in an attempt to evaluate characteristics of learning with incorporation of robotic technology. RESULTS Four hundred five patients were identified who underwent robotic surgery for endometrial cancer. Mean age was 62.2 years and mean body mass index was 32.4. Fifty-five percent of patients reported a prior abdominal surgery. Final pathologic analysis demonstrated that 89.6% of all patients had stage I and II disease. Mean operative time was 170.5 minutes. Mean estimated blood loss was 87.5 mL. Mean lymph node count was 15.5. Mean hospital stay was 1.8 days. Intraoperative complications occurred in 3.5% of the patients and conversion to laparotomy occurred in 6.7%. Postoperative complications were reported in 14.6% of the patients. For the group, fewer than 10 cases were required to achieve proficiency with the procedure. CONCLUSION Robotic technology may level the playing field between the novice and expert laparoscopist for endometrial cancer staging. Prospective trials should be undertaken to compare robotic and laparoscopic approaches to treat endometrial cancer.

Mutations in these epitope regions are continuously emerging, potentially conferring resistance to COVID-19 therapeutics in development. Individual phase I studies showed that BRII-196 or BRII-198 alone were safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects. The BRII-196 and BRII-198 cocktail is currently under evaluation in Phase 2/3 studies for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Preclinical study: BRII-196 and BRII-198 were evaluated in the microneutralization assay using pseudo-viruses encoding mutations identified in the spike protein of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns, including strains originating in UK, SA, BR, CA, and India. The fold-change in neutralization IC(50) titers relative to wild-type virus was calculated. Phase 1 study: healthy adults received sequential IV BRII-196 and BRII-198 (n=9) or placebo (n=3); and were followed for 180 days. Two dose levels (750mg/750mg and 1500mg/1500mg) were evaluated for safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. Interim analysis results are presented. RESULTS: Preclinical: BRII-196 and BRII-198 exhibited neutralizing activity against pseudo-virus variants that contained spike mutations of a panel of variants including B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351(SA), P.1(BR), B.1.427/429 (CA), B.1.526 (NY), and B.1.617 (IN), comparable to that against wild-type virus. Phase I study: BRII-196 plus BRII-198 was well tolerated with no dose-limiting adverse events (AEs), deaths, serious adverse events, or infusion reactions. The majority of AEs were isolated asymptomatic grade 1-2 laboratory abnormalities. (Table 1). Each mAb displayed pharmacokinetic characteristics expected of extended half-life YTE-antibodies. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The BRII-196 and BRII-198 cocktail was well-tolerated, and maintains neutralization against currently reported circulating variants of concern. These preclinical and clinical results support further development of BRII-196 and BRII-198 as a therapeutic or prophylactic option for SARS-CoV-2. DISCLOSURES: David A.

With this requirement;however, CMS did not provide specific guidance for implementation. The purpose of TIC was to obtain traumatic experiences, identify approaches to manage reoccurrences of certain triggers, and to prevent re-traumatization thus providing a safer environment and more effective care. Here we communicate the accumulated experiences of the first-year implementation of TIC in one SNF. Methods: Budd Terrace at Wesley Woods, a non-profit, 250 bed long-term care and SNF, providing short-term rehabilitation and long-term placement. Without implementation guidance for TIC, our Interdisciplinary Team (IDT) added TIC questionnaires in the Baseline Care Plan, which is within 48 hours of admission. The admission nurse developed a process to guide the collection upon admission including the creation of a system encompassing a 6-part approach emphasizing the sensitive nature of trauma - Trust, Readiness, safe Atmosphere, Understanding, Minimize exposure, and Accommodation Results: We collected data from 473 new admissions from November 2019 to November 2020. Of these, 4.9% (n=23) reported experiencing trauma. Survivors ranged in age from 25 to 97 years old and reported a broad range of trauma experiences including: sexual assault (43%, all women);complicated grief (13%);COVID-19 (13%);combat-related PTSD (8.7%);intimate partner violence;racial discrimination;emotional abuse;other medical trauma;and accidents (all at 4.3%). The IDT was informed of the survivors' experiences. The social worker created a comprehensive person-centered care plan for the patient, addressing the trauma, goals, and interventions. Based on information gathered from this process we engaged in therapeutic approaches and take measures to prevent re-traumatization while in our care. Conclusions: During this implementation and ongoing pandemic, we recognized the profound importance of TIC in the SNF setting. Our process enabled us to connect better with our patients as their own self, with their own distinct experiences and needs that are often overlooked in medical charts. It has equipped us with a unique and valuable lens to view our patients, through which we can strive to provide a holistic, personalized, and a compassionate based care.","output":"Getting to know our patients through the lens of trauma informed care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current condition of the COVID-19 pandemic affects health especially for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in rural areas in performing self-care management.

The study evaluates the differences between Slovenia and Italy in health-related everyday practices induced by the restrictive measures during first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The study examined changes through an online survey conducted in nine European countries from April 15-28, 2020. The survey included questions from a simple activity inventory questionnaire (SIMPAQ), the European Health Interview Survey, and some other questions. To compare changes between countries with low and high incidence of COVID-19 epidemic, we examine 956 valid responses from Italy (N=511;50% males) and Slovenia (N=445;26% males). Results: During the survey, there was a 4.7-fold higher incidence and 12.1-fold more deaths (per 100,000) in Italy than in Slovenia. Barring periods and measures were similar, the latter more stringent in Italy. We found more changes in Italy than in Slovenia: physical inactivity increased (Italy: +65% vs. Slovenia: +21%;p< 0.001), walking time decreased (Italy: -68% vs. Slovenia: -4.4%;p< 0.001);physical work increased by 38% in Slovenia (p< 0.001), and recreation time decreased by 37% in Italy (p< 0.001). Italians reported a decrease in quality of general health, fitness level, psychological well-being, and quality of life (p<0.001);Slovenians showed a decline in psychological well-being and quality of life (p<0.001) but generally had a higher concern for their own health (p=0.005). Changes in eating habits (meal size and consumption of unhealthy food), age and physical inactivity were positively correlated with increases in body mass, while changes in general well-being and concern for health were negatively correlated. Conclusion: The study highlights the implications of COVID-19 measures and epidemiological data and provides insight into the relationship between them and various lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 measures.

Understanding patients metabolomics and genetic make-up in conjunction with clinical data will significantly lead to determining predisposition, diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers and paths ultimately providing optimal and personalized care for diverse, and targeted chronic and acute diseases. In clinical settings, we need to timely model clinical and multi-omics data to find statistical patterns across millions of features to identify underlying biologic pathways, modifiable risk factors, and actionable information that support early detection and prevention of complex disorders, and development of new therapies for better patient care. It is important to calculate quantitative phenotype measurements, evaluate variants in unique genes and interpret using ACMG guidelines, find frequency of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants without disease indicators, and observe autosomal recessive carriers with a phenotype manifestation in metabolome. Next, ensuring security to reconcile noise, we need to build and train machine-learning prognostic models to meaningfully process multisource heterogeneous data to identify high-risk rare variants and make medically relevant predictions.

The outbreak of COVID-19 makes online learning popular and universal. Different from the traditional way of education, online learning allows learners to have access to complexity and diversity as well as varying levels of knowledge mastery. For the current mainstream personalized education, making good use of education data for learning analysis is an important direction to solve the problem. This paper finds that learning platform has just begun to rise on a large scale, but there are still some problems, such as the confusion of learning resources, the unreasonable setting of the question bank and the unclear classification of the difficulty of knowledge points. Most of the platforms do not divide the knowledge points and difficulty of the questions, therefore, students cannot find the key points, and some of them fill in the difficulty directly according to subjective judgment, which is not scientific nor objective. This paper analyzes students' historical answer data, classifies and divides the difficulty of knowledge points by clustering algorithm, then verifying it on the Istudy education platform which is developed by our laboratory. The experimental results show that this labeling system is more objective and effective, contributing to improving the efficiency of online learning.

However, wild foods are not regularly considered in the planning of strategies for food and nutrition security mainly due to the lack of technical and/or scientific knowledge so that they can be considered suitable for human consumption. This paper proposes a multidisciplinary method that estimates the potential of wild foods as alternative resources when planning interventions in favour of food and nutrition security in tropical forest territories. When designing the method, four dimensions were identified in science, technology and innovation (STI) that define this potential as well as ten assessment criteria. The wild foods chosen for applying the method were Alibertia patinoi (a fruit commonly known as Boroj) and Proechimys semispinosus (Mouse of thorns), which are two of the main wild foods traditionally used by human communities in a tropical forest territory in the northwest of Colombia. In both cases, although there are significant advances in STI, compliance with some criteria is still required to regard them as viable alternatives for nutrition and food security within this territory. This research is useful for promoting the inclusion of wild food in food security programmes for communities where this food is already included in their traditional pattern of consumption and identifies the progress needed in STI to achieve this purpose. It may also promote the early recognition of possible traditional and cultural practices with high risk of transmission of pathogenic elements by the handling and/or inadequate consumption of wild foods.

Among options for accelerated development is the evaluation of drug combinations in the absence of prior monotherapy data. This approach is appealing for a number of reasons. First, combining two or more drugs with related or complementary therapeutic effects permits a multipronged approach addressing the variable pathways of the disease. Second, if an individual component of a combination offers a therapeutic effect, then in the absence of antagonism, a trial of combination therapy should still detect individual efficacy. Third, this strategy is time saving. Rather than taking a stepwise approach to evaluating monotherapies, this strategy begins with testing all relevant therapeutic options. Finally, given the severity of the current pandemic and the absence of treatment options, the likelihood of detecting a treatment effect with combination therapy maintains scientific enthusiasm for evaluating repurposed treatments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study involving patients with clinical-epidemiological suspect of COVID-19 infection, who performed CXRs at the emergency department (ED) of our University Hospital from March 1 to March 31, 2020. All patients performed RT-PCR nasopharyngeal and throat swab, CXR at the ED and clinical-epidemiological data. RT-PCR results were considered the reference standard. The final outcome was expressed as discharged or hospitalized patients into a medicine department or intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: Patients that had a RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 infection were 234 in total: 153 males (65.4%) and 81 females (34.6%), with a mean age of 66.04 years (range 18-97 years). Thirteen CXRs were negative for radiological thoracic involvement (5.6%). The following alterations were more commonly observed: 135 patients with lung consolidations (57.7%), 147 (62.8%) with GGO, 55 (23.5%) with nodules and 156 (66.6%) with reticular-nodular opacities. Patients with consolidations and GGO coexistent in the same radiography were 35.5% of total. Peripheral (57.7%) and lower zone distribution (58.5%) were the most common predominance. Moreover, bilateral involvement (69.2%) was most frequent than unilateral one. Baseline CXR sensitivity in our experience is about 67.1%. The most affected patients were especially males in the age group 60-79 years old (45.95%, of which 71.57% males). RALE score was slightly higher in male than in female patients. ANOVA with Games-Howell post hoc showed significant differences of RALE scores for group 1 vs 3 (p < 0.001) and 2 vs 3 (p = 0.001). Inter-reader agreement in assigning RALE score was very good (ICC: 0.92-with 95% confidence interval 0.88-0.95). CONCLUSION: In COVID-19, CXR shows patchy or diffuse reticular-nodular opacities and consolidation, with basal, peripheral and bilateral predominance. In our experience, baseline CXR had a sensitivity of 68.1%.

We report here a patient with FAP who had resection via rectal eversion just over the dentate line under direct visualization and ileoanal-J pouch anastomosis by double-stapler technique. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 40 yr. old female patient with FAP underwent surgery. Firstly, colon and the rectum mobilized completely, and then from the 10 cm. proximal to the ileo-caecal valve to the recto-sigmoid junction total colectomy was performed. Rectum was everted by a grasping forceps which was introduced through the anus and then resection was performed by a linear stapler just over the dentate line. A stapled J-shaped ileal reservoir construction followed by intraluminal stapler-facilitated ileoanal anastomosis. Follow up at six months anal sphincter function was found normal. DISCUSSION There is only surgical management option for FAP patients up to now. Total colectomy with IRA and restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA is surgical options for FAP patients that avoid the need for a permanent stoma.

We used Lins concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) to quantify concordance between AMR prevalence estimates in wastewater and human compartments (where CCC = 1 reflects perfect concordance), and logistic regression to identify study features (e.g. sampling methods) associated with high agreement studies (defined as >70% of within-study wastewater-human AMR prevalence comparisons within 10%). RESULTS: Of 8,867 records and 441 full-text methods reviewed, 33 studies were included. AMR prevalence data was extractable from 24 studies conducting phenotypic-only (n = 7), genotypic-only (n = 1) or combined (n = 16) AMR detection. Overall concordance of wastewater-human AMR prevalence estimates was reasonably high for both phenotypic (CCC = 0.85 [95% CI 0.8C0.89]) and genotypic approaches (CCC = 0.88 (95% CI 0.84C0.9)) despite diverse study designs, bacterial species investigated and phenotypic/genotypic targets. No significant relationships between methodological approaches and high agreement studies were identified using logistic regression; however, this was limited by inconsistent reporting of study features, significant heterogeneity in approaches and limited sample size. Based on a secondary, descriptive synthesis, studies conducting composite sampling of wastewater influent, longitudinal sampling >12 months, and time-/location-matched sampling of wastewater and human compartments generally had higher agreement. CONCLUSION: Wastewater-based surveillance of AMR appears promising, with high overall concordance between wastewater and human AMR prevalence estimates in studies irrespective of heterogenous approaches. However, our review suggests future work would benefit from: time-/location-matched sampling of wastewater and human populations, composite sampling of influent, and sampling >12 months for longitudinal studies. Further research and clear and consistent reporting of study methods is required to identify optimal practice.","output":"Systematic review of wastewater surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in human populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic has shaken the global health system and economy by their roots. This epidemic is still spreading and showing no signs of decreasing trend. Vaccination could be the only effective and economical means to control this pandemic. A number of research institutions and pharmaceutical companies have plunged into the race of vaccine development against COVID-19 which are in various stages of development. An intriguing fact of coronavirus infections is that in every decade of the 21st century there is a new major coronavirus epidemic, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and now COVID-19; and such epidemics are expected in future too. Since most of the biological characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are still obscure, the scientists are relying on the information available on SARS-CoV and to some extent on MERS-CoV for designing and developing COVID-19 vaccines. But there is a need of vigorous testing for immunogenicity, safety, efficacy, and level of protection conferred in the hosts. This review focuses on the challenges and prospects of vaccine development against COVID-19. It highlights seriousness, bottlenecks in vaccine development, possible vaccine candidates, different vaccine strategies, safety evaluation issues, and vaccine production processes pertaining to COVID-19 based on the knowledge acquired on SARS and MERS vaccine development in the past.","output":"Challenges and prospects of COVID-19 vaccine development based on the progress made in SARS and MERS vaccine development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Purpose Tremendous physical and psychological pressure has been placed on healthcare workers due to the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to examine the anxiety and depression levels and related factors among healthcare professionals working in operating theatres (anesthetic technicians and nurses) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design The universe of this descriptive study consisted of healthcare professionals working in operating theatres in various healthcare institutions in Turkey. Methods The data were collected online between 9 April 2020 and 12 April 2020 using a SurveyMonkey questionnaire (SurveyMonkey, San Mateo, California, United States) and healthcare workers who volunteered to participate in the study were contacted via the social media platforms Twitter, LinkedIn and WhatsApp and asked to answer the questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 22.0 software. Findings In total, 702 healthcare professionals working in operating theatres participated in the study. The mean depression and anxiety scores of the participants were found to be 9.44.6 (min: 0Cmax: 21) and 10.04.5 (min: 0Cmax: 21), respectively. Depression scores were statistically significantly higher among females, single individuals, those who had children, those living with a person aged 60 years or older (p<0.05). Meanwhile, anxiety scores were statistically significantly higher among females, single individuals (including widowed and divorced), university graduates, those with at least one chronic disease and those whose workload increased (p<0.05). Conclusions The present study showed that anxiety and depression symptoms were high among healthcare professionals working in operating theatres. In order to reduce these symptoms, psychological conditions of healthcare professionals can be followed continuously and regularly via standard procedures, and necessary interventions can be provided in the early period.","output":"Evaluation of depression and anxiety levels and related factors among operating theatre workers during the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The proceedings contain 128 papers.

The supply scarcity and capacity limits affect test administration: priority must be given to hospitalized patients and symptomatic individuals, which can prevent the identification of asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals and hence effective tracking and tracing policies. We describe optimized group testing strategies applicable to SARS-CoV-2 tests in scenarios tailored to the current COVID-19 pandemic and assess significant gains compared to individual testing. Methods: We account for biochemically realistic scenarios in the context of dilution effects on SARS-CoV-2 samples and consider evidence on specificity and sensitivity of PCR-based tests for the novel coronavirus. Because of the current uncertainty and the temporal and spatial changes in the prevalence regime, we provide analysis for several realistic scenarios and propose fast and reliable strategies for massive testing procedures. Key Findings: We find significant efficiency gaps between different group testing strategies in realistic scenarios for SARS-CoV-2 testing, highlighting the need for an informed decision of the pooling protocol depending on estimated prevalence, target specificity, and high- vs. low-risk population. For example, using one of the presented methods, all 1.47 million inhabitants of Munich, Germany, could be tested using only around 141 thousand tests if the infection rate is below 0.4% is assumed. Using 1 million tests, the 6.69 million inhabitants from the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, could be tested as long as the infection rate does not exceed 1%. Moreover, we provide an interactive web application, available at www.grouptexting.com, for visualizing the different strategies and designing pooling schemes according to specific prevalence scenarios and test configurations. Interpretation: Altogether, this work may help provide a basis for an efficient upscaling of current testing procedures, which takes the population heterogeneity into account and is fine-grained towards the desired study populations, e.g., mild/asymptomatic individuals vs. symptomatic ones but also mixtures thereof.

Biological weapons bring the additional dimension that these could be self-replicating, easy to manufacture and synthesized with commonly available expertise. This resulted in increasing concern about the type of research done and communicated, despite the fact that such research often has direct societal benefits, bringing the dual-use dilemma to biology. The conundrum of dual use research of concern was crystallized by the so-called gain-of-function type of experiments in which avian influenza viruses were endowed with new properties in the laboratory such as increased virulence and the capacity for mammalian transmission. After more than a decade of intensive discussion and controversy involving biological experiments with dual-use potential, there is no consensus on the issue except for the need to carry out such experiments in the safest conditions possible. In this essay, we review the topic with the hindsight of several years and suggest that instead of prescribing prohibitions and experimental limitations the focus should be on the importance of scientific questions at hand. We posit that the importance of a scientific question for medical and scientific progress provides a benchmark to determine the acceptable level of risk in biological experimentation.","output":"A New Approach to Evaluating the RiskCBenefit Equation for Dual-Use and Gain-of-Function Research of Concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused an emergency adaptation of university teaching around the world.

Identification of risk factors for complications would allow for appropriate preoperative optimization of the patient, as well as reasonable postoperative care and early diagnosis and treatment of possible complications. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors for perioperative complications after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of patients operated for morbid obesity. Regarding postoperative complications defined as adverse events occurring within 30 days of the procedure. Factors associated with patient characteristics and those related to the surgical procedure were determined. 408 patients met inclusion criteria and were submitted to surgical treatment. LSG and LRYGB were performed in 233 and 175 patients, respectively. RESULTS Complications were observed in 30 (7.3%) patients. The maximum preoperative body weight and BMI, as well as body weight and BMI on the day of surgery were associated with increased complication rate. The type of the procedure did not influence perioperative complications (LRYGB vs. LSG; OR: 1.14; CI: 0.53-2.44; p = 0.74). Although operative time statistically significantly increased the risk of complications, it did not seem clinically relevant (OR: 1.01; CI: 1.00-1.02; p = 0.003). An increase in the number of stapler firings used significantly increased complication rate only in LSG group. CONCLUSION Longer duration of LSG and the increase in the number of stapler firings used during LSG should alert a surgeon to an increased risk of postoperative complications. In patients submitted to LRYGB the risk of possible complications increases with BMI.","output":"Risk factors for complications of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reactive molecular oxygen (O2) plays important roles in bioenergetics and metabolism and is implicated in biochemical pathways underlying angiogenesis, fertilization, wound healing and regeneration.

OBJECTIVES To describe outbreak containment actions initiated by MDA, including a COVID-19 tele-triage center and home testing by paramedics. METHODS Retrospective analysis was conducted of de-identified data from the call management and command and control systems during the first period of the COVID-19 outbreak in Israel (23 February 2020-15 March 2020). RESULTS During the study period, the total number of calls to the dispatch centers was 477,321 with a daily average of 21,696, compared to 6000-6500 during routine times. The total number of COVID-19 related calls was 334,230 (daily average 15,194). There were 28,454 calls (8.51% of all COVID-19 related calls, average 1293/day) transferred to the COVID-19 call center. Of the COVID-19 call center inquiries, 8390 resulted in the dispatch of a dedicated vehicle, including a paramedic wearing personal protective equipment, to collect samples for testing (daily average 381).

RESULTS: Post cesarean delivery, patients who received both bilateral transversus abdominis plane blocks with liposomal bupivacaine and neuraxial morphine was associated with a significant decrease in the number of patients using post operative opioids, 54%C60% decreased to 18% (p < 0.001), and a decreased length of stay; 3.1 days was reduced to 2.39 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Neuraxial opioids combined with liposomal bupivacaine transversus abdominis plane blocks provided significant pain relief for patients post cesarean delivery, required less post operative opioids, and facilitated earlier discharge that may aid in reducing patient exposure and hospital burden secondary to COVID-19.","output":"The use of bilateral transversus abdominis plane blocks with liposomal bupivacaine on postoperative cesarean delivery patients during COVID-19 pandemic is associated with reduced narcotics use and reduced length of stay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: It is imperative to acknowledge that COVID-19 poses significant burden on the psychological well-being of people With implementation of lockdown and measures like quarantine, the mental health of people is affected, and the associated problems may range from depression to suicidal ideation With this background, the aim of this study was to assess COVID-19 anxiety among general population of the state of Andhra Pradesh Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study assessed the COVID-19 anxiety among the population of Andhra Pradesh using COVID-19 Anxiety Scale (CAS-7), a seven-item validated psychometric instrument which assesses the cognitive, emotional, and physiological dimensions of COVID-19 anxiety, using a semantic differential scale The final sample constituted 1,346 participants Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 20 software (IBM SPSS statistics for Windows version 20, Armonk, NY, USA)","output":"Measuring the impact of COVID-19 on mental health as a preliminary procedure in primary care provision: a cross-sectional study using COVID-19 anxiety scale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zebadiah Hall, Director of Student Disability Services at Cornell University, explained how his office's approach to COVID-19 promotes social justice","output":"Focus on social justice when addressing COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the update of the \\"Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia\\" from the National Health Commission of China, the military medical expert group on the front-line has formulated the \\"Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19 from Military Medical Team Supporting Wuhan(Trial Version 2)\\" It provides some additional comments on the national protocol including disease name, virus origin, population susceptibility, interpretation of serum-specific antibody test results, evaluation of outbreak outcome and so on","output":"[Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19 from Military Medical Team Supporting Wuhan (Trial Version 2)]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Gas exchange in COVID-19 pneumonia is impaired and vessel obstruction has been suspected to cause ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Dual-energy CT (DECT) can depict pulmonary perfusion by regional assessment of iodine uptake. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was the analysis of pulmonary perfusion using dual-energy CT in a cohort of 27 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed pulmonary perfusion with DECT in 27 consecutive patients (mean age 57 years, range 21C73; 19 men and 8 women) with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Iodine uptake (IU) in regions-of-interest placed into normally aerated lung, ground-glass opacifications (GGO) and consolidations was measured using a dedicated postprocessing software. Vessel enlargement (VE) within opacifications and presence of pulmonary embolism (PE) was assessed by subjective analysis. Linear mixed models were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Compared to normally aerated lung 106/151 (70.2%) opacifications without upstream PE demonstrated an increased IU, 9/151 (6.0%) an equal IU and 36/151 (23.8%) a decreased IU. The estimated mean iodine uptake (EMIU) in opacifications without upstream PE (GGO 1.77 mg/mL; 95%-CI: 1.52C2.02; p = 0.011, consolidations 1.82 mg/mL; 95%-CI: 1.56C2.08, p = 0.006) was significantly higher compared to normal lung (1.22 mg/mL; 95%-CI: 0.95C1.49). In case of upstream PE, EMIU of opacifications (combined GGO and consolidations) was significantly decreased compared to normal lung (0.52 mg/mL; 95%-CI: -0.07C1.12; p = 0.043). The presence of VE in opacifications correlated significantly with iodine uptake (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: DECT revealed the opacifications in a subset of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia to be perfused non-uniformly with some being hypo- and others being hyperperfused. Mean iodine uptake in opacifications (both ground-glass and consolidation) was higher compared to normally aerated lung except for areas with upstream pulmonary embolism. Vessel enlargement correlated with iodine uptake: In summary, in a cohort of 27 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, dual-energy CT demonstrated a wide range of iodine uptake in pulmonary ground-glass opacifications and consolidations as a surrogate marker for hypo- and hyperperfusion compared to normally aerated lung. Applying DECT to determine which pathophysiology is predominant might help to tailor therapy to the individual patients needs.","output":"Severe COVID-19 pneumonia: Perfusion analysis in correlation with pulmonary embolism and vessel enlargement using dual-energy CT data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 11 March 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was defined by the World Health Organization as a pandemic. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the newly evolving human coronavirus infection that causes COVID-19, and it first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread rapidly all over the world. COVID-19 is being increasingly investigated through virology, epidemiology, and clinical management strategies. There is currently no established consensus on the standard of care in the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 patients. However, certain medications suggested for other diseases have been shown to be potentially effective for treating this infection, though there has yet to be clear evidence. Therapies include new agents that are currently tested in several clinical trials, in addition to other medications that have been repurposed as antiviral and immune-modulating therapies. Previous high-morbidity human coronavirus epidemics such as the 2003 SARS-CoV and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prompted the identification of compounds that could theoretically be active against the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, advances in molecular biology techniques and computational analysis have allowed for the better recognition of the virus structure and the quicker screening of chemical libraries to suggest potential therapies. This review aims to summarize rationalized pharmacotherapy considerations in COVID-19 patients in order to serve as a tool for health care professionals at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic. All the reviewed therapies require either additional drug development or randomized large-scale clinical trials to be justified for clinical use.","output":"The rationale for potential pharmacotherapy of covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be an unprecedented challenge to worldwide health, and strategies to mitigate the spread and severity of COVID-19 infection are urgently needed. Emerging evidence suggests that the composition of the gut microbiome and modification of microbial ecology via probiotics can affect susceptibility to a wide range of infections, including respiratory tract infections. In this study, we aim to evaluate the effects of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) versus placebo on COVID-19 infection status and the gut microbiome in subjects with a household contact who has tested positive for COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, we will randomise 1132 subjects having a household contact who has recently (7 days) tested positive for COVID-19 to daily oral LGG or placebo for 28 days. We hypothesise that taking LGG as a probiotic will protect against COVID-19 infection and reduce the severity of disease in those who become infected (primary endpoint: decreased symptoms), and will be associated with beneficial changes in the composition of the gut microbiome. Stool samples and nasal swabs will be collected to evaluate the microbiome by 16S rRNA sequencing and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, respectively. We will also conduct multivariate analysis of demographic, behavioural, temporal, and other variables that may predict development of symptoms and other outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial is conducted under a Food and Drug Administration Investigational New Drug for LGG, has received ethics approval by the institutional review board of Duke University and enrolment has begun.

A total of 300 patients completed the questionnaire, including 150 in Poland and 150 in the Ukraine. The level of vaccination acceptance was assessed before and after medical consultation. There were 53 (35.3%) patients with the intention to get vaccinated in Poland and 25 (16.7%) in the Ukraine. After consultation with a physician, this increased to 109 (72.6%) in Poland and 69 (46%) in the Ukraine.

Sequencing of selected positive samples found mainly gammacoronaviruses, but also some deltacoronaviruses. The detection rate of coronaviruses was improved by using multiple PCR assays, as no single assay could detect all coronavirus positive samples. Sequencing of the relatively conserved Orf1 PCR amplicons found that Australian duck gammacoronaviruses were similar to duck gammacoronaviruses around the world. Some sequenced shorebird gammacoronaviruses belonged to Charadriiformes lineages, but others were more closely related to duck gammacoronaviruses. Australian duck and heron deltacoronaviruses belonged to lineages with other duck and heron deltacoronaviruses, but were almost 20% different in nucleotide sequence to other deltacoronavirus sequences available. Deltacoronavirus sequences from shorebirds formed a lineage with a deltacoronavirus from a ruddy turnstone detected in the United States. Given that Australian duck gammacoronaviruses are highly similar to those found in other regions, and Australian ducks rarely come into contact with migratory Palearctic duck species, we hypothesise that migratory shorebirds are the important vector for moving wild bird coronaviruses into and out of Australia.","output":"Detection and characterisation of coronaviruses in migratory and non-migratory Australian wild birds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses are evolving at an alarming rate, spreading and inconspicuously adapting to cutting-edge therapies. Therefore, the search for rapid, informative and reliable diagnostic methods is becoming urgent as ever. Conventional clinical tests (PCR, serology, etc.) are being continually optimized, yet provide very limited data. Could high throughput sequencing (HTS) become the future gold standard in molecular diagnostics of viral infections? Compared to conventional clinical tests, HTS is universal and more precise at profiling pathogens. Nevertheless, it has not yet been widely accepted as a diagnostic tool, owing primarily to its high cost and the complexity of sample preparation and data analysis. Those obstacles must be tackled to integrate HTS into daily clinical practice. For this, three objectives are to be achieved: (1) designing and assessing universal protocols for library preparation, (2) assembling purpose-specific pipelines, and (3) building computational infrastructure to suit the needs and financial abilities of modern healthcare centers. Data harvested with HTS could not only augment diagnostics and help to choose the correct therapy, but also facilitate research in epidemiology, genetics and virology.

The deposition of aerosol and bio-aerosol particles in the respiratory tract of healthy adult males and females was calculated using Multipath Particles Dosimetry Model. The exposure assessment revealed that exposure to fine airborne particles (<1 m) was dominant;more than 40% of total aerosol deposition and 10C16% of bio-aerosol deposition were found in the pulmonary region of the respiratory tract. Higher deposition dose of particles was observed in males in comparison to females. In the journey along the metro line, a high deposition dose was found during in-train travel and in the underground metro station. Severalfold higher deposition doses were found in the respiratory tract of subway metro workers due to the longer exposure duration. Recent studies have confirmed the spread of COVID-19 virus through airborne particles of size <2.5 m and airborne transmission was found to be significantly more in indoor spaces.

MEASUREMENTS: Older adults in Uganda were interviewed over the phone and asked about their lives before and since COVID-19, and how public health restrictions have affected their lives. Semi-structured interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and translated into English. Transcripts were thematically analyzed and themes generated in discussion. RESULTS: In total, 30 older adults participated in the study. Five themes were identified: (1) economic impacts; (2) lack of access to basic necessities; (3) impact on healthcare utilization; (4) social impacts and (5) violent reinforcement of public health restrictions. COVID-19 public health restrictions had severe impacts on their lives, with many people having not enough food to eat due to lack of income, and being unable to pay their grandchildren's school fees. Steep rises in public transport fares and an overall avoidance of transport also resulted in a lack of access to healthcare services and difficulty in getting food. Restrictions were violently reinforced by security guards. CONCLUSIONS: Public health restrictions have a severe impact not only on older adults but also on the whole family in Uganda.

Genomic RNA was extracted and tailed with adenine residues at the 3' end with poly-A polymerase. Double-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized, using the poly-A-tailed RNA as a template and oligo-dT as a primer, and then cloned into the pUC9 plasmid. Virus-specific cDNA sequences, varying in length from 0.5 to 2.5 kilobases (kb), were obtained. One BVDV-specific sequence of cloned cDNA, 1.1 kb in length and with an internal Pst I restriction endonuclease cleavage site, was selected for use as a probe. The cloned cDNA insert was removed from the plasmid either with or without flanking plasmid sequences and labeled with 32P-nucleotides by nick translation for use as hybridization probes for BVDV. The performance of probes of smaller fragments of the insert was compared to that of the intact sequence in hybridization assays. In addition, 2 methods of specimen preparation were compared to establish optimum parameters for hybridization. The hybridization assay was 10-100 times more sensitive than infectivity assays for BVDV in infected cell cultures. Freezing of specimens reduced by 10-fold the sensitivity of hybridization for BVDV target sequences.

This finding is intuitive because people avoid daycare due to the increased risk of exposure to infection. However, the number of users of home care is positively correlated to users of daycare, which implies that home care has not functioned as a replacement for daycare, despite government encouragement. Furthermore, a regression analysis using prefecture data shows that working hours for both females and males were negatively correlated to the national status of the pandemic, while the regional status of the pandemic was negatively correlated only to female working hours. This implies that female labor status is more vulnerable to such outbreaks in Japan.

METHODS We will conduct a living umbrella review according to the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewers' Manual. We will consider all knowledge syntheses addressing scaling in health or social care (e.g., any setting, any clinical area) and conducted in a systematic way. We will search the following electronic databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, PsychINFO (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, Sociological Abstract (Proquest), Academic Search Premier (EBSCO), and Proquest Dissertations & Theses Global, from inception. Furthermore, we will conduct searches of the grey literature. No restriction regarding date or language will be applied. Each phase of the review will be processed by two independent reviewers. We will develop a data extraction form on Covidence. We will assess the methodological quality of the included reviews using AMSTAR2 and the risk of bias using ROBIS. Results will be presented in tabular form and accompanied by a narrative synthesis covering the traditional themes of scaling science that emerge from the analysis, such as coverage, range, and sustainability, as well as themes less covered in the literature, including reporting guidance, models, tools, barriers, and/or facilitators to scaling innovations, evidence regarding application in high-income or low-income countries, and end-user engagement.

Four of the studies used a method of time use registration, and six papers used interviews or questionnaires. Common meals with family members were the most common, and dinners late at night were often preferred for commensal activities among the working population. In conclusion, the family meal seemed to be the most important commensal meal. It is clear from the collected papers and from previous systematic reviews that more studies of commensal meals in general and about timing aspects in particular and in relation to nutritional health are essential to provide a solid background of knowledge regarding the importance of timing in relation to commensal meals.","output":"Assessing Time of Eating in Commensality Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The core task of European Reference Networks (ERNs) is to reduce health care inequalities throughout Europe for all patients with rare and complex conditions. A secure web-based application for virtual consultations, the Clinical Patient Management System (CPMS), was developed by the EU to provide expert specialized care for all these patients. This review analyses the opportunities and difficulties that the implementation of this virtual network implies for physicians as well as for the patients. METHODS: European Reference Network on Rare Endocrine Conditions (Endo-ERN) installed an Operational Helpdesk (OH) to support their members in using CPMS. The OH initiated several actions to facilitate and increase the usage of CPMS. Satisfaction with the system and reasons for low participation rates in virtual case discussions were analyzed by different surveys. RESULTS: The number of CPMS users increased constantly, but the active usage of the system remains insufficient. Main reasons were technical difficulties, lack of time and insufficient awareness about CPMS in experts and patients throughout Europe. Still, outcomes of the virtual discussions are considered useful by involved experts and the discussions have provided topics for educational webinars and research. CONCLUSIONS: CPMS is a secure system with many advantages compared to previous ways of consulting experts but also difficulties that need to be overcome with future strategies. By facilitating its use and increasing awareness among all relevant European experts and patients, CPMS can help to make the existing expertise available for all patients with rare (endocrine) conditions throughout Europe as it was intended.","output":"CPMSCimproving patient care in Europe via virtual case discussions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world Health Organization (WHO) has designated the novel coronavirus outbreak (COVID19) as a pandemic It is estimated that 125 million to 250 million people in India will be affected and 70% of humanity is likely to be infected within 1 year The psychological impact can be from stress or economic-socio-occupational disruption, and people may suffer from fear of infection, anger, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, increased substance use, or relapse of psychiatric disorders This can be of great concern for India, which already has high mental health morbidity but the lowest number of mental health experts, according to the WHO Hence, it is imperative to consider the empowerment of available human resources Here, we propose a structured action plan for mental and behavioral preparedness against virus COVID 19 disaster currently but virtually for any disaster in the country (SAMBAV Bharath) It designed to enable people by providing online training for individuals as mental health facilitators, who can assist the needy during and aftermath of the disaster","output":"Structured action plan for mental and behavioral preparedness against virus COVID19 outbreak in India (SAMBAV Bharath): proposal for augmenting mental health services.

There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications. DESIGN: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. SETTING: News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. PARTICIPANTS: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China. MEASUREMENTS: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. RESULTS: There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. LIMITATION: Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases. CONCLUSION: This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS. Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.

Photoreceptors in the outer retina rely on nutrient support from the neighboring retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a monolayer of epithelial cells that separate the retina and choroidal blood supply. RPE dysfunction or cell death can result in photoreceptor degeneration, leading to blindness in retinal degenerative diseases including some inherited retinal degenerations and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In addition to having ready access to rich nutrients from blood, the RPE is also supplied with lactate from adjacent photoreceptors. Moreover, RPE can phagocytose lipid-rich outer segments for degradation and recycling on a daily basis. Recent studies show RPE cells prefer proline as a major metabolic substrate, and they are highly enriched for the proline transporter, SLC6A20. In contrast, dysfunctional or poorly differentiated RPE fails to utilize proline. RPE uses proline to fuel mitochondrial metabolism, synthesize amino acids, build the extracellular matrix, fight against oxidative stress, and sustain differentiation. Remarkably, the neural retina rarely imports proline directly, but it uptakes and utilizes intermediates and amino acids derived from proline catabolism in the RPE. Mutations of genes in proline metabolism are associated with retinal degenerative diseases, and proline supplementation is reported to improve RPE-initiated vision loss. This review will cover proline metabolism in RPE and highlight the importance of proline transport and utilization in maintaining retinal metabolism and health.","output":"Proline metabolism and transport in retinal health and disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a dsDNA virus responsible for a severe, highly contagious, and lethal disease affecting both domestic and wild pigs.

Herein, we developed a Cas12a-mediated portable paper assay to rapidly and precisely detect ASFV. We identified a robust set of crRNAs that recognized the highly conserved region of essential ASFV genes. The Cas12a-mediated detection assay showed low tolerance for mismatch mutations, and no cross-reactivity against other common swine pathogens. We further developed a paper-based assay to allow instrument-free detection of ASFV. Specifically, we applied gold nanoparticleCantibody conjugate to engineer homemade strips and combined it with Cas12a-mediated ASFV detection. This portable paper, instrument-free diagnostics, faithfully detected ASFV in swine samples, showing comparable sensitivity to the traditionally instrument-dependent qPCR method.

We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics of pediatric patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory pathogens infected pneumonias. METHODS: We conducted a multi-center, cross-sectional study of pediatric inpatients in China. Based on pathogenic test results, pediatric patients were divided into three groups, including COVID-19 pneumonia group, Non-COVID-19 viral (NCV) pneumonia group and Non-viral (NV) pneumonia group. Their clinical characteristics were compared by Kruskal-Wallis H test or chi-square test. RESULTS: A total of 636 pediatric pneumonia inpatients, among which 87 in COVID-19 group, 194 in NCV group, and 355 in NV group, were included in analysis. Compared with NCV and NV patients, COVID-19 patients were older (median age 6.33, IQR 2.00-12.00 years), and relatively fewer COVID-19 patients presented fever (63.2%), cough (60.9%), shortness of breath (1.1%), and abnormal pulmonary auscultation (18.4%). The results were verified by the comparison of COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A (IFA) pneumonia patients. Approximately 42.5%, 44.8%, and 12.6% of the COVID-19 patients presented simply ground-glass opacity (GGO), simply consolidation, and the both changes on computed tomography (CT) scans, respectively; the proportions were similar as those in NCV and NV group (p>0.05). Only 47.1% of COVID-19 patients had both lungs pneumonia, which was significantly lower than that proportion of nearly 80% in the other two groups. COVID-19 patients presented lower proportions of increased white blood cell count (16.5%) and abnormal procalcitonin (PCT) (10.7%), and a higher proportion of decreased lymphocyte count (44.0%) compared with the other two groups. CONCLUSION: Majority clinical characteristics of pediatric COVID-19 pneumonia patients were milder than non-COVID-19 patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Papers were retrieved from a PubMed search, using different combinations of keywords [e.g., pain treatment AND COVID-19 AND drug-drug interaction (DDI)], without limitations in terms of publication date and language. RESULTS: Remdesivir is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase the plasma concentration of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., fentanyl). Dexamethasone is an inducer of CYP3A4 and glycoprotein P, thus coadministration with drugs metabolized by this isoform will lead to their increased clearance. Dexamethasone may cause hypokalemia, thus potentiating the risk of ventricular arrhythmias if it is given with opioids able to prolong the QT interval, such as oxycodone and methadone. Finally, the existing differences among opioids with regard to their impact on immune responses should also be taken into account with only tapentadol and hydromorphone appearing neutral on both cytokine production and immune parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should keep in mind the frequent DDIs with drugs extensively metabolized by the CYP450 system and prefer opioids undergoing a limited hepatic metabolism. Identification and management of DDIs and dissemination of the related knowledge should be a major goal in the delivery of chronic care to ensure optimized patient outcomes and facilitate updating recommendations for COVID-19 therapy in frail populations, namely comorbid, poly-medicated patients or individuals suffering from substance use disorder.","output":"Should we be concerned when COVID-19-positive patients take opioids to control their pain?

Since its first description in 2013, over 200 patients have been reported worldwide. Unsurprisingly, many of the newly diagnosed patients were recruited later in life from previously long-standing unclassified immunodeficiencies and the early course of the disease is, therefore, often less well-described. In this study, we report clinical and laboratory features of eight patients followed for APDS, with particular focus on early warning signs, longitudinal development of their symptoms, individual variations, and response to therapy. The main clinical features shared by our patients included recurrent bacterial and viral respiratory tract infections, gastrointestinal disease, non-malignant lymphoproliferation, autoimmune thyroiditis, and susceptibility to EBV. All patients tolerated vaccination with both attenuated live and subunit vaccines with no adverse effects, although some failed to mount adequate antibody response. Laboratory findings were characterized by dysgammaglobulinaemia, elevated serum IgM, block in B-cell maturation with high transitional B cells, and low na?ve T cells with CD8 T-cell activation. All patients benefited from immunoglobulin replacement therapy, whereas immunosuppression with mTOR pathway inhibitors was only partially successful.

In India, there is lack of data regarding the prevalence of COVID-19 amongst HCWs due to absence of routine screening programme within the hospital premises. We have designed this study in order to improve our understanding of the incidence of SARS-CoV2 within the health care workers working in a level 4 COVID hospital in Kolkata. Materials and Methods A retrospective observational study was conducted at the Department of Microbiology, ID and BG Hospital, Kolkata upon health care workers who presented with symptoms suggestive of Covid 19 and their direct contacts. Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs collected from the participants were subjected to Real time RT-PCR for detection of E, RDRP and ORF1B N gene for Covid 19 detection. Result Out of the 274 HCW tested, 75 (27%) of total HCWs were found to be positive. Among them 33(44%) were frontline workers and rest of them 42 (56%) were non-frontline workers. Predominance of SARS- CoV2 infection was found in male HCWs (57%) than female HCWs (43%). HCWs younger than 45 years (68%) were more infected.52 (69%) HCWs presented with symptoms like fever, sore throat, bodyache, loss of sensation of smell, coughs etc. 23(31%) were asymptomatic with history of direct contact with Covid-19 positive cases.

Resurgence of highly transmissible strains has resulted in revisiting restrictions with potential impacts on newborn health. With concerns for inadequate post-partum support, we sought to determine if social distancing correlated with increased rates of readmission for hyperbilirubinaemia. METHODS Retrospective chart review identified all readmissions for hyperbilirubinaemia between 1/18 and 4/20 in Western New York. Infant/maternal demographics and data on hospital course were collected on control (1/1/18-31/1/20) and social distancing (1/2/20-30/4/20) cohorts. Nineteen outpatient clinics were surveyed regarding lactation support. RESULTS Monthly readmissions for hyperbilirubinaemia nearly tripled during social distancing (0.90  0.91 vs. 2.63  2.29 per 1000 births during early COVID, P = 0.015). Comparable severity of disease at readmission was observed with no difference in the need for therapies (phototherapy, intravenous immunoglobulin or exchange transfusion) or length of hospital stay. Mothers were younger (25.8  3.3 vs. 31.3  4.7 years; P = 0.005) with higher rates of primiparity and exclusive breastfeeding than national norms, however not significantly higher than controls in our small cohort (62.5 vs. 37.0% for primiparity; 87.5 vs. 81.5% for breastfeeding). Of 19 clinics surveyed, only six confirmed a telemedicine option for lactation support. CONCLUSIONS Rates of readmission for hyperbilirubinaemia increased during social distancing. Younger maternal age with high rates of primiparity and exclusive breastfeeding raise concern for inadequate social and/or lactation support.

Objectives To support primary care professionals to safely assess febrile children during the pandemic, and to help parents safely navigate a disrupted health system, an information bundle was co-produced and distributed to GPs and families across an inner-city area. Methods Connecting Care for Children (CC4C) is a collaborative that supports the delivery of integrated child health services. Through established primary and secondary care networks, CC4C was able to listen to primary care colleagues practicing in the pandemic, and to understand their clinical worries and needs. Similarly, CC4C used its network of patient champions to hear what families were grappling with. With this understanding, the CC4C team was able to initiate the development of supportive child health resources. A Primary Care and Community Resource Pack for use during the Covid-19 pandemic was co-produced by general and infectious disease paediatricians, local GPs, and junior doctors. The resource bundle included: . Guidance for assessing febrile children in primary care . Advice for minimising the risk of Covid-19 transmission during face-to-face assessment . Answers to frequently asked questions . Information about when Covid-19 tests are indicated A sample group of GPs provided feedback to an initial draft, and their suggestions were incorporated into the guideline. Resources for GPs to distribute to parents and carers were also included in the bundle: . a flow-chart to aid decision making about school attendance based on a child's symptoms . when to seek medical attention based on their child's clinical condition. Patients and citizens were involved in the development of the 'Should I Send my Child to School' flowchart, providing suggestions to make the guidance clearer. During the second wave of the pandemic, new resources were added including: . information about Paediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome . the new Covid-19 variants Results The resource pack was distributed to GPs across a large inner-city population, and two adjacent regions requested permission to use the resources. Resources from the bundle are available online at: www.cc4c.imperial.nhs.uk/our-experience/ common-paediatric-questions.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Hospitalisations and deaths (any time following first hospitalisation) from lower respiratory tract infections, adjusted risk ratios and hazard ratios by ethnicity and sex were calculated. We multiplied ratios and confidence intervals by 100, so the reference Scottish White population's risk ratio and hazard ratio was 100. RESULTS Among men, adjusted risk ratios for lower respiratory tract infection hospitalisation were lower in Other White British (80, 95% confidence interval 73-86) and Chinese (69, 95% confidence interval 56-84) populations and higher in Pakistani groups (152, 95% confidence interval 136-169). In women, results were mostly similar to those in men (e.g. Chinese 68, 95% confidence interval 56-82), although higher adjusted risk ratios were found among women of the Other South Asians group (145, 95% confidence interval 120-175).

The first part of this paper overviews the theoretical innovations of the last decades regarding the interpretation of cause-specific mortality dynamics, often referred to as epidemiological transition theories, and their relevance for the analysis of mortality inequalities. The paper then analyses the cause-specific trends of mortality for two educational classes between 1971 and 2008. The trends were corrected for changes in the coding system and divided into linear (stagnating, increasing or decreasing) periods. Causes of death were grouped according to the relationship between the sequences of these periods for the two educational classes. The 57 causes of death were finally clustered into six groups. One group, which is dominated by nutrition-related and cardiovascular diseases, is largely responsible for the onset of mortality inequalities in 1980.

Therefore, it is clear that the food industry needs to know the perceptions of sensory attributes to know the acceptability of a product. There exist procedures that systematically allows measurement of these property perceptions that are performed by professional panels. However, systematic evaluations of attributes by these tasting panels, which avoid the subjective character for an individual taster, have a high economic, temporal and organizational cost. The process is only applied in a sampled way so that its result cannot be used on a sound and complete quality system. In this paper, we present a method that allows making use of a non-destructive measurement of physical-chemical properties of the target product to obtain an estimation of the sensory description given by QDA-based procedure. More concisely, we propose that through Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), we will obtain a reliable prediction that will relate the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum of a complete set of cheese samples with a complete image of the sensory attributes that describe taste, texture, aspect, smell and other relevant sensations.","output":"Accurate Prediction of Sensory Attributes of Cheese Using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Based on Artificial Neural Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the case of a MS patient on subcutaneous ofatumumab who became infected with SARS-CoV-2 and remained asymptomatic while developing antiviral IgM and IgG antibodies.

These seem to have developed manifold strategies to modulate the cholesterol metabolism to the side of lipid uptake and de novo synthesis. In turn, affecting the cholesterol homeostasis has emerged as novel broad-spectrum antiviral strategy. On the other hand, the innate immune system is similarly regulated by the lipid and stimulated by its derivatives. This certainly requires attention in the design of antiviral strategies aiming to decrease cellular cholesterol, as evidence accumulates that withdrawal of cholesterol hampers innate immunity. Secondly, there are exceptions to the rule of the abovementioned virus-induced metabolic shift toward cholesterol anabolism. It therefore is of interest to dissect underlying regulatory mechanisms, which we aimed for in this minireview. We further collected evidence for intracellular cholesterol concentrations being less important in viral life cycles as compared to the spatial distribution of the lipid. Various routes of cholesterol trafficking were found to be hijacked in viral infections with respect to organelle-endosome contact sites mediating cholesterol shuttling. Thus, re-distribution of cellular cholesterol in the context of viral infections requires more attention in ongoing research. As a final aim, a pan-antiviral treatment could be found just within the transport and re-adjustment of local cholesterol concentrations.

DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases PubMed Central and PubMed were searched from January 2020 to June 2020 for published studies about ECMO and/or invasive mechanical ventilation use in COVID-19 patients. Data Extraction and Study Selection: The search strategy retrieved 766 articles, of which 19 studies consisting of 204 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. DATA SYNTHESIS: Primary outcomes evaluated were discharge and/or clinical improvement and mortality rate. Secondary outcomes evaluated included reported complications and the mean number of days of hospitalization for survivors. Weighted averages of included studies were calculated, and data were pooled in forest plots. Nearly, 68.1% of the patients received invasive mechanical ventilation without ECMO support, and 31.9% were placed on ECMO. Also, 22.5% of the patients were discharged and/or clinically improved and 51.5% died. Twenty-six percent of the study population deteriorated but remained alive or experienced no improvement in clinical condition. And 75.2% of those who died belonged to the non-ECMO group and 24.8% to the ECMO group. The mortality rate in the non-ECMO group was 56.8% compared to 40% in the ECMO group.

Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to investigate the spread of RGs in a fish-duck pond and the RGs and bacterial community of fish intestines. Five fish tanks, including a control tank and four experimental tanks (duck manure, duck manure + cefotaxime, duck manure + As, and duck manure + cefotaxime + As), were tested for 100 days. The results showed that duck manure increased both the diversity and relative abundance of RGs in fish intestines, and the addition of stress factors (cefotaxime, As) increased the relative abundance of RGs by one to two orders of magnitude. The stress-inducing effect of cefotaxime was greater than that of As. Tetracycline resistance genes were more sensitive to stress factors and were the predominant RGs in fish intestines. RGs in duck manure preferentially spread from the water to biofilm and then to fish intestines, whereas co-stress of cefotaxime and As obviously promoted the spread of RGs to fish intestines. In comparison to the control tank, duck manure and stress factors significantly changed the bacterial community of fish intestines. Correlation analysis also revealed that arsB, MOX, tetA and sul1 were significantly correlated with intI1 (P < 0.01), which hinted a potentially dissemination risk of RGs in fish intestines.

We then go on to consider how it is through group memberships that individuals are defined by their trauma risk and trauma historiesthat is, a person's group memberships and their trauma are often inherently linked. Considering the importance of group memberships for understanding trauma, we argue that it is important to see these, and group processes more generally, as more than just demographic risk factors. Instead, we argue that when groups are defined by their trauma history or risk, their members will often derive some sense of self from this trauma. For this reason, attributes of group memberships are important in developing an understanding of adjustment and adaptation to trauma. In particular, groups' status, their recourse to justice, and the level of trust and solidarity within the group are all central to the impact of traumatic events on individual\\\\level psychological resilience. We review evidence that supports this analysis by focusing on the exacerbating effects of stigma and social mistrust on post\\\\traumatic stress, and the value of solidarity and strong identities for resilience.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study was carried out as a hospital record based retrospective comparative analysis on patients presenting with ocular trauma in the lockdown period (MarchCJuly 2020) compared with the same time frame of the previous year considered as prelockdown period (MarchCJuly 2019) and during the unlock phases (AugustCDecember 2020). RESULTS: Overall, the casualty department saw 464 patients of ocular trauma in the prelockdown period, 173 in the lockdown and 253 in unlock. The study showed a 44% reduction in patients visiting the casualty department for trauma during the lockdown compared with prelockdown, and a 62% reduction specifically in ocular trauma. The unlock phase showed a 21% reduction in ocular trauma compared with prelockdown and a 41% increase compared with the lockdown. In all three phases, the majority of people affected by ocular trauma were middle aged males from a rural background, sustained by assault. The lockdown saw a decrease in outdoor assaults (45%) and road traffic accidents (22%). Trauma sustained by females (18%) increased in the lockdown, as did home-based assaults (150%) and sexual assaults. The presentation of trauma, especially road traffic accidents and outdoor assaults saw a steady rise during the unlock. CONCLUSION: The lockdown mandated by the government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the trends of trauma presenting to healthcare facilities. There was a decrease in the overall number of patients approaching the casualty during the lockdown.

This study investigated the purposes for which social networking sites are used and their effects on learning, social interaction, and sleep duration. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 300, 17C29-year-old female students at Prince Sattam bin Abdul Aziz University. A questionnaire was used to collect data. Chi-squared (Fishers exact test) test was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The results showed that 97% of the students used social media applications. Only 1% of them used social media for academic purposes. Whereas 35% of them used these platforms to chat with others, 43% of them browsed these sites to pass time. Moreover, 57% of them were addicted to social media. Additionally, 52% of them reported that social media use had affected their learning activities, 66% of them felt more drawn toward social media than toward academic activities, and 74% of them spent their free time on social media platforms. The most popular applications (i.e., based on usage) were Snapchat (45%), Instagram (22%), Twitter (18%), and WhatsApp (7%). Further, 46% and 39% of them reported going to bed between 11 pm and 12 am and between 1 am and 2 am, respectively. Finally, 68% of them attributed their delayed bedtime to social media use, and 59% of them reported that social media had affected their social interactions. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of the participants reported prolonged use of social networking sites for nonacademic purposes. These habitual behaviors can distract students from their academic work, adversely affect their academic performance, social interactions, and sleep duration, and lead to a sedentary lifestyle and physical inactivity, which in turn can render them vulnerable to non-communicable diseases and mental health problems.","output":"Effect of social media use on learning, social interactions, and sleep duration among university students()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have focused on the development and evaluation of care bundles to reduce the risk of surgical site infection (SSI) throughout the perioperative period. A focused examination of the technical/surgical aspects of SSI reduction during CRS has not been conducted. This study aimed to develop an expert consensus on intraoperative technical/surgical aspects of SSI prevention by the surgical team during colorectal surgery (CRS). STUDY DESIGN: In a modified Delphi process, a panel of 15 colorectal surgeons developed a consensus on intraoperative technical/surgical aspects of SSI prevention undertaken by surgical personnel during CRS using information from a targeted literature review and expert opinion. Consensus was developed with up to three rounds per topic, with a prespecified threshold of 70% agreement. RESULTS: In 3 Delphi rounds, the 15 panelists achieved consensus on 16 evidence-based statements. The consensus panel supported the use of wound protectors/retractors, sterile incision closure tray, preclosure glove change, and antimicrobial sutures in reducing SSI along with wound irrigation with aqueous iodine and closed-incision negative pressure wound therapy in high-risk, contaminated wounds. CONCLUSIONS: Using a modified Delphi method, consensus has been achieved on a tailored set of recommendations on technical/surgical aspects that should be considered by surgical personnel during CRS to reduce the risk of SSI, particularly in areas where the evidence base is controversial or lacking.

There is still no approved and effective treatment for the disease. Several drugs are being administered empirically to patients, based on results from studies with limited methodologies. There is an urgent need for systematic reviews to support decision makers and the development of guidelines. The purpose of this paper was to conduct a systematic review of drug studies carried out worldwide for COVID-19, verifying the effectiveness and methodological quality. METHOD: The search for relevant articles was performed in the Cochrane Central, MEDLINE, and Embase databases.

The review process of the articles was carried out independently by four reviewers using the PRISMA-P method. RESULTS: As a result, a total of 30 articles were selected, which addressed the study of one or more medications for severe cases of COVID-19, which were hydroxychloroquine (or chloroquine) and azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, and Shufeng Jiedu Capsule, Combinations: remdesivir/lopinavir/homoharringtonine/emetine, remdesivir, interferon, lopinavir and ritonavir, thalidomide/methylprednisolone, tocilizumab, antimicrobial therapy. CONCLUSION: Despite efforts and studies, research does not provide evidence for the use of any drug to treat COVID-19, as the effects, safety, and efficacy are still uncertain. Thus, there is a need for systematic reviews to monitor, synthesize, and update the literature data on the subject, generating reliable evidence for decision makers.

Here we evaluated changes in the fatty acid (FA) profile and the participation of the activity of the desaturases, in plasma of patients with severe pneumonia by SARS-CoV-2. We found that SARS-CoV-2 alters the FA metabolism in the cells of the host. Changes are characterized by variations in the desaturases that lead to a decrease in total fatty acid (TFA), phospholipids (PL) and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). These alterations include a decrease in palmitic and stearic acids (p  0.009) which could be used for the formation of the viral membranes and for the reparation of the hosts own membrane. There is also an increase in oleic acid (OA; p = 0.001) which could modulate the inflammatory process, the cytokine release, apoptosis, necrosis, oxidative stress (OS). An increase in linoleic acid (LA) in TFA (p = 0.03) and a decreased in PL (p = 0.001) was also present. They result from damage of the internal mitochondrial membrane. The arachidonic acid (AA) percentage was elevated (p = 0.02) in the TFA and this can be participated in the inflammatory process. EPA was decreased (p = 0.001) and this may decrease of pro-resolving mediators with increase in the inflammatory process. The total of NEFAs (p = 0.03), PL (p = 0.001), cholesterol, HDL and LDL were decreased, and triglycerides were increased in plasma of the COVID-19 patients. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 alters the FA metabolism, the changes are characterized by alterations in the desaturases that lead to variations in the TFA, PL, and NEFAs profiles. These changes may favor the replication of the virus but, at the same time, they are part of the defense system provided by the host cell metabolism in its eagerness to repair damage caused by the virus to cell membranes.","output":"Alteration in the Lipid Profile and the Desaturases Activity in Patients With Severe Pneumonia by SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Covid-19 pandemic has had a major impact in the delivery of psychological treatment.

This stage 1 pilot study tested an EMDR therapy scripted protocol C Virtual Blind 2 Therapist (VB2T) as a VCP regarding fitness for purpose, distinctiveness, relevance, and efficiency. Methods Twenty-four participants were recruited to the study. The design included a one-session treatment intervention obtaining measures pre, post, one-month, and six-month follow-up. This treatment session used a Blind 2 Therapist EMDR therapy scripted protocol as video-conference psychotherapy that involves non-disclosure of traumatic memory. The research explored the treatment effect on the core characteristics of the trauma memory including subjective disturbance, belief systems, memory intensity, vividness, and levels of emotionality. Additionally, the research explored participants experiences of adverse and benevolent childhood experiences (ACEs/BCEs) during their childhood. Results Regarding the four tests - fitness for purpose, distinctiveness, relevance, and efficiency results are favourably suggesting potential clinical benefits of using EMDR as video-conference psychotherapy. That said this is a proof-of-concept study showing positive results, however, no clinical population or control group was used. The purpose of the study is to explore the potential for scalability towards a larger clinical trial. The treatment intervention was achieved irrespective of either adverse or benevolent childhood experiences (ACEs/BCEs) during childhood Conclusion The research tentatively supports the case for EMDR therapy as a credible treatment when used as a video conference psychotherapy.

Owing to the rapid increase of genome sequences in public databases, the evolutionary relationship of species becomes more challenging. But traditional alignment-based methods are found inappropriate due to their time-consuming nature. Therefore, it is necessary to find a faster method, which applies to species phylogeny. In this paper, a new graph-theory based alignment-free sequence comparison method is proposed. A complete-bipartite graph is used to represent each genome sequence based on its nucleotide triplets. Subsequently, with the help of the weights of edges of the graph, a vector descriptor is formed. Finally, the phylogenetic tree is drawn using the UPGMA algorithm. In the present case, the datasets for comparison are related to mammals, viruses, and bacteria. In most of the cases, the phylogeny in the present case is found to be more satisfactory as compared to earlier methods.","output":"A new graph-theoretic approach to determine the similarity of genome sequences based on nucleotide triplets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) has a complex pathogenesis and may be a primary diagnosis or secondary to an underlying condition 1. Evaluation for underlying diagnoses in patients presenting with atypical features of classic ITP is key, as this can impact treatment decisions, therapy response, and prognosis. Genetic variants that predispose patients to ITP are especially important to investigate as patients may be at risk for additional autoimmune phenomenon or malignancy. The SARS CoV-2 pandemic has added further complexity as reports suggest the infection can lead to autoimmunity in those with genetic predispositions 2,3. Loss of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) function has been described to manifest with autoinflammatory syndrome, with or without immunodeficiency 4,5. Reports of autoimmunity developing in patients with SOCS1 haploinsufficiency after SARS CoV-2 infection are documented, including multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) 2. A proposed mechanism of this virus-triggered autoimmunity includes a transient innate and adaptive immunodeficiency 3. This raises the question whether patients harboring genetic variants with risk of autoimmunity are placed at an even higher risk for ITP in the wake of SARS-CoV2 infection. CASE PRESENTATION We present a 6-year-old female with isolated thrombocytopenia of 4,000/uL identified during evaluation for severe arthralgias unresponsive to corticosteroid treatment (maximum dose 1mg/kg/day) over a 6-month period. Laboratory results at presentation were consistent with ITP, including presence of platelet autoantibodies. Evaluation revealed hypocellularity for age (~50%) on bone marrow evaluation as well as elevated IgE (2080 kU/L), with IgA, IgM, and IgG levels within reference range. She had a remote history of SARS CoV-2-like illness and SARS CoV-2 antibodies were found present in serologic assay, without a history of vaccination. Genetic testing, including chromosomal microarray from peripheral blood and marrow, was included in the diagnostic workup given concern for a history of developmental delays with macrocephaly and necessity to rule-out malignancy with the patient noted to have a 5 mega-base deletion at 16p13.2p13.11, which includes the SOCS1 gene. Comprehensive next generation sequencing for additional immune dysregulation/primary immunodeficiency associated variants was unremarkable. Functional studies of surface expression of interferon-inducible genes (CD169 (SIGLEC-1)) and STAT1 phosphorylation via analysis of CD14+ monocytes revealed excess interferon signaling previously described in patients with SOCS1 haploinsufficiency (Figure 1). Measurements of B-cell-activating factor were also found to be extremely elevated at 6432 pg/mL. The patient's ITP course was complicated by hematuria, melena and refractory platelet response to first line therapy consisting of intravenous immunoglobulin 1 g/kg x2 doses and 2 mg/kg/day prednisolone. She required escalation to high dose methylprednisolone (30mg/kg), rituximab 375 mg/m 2/weekly x4 doses, and concurrent romiplostim (2 doses) for control of thrombocytopenia and bleeding manifestations. Her rheumatologic symptoms subsided with initiation of corticosteroids, and she has subsequently completed a prolonged corticosteroid taper. She currently has a normal platelet count with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy utilized for arthralgia management with plan to transition to JAK inhibition for maintenance therapy. CONCLUSION This case highlights the potential impact of investigating for susceptibility genes for ITP with consideration for broader testing including targeted next generation sequencing panels or microarray analysis in patients with atypical ITP presentations or response to therapy, as knowledge of this patient's underlying genetics led to earlier treatment and use of alternative agents. Additionally, the case adds the novel finding of bone marrow hypocellularity to the clinical phenotype of SOCS1 haploinsufficiency, as this has not yet been reported and contributes to the literature on the relationship of autoimmunity and SARS CoV-2 infections in patients with predisposing genetic variants.

We need an urgent solution for the prevention, treatment, and recovery of the involved patients. Methods: Modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT) is known as an immuno-supportive therapy in oncology. Our proposal is to apply this method to prevent the progression of the disease after its identification, to provide treatment when necessary, and deliver rehabilitation to diminish the fibrotic-often fatal-consequences of the infection. Hypothesis: The effects of mEHT, which are proven for oncological applications, could be utilized for the inactivation of the virus or for treating the fibrotic consequences. The hypothesized mEHT effects, which could have a role in the antiviral treatment, it could be applied for viral-specific immune-activation and for anti-fibrotic treatments.","output":"A Potential Bioelectromagnetic Method to Slow Down the Progression and Prevent the Development of Ultimate Pulmonary Fibrosis by COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to coronaviruses (CoVs) are valuable in their own right as prophylactic and therapeutic reagents to treat diverse CoVs and, importantly, as templates for rational pan-CoV vaccine design.

Here, we showed that CC40.8 targets the conserved S2 stem-helix region of the coronavirus spike fusion machinery. We determined a crystal structure of CC40.8 Fab with a SARS-CoV-2 S2 stem-peptide at 1.6 ? resolution and found that the peptide adopted a mainly helical structure. Conserved residues in -CoVs interacted with CC40.8 antibody, thereby providing a molecular basis for its broad reactivity. CC40.8 exhibited in vivo protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in two animal models. In both models, CC40.8-treated animals exhibited less weight loss and reduced lung viral titers compared to controls. Furthermore, we noted CC40.8-like bnAbs are relatively rare in human COVID-19 infection and therefore their elicitation may require rational structure-based vaccine design strategies.

The procurement and transformation of required equipment to the involved areas is considered as one of the main triggers of decreasing damages and losses during crisis. In this regard, a breakdown in pharmaceutical supply chain can lead to intensive, undesired consequences. METHODS: This was a qualitative study applying a grounded theory approach. The study was conducted with attending of 32 informant participants who were qualified in supply chain during natural disasters and crisis. In order to collect the data, deep semi-structured interviews were applied along with investigating the documents, observation, field notes and theoretical memos. For data analysis, a continuous comparison was used according to Corbin and Strauss method. RESULTS: Results of the study were categorized in 8 main categories as the main themes. Wasting appeared as the main factor of the resilience of pharmaceutical and consumable medical equipment supply chain. Wasting included two subthemes of loss of resources and wasting time. CONCLUSION: In order to make resilience in pharmaceutical and consumable medical equipment during disasters, it is necessary to reinforce the various dimensions of the resilience model to increase the rate of supply chain responsiveness. This study particularly contributes to broadening and deepening our understanding of how to mitigate the risk of undesirable outcomes of pharmaceutical supply chain during the disasters or crises.","output":"Designing a resilience model for pharmaceutical supply chain during crises: a grounded theory approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is known to lead not only to severe acute respiratory syndrome, but also can result in thromboembolic events in both the venous and the arterial circulation by inducing coagulation disorders. The potential causes of coagulopathy are inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and stasis. The thrombotic events including pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis as well as intracatheter thrombosis are more likely to develop in patients infected with severe form of SARS-CoV-2 who are admitted to ICU. Furthermore, these events contribute to multi-organ failure. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report a case of an immunocompromised COVID-19 elderly patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia who developed myocardial infarction with ST elevation in the setting of acute pulmonary thromboembolism in the presence of zero platelet count. Despite successful urgent coronary revascularization and platelet transfusion, the patient eventually died after failed resuscitation efforts. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 infection are at a greater risk of developing cardiovascular complications, but their appropriate management can decrease the risk of fatal events. Coronary thrombosis associated with pulmonary thromboembolism in the setting of thrombocytopenia is a rare and a complex to manage condition. Significance of single antiplatelet agent in STEMI with thrombocytopenia merits further studies. According to expert opinions and literature reviews, we must avoid dual antiplatelet therapy in these patients and keep platelet transfusion as a standard therapy to avoid drastic bleeding complications.","output":"A rare presentation of an elderly patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia and platelet count of zero associated with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, pulmonary thromboembolism in the setting of SARS-CoV 2: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A severe outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in China in December 2019, and spread so rapidly that more than 200,000 cases have so far been reported worldwide; on January 30, 2020, the WHO declared it the sixth public health emergency of international concern.

In the first stage, the study measures the productivity of the co-operatives using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Meanwhile, in the second stage, the study utilizes a panel regression model to measure and analyze the determinants of productivity of the co-operatives in Indonesia. The study recorded that the co-operatives in Indonesia have experienced a 9.7% increase in their Total Factor Productivity (TFP), contributed mainly by the technical efficiency progress. Furthermore, the study found that the business volume has contributed to the improvement of the co-operatives' TFP. Meanwhile, the co-operatives' members, liquidity, and indebtedness are found to deteriorate the TFP growth. Profitability, however, is found to have an insignificant effect on TFP growth due to the non-profit orientation of the co-operatives. These findings suggest the need for cooperatives to diversify their business activities, supported by the adoption of relevant advanced technologies, particularly the use of online marketing. In addition, the co-operatives should improve their financial performances to maximize the use of capital by restricting liquidity and indebtedness.

Existing health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) measurement tools do not account for these differences. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a culturally specific parent-proxy HR-QoL measurement tool for First Nations children. DESIGN: Scale development was informed by parents/carers of children with a chronic illness and an expert panel. The preliminary 39-item survey was reviewed (n=12) and tested (n=163) with parents/carers of First Nations children aged 0-12 years at baseline with comparative scales: the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, generic HR-QoL (Paediatric QoL Inventory 4.0, PedsQL4.0) and Spence Children's Anxiety Scale, and repeated (n=46) 4 weeks later. Exploratory Factor Analysis was used for scale reduction. Reliability and validity were assessed by internal consistency, test-retest, and correlations with comparison scales. RESULTS: Items within our First Nations-Child Quality of Life (FirstNations-CQoL) were internally consistent with Cronbach's alpha coefficients of &#8805;0.7 (quality of life, 0.808; patient experience, 0.880; patient support, 0.768) and overall test-retest reliability was good (r=0.75; 95% CI 0.593 to 0.856). Convergent validity was observed with the PedsQL4.0 with Pearson's coefficients of r=0.681 (ages 2-4 years); r=0.651 (ages 5-12 years) and with the Kessler Psychological Distress scale (r=-0.513). Divergent validity against the Spence Anxiety Scale was not demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: The FirstNations-CQoL scale was accepted by the participants, reliable and demonstrated convergent validity with comparison measures.

The presence of bacteria induces an inflammatory response mediated by leukocytes. There is a direct relationship between the degree of impairment of the mucocilliary drainage system, the density of bacteria in mucus and the number of leukocytes in the sputum. Purulent sputum is a good marker of a high bacterial load. Eventually, if the number of leukocytes is high, their normal activity could decrease the effectiveness of the drainage system, increase the bronchial obstruction and probably damage the lung parenchyma. Whenever the density of bacteria in the bronchial lumen is  10(6) CFU/mL, there is a high probability that the degree of inflammatory response will lead to a vicious cycle which in turn tends to sustain the process. This situation can arise during the clinical course of any acute exacerbation of CB, independently of its aetiology, provided the episode is sufficiently severe and/or prolonged. Fluoroquinolones of the third and fourth generation are bactericidal against most microorganisms usually related to acute exacerbations of CB. Their diffusion to bronchial mucus is adequate. When used in short (5-day) treatment they reduce the bacterial load in a higher proportion than is achieved by lactam or macrolide antibiotics given orally. Although the clinical cure rate is similar to that obtained with other antibiotics, the time between exacerbations could be increased.","output":"Should patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis be treated with antibiotics?

Convalescent and vaccinee samples show reduced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC). Next generation DNA vaccines could be matched to single variants or synthetically designed for broader coverage of multiple VOCs. METHODS: The synthetic consensus (SynCon?) sequence for INO-4802 SARS-CoV-2 spike with focused RBD changes and dual proline mutations was codon-optimized (Figure 1). Sequences for wild-type (pWT) and B.1.351 (pB.1.351) were similarly optimized. Immunogenicity was evaluated in BALB/c mice. Pre-clinical efficacy was assessed in the Syrian Hamster model. Figure 1. Design Strategy for INO-4802 [Image: see text] RESULTS: INO-4802 induced potent neutralizing antibody responses against WT, B.1.1.7, P.1, and B.1.351 VOC in a murine model. pWT vaccinated animals showed a 3-fold reduction in mean neutralizing ID50 for the B.1.351 pseudotyped virus. INO-4802 immunized animals had significantly higher (p = 0.0408) neutralizing capacity (mean ID50 816.16). ID50 of pB.1.351 serum was reduced 7-fold for B.1.1.7 and significantly lower (p = 0.0068) than INO-4802 (317.44). INO-4802 neutralized WT (548.28) comparable to pWT. INO-4802 also neutralized P.1 (1026.6) (Figure 2). pWT, pB.1.351 or INO-4802 induced similar T-cell responses against all variants. INO-4802 skewed towards a TH1-response. All hamsters vaccinated with INO-4802 or pB.1.351 were protected from weight loss after B.1.351 live virus challenge. 4/6 pWT immunized hamsters were completely protected. pWT immunized hamsters neutralized WT (1090) but not B.1.351 (39.16). INO-4802 neutralized both WT (672.2) and B.1.351 (1121) (Figure 3). We observed higher increase of binding titers following heterologous boost with INO-4802 (3.6 C 4.4 log2-fold change) than homologous boost with pWT (2.0 C 2.4 log2 fold change) (Figure 4). Figure 2.

The present research aimed to develop and evaluate a new parent-report questionnaire that measures the time children spend playing and how adventurously children play, across a range of places. Method: The questionnaire was developed with input from a diverse group of parents and experts in childrens play. It was designed to yield a range of metrics including time spent playing per year, time spent playing outside, time spent playing in nature and level of adventurous play. The reliability of the questionnaire was then evaluated with 245 parents (149 mothers, 96 fathers) of 154 children aged 5 to 11 years. All participants completed the measure at time 1. At time 2, an average of 20 days later, 184 parents (111 mothers and 73 fathers) of 99 children completed the measure again. Results: Cross-informant agreement, evaluated using Concordance Correlation Coefficients (CCCs), ranged from 0.36 to 0.51. These fall in the poor to moderate range and are largely comparable to cross-informant agreement on other measures. Test-retest reliability for mothers was good (range 0.67 - 0.76) for time spent playing metrics. For fathers, test-retest reliability was lower (range 0.39 - 0.63). For both parents the average level of adventurous play variable had relatively poor test retest reliability (mothers = 0.49, fathers = 0.42). This variable also showed a significant increase from time 1 to time 2. This instability over time may be due to the timing of the research in relation to the Covid-19 lockdown and associated shifts in risk perception. Conclusions: The measure will be of value in future research focusing on the public health benefits and correlates of childrens play as well as researchers interested in childrens outdoor play and play in nature specifically. The development of the measure in collaboration with parents and experts in childrens play is a significant strength. It will be of value for future research to further validate the measure against play diaries or activity monitors.","output":"Development and Evaluation of A New Measure of Childrens Play: The Childrens Play Scale (CPS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Despite advances in treatments for COVID-19, a subset of patients develop end stage lung disease, necessitating lung transplantation. However, COVID-19 ARDS often requires prolonged intubation with sedation and paralytics, resulting in profound deconditioning. As such, extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) is a useful bridge to transplant to allow for a wakeful state and facilitate rehab. This study compares outcomes among patients with COVID-19 and nonCOVID-19 lung disease placed on ECMO as a bridge to transplant. Methods All patients on veno-venous ECMO prior to lung transplantation at a single center from Jan 2020 - Oct 2021 were identified. Patient characteristics and post-transplant outcomes were ed for comparison. Results A total of 7 patients were identified in the COVID-19 (C) cohort and 11 in the nonCOVID-19 (NC) cohort. Age and LAS at transplant were similar (Table 1). As expected, total duration on ECMO was longer for C cohort patients (85.4 vs 14.5 days). Patients in the C cohort had longer ischemia times and more returns to the OR within 72 hours of transplant (71% vs 45%). Rates of hemodialysis within 30 days of transplant were lower in the C cohort (14% vs 18%). Further, C cohort patients had higher rates of detectable donor specific antibodies by IgG (71% vs 55%), though all were negative by C1q and compatible cross matches. While total and ICU lengths of stay were longer in the C cohort, this group had a shorter post-transplant hospital length of stay. Median time post-transplant was 212 days for the C cohort and 154 days for the NC cohort;survival was 100% for both groups at follow up. Conclusion For patients with COVID-19 ARDS, ECMO is a useful bridge to transplant to mitigate complications associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation. These preliminary data suggest prolonged periods of ECMO pre-transplant do not result in significant adverse events post-transplant. Additional analyses of graft function and survival at 6 and 12 months are ongoing.","output":"Comparing Outcomes of COVID-19 vs NonCOVID-19 Lung Transplant Recipients on ECMO as a Bridge to Transplant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: For two decades, women have made up nearly half of medical school graduates, yet this is not translated to equity in promotion.

The most common setting for patient-nephrologist interactions is during the HD treatment, which is a time pressured setting that lacks privacy. OBJECTIVE: To facilitate effective communication in the hemodialysis (HD) unit, we evaluated the usability of a web application (web app) from both the patient and physician perspective. The main aim of the web app was to support patients in prioritizing their dialysis concerns outside of the clinical HD encounter. DESIGN: Mixed method, parallel arm, multi-site, pilot randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Two outpatient Canadian HD centers. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients receiving in-center HD and their attending nephrologists. METHODS: Patients were randomized to either a web application or an active control (paper form) for logging concerns to be addressed at weekly encounters with the nephrologist over 8 weeks. Topics included: HD treatment, symptoms, modality, and medications. The primary outcome was usability, defined as effectiveness (engagement with the tool, frequency of submitted concerns, whether the concern was satisfactorily addressed) and satisfaction with the tool using a priori thresholds and explored in interviews with patients and nephrologists. RESULTS: 77 patients (30 women, median age 61, interquartile range [53,67], median 2 years [1,4] on dialysis) and 19 nephrologists (4 women, median age 46 [36,65]) were enrolled. Patient use of a digital device at baseline was low (20%). Engagement with the tool was 70% (web app) and 100% (paper) with a lower proportion of patients in the web app group submitting at least one concern over 8 weeks compared to the paper form group: 56.7% vs 87.9%. Weekly concerns were satisfactorily addressed in both groups and 70% of patients would continue to use the tools. For patients, both tools promoted preparation and participation in the encounter; however, only the web app facilitated greater privacy in relaying concerns. For most nephrologists, the tools were disruptive to their workflow and were perceived as unnecessary given existing processes and familiarity with patients. For future versions of the app, patients suggested more features to facilitate self-management and nephrologists suggested integration with health databases and multidisciplinary teams. LIMITATIONS: Tertiary setting may limit generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: Both tools promoted fundamental components of self-management; however, patients in the paper form group submitted concerns more often and this tool was easier to remember to use. Although modifications would likely enhance web app usability, successful future adoption is limited by physician acceptance.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) provides a gold standard assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but instrument costs are high and supply chains are potentially fragile, motivating interest in additional assay methods. Reverse transcription and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) provides an alternative that uses orthogonal and often less expensive reagents without the need for thermocyclers. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is typically detected using dyes to report bulk amplification of DNA; however, a common artifact is nonspecific DNA amplification, which complicates detection. RESULTS: Here we describe the design and testing of molecular beacons, which allow sequence-specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes with improved discrimination in simple reaction mixtures. To optimize beacons for RT-LAMP, multiple locked nucleic acid monomers were incorporated to elevate melting temperatures. We also show how beacons with different fluorescent labels can allow convenient multiplex detection of several amplicons in single pot reactions, including incorporation of a human RNA LAMP-BEAC assay to confirm sample integrity. Comparison of LAMP-BEAC and RT-qPCR on clinical saliva samples showed good concordance between assays. To facilitate implementation, we developed custom polymerases for LAMP-BEAC and inexpensive purification procedures, which also facilitates increasing sensitivity by increasing reaction volumes. CONCLUSIONS: LAMP-BEAC thus provides an affordable and simple SARS-CoV-2 RNA assay suitable for population screening; implementation of the assay has allowed robust screening of thousands of saliva samples per week.

However, convalescent HCWs may shed SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA for prolonged periods. METHODS: 40 healthy HCWs off work because of ongoing positive RT-PCR results in combined nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs following SARS-CoV-2 infection were invited to participate in this study. These HCWs had been in self-isolation because of a PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. NP and OP swabs as well as a blood sample were collected from each participant. RT-PCR and virus isolation was performed with each swab sample and serum neutralization test as well as two different ELISA tests were performed on all serum samples. RESULTS: No viable virions could be detected in any of 29 nasopharyngeal and 29 oropharyngeal swabs taken from 15 long-time carriers. We found SARSCoV- 2 RNA in 14/29 nasopharyngeal and 10/29 oropharyngeal swabs obtained from screening 15 HCWs with previous COVID-19 up to 55 days after symptom onset. Six (40%) of the 15 initially positive HCWs converted to negative and later reverted to positive again according to their medical records. All but one HCW, a healthy volunteer banned from work, showed the presence of neutralizing antibodies in concomitantly taken blood samples. Late threshold cycle (Ct) values in RT-PCR [mean 37.4; median 37.3; range 30.8C41.7] and the lack of virus growth in cell culture indicate that despite the positive PCR results no infectivity remained. CONCLUSION: We recommend lifting isolation if the RT-PCR Ct-value of a naso- or oropharyngeal swab sample is over 30.

Various chemical agents are used routinely to devitalize the severely inflamed pulpal tissue. Most of these agents are harmful and have detrimental effects. This questionnaire-based study evaluated the awareness and perception of dental practitioners regarding the use of devitalizing agents during endodontic procedures, and various alternatives to minimize the use of these agents. Methods An open questionnaire was distributed to a total of 250 dental practitioners. It carried detailed information about the most common devitalizing agent used, the purpose of use, method, and duration of application, recommendations, complications encountered, awareness of complications, and various alternatives. The collected data were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version 17.0 (IBM Statistics, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Descriptive statistics were drawn with respective percentages to have a comparative overview. Results 209 responses to 250 questionnaires circulated gave a response rate of 83.6%. Amongst them, 63.15% of dentists were using devitalizing agents. The most widely and frequently used devitalizing agent was Devitec (PD Swiss, Vevey, Switzerland) (36.3%), followed by Caustinerf forte (Septodont, Saint-Maur-des-Fosses, France) (29.5%). A total of 32.9% dentists were aware of the recommendations, and 66.02% were aware of the complications of devitalizing agents; 16.26% of dental practitioners encountered complications due to the use of devitalizing agents.

However, the generalizability of such methods is often dependent on training on diverse datasets from multiple medical institutions, which is a restrictive requirement considering the sensitive nature of medical data. Recently proposed collaborative learning methods such as Federated Learning (FL) allow for training on remote datasets without the need to explicitly share data. Even so, data annotation still represents a bottleneck, particularly in medicine and surgery where clinical expertise is often required. With these constraints in mind, we propose FedCy, a federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) method that combines FL and self-supervised learning to exploit a decentralized dataset of both labeled and unlabeled videos, thereby improving performance on the task of surgical phase recognition. By leveraging temporal patterns in the labeled data, FedCy helps guide unsupervised training on unlabeled data towards learning task-specific features for phase recognition. We demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art FSSL methods on the task of automatic recognition of surgical phases using a newly collected multi-institutional dataset of laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach also learns more generalizable features when tested on data from an unseen domain.","output":"Federated Cycling (FedCy): Semi-supervised Federated Learning of Surgical Phases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous research has shown secondhand tobacco smoke to be detrimental to childrens health.

Whether adults with obesity can achieve weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention has not been confirmed. METHODS: In this double-blind trial, we enrolled 1961 adults with a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or greater (&#8805;27 in persons with &#8805;1 weight-related coexisting condition), who did not have diabetes, and randomly assigned them, in a 2:1 ratio, to 68 weeks of treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (at a dose of 2.4 mg) or placebo, plus lifestyle intervention. The coprimary end points were the percentage change in body weight and weight reduction of at least 5%. The primary estimand (a precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the objective of the clinical trial) assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue interventions. RESULTS: The mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -14.9% in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.4% with placebo, for an estimated treatment difference of -12.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -13.4 to -11.5; P<0.001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight reductions of 5% or more (1047 participants [86.4%] vs. 182 [31.5%]), 10% or more (838 [69.1%] vs. 69 [12.0%]), and 15% or more (612 [50.5%] vs. 28 [4.9%]) at week 68 (P<0.001 for all three comparisons of odds). The change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -15.3 kg in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.6 kg in the placebo group (estimated treatment difference, -12.7 kg; 95% CI, -13.7 to -11.7). Participants who received semaglutide had a greater improvement with respect to cardiometabolic risk factors and a greater increase in participant-reported physical functioning from baseline than those who received placebo. Nausea and diarrhea were the most common adverse events with semaglutide; they were typically transient and mild-to-moderate in severity and subsided with time. More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group discontinued treatment owing to gastrointestinal events (59 [4.5%] vs. 5 [0.8%]).

This workshop will highlight the essential role city governments play in developing and implementing policies and practices to prevent noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and injuries. Although traditionally perceived as the domain of national governments, actions to protect citizens from risk factors- including air quality, speeding and unsafe road conditions- that cause NCDs and injuries are readily being adopted and implemented by cities. This is due to both the magnitude of the chronic disease and injury burden and the subsequent need for immediate action, and the proximity local governments have to directly changing environments to improve health outcomes. The World Health Organization's (WHO) European Healthy Cities Network has long supported cities in the region in their efforts to put health at the centre of their social, political and economic agendas. This work has been formative in drawing attention to the role of cities. The presentations in this panel will provide specific practice examples of the principles upheld by that network. The workshop will present a diverse set of case studies illuminating city responses to NCDs and injuries, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. By doing so, the discussion will demonstrate the value of what empowered, committed and well-resourced local governments - specifically Health and Transportation Departments - can do to reduce death and disability in urban settings. Showcasing these examples will also provide workshop participants with practical examples of how policy and practice are translated from the global and national to the local level in a variety of geographical settings, and the different ways in which context has been taken into account during implementation. The result will be an exchange of good practices that will hopefully spur other cities and relevant stakeholders to pursue similar interventions in their own municipalities.

Continuous nebulization can influence the delivered tidal volume (V(T)) and lead to significant medication loss during expiration. Ventilators thus provide integrated jet nebulization systems that are synchronized during inspiration and ostensibly keep VT constant. METHODS This was a bench study of systems integrated in the Evita XL, Avea, Galileo, and G5 ventilators. The VT delivered with and without nebulization, the inspiratory synchronization of nebulization, and the aerosol deposition were measured with 2 locations of the nebulizer. RESULTS Changes in V(T) with the nebulizer were below 20 mL and below 10% of set V(T) for all ventilators. Synchronization was good at the beginning of insufflation, but prolonged nebulization was observed with all ventilators at the end of insufflation, until up to 1 s during expiration: 5-80% of nebulization occurred during expiration with significant aerosol loss in the expiratory limb. Synchrony could be improved by (1) reducing gas compression/decompression phenomena proximal to the jet nebulizer and (2) increasing inspiratory time, which reduced the amount of nebulization occurring during expiration. Placing the nebulizer upstream in the inspiratory limb did not affect inspiratory synchrony but allowed reduction of the amount of aerosol lost in the expiratory limb. CONCLUSIONS Jet nebulizer systems integrated in the tested ventilators are reliable in terms of V(T) control. Gas compression in tubing driving gas to the nebulizer delays synchronization and reduces nebulization yield if the nebulizer is placed close to the Y-piece. Increasing inspiratory time with no end-inspiratory pause reduces the expiratory loss of medication if placement of the nebulizer upstream in the inspiratory limb is not feasible.","output":"Ventilator-integrated jet nebulization systems: tidal volume control and efficiency of synchronization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In low and middle-income countries (LMICs), strict social distancing measures (e.g., nationwide lockdown) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are unsustainable in the long-term due to knock-on socioeconomic and psychological effects. However, an optimal epidemiology-focused strategy for 'safe-reopening' (i.e., balancing between the economic and health consequences) remain unclear, particularly given the suboptimal disease surveillance and diagnostic infrastructure in these settings. As the lockdown is now being relaxed in many LMICs, in this paper, we have (1) conducted an epidemiology-based \\"options appraisal\\" of various available non-pharmacological intervention options that can be employed to safely lift the lockdowns (namely, sustained mitigation, zonal lockdown and rolling lockdown strategies), and (2) propose suitable application, pre-requisites, and inherent limitations for each measure. Among these, a sustained mitigation-only approach (adopted in many high-income countries) may not be feasible in most LMIC settings given the absence of nationwide population surveillance, generalised testing, contact tracing and critical care infrastructure needed to tackle the likely resurgence of infections. By contrast, zonal or local lockdowns may be suitable for some countries where systematic identification of new outbreak clusters in real-time would be feasible. This requires a generalised testing and surveillance structure, and a well-thought out (and executed) zone management plan. Finally, an intermittent, rolling lockdown strategy has recently been suggested by the World Health Organization as a potential strategy to get the epidemic under control in some LMI settings, where generalised mitigation and zonal containment is unfeasible. This strategy, however, needs to be carefully considered for economic costs and necessary supply chain reforms. In conclusion, while we propose three community-based, non-pharmacological options for LMICs, a suitable measure should be context-specific and based on: (1) epidemiological considerations, (2) social and economic costs, (3) existing health systems capabilities and (4) future-proof plans to implement and sustain the strategy.","output":"Long-term strategies to control COVID-19 in low and middle-income countries: an options overview of community-based, non-pharmacological interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The American jury system holds the promise of bringing commonsense ideas about justice to the enforcement of the law. But its democratizing effect cannot be realized if a segment of the population faces systematic exclusion based on income or wealth. The problem of unequal access to jury service based on socio-economic disparities is a longstanding yet under-studied problem-and one which the uneven fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic only exacerbated. Like race- and sex-based jury discrimination during the peremptory challenge phase of jury selection, the routine dismissal of citizens who face economic hardship excludes not only people but also the diversity of ideas, experiences, and frames of interpretation that characterize the American population. By failing to make sure that people who are poor can serve, we impoverish our shared understanding of doing justice. This Article offers a historical and empirical account of how socio-economic exclusion cuts prospective jurors from juries. It argues that the dominant rationale for such exclusion is a perception that poor and otherwise burdened prospective jurors should be excused from jury service for their own benefit. The effect of this superficially benevolent rationale, I argue, has been the concealment and reinforcement of class-based jury discrimination. The Article concludes that addressing this seemingly benign but exclusionary practice is an essential task for legal reformers, recognizing the relationship between race and class-based exclusion.

validate a low cost but effective electronic stethoscope that allows auscultation over the PPE or from a safe distance Materials and methods: While developing the DIY stethoscope, we aimed at good quality auscultation sounds while keeping the assembly simple, affordable, and using components that most physicians would already possess We tried various permutations of sensors, its placement within a stethoscope, and of the entire assembly After initial testing, we settled on using commonly available commercial microphones, housed either in the ear-tip or within the tubing of a stethoscope Data were transmitted to a mobile phone, which ran our customdeveloped app, which amplified the sound, reduced the noise, and transmitted the data for playback to Bluetooth headphones, which the doctor will be wearing over the PPE To test our device, we conducted a study in Medicine and Pediatrics wards of a tertiary care hospital of North India in November 2020 Residents posted in these wards, auscultated patients using both the DIY stethoscope and a conventional stethoscope Which stethoscope would be used first was determined through randomization After auscultation, each device was rated on a scale of 1 to 10 on the following characteristics: Loudness of sound, Sound clarity, Loudness of noise, Interference caused by noise, Satisfaction, Comfort Any auscultation findings were also recorded Results: Sixteen residents participated in the study and auscultated a total of 100 patients DIY stethoscope had significantly higher loudness of the auscultation sounds, with a median (IQR) score of 8 (7, 9) for a DIY stethoscope and 8 (7, 8) for a conventional stethoscope Discussions: We presented a technique to convert a conventional stethoscope to an electronic one, producing sounds with good clarity and loudness Although there is more noise in DIY stethoscope as compared to conventional, it does not affect the ability to auscultate patients and identify findings It also offers louder sounds, ability to record and share auscultation clippings The app is available free of charge on Google Play Store As most physicians would already possess most of the components required for assembly of DIY stethoscopes, only the microphone may need to be purchased which drives down the cost of an electronic stethoscope from approximately 500$ to 500rs Compared to other available attachments for stethoscopes available in the market, not only is it cheaper, but does not require transecting the stethoscope, so it stays unharmed and can be converted back to its

The results showed that LPS treatment significantly reduced endothelial cell viability, increased LDH release, and promoted cell necrosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which was dramatically inhibited by TSG pretreatment. Furthermore, LPS induction significantly enhanced the expression of RhoA, ROCK1, and ROCK2 and the activation of ROCK; these effects were reduced by TSG pretreatment. The suppression of either RhoA or ROCK significantly improved LPS-induced endothelial cell viability, and reduced cell necrosis and LDH release. In addition, LPS treatment promoted F-actin skeleton rearrangement and contraction ring formation around the plasma membrane, which was greatly inhibited by the suppression of the RhoA/ROCK pathway or TSG pretreatment.

METHODS: Within PID-ARI.net, a research network for ARI in children in Germany, an active, year-round surveillance system was formed in three regions from north to south for population-based analysis. Children from birth to 16 years of age were included and up to 19 noncolonizing airway pathogens were tested for with multiplex RT-PCR. RESULTS: In the 10-year period from July 1996 to June 2006, a total of 18,899 samples were tested. The positive rate increased with the size of the test panel to up to 72.9%. Picornaviruses (35C39%), paramyxoviruses (23C28%) and orthomyxoviruses (5.8C12.5%) comprised the highest fraction. Reoviruses and Legionella pneumophila were not found at all and Chlamydia pneumoniae and Bordetella parapertussis only rarely. Respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 3 were anticyclical in rhythmicity with metapneumovirus and PIV1 and PIV2. The age medians per pathogen depended predominantly upon the attack rate and interepidemic intervals. CONCLUSION: Active surveillance systems for ARI are superior to passive systems. They should be pathogen-specific and comprehensive for viruses and bacteria and age ranges. They should be population-based and multilevel to avoid bias.

In addition, the findings showed that there is a statistically significant relationship between education level and verbal violence (p = 0.02) and between work status (p = 0.02) and marital status (p = 0.02) with physical violence.ConclusionThe results of the study show that during the pandemic of COVID-19, verbal and physical violence for nurses occurred in several occasions, which requires the authorities to take effective measures to reduce the incidence of violence in hospitals.","output":"Violence Against Frontline Emergency Nurses During Pandemic of COVID-19 in Guilan: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: GCV-R CMV infection is an emerging cause of morbidity and mortality in lung transplant recipients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and economic impact of GCV-R CMV infection in a high-risk population. METHODS: We performed a single-center, retrospective cohort study of lung transplant recipients with genotype confirmed GCV-R CMV and ganciclovir-sensitive (GCV-S) CMV infection, matched (1:3) by year of diagnosis. Clinical outcomes within 1 year following the onset of CMV infection and total hospital costs were assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were included in the analysis: 7 with GCV-R CMV infection and 21 with GCV-S CMV infection. Baseline demographics (Table 1) were similar in the two groups. CMV load at diagnosis was numerically higher (282,932 I.U./mL [IQR, 43,181 IU/mL 3,368,931 I.U./mL] vs. 44,604 IU/mL [IQR, 6,314 I.U./mL 88,797 IU/mL], P = 0.10) and days to CMV infection following discontinuation of antiviral prophylaxis was numerically lower (20 [IQR, 0C137] vs. 175 [IQR, 123C190], P = 0.07) in the GCV-R CMV group. All-cause mortality (71.4% vs. 19.0%, P = 0.02) and total hospital days due to CMV infection (63 [IQR, 34C76] vs. 6 [IQR, 2C9], P < 0.01) were significantly higher in the GCV-R CMV cohort. There were no differences in allograft rejection and hospital readmission between the two groups. Total hospital costs were significantly higher amongst patients with GCV-R CMV infection ($208,924 [IQR, $114,555-$253,191] vs. $20,419 [IQR, $12,438-$27,892], P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: GCV-R CMV infection is associated with poor outcomes and considerable healthcare costs.

Business dynamics and changes in the operating environment often give rise to continuous changes in application requirements that may be fulfilled only by changing the underlying ontologies. This is especially true for Semantic Web applications, which are based on heterogeneous and highly distributed information resources and therefore need efficient mechanisms to cope with changes in the environment. In our previous work we have developed the KAON ontology evolution framework that (i) enables handling the required ontology changes; (ii) ensures the consistency of the underlying ontology and all dependent artefacts; (iii) supports the user to manage changes more easily; and (iv) offers advice to the user for continual ontology reengineering. In this paper we apply the proposed approach on the MEDLINE system and discuss its benefits. First, we translated the MeSH/MEDLINE into a set of the ontologies by enriching the MeSH vocabulary with the set of rules and by eliminating some inconsistencies. Second, we showed that ontology evolution ensures the consistency between all related data.

The airway epithelium has an important role in host defense against infection and this is illustrated in this review by considering infection by respiratory viruses.

Knowledge of the immunopathogenesis of such RV\\\\induced exacerbations remains limited, but information is available from in vitro and from in vivo studies, especially of experimental infection in human volunteers. RV infects and replicates within epithelial cells (EC) of the lower respiratory tract. EC are an important component of the innate\\\\immune response to RV infection.

While most of the research explores their effectiveness to prevent the spread of the virus, a growing body of literature has found that using face masks also has social meaning. But what social meaning does it have, and how does this meaning express itself in people's practice? Based on 413 qualitative interviews with residents in five European countries (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, and Switzerland), we found that the meanings of face masks have changed drastically during the first months of the pandemic. While in spring 2020 people wearing them had to fear stigmatization, in autumn of 2020 not wearing masks was more likely to be stigmatized. Throughout the first year of the pandemic, we found that mask wearing had multiple and partly seemingly contradictory meanings for people. They were perceived as obstacles for non-verbal communication, but also a way to affirm friendships and maintain social contacts. They also signaled specific moral or political stances on the side of face mask wearers and non-wearers alike, expressed their belonging to certain communities, or articulated concern. In sum, our findings show how face masks serve as scripts for people to navigate their lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conclude that public and political discussions concerning face masks should include not only evidence on the epidemiological and infectiological effects of face masks, but also on their social meanings and their social effects.","output":"The Social Meanings of Artifacts: Face Masks in the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has markedly affected emergency care, due to sudden limitation of health care capacity by general practitioners (GP) and urgent need for infection control strategies. We evaluated the activity of the Emergency Department (ED) during the national lockdown (March 8CApril 30), as well as the outcomes of our infection control strategy. RESULTS: Despite a reduction in access by one fifth, a proportion of febrile patients comparable to 2019 was seen (829/2492, 33.3% vs 4580/13.342, 34.3%, p = 0.3). Diagnostic swab for COVID-19 was performed in 25% of patients, especially in subjects with co-morbidities or multiple access. Six infected cases were identified, all presenting with febrile disease. Only two positive patients fulfilled the criteria for diagnostic swab provided by the Italian Health Authorities, because of close contact with suspected or confirmed cases. The rate of admission for febrile or respiratory conditions was higher than the same period of 2019 (33.4% vs 25.9%, p < 0.0001). None of the 105 health-care professionals working during the study time lapse exhibited anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion. Among the 589 patients with information available, 54.9% declared no medical consultation at all prior to coming to ED, while only 40 (of which 27 with fever) had been examined by their GP before coming to ED. Nevertheless, 35.6% of the cases were already taking medications. None of the 9 patients requiring intensive care reported recent pediatric consultation, despite symptoms duration up to 30 days. CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence that the reduced capacity of primary care facilities during the national lockdown may have caused a high rate of self-medication as well as a delayed provision of care in some patients. Identification of pediatric patients affected with SARS-CoV-2 infection remains a challenge because of the absence of reliable predictive factors. Finally, the use of specific triage centers, with dedicated pathways to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection, trace contacts and allow adequate care after swabs, is effective in preventing spreading of the infection.","output":"Infection control strategy and primary care assistance in Campania region during the national lockdown due to COVID-19 outbreak: the experience of two tertiary emergency centers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A potentially important aspect of the humoral immune response to Covid-19 is avidity, the overall binding strength between antibody and antigen. As low avidity is associated with a risk of re- infection in several viral infections, avidity might be of value to predict risk for reinfection with covid-19. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe the maturation of IgG avidity and the antibody-levels over time in patients with PCR-confirmed non-severe covid-19. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal cohort study including patients with RT-PCR confirmed covid-19. Blood samples were drawn 1, 3 and 6 months after infection. Antibody levels and IgG-avidity were analysed. RESULTS: The majority had detectable s- and n-antibodies (88,1%, 89,1%, N = 75). The level of total n-antibodies significantly increased from 1 to 3 months (median value 28,3 vs 39,3 s/co, p<0.001) and significantly decreased from 3 to 6 months (median value 39,3 vs 17,1 s/co, p<0.001). A significant decrease in the IgG anti-spike levels (median value 37,6, 24,1 and 18,2 RU/ml, p<0.001) as well as a significant increase in the IgG-avidity index (median values 51,6, 66,0 and 71,0%, p<0.001) were seen from 1 to 3 to 6 months.

There is an urgent need for alternative treatment strategies against COVID-19. Peptides and peptidomimetics have several advantages as therapeutic agents because of their target selectivity, better interactions, and lower toxicity. Minor structural alterations to peptides can help prevent their fast metabolism and provide long-action.

METHODS: We conducted a multicentre randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial evaluating hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients with at least one of the following risk factors for worsening: need for supplemental oxygen, age &#8805;75 years, age between 60 and 74 years and presence of at least one co-morbidity. Severely ill patients requiring oxygen therapy >3 L/min or intensive care were excluded. Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 800 mg hydroxychloroquine on day 0 followed by 400 mg per day for 8 days or a placebo. The primary end point was a composite of death or start of invasive mechanical ventilation within 14 days following randomization. Secondary end points included mortality and clinical evolution at days 14 and 28, and viral shedding at days 5 and 10. RESULTS: The trial was stopped after 250 patients were included because of a slowing down of the pandemic in France. The intention-to-treat population comprised 123 and 124 patients in the placebo and hydroxychloroquine groups, respectively. The median age was 77 years (interquartile range 58-86 years) and 151/250 (60.4%) patients required oxygen therapy. The primary end point occurred in 9/124 (7.3%) patients in the hydroxychloroquine group and 8/123 (6.5%) patients in the placebo group (relative risk 1.12; 95% CI 0.45-2.80). The rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests at days 5 and 10 were 72.8% (75/103) and 57.1% (52/91) in the hydroxychloroquine group, versus 73.0% (73/100) and 56.6% (47/83) in the placebo group, respectively.

Applying postcolonial theory, this article seeks to fill this gap and to explore whether there are any indications that ECJ discourse is in line with the historical western-centric inferiorisation of the CEE region. A critical discourse analysis of a set of ECJ judgments and corresponding Advocate General opinions pertaining to CEE nationals illustrates not only how the ECJ adopts numerous discursive strategies to maintain its authority, but also how it tends to prioritise values of the western Member States, while overlooking interests of CEE movers. Its one-sided approach is further reinforced by referring to irrelevant facts and negative assumptions to create an image of CEE nationals as socially and economically inferior to westerners, as not belonging to the proper EU polity and as not quite deserving of EU laws protections. By silencing CEE nationals voices, while disregarding the background of east/west socio-economic and political power differentials and precariousness experienced by many CEE workers in the west, such racialising discourse normalises ethnicity- and class-based stereotypes. These findings also help to contextualise both EU and western policies targeting CEE movers and evidence of their unequal outcomes in the west, and are in line with todays nuanced expressions of racisms. By illustrating the ECJs role in addressing values pertinent to mobile CEE individuals, this study facilitates a fuller appreciation of the ECJs power in shaping and reflecting western-centric EU identity and policies.

METHODS: This is a multi-center retrospective observational study involving 59 Italian centers. We retrospectively reviewed the prevalence of interstitial pneumonia detected during the COVID period (between March 16 and 27, 2020) and compared to a pre-COVID period (January-February 2020) and a control time (in 2019). The diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia was done considering lung alterations of CT of PET. RESULTS: Overall, [18F]FDG PET/CT was performed on 4008 patients in the COVID period, 19,267 in the pre-COVID period, and 5513 in the control period. The rate of interstitial pneumonia suspicious for COVID-19 was significantly higher during the COVID period (7.1%) compared with that found in the pre-COVID (5.35%) and control periods (5.15%) (p < 0.001). Instead, no significant difference among pre-COVID and control periods was present.

This circumstance influenced the timely diagnosis and subsequential initiation of therapy in almost all specialties. The aim of the present study is to evaluate a hypothetical change in health awareness with regard to outpatient consultations of ENT physicians in Germany. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study used anonymized data from 146 ENT practices in Germany and included 162,724 patients in Q2 2019, 158,077 in Q3 2019, 128,342 in Q2 2020, and 149,153 in Q3 2020. The first outcome was the difference in the number of patients with at least one visit to these practices between the second and third quarters of 2019 and the second and third quarters of 2020. The second outcome was the number of patients with new diagnoses per practice, defined as diagnoses not previously documented in the database for a given patient. RESULTS: The number of patients per practice was significantly lower in Q2 2020 compared to Q2 2019 (879 versus 1108, p<0.001). There were no significant differences when comparing Q3 2020 to Q3 2019 (1022 versus 1083, p=0.261).

We hypothesized that (i) disruptions prolonged diagnostic latency; (ii) autopsy rates declined; and (iii) COVID-19 infection negatively affected diagnosis, care, and survival. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the first year of the pandemic, using the preceding year as a comparator, quantifying numbers of individuals assessed by the UK National CJD Research & Surveillance Unit for suspected CJD, time to diagnosis, disease duration, and autopsy rates. We evaluated the impact of COVID-19 status on diagnosis, care, and survival in CJD. RESULTS: A total of 148 individuals were diagnosed with CJD in the pandemic (from a total of 166 individuals assessed) compared to 141 in the comparator (from 145 assessed). No differences were identified in disease duration or time to diagnosis. Autopsy rates were unchanged. Twenty individuals had COVID-19; 60% were symptomatic, and 10% had severe disease. Disruptions in diagnosis and care were frequently identified. Forty percent of COVID-19-positive individuals died; however, COVID-19 status did not significantly alter survival duration in CJD. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has not impacted UK CJD case ascertainment or survival, but diagnostic evaluation and clinical care of individuals have been affected.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease surveillance and patient care in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mobile phones (MPs) are potential reservoirs of nosocomial bacteria, but few data are available concerning viruses. We aimed to evaluate the presence of virus RNA from epidemic viruses including metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses, rotavirus (RV) and norovirus on the MPs used by healthcare workers (HCWs) and to relate it to hygiene measures. An anonymous behavioural questionnaire about MP use at hospital was administered to the HCWs of four adult and paediatric departments of a university hospital. After sampling personal (PMP) and/or professional MPs (digital enhanced cordless telephone, DECT), virus RNAs were extracted and amplified by one-step real-time reverse transcriptionCquantitative PCR. The molecular results were analysed in a masked manner in relation to the behavioural survey. Questionnaires from 114 HCWs (35 senior physicians, 30 residents, 32 nurses, 27 nurses' assistants) working either in adult (n = 58) or paediatric (n = 56) departments were analysed. Medical personnel used their PMP more frequently than paramedical HCWs (33/65 vs. 10/59, p <0.001). MPs were used during care more frequently in adult wards than in paediatric ones (46/58 vs. 27/56, p <0.001). Virus RNA was detected on 42/109 (38.5%) collected MPs, with RV found on 39, respiratory syncytial virus on three and metapneumovirus on one. The presence of virus RNA was significantly associated with MPs from the paediatric HCWs (p <0.001). MPs routinely used in hospital, even during care, can host virus RNA, especially RV. Promotion of frequent hand hygiene before and after MP use, along with frequent cleaning of MPs, should be encouraged.","output":"Contamination of healthcare workers' mobile phones by epidemic viruses()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Female sex workers' (FSWs) risk for HIV/STIs is influenced by their work environments. While previous research has characterized vulnerability in a single workplace, many FSWs solicit clients from multiple settings. Using latent class analysis (LCA), we examined client solicitation patterns and associated HIV/STI-related behaviors (consistent condom use with clients, asking clients about HIV/STIs, and past 6-month HIV/STI testing) among 385 FSWs in Baltimore, Maryland. The LCA yielded a three-class solution: predominantly street (61.2%), mixed street/venue (23.7%), and multisource (street, venue, and online) (15.1%). Consistent condom use differed significantly (p < 0.01) by class, with the mixed street/venue having the lowest (40.6%) rate and the multisource having the highest (70.6%). Classes differed on HIV/STI testing (p < 0.01), with the predominantly street class having the lowest testing rate (56.2%) and multisource with the highest (85.7%). These findings underscore the importance of considering how solicitation patterns are linked to HIV/STI susceptibility of FSWs and adapting interventions accordingly.","output":"Patterns of Sex Work Client Solicitation Settings and Associations with HIV/STI Risk Among a Cohort of Female Sex Workers in Baltimore, Maryland."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our study examined the effects of COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures on family caregivers (FCGs) of frail older adults; specifically, their care work, anxiety, and loneliness all of which are associated with decreased wellbeing. Approximately 604 FCGs completed the survey and findings evidenced COVID-19 creating two solitudes. First, 73% of FCGs for individuals living with them were providing significantly more care during COVID-19. Second, those caring for residents in congregate settings were unable to care. Both situations, community-dwelling and congregate care, increased FCG distress and decreased wellbeing. Anxiety significantly increased from 36% pre COVID-19 to 54% during COVID-19. Loneliness increased from 46% to 85%. FCGs report their mental (58%) and physical (48%) health deteriorated. The detrimental impact of the pandemic and public health measures on FCGs caring at home and in congregate care, and their related needs, need immediate attention from both the health and social systems of care.","output":"The Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Family Caregivers' Care Work, Anxiety, and Loneliness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ascofuranone and its precursor, ilicicolin A, are secondary metabolites with various pharmacological activities that are produced by Acremonium egyptiacum. In particular, ascofuranone strongly inhibits trypanosome alternative oxidase and represents a potential drug candidate against African trypanosomiasis. However, difficulties associated with industrial production of ascofuranone by A. egyptiacum, specifically the co-production of ascochlorin, which inhibits mammalian respiratory chain complex III at low concentrations, has precluded its widespread application. Therefore, in this study, ascofuranone biosynthetic genes (ascA-E and H-J) were heterologously expressed in Aspergillus sojae, which produced very low-levels of endogenous secondary metabolites under conventional culture conditions. As a result, although we obtained transformants producing both ilicicolin A and ascofuranone, they were produced only when an adequate concentration of chloride ions was added to the medium. In addition, we succeeded in increasing the production of ilicicolin A, by enhancing the expression of the rate-determining enzyme AscD, using a multi-copy integration system. The heterologous expression approach described here afforded the production of both ascofuranone and ilicicolin A, allowing for their development as therapeutics.","output":"Heterologous production of ascofuranone and ilicicolin A in Aspergillus sojae"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus infection outbreaks have occurred frequently in the last two decades and have led to significant mortality. Despite the focus on reducing mortality by preventing the spread of the virus, patients have died due to several other complications of the illness. The understanding of pathological mechanisms and their implications is continuously evolving. A number of symptoms occur in these patients due to the involvement of various endocrine glands. These clinical presentations went largely unnoticed during the first outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003. A few of these derangements continued during the convalescence phase and sometimes occurred after recovery. Similar pathological and biochemical changes are being reported with the novel coronavirus disease outbreak in 2020. In this review, we focus on these endocrine changes that have been reported in both SARS coronavirus and SARS coronavirus-2. As we battle the pandemic, it becomes imperative to address these underlying endocrine disturbances that are contributing towards or predicting mortality of these patients.","output":"Endocrine changes in SARS-CoV-2 patients and lessons from SARS-CoV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: This study explores associations between trust in directives and compliance with physical distancing by comparing two populations in Israel. Methods: Following two lockdowns, we conducted two cross-sectional surveys among the Arab minority and Jewish citizens of Israel (first survey, N = 613; second survey, N = 542). We conducted multivariable logistic regression analyses for the association between trust and compliance with physical distancing separately for each group in each survey. Results: In both surveys trust levels were significantly lower among Arabs than Jews (p < 0.001). Compared to Jews, Arabs were less likely to report compliance with physical distancing in the first and second surveys (OR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.32C0.84 and OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.39C0.98, respectively). In both surveys trusting the directives was an important determinant of compliance with physical distancing among Jews only. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that momentum is important in building and maintaining public trust and compliance during pandemics. Policymakers should note the lack of trust among Arabs, which warrants further research and interventions.","output":"Inequalities in Trust Levels and Compliance With Physical Distancing During COVID-19 Outbreaks: Comparing the Arab Minority and Jewish Populations in Israel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this systematic review was to examine if the motives of satisfaction with outcomes, enjoyment of behavior, self-determination, and identity are related to physical activity (PA) maintenance in older adults. We also explored whether the strength of these associations varies as a function of sample characteristics (i.e., age, gender, physical health status) and maintenance context. Five electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, SportDiscus, CINAHL, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses) were searched, and sixteen studies (k) with a sample mean age &#8805; 55 years were included. When the number of studies was &#8805; 5 for a given motive, a pooled correlation coefficient was calculated using the inverse-variance method under the random-effects model assumption. Self-determination was positively associated with PA maintenance [r (95% CI) = 0.189 (0.127, 0.249); k = 11]. This association was stronger and more homogeneous for samples described as having a physical health condition (r = 0.212; k = 6) and studies judged to be at risk of bias due to missing data (r = 0.223; k = 8). Few studies (< 5) investigated satisfaction with outcomes, enjoyment of behavior, and identity, which precludes any summary judgment for these three motives.

Methods: From April 23rd to May 8th 2020, we recruited a sample of participants from five sectors: healthcare, air transport, police, road transport and informal. We collected oropharyngeal swab for direct detection through real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and blood for antibodies detection by serological tests. The overall prevalence (current and past) of infection was defined by positivity for both tests. Results: A total of 955 participants with a median age of 36 (IQR 32-43) were included and 71.6% (n=684) were men. Around 22.1% (n=212) were from the air transport sector, 20.5% (n=196) in the police, and 38.7% (n=370) in the health sector. Seven participants (0.7%, 95% CI: 0.3-1.6%) had a positive rRT-PCR at the time of recruitment and nine (0.9%, 95% CI: 0.4-1.8%) were seropositive for IgM or IgG against SARS-CoV-2. We found an overall prevalence of 1.6% (n=15), 95% CI: 0.9-2.6%.
